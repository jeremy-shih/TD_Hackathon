Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ms. Beth Mooney. Please go ahead.","Beth E. Mooney","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to KeyCorp's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call.","Joining me for today's presentation is Jeff Weeden, our Chief Financial Officer, and available for the Q&A portion of the call are the leaders at Key Corporate Bank and Key Community Bank: Chris Gorman and Bill Koehler. And also joining us for the Q&A discussion are our Treasurer, Joe Vayda; and our Chief Risk Officer, Bill Hartmann.","Slide 2 is our forward-looking disclosure statement. It covers our presentation materials and comments, as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call today. Slide 3 provides some highlights on our third quarter. Our results underscore the company's sustained drive to increase revenue, reduce cost and grow the franchise. We recorded net income from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders of $214 million or $0.23 per common share this morning. Revenue for the quarter benefited from a 6% improvement in net interest income, driven by 17 basis point increase in the net interest margin and continued loan growth. C&I loans rose for the sixth consecutive quarter, and we surpassed our commitment to lend $5 billion to small businesses with up to $20 million in revenue, 2 years ahead of schedule in this quarter. Home equity loans reached their highest level in recent years, in part due to our successful borrowing campaign we have launched. On the cost side, we are on pace to reach our targeted annual expense reductions of $150 million to $200 million by December 2013. These efficiency initiatives will lower Key's cost structure to align with the current operating environment and should improve the company's competitive position in its markets.","During the quarter, we took steps to enhance our franchise, our product offerings and our profitability. We re-entered the credit card business by acquiring a $725 million Key-branded credit card portfolio, made up of our own clients, and by beginning to self-issue cards. The acquisition provides us with an opportunity to solidify our payments platform while realizing attractive financial benefits. To strengthen our share of 2 attractive markets in Western New York, we acquired 37 branches in Buffalo and Rochester from which we expect to grow current customer relationships and build new ones. Our underlying credit quality continues to improve, and in this quarter, we did make provisions to account for our acquisitions and to meet updated regulatory guidance. Jeff will cover these items in his remarks.","The final few items on this slide highlight our continuing commitment to disciplined capital management. In addition to leveraging our strong capital position through recent acquisitions, we have continued to return capital to our shareholders by repurchasing common stock and through dividends.","Turning to Slide 4. I'm sure everyone on the call today is aware of the challenges facing our industry. We have endured a protracted period of slow economic growth and historically low interest rates, and we believe these conditions are likely to continue. That said, we have taken steps to position Key for growth and improve profitability. We are focused on revenue growth, improving efficiency and disciplined capital management. Our results this quarter are evidence of our progress.","First, we are increasing revenue. Organically, our relationship model is generating results from new customers and expanding relationships with existing clients, who are using more of our services. We are seeing our lending businesses grow and our market share expand. And as I mentioned, we continue to invest in our businesses. This quarter included our branch acquisition and reentering the credit card business. Both provide new revenue streams and opportunities to grow our client base. In addition, we are able to deploy the additional balance sheet liquidity from our branch acquisition into higher yielding credit card assets and into the redemption of the trust preferred securities.  Next, we believe one of our most effective levers comes from lowering our expense base and creating a more variable cost structure on the one hand, and delivering a high-quality client experience on the other. As we said earlier, we made progress this quarter on our efficiency initiative, and we remain focused on reaching our efficiency ratio target of 60% to 65%, all this while remaining committed to our relationship model.  Finally, we see our capital position as a competitive advantage. How we manage our capital will continue to be one of the most important decisions we make for this franchise over the next several years.  Overall, our third quarter results were another step forward for our company as we continue to make progress on our targets for success. Now let me turn our call over to Jeff for some further comments on our results. Jeff?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Thank you, Beth. Slide 6 provides a summary of the company's third quarter 2012 results from continuing operations. As we reported this morning, the company earned a net profit from continuing operations of $0.23 per common share for the third quarter compared to $0.23 for the second quarter of this year and $0.24 for the third quarter of 2011. There were a number of moving parts this quarter that Beth touched on in her remarks that impacted our results. First, we completed the acquisition of the branches in Western New York. Second, we redeemed $707 million of trust preferred securities. Third, we reacquired our Key-branded credit card portfolio. Fourth, we terminated 2 additional leverage leases. And fifth, we implemented new regulatory guidance on how we were handling certain credits involved in Chapter 7 bankruptcies. I'll cover how these events impacted our results in more detail in the following slides.","Turning to Slide 7. Average total loans for the third quarter were up $1,249,000,000 or 2.5% unannualized compared to the second quarter of this year. Included in this amount was the impact of the loans acquired with the Western New York branches of $223 million and our Key-branded credit card portfolio of $473 million. In addition to the acquired loans, we also continued to experience growth in our C&I and home equity loans. Our period-ending loan balances were higher than average loan balances by $724 million, which should bode well for growth in our fourth quarter average total loan balances. And our exit portfolio declined $375 million during the third quarter. The reduction in the exit portfolio was both from normal amortization and the early termination of leverage leases. On a period-end basis, our exit portfolios from continuing operations represented less than 6% of total loans at September 30, 2012.","Continuing to Slide 8. On the liability side of the balance sheet, our trend of improving deposit mix continued into the third quarter, where we experienced an increase in average balances of non-time deposits of approximately $2.6 billion or 5.2% unannualized. Contributing to this increase was the addition of $1.6 billion of mostly consumer deposits associated with our acquisition of branches in Western New York. You can also see here where the deposit funding costs have significantly declined over the past year. This, along with debt maturities and the redemption of trust preferred securities, is driving down the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. As we stated last quarter, maturities of higher-costing CDs and debt would benefit the net interest margin in the second half of the current year. During the fourth quarter, we have approximately $540 million of CDs at an average cost of 4.9% maturity. These maturities, along with getting the full benefit of our third quarter maturities, will continue to lower our funding costs in the fourth quarter and help offset pressure on the asset yields in this low-rate environment.","Turning to Slide 9. For the third quarter of 2012, the company's net interest margin was 3.23% compared to 3.06% for the second quarter, a 17 basis point expansion. Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $578 million for the third quarter, up 6.3% from the $544 million we've reported in the second quarter, primarily as a result of improvement in funding cost and earning asset mix. We also had 2 leverage leases terminate during the quarter, which negatively impacted net interest income and the net interest margin for the third quarter by $13 million and 7 basis points, respectively. This was the same impact we experienced last quarter, in the second quarter, on net interest income and the net interest margin.","On deposit front, we realized $5 million of accretion associated with our credit card purchase, which added approximately 3 basis points to the margin. Based on continued improvement in our funding costs, a change in asset mix driven by higher loan balances and lower investment security balances and excluding any potential impact from early termination of leverage leases, we anticipate the net interest margin for the fourth quarter to be in the low 3.30% area. On the noninterest income front, fee income was positively impacted from a $39 million of gains we realized on the early termination of certain leverage leases. This was $26 million net of the impact to the net interest margin. As well, we also incurred a -- or experienced a $54 million gain from the redemption of trust preferred securities during the quarter. Gains on loan sales continued to be strong, driven by commercial mortgage origination activity in our Real Estate Capital line of business, and our pipeline in this business remains solid, headed into the fourth quarter.","Turning to Slide 10. Noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2012 remained well-controlled at $734 million, up $20 million from the second quarter. Included in our expense for the third quarter was approximately $16 million in costs related to our acquisition of branches in Western New York, including $8 million of merger integration costs and $2 million of amortization of intangibles. In addition, expenses associated with our credit card portfolio acquisition were $10 million and included amortization of the purchase credit card receivable premium of approximately $6 million.","As we announced last quarter, we are targeting $150 million to $200 million of expense reductions by the end of next year. We are making progress with implementing initiatives, including closing certain branches, consolidating operations and adjusting staff levels to meet customer demand. We remain on track to deliver approximately $30 million to $50 million of our targeted savings by the end of this year with efforts continuing throughout 2013. We will also continue making investments for future growth. Our efforts are not all about cost-cutting, but they are about improving profitability and ensuring we meet the ever-changing regulatory demands facing our industry and Key.","Turning to Slide 11. Credit quality metrics and provision for the third quarter were impacted by a number of items. Net charge-offs for the third quarter were $109 million or 86 basis points of average loans. Included in this were $45 million of additional charge-offs we recognized as a result of updated regulatory guidance related to consumer loans discharged through bankruptcy. This $45 million represented approximately 35 basis points of net charge-offs to average loans for the quarter. In addition, the change in guidance also resulted in adding $38 million to our nonperforming loan totals at September 30, 2012. Going forward, we do not expect this change in recognition to have a meaningful impact on our net charge-offs or nonperforming loan additions.","During the third quarter, we also incurred provision expense of $32 million associated with our credit card portfolio and branch acquisitions and established an allowance for loan and lease losses of $29 million at September 30, 2012, associated with these particular portfolios. We expect provision expense for these portfolios will be significantly less in the fourth quarter. At September 30, our reserve for loan losses represented 1.73% of period-end loans and 136% coverage of nonperforming loans.","On Page 19 in the appendix, we provide our long-term trend of past due and criticized loans, both of which continued to show improvement through September 30 of this year. We remain on track with our asset quality trends of achieving our long-term targeted goal for net charge-offs in the 40 to 50 basis point range of average loans.","And finally, turning to Slide 12. Our tangible common equity ratio and estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio both remained strong at September 30, 2012, at 10.4% and 11.4%, respectively. We have also updated our estimated Basel III Tier 1 common ratio as of September 30, 2012, based on the Fed's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on a fully implemented basis at 10.5%.","And during the third quarter, we repurchased 9.6 million of our common shares at an average cost of $8.36 per share, and we will continue to execute on our share repurchase authorization during the fourth quarter of this year.","That concludes our remarks, and now we will turn the call back over to the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A segment of our call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to start -- this morning, Huntington, in their earnings release, they said they saw a broad-based change in customer sentiment late in the quarter, talking about uncertainty over the economy, issues like the fiscal cliff. Are you guys seeing this shift in your customers as well? And do you expect this to impact growth over the near-term?","Christopher Marrott Gorman","Sure, Steve. It's Chris Gorman here. We are. I was just out with our leasing folks, which I think is a pretty good forward look, and clearly, we have seen a slowdown in terms of, for example, equipment purchases. I think the fiscal cliff, the election, I think all these things play into it, but right now, we have -- backlogs are strong, but I do think there is a fair amount of hesitancy out there in the marketplace in the business community.","William R. Koehler","And I -- this is Bill Koehler, sorry, Steve. I would agree that as we look at middle market and even in our business banking, smaller businesses, we would see the same amount of cautiousness, I guess, as we go forward.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Just a follow-up. Following the news of QE3, and we\u2019re seeing MBS yields come down, we're seeing quite a few banks get even more aggressive on deposit repricing. We're seeing money market products that we thought where floors go even further. As you guys look at your deposit repricing strategy, are you putting even more aggressive reductions in there, right, particularly as all these high-cost CDs roll off?","William R. Koehler","Steve, this is Bill again. We have not been any more aggressive. We believe our relationship strategy helps us attract good customers at deposit levels, at pricing levels that make sense, and we have maintained a very consistent pricing strategy in the market.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Steve Scinicariello with UBS.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple quick ones for you. Just as you guys look to continue to improve the payments platform, I know you brought in the Key-branded customers, the $725 million of receivables. I'm just kind of curious, what kind of revenue opportunities do you see and potential for growth in that portfolio that you might have going forward, if you could give some color on that?","William R. Koehler","This is Bill again. Thanks for the question. We feel very good about our credit card acquisition because it broadens our product offering in a way that is very consistent with the way clients are choosing to behave in the market, and we can also fold it into our relationship awards platform. So whereas prior to the acquisition, we had a debit card strategy and that was impacted by Durbin, here, we can offer a more -- a broader product offering that give our clients more choices, and early days, everything is moving according to plan.","Beth E. Mooney","And Steve, I would just add that, as Jeff mentioned in his comments, that it did create a more favorable asset mix on our balance sheet, as well as strong economics from the use of those credit cards. This was part of our Durbin mitigation strategy. And when you couple that with the realignment and the more efficient platforms we have done underneath on the cost structure, this is a big step forward for us as we replace some of the impacts of the governmental price controls.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Definitely, and so we should expect that and those balances to keep growing as we look ahead then, right?","William R. Koehler","We're early days -- this is Bill again, early days. We are pleased with the results we are seeing.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Good. And then just my last question, just in terms of some of the franchise improvement and optimization that you guys referenced in the beginning of the call, I\u2019m just kind of curious in terms of the timing of maybe some of the pruning of some areas or, like you said, consolidating or optimizing some of these things. What's kind of the pace that we should expect as we look ahead?","Beth E. Mooney","Steve, this is Beth. We will keep you updated as we go through. We did indicate that we have made progress on what we had targeted of $30 million to $50 million of our total goal this year, and I think we announced that we have closed 16 branches in the third quarter, and we have another 3 scheduled for closure in the fourth quarter. We have consolidated some of our back rooms. We have worked to reduce our staffing levels, and we've continued to look at our procurement and vendor relationship. So as we go into the end of the year, we feel good about the $30 million to $50 million that will be coming through in our 2013 run rate and have plans and implementation strategies in line of sight to be $150 million to $200 million by the end of 2013.","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Steve, this is Jeff Weeden. Just to give you a little bit more in terms of some proof points on it also. If you remember, last quarter, we talked about some of the things that we had entered into and specifically in our Real Estate Capital line of business. You can see that starting to really show up if you look at the line of business reporting, and it's on Page 28 of the earnings release this morning. You'll see that FTE count is down in that particular area, and deposits are up. So we said it was a combination of what we were also going to be able to do on the cost side, but also looking at what we had to do on the revenue side. So it's a combination. When we talk about it, it's just not about costs. It's also about revenue enhancements and improvement and improving the overall profitability. So the numbers are coming through in various lines of business, and we're making reinvestments also just as we talked about in card or the branches in Western New York.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Marty Mosby with Guggenheim.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Beth, I wanted to ask. You had mentioned that one of the most strategic kind of paths, which given the excess capital that you have, is the deployment of your -- of that excess capital. Can you give us some prioritization in the sense of how you really want to take that capital and put it to work? And also give us kind of a third dimension of time and a sense of how fast do you want to get it back and\/or will you hold some back for some strategic use down the road?","Beth E. Mooney","Marty, thank you. We have talked about our capital priorities and said that, obviously, our level of capital, we believe, is a competitive strength in the coming years. And as we've talked about our priorities, clearly, our first 2 priorities -- our first priority is to support our own organic growth of our business model, and you have heard in this quarter, we utilized some of our capital for the purpose of branch acquisition and the credit card portfolio. From there, we prioritized dividends, and second, from there, would be the repurchase of our shares underneath the CCAR process at these attractive rates that our stock is trading in the market. And as you correctly pointed out that, fourth, you would always retain some level of capital to create flexibility for strategic opportunities to enhance the franchise and grow the business over time.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And just one more question about this credit card acquisition. We're seeing this happen more often within the kind of superregional bank group, where, in the past, we had so much loan growth. We were crowding out some of our assets. Now that we have all the deposit funding, we're kind of looking back and pulling some of those assets back on the balance sheet. But if you also look at in a sense of the debit card pressure that we have for the regulatory change and then on the flip side, you have the HELOC product that's under so much capital pressure. Do those things just kind of push us right back into this credit card business? And then lastly, how about the operations of bringing the portfolio back on the balance sheet? Is there any challenges there?","Beth E. Mooney","Marty, I'll take a first pass at that, and then I'll let Bill or Jeff add if they have some additional thoughts. But in terms of bringing the credit card balances back on, one of the big drivers, I think, for all the regional banks has also been the ability in the cost infrastructure to actually service those cards is dramatically different than it was 10 years ago when many of us exited the business. And it fits more fully with relationship strategies versus the days when it was more of a mono-line product. So we see it as attractive client relationship, honing that client experience, as well as attractive client economics. So we view it as a good augment to our payment platform, as well as our client experience, and have plenty of room within our balance sheet for good relationship loans to include equity and card. I don't think we have any further comments.","Operator","And we'll go next to Erika Penala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My first question, I just wanted to make sure I understood your guidance correctly for expenses. If we run rate the $734 million that we saw this quarter, I get $2.9 billion, and then I take off the one -- the midpoint of your guidance, and I get to 2.76 run rate for next year. Can you -- is that, a, the right way to think it? And b, could you keep it that flat and to that level? In other words, is the expense program or the expense savings that you mentioned net of any sort of core investments that you'll make into next year?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","So this is Jeff Weeden. We're going to continue to make investments, and I think we talked about that earlier, and I made that in my prepared remarks too, is that we will continue in this path, down this path. There's a lot of things that we have to -- all of us do in the banking industry to meet all the due updated regulatory requirements. And as we're going through and improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness, we're continuing also to invest in our businesses, and so I think you're seeing top line revenue growth also is what we're driving for. So we're targeting a 65 -- a 60% to 65% efficiency ratio. That's one of our targeted items. Now to get there, we have to have expense reduction and also revenue growth. And one of the things that we are keenly focused on is reducing costs where we can reduce costs. So we haven't given a specific target for the absolute run rate of expenses for 2013 at this particular juncture. What we have talked about is reducing our costs from where we were. You have to add in, which is why we tried to show some of the waterfall effect here when we talk about it, add in what we're making reinvestments on and what those reinvestments are for going forward.","Beth E. Mooney","Erika, Jeff referenced the waterfall, and that is on Page 10 of our slide deck, and I think it will help you understand some of the dynamics of the $734 million for this quarter.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, yes, and on just -- on the -- I appreciate the guidance that you gave for the fourth quarter on the margin. Looking at the average the balance sheet, I appreciate the commentary on deposit costs, but it still looks like there could be some wood to chop on the wholesale funding side. I guess, could you give us a sense of what the opportunities could be in terms of either the maturities of debt or maybe calling some debt to help support the margin into 2013?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Okay, so this is Jeff Weeden. What we have provided guidance on again was for the fourth quarter. We'll update our guidance for 2013. We continue to have maturities of CDs. Here, we talked about the $540 million in the fourth quarter. We'll have additional maturities in 2013, but they go down dramatically. So while we've been running close to the -- we had $1 billion in the third quarter. We\u2019ve had $500 million here in the fourth quarter. They start to drop into the $200 million to $250 million per quarter going forward. So the entire 2013 time period, basically, the higher-costing CDs are about $1 billion left [ph]. I think when we look at our debt, we have additional debt maturities next year, but they're not that significant at this particular point in time. And in 2013, we have $750 million that matures in the May time period next year. So there's not a lot of additional debt maturities, and I think the other thing that we're constantly looking at is what do we need to have for a level of debt that's outstanding also to support just long-term liquidity of the balance sheet. So these are all the different things that we're looking at. We'll provide additional guidance as we get into next year. We think we're well-positioned at this point in time. The credit card portfolio is only on for a partial quarter at the -- in the third quarter. We'll have the full quarter benefit of it. You'll see that in the average balances for what we talked about. I think it's about $773 million over the average -- or the ending balances. If you look at the average balances, they were basically in that $470 million range, so significantly different. We'll get about $300 million pickup there in terms of balances at a much higher yield.","Operator","And we'll go next to Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","The card acquisition and branch acquisition that must have added to expenses in excess of the one-time charge, what was that number?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Okay. So what we have on an ongoing basis, if you -- on Slide 10 in our deck, we tried to point this out. So the $16 million that we incurred in the branch acquisition, Mike, of that, we had $8 million of one-time expense, and we also had $2 million of amortization of the core deposit intangible that was embedded in that. So about $6 million were the ongoing costs. If you look at the card portfolio...","Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Before you leave the branches, so another -- just the cost of running branches goes up $6 million due to the acquisition?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Cost of -- roughly, yes.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","In other words, other than the one-time, the permanent step-up in expenses due to the branch acquisition would be $6 million?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Approximately, yes. And then if you look at the card portfolio, we have the ongoing costs associated with the processing of the cards, and we also have embedded in that are the purchased credit card receivable amortization. In the third quarter, that number was $6 million, and it will increase in the fourth quarter as we have an entire quarter. So it will go up approximately $2 million. So on a quarterly basis, the $6 million will go to approximately $8 million going forward, and then we have just our normal processing costs that go along with that particular card portfolio in addition to other services.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","So all I'm trying to get to is if you hadn't done these acquisitions, how much would your expenses have gone up?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","If we hadn't done these acquisitions, compared to the prior quarter, expenses would have been down.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Down how much?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Approximately $6 million.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Okay. So core expenses then are down $6 million, and doing the same logic, if you hadn't done either of these acquisitions, what would have happened to the margin?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Well, it\u2019s very dynamic, Mike. I think as you look at it, we use the deposit funding here to really offset the maturities that we had in terms of the $707 million worth of trust preferreds. We also had additional debt maturities of about $650 million during the third quarter that were outside of the calls, and then on top of that, the investments of -- in terms of the card portfolio. So it was really used to help fund that particular investment, along with just lower levels of investment securities. So the balance sheet changed on the asset side, as well as the liability side.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","However you want to look at it, but the margin was up 17 basis points. If you hadn't done these deals, in your estimate, it would have been up 10, 5, flat, down?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Well, our -- in our analysis that we talked about, it probably would have been up about 10 basis points without the -- without it...","Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","And the loan -- okay, and the loan growth, what would loan growth have been without these acquisitions?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Loan growth, we still would have had very strong loan growth on the C&I book, and so we've really given the breakout of the overall loan growth without it. I think we were up about 1.1%, excluding the acquisitions, but that's because a lot of this -- that's on an average balance basis, Mike.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Right, okay. And NII, if you hadn't done the deals?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Net interest income, if we hadn't done the deals, I guess, I don't have that number right off the top of my head, Mike. We'll have to do the math on that.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Okay. That's -- my big question is, I recall -- or maybe if you can just talk about the history of KeyCorp in the credit card business because you have to appreciate over the last 2 decades, KeyCorp has expanded its product line many times only to contract. I recall, 1997, KeyCorp sold off some credit cards, and what I just don't understand is how KeyCorp has the capabilities and the portfolio to compete with the likes of a J.P. Morgan, American Express and Capital One and others that have made huge investments in brand, loyalty and partnership. So KeyCorp getting back in the credit card business, I'm sorry, it's a little bit d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, and I'm just wondering if that makes sense. Clearly, you've thought about this long and hard, and what can you say to reassure those of us who've been around for a while and seen a few of these cycles?","Beth E. Mooney","Mike, this is Beth. I'll go ahead and take that. I do think the credit card industry and the ability for regional banks to compete in the credit cards space as a relationship product is very different than it was 10 years ago. I made reference to that in an earlier answer that I provided. We look at to this as an augment to our relationship strategy. This product offering will be embedded in our relationship rewards, which is our primary account offering right now for our mass affluent client base, and the underlying cost structure, as Jeff said, we can outsource the processing of that. So it's a volume variable expense for us so that we have created a nice profitable spread by reentering. So this is not a business line that we intend to re-embark as a growth strategy for client acquisition or a lead product. We see it as a complement to our existing portfolios. Many other regional banks have also gone back into this, and we can own and control the client experiences. We've offered cards but through a white label relationship. So this client base also has, as we -- on August 1, when we announced this transaction, had substantial deposits and investments with us and loans. So this is a well-seasoned and mature set of clients that we acquired.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","And then last follow-up. I ran over to our credit card analyst, and I said what you were doing. And he said that the key to the credit card business today is what makes them sticky -- the most sticky is the rewards that you offer as opposed to the issuer, as opposed to being KeyCorp, the offer you present to them. So how is your credit card offer going to be strong enough to be sticky so that the other credit card players with enormous scale don't pull them away?","Beth E. Mooney","I'm going to let Bill Koehler augment that. But as I said, we are embedding this into our Relationship Rewards program that we have with our client base. We have already got a very strong relationship rewards. And a year ago, when Durbin was enacted, one of the things Key did that was differentiating in the market space was we reaffirmed and relaunched our rewards, and this was a product gap. And, we, obviously, as we looked at our Durbin mitigation strategies, reacquiring that card portfolio, putting it in our existing relationship reward product to make it more robust, get the attractive client economics, the attractive usage economics, as well as being able to process it on a variable cost basis, was a significant part of our strategy to mitigate Durbin.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","The C&I growth was quite strong this quarter, and frankly, we're seeing slowdowns for most other banks, and I'm just wondering what is driving that. You mentioned some of your real estate lines of business within the broader C&I bucket, but maybe a little more detail in terms of what's driving that. Is it chunky? Is it broad-based? And then I think you had said the pipeline at the end of the quarter looked pretty good. So a little more flavor, going forward, as well, please?","Christopher Marrott Gorman","Well, Matt, it's Chris. I think what's driving it is our strategy enables us to really take share. For example, in the corporate bank, in terms of new clients of this year, we have 450 new clients that have generated around $63 million or so of revenue. And so while there are some challenges in the marketplace, and I think there's a lot of concerns out there, we do see ourselves continuing to take share. The other thing that I would remind you of, of course, is that our business model -- 54% of our revenues are noninterest income. So that gives us, we think, a lever that's a little differentiated from some of our competitors as well.","William R. Koehler","And I would add -- Matt, this is Bill. I would add on the smaller end, what we've seen throughout the year is a general trend of smaller companies getting stronger and having an opportunity to strengthen their balance sheet, strengthen their business, and although it's smaller dollars in terms of its impact on the whole, we have seen our loan volumes in business banking migrate up and our pipelines remain consistent as a result.","William L. Hartmann","And Matt, this is Bill Hartmann, just maybe to add a little bit to what Chris and Bill have said. We've actually seen pretty good growth across the geographies and across our major segments of business. This is the result of a lot of effort that went into identifying who the customers were that we wanted to do business with and then decking bankers against those clients and understanding what our appetite for risk was and then just going out and executing. So it's a concerted strategy against the defined customer base.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And was there anything in particular that happened this quarter where, again, it just seems like you had an acceleration of growth versus deceleration for others? And sometimes, these initiatives and efforts take a while to bear fruit, but they just kind of all come together at once? Or there's always some puts and takes, and this quarter, it kind of all went in the same direction?","Christopher Marrott Gorman","So, Matt, it\u2019s Chris again. There's always -- it's always a little bit lumpy. Here, in the corporate bank, we, on a quarter-over-quarter basis, we were up about 1.9%. That would compare to, say, 11% over the last year. So there was really nothing particular in this quarter that was any huge piece of business. But what we do see is, Bill Hartmann mentioned, the notion of being very targeted in certain industries and knowing exactly who we want to do business with. We've been at this pretty hard for a couple of years now, and we are getting our shots with our targeted customers, and so that's really what\u2019s driving it.","Beth E. Mooney","And Matt, as we looked at the quarter, one of the things we did say in our second quarter call is that we went into the third quarter with solid and strong pipelines, and some piece of what we talked about was what was going to be the pull-through rate because it really was based in client and business sentiment. And so to your question, is this episodic or is it the trend, I think it was the pull-through of a strong pipeline into the second quarter, broad-based, geographically from a client base and reflects our targeted relationship strategy. And as we said, we are taking share. There is a lot of new client acquisition that is, on average, better credit quality and has more revenue associated with it in many ways than our average loans in our current book.","Operator","And we'll go next to Craig Siegenthaler with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Can you provide us some perspective on capital deployment here? Just looking how high your capital levels are versus peers and regulatory ratios, and that's not really that new. But I'm wondering if you can provide us any perspective on how capital deployment could potentially change into next year or in the future, given -- kind of given your conversations with regulators?","Beth E. Mooney","Craig, this is Beth. As you know, we are at the front end of the 2013 CCAR process and really have not yet received the guidance from the Federal Reserve on scenarios they want to use. And so, we, like the other banks, who can comment on any near-term capital actions, it will be subject to our CCAR submission this year. And clearly, we enter that with a strong level of capital, and we're pleased this year that we were able to pass through a dividend increase, as well as a share repurchase program for this year.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe turning over to reserve balances, on a dollar basis, it looks like they've stopped falling here. Your loan growth is positive. That's one driver. I'm wondering if there's any regulatory pressure on the other side. How should we think about reserve-to-loan ratios because it's still the -- on that base, it still declined by a little bit, but should we expect it to decline further, potentially under 15?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Well, I think what we have to look at is -- this is Jeff Weeden. Each and every quarter, Bill Hartmann's area and the risk management area go through and build up the overarching reserves. So it's going to be -- it's going to depend upon the credit migration and overall quality, the size of the portfolio, and it has to be built up in that particular regard. So we said earlier this year that we expected to see charge-offs continue to come down. Now in the third quarter here, we had the regulatory adjustment that took place that it was an industry-wide event. That added to our provision and charge-offs about $45 million in the third quarter. We don't expect that to continue into the fourth quarter. So our long-term target of 40 to 50 basis points remains intact, and we said that provision expense would migrate towards our long-term targeted rate of net charge-offs. So in terms of reserve, I can't tell you, it may come down a little bit, may go up a little bit. It's going to depend upon how we build it up each and every quarter.","William L. Hartmann","This is a Bill Hartmann. Just -- there's obviously been some press out there about, specifically, I think, the OCC, who has been talking about the level of reserves. If you read what they're really saying is they want to make sure that firms are diligent in the way that they document the level of reserves, and so we obviously have talked with them about the level of our reserves, and we're comfortable that we're showing the right level of reserves.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","At this point, do you think reserves are more relevant relative to NPAs or forward charge-off expectations?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","It's probably more indicative of forward charge-off expectations. And of course, you always have to have a degree of what might be the embedded losses in the loss confirmation period for the credits that you have on your books today.","William L. Hartmann","If you look in some of the material in the appendix of the slides, there's a credit quality trends on Slide 19, and that gives you an indication of where things have been going.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Bryan Batory - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","This is actually Bryan Batory from Ken's team. My question is on the CRE loan portfolio. So that's flattened out this quarter, actually showed a little bit of growth quarter-over-quarter. Could you just comment on some of the trends you're seeing there? And should this -- would you expect this to be the bottom for that portfolio, and we could actually see some growth going forward?","Christopher Marrott Gorman","Sure, Bryan, it's Chris Gorman. There's a couple things going on in that portfolio. First of all, we talked earlier today about de-risking and making sure we're doing business with the people that we want to do business with, and there is still some planned and thoughtful run-off in that portfolio. The other thing that's been going on, Bryan, is our mortgage banking business had been quite robust, and obviously, that cannibalizes that portfolio to some degree. Having said all of that, we do think it's a bottomed out, and we do think it will grow modestly from here.","Bryan Batory - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then, Jeff, typically, you give a pre-provision net revenue outlook on where you think you could run near-term. Last quarter, it was $290 million to $330 million. What would your near-term outlook be as we go forward?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Yes, Bryan, we're really not changing our near-term outlook at this particular point in time. We're still going through, and I think in terms of where that would be, it might be, again, $300 million to $330 million in that particular range.","Operator","And we'll go next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Beth, in regards to your comments about the credit card portfolio, is there any way -- or can you point us to a metric that we outsiders can look at to determine the success that you're having with that portfolio or contributing to a higher ROE for this organization?","Beth E. Mooney","Gerard, I think the way we will realize the benefit of the credit card portfolio that will translate into, obviously, our returns is the revenue we receive from the balances, our ability to extend that into our existing client base with our Relationship Rewards, the transactional fees that we receive on the interchange, as our clients use those, coupled with a very, like I said, variable cost base and a well-performing credit profile, given that it is a well-seasoned portfolio. So it will be generally accretive to our revenue growth, as well as help us with client acquisition and broader client experience. So we see it as a positive to the performance as you look at how we are deploying our balance sheet and building revenue.","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Gerard, this is Jeff. Near-term, of course, we have the amortization of the purchase credit card receivables that's going to be going through. So that runs through basically on a sum-of-the-months\u2019 or sum-of-the-years\u2019 digits basis. So it's much more front-end loaded. We have some of the accrete-able income that's coming in. It was about $5 million in the third quarter. It will be slightly less than that in the fourth quarter, and that part of it burns down relatively quickly. The amortization will continue on. So from a net P&L, in the very first year or so that we have of this, it\u2019s not what I would call accretive to the overall bottom line because of that. It's really the long-term view that we have of the portfolio, and we've done all of our returns based on that.","William R. Koehler","And I would -- the other thing I would say, this is a Bill, Gerard, accretive to the client experience, that is the important thing to take away here.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","As outsiders, because we hear this -- to the comments made earlier for the folks who have been following KeyCorp for a long time, we've heard strategies like this from other banks or could you guys -- some of our big banks have, obviously, the big credit card businesses, and they break it out separately, so you can really look at how successful they are. Any chance that you guys would break the credit card business out separately? Or is that just going to be engrained into the different banking lines, and we won't to be able to see it?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Gerard, this is Jeff. It's going to be embedded into the various banking lines. What we're talking about, starting off here, is a portfolio of about $0.75 billion. We will grow that portfolio over time, but that is probably not a \"significant standalone line of business\" for us. We also have our enterprise commercial payments, and that was part of our announcement too in July. So we talked about what we're doing on the merchant side of the business, and these are in -- and across the entire payment stream. So we are investing in payments within our company. But as far as breaking this one specific area out, that's probably not going to happen. We do break out on the margin analysis. You'll be able to see that. We'll break out additional line items, going forward, with respect to the fee revenue that comes from it, and so you could construct some type of a P&L from probably our publicly available disclosures on it.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And have you guys given us -- and I apologize if you already did it on the call, what the targets are for the size of this portfolio in 12 months and 24 months out?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","No, we have not.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, finally, on the capital side of the balance sheet, you guys have a very strong Tier 1 common ratio, obviously, under Basel III. Assuming that the regulations, when they -- we get the final numbers in the spring of next year, hopefully, that 7% Tier 1 common ratio is the number everybody has to manage to, plus a SIFI buffer, and if we assume for a moment your SIFI buffer will be 50 basis points on top of that. So I'm assuming you're going to be required to carry 7.5% Tier 1 common, and you're obviously well above that. What level are you comfortable with in carrying if those are the rules, 7.5% is your bogey? And then second, how -- once you give us that number of your comfort level, how quickly would you move to bring that number down to that comfort level?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Gerard, I think, in terms of overall capital levels, it's something that we have discussions with our board on, as to what that level ultimately will end up being until we see the final rules, and the NPR is just out at this point in time. It's still in the comment period. I know it's supposed to end here, I think, next week. So we'll see where we ultimately end up with. Clearly, we have more Tier 1 common than we believe that is necessary and that we would like to deploy that. However, it's a deployment that takes place between the board, management and the regulators as to how that will be ultimately repatriated into the future or utilized.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Mike Turner with Compass Point.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","On your about $17 billion securities portfolio, what's sort of the plan for that? It seems to be continuing to run off. I know a lot of the proceeds are being used to repay TruPS and CDs. And then also what are the reinvestment rates? And what's the -- remind me what the duration on that is.","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Okay. Well, this is Jeff Weeden. The portfolio at the end of the quarter was actually between the available-for-sale and the held-to-maturity portfolios were down to about $16.1 billion. And so we're getting close to kind of the floor level of maintaining a portfolio of right around that particular size just for overall liquidity management, as we've talked about pledging, et cetera, what we will use that portfolio for. In terms of the duration, it's around, I believe, 2.1, 2.2 years at this particular point in time. We've provided a disclosure for it. I guess I could go directly to that particular slide, which is Slide 15. 2.3 years is the average life. And in terms of what reinvestment rates are and what rates are going off at. So the overall yield on the portfolio, combined, is about 2.78%. I think if you look at what comes off currently, it's fair to say it's coming off at around 3%, and new reinvestment yields at this particular point in time on the product that we structure in the marketplace is about 1.4% to 1.5%.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Okay, thanks. And then just to follow up on expenses. Of the $30 million to $50 million you expect to realize at the end of this year, how much have you already booked through the third quarter?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","We haven't disclosed how much we have booked already through the third quarter. I think though if you look some of the things that we have changed in terms of our shifting our FTE count around. So we've actually taken FTEs out of certain areas of the company. We've consolidated some of our operations. You can see that if you look at some of the specific line of business information I was pointing to on Page 28 of the press release. Those items have already taken place, and we've continued to work on overall occupancy costs, and we are continuing to invest, though, too in occupancy. And if you look at the third quarter, we added the 37 branches in Western New York. Those costs are on, yet occupancy cost remains relatively stable for us. So we're taking costs out. We're making reinvestments. It's a dynamic process that we're going through. We'll provide additional information as we get into the fourth quarter earnings call.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from Andrew Marquardt with Evercore Partners.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of clarification questions. In terms of asset quality and credit costs, could you just clarify, this quarter, you had $109 million of provision, but that sounds like it included the $45 million from the change in regulatory reporting requirements, and then also some reserve build from the card and branch acquisitions of $32 million. So if we adjust for those, I mean, should we think the kind of a more normal kind of core run rate on provision being in the mid-to-low 30s? Am I thinking about that right?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","In terms of basis points or in terms of dollars?","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Dollars.","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Dollars, so if you were to look at the third quarter, that's how you would have looked at the third quarter. It would've been in kind of that low-to-mid $30 million range. That's correct. And longer-term,  we've said that it'll migrate closer in terms of basis points now in terms of -- to the 40 to 50 basis point range of charge-offs, which is where we're headed.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. So coming -- but the base should be kind of -- we\u2019re in that kind of mid-to-low 30s, and maybe migrating a little bit higher on a provision ratio basis. Is that fair?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","That's where we were for the third quarter. Again, we don't provide that specific type of a guidance with respect to the level of provision because it becomes more problematic as you just look at the overall credit quality trends, which are continuing to show improvement, and again, I don't want to get in front of ourselves until we actually close the fourth quarter on out...","Beth E. Mooney","And Slide 11, I think, gives some good color and context on that, Andrew.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Thanks, Beth. And then just lastly, on the margin and also, obviously, the other drivers on pre-pre because the margin, obviously, is going to hold up for another quarter or so. But then it becomes maybe tougher in terms of less levers, in terms of liability, as you've noted next year. But is it possible, given the other initiatives, to improve your pre-pre from the kind of low-300s this quarter next year, just given still all the headwinds that you and everyone are facing?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","So we provided guidance for the fourth quarter at this particular point in time. We'll update that guidance as we get into the January time period when we do our fourth quarter earnings call. I think it's fair to say that we have -- in heading into the fourth quarter, we feel very good about the direction of the overall margin. So in that 3 -- the low 330 area. I think as you look further on out and we start talking about all of 2013, '14, if the rate environment stays exactly where it is today, assets are going to be pressured. Liabilities will continue to reprice, but there's less levers that we're talking about there. So I think in terms of longer-term, the margins for the industry and for us will be pressured as we go further out the spectrum.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And then on pre-pre, you had said 300 to 330 was your goal. Can you remind us what the time frame is for that?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","That's what we're operating in today. I mean, we are above that for the third quarter, but we had the trust preferred gains out there.","Beth E. Mooney","That was for the fourth quarter.","Operator","And there are no other questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back to our speakers for any closing remarks.","Beth E. Mooney","Thank you, operator.

And welcome to KeyCorp\u2019s First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chairman and CEO, Beth Mooney. Please go ahead.","Beth Mooney","Thank you, Operator. Good morning, and welcome to KeyCorp's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. In the room with me are Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer and Chris Gorman, our President of Banking.","Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments, as well as the question-and-answer segment of the call. I am now turning to Slide 3.","The first quarter was a good start to the year for KEY with continued momentum in our core businesses as we grew and expanded relationships with our targeted clients. With a more positive economic backdrop and improving client sentiment, we are seeing strong activity and healthy dialog in our markets from clients large and small. We continue to take share and our pipelines remain strong.","Our results this quarter reflect the strength of our business model and competitive positioning. Earnings per common share was up 19% from the prior year and we generated a return on tangible common equity of 15% for the quarter. Reported revenue was up over 3% from the first quarter of last year and adjusted for purchase accounting accretion, revenue growth was 4.6%, driven by a higher net interest margin, solid loan growth and strong performance from our fee based businesses.","The growth in average loans this quarter was broad based and was primarily in commercial and industrial loans, which were up over 3% linked quarter. The growth reflects our success in growing and expanding middle market and corporate relationships, as well as the momentum we had coming out of the fourth quarter, the strong pipeline and activity to carry it into the first quarter for closing.","Our fee based businesses once again reflected our ability to offer a full range of solutions to our clients, including off balance sheet financing alternatives that help drive our investment banking and debt placement fees to a record first quarter level. Capital markets execution enables KEY to meet our clients\u2019 needs, drive fee income, managed portfolio risk and generate attractive returns on capital. While the mix of on and off balance sheet activity can vary in any given period, this quarter, we saw strength in both and our results continue to be a clear reflection of the success of our model.","Expenses were elevated in the quarter as a result of higher benefits and severance, as well as the acceleration of certain technology costs and investments. Don will walk through the expense line items in his comment. But importantly, we remain committed to achieving our 2018 expense guidance and believe that the first quarter level will be the high point for the year. Given our outlook for revenue growth and lower expenses, we expect to move toward the high end of our long term efficiency ratio target of 54% to 56% by the end of this year.","As we have discussed previously, we continue to execute on efficiency opportunities across our company, including realizing the remaining benefit from the First Niagara expense saves that will be fully captured in our second quarter results. We've also started implementation on a number of expense initiatives, including several that are a carryover from last year when resources were devoted to the integration of the acquisition. We have a high degree of confidence in achieving these incremental savings as we move through the year, which will come from such things as additional branch consolidations, savings from third party vendor contracts, realizing efficiencies in the middle and back office areas and the realignment of several business units.","Final two sections on the slide highlight our stronger position in terms of both risk management and capital. Credit quality remains the strength with net charge-offs to loans at 25 basis points. We remain committed to maintaining our moderate risk profile. And our approach to capital has also remained consistent, maintaining our strong capital position, while returning a large portion of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Earlier this month, we submitted our capital plan through the CCAR process and our plan was consistent with our stated capital priorities.","Overall, it was a solid start to the year. I was pleased with the growth we are seeing across our franchise. Expenses reflected some seasonal factors and other timing differences are expected to come down over the course of the year, and we remain on a path to make meaningful progress approaching the upper end of our efficiency ratio target this year.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Don for more detail on the quarter. Don?","Don Kimble","Thanks, Beth. I\u2019m on Slide 5. We reported first quarter net income from continuing operations of $0.38 per common share. Our results compared to $0.32 per share in the year ago period and $0.36 in the fourth quarter with prior periods adjusted to exclude notable items.","Our return on average tangible common equity grew to 14.9% in the first quarter. Our cash efficiency ratio was impacted by elevated expenses in the first quarter. Importantly, as Beth mentioned and as I will comment on in more detail later, we have plans in place to reduce our expenses and we expect to approach the high end of our efficiency ratio target of 54% to 56% by the end of this year. In the first quarter, we benefited from a GAAP effective tax rate of 13%, reflecting recent tax law change and credits from investments and tax-advantaged assets. I will cover many of the remaining items on this slide in the rest of my presentation, but I\u2019m now turning to Slide 6.","Total average loans of $87 billion were up $921 million from the fourth quarter. First quarter growth was driven by commercial industrial loans, which were up over 3% linked quarter on annualized. The growth was from core relationship business in both our Community Bank and our corporate bank, and we saw a good business activity in our new and overlap markets. Importantly, we maintained our underwriting standards and remain selective and focused on our targeted clients segment.","The growth this quarter also reflected the continuation of the momentum we had at year end, carryover from deals that were pushed into the first quarter and strong pipelines. Loan pay downs were still elevated slowed significantly this quarter and we would expect this trend to continue as we move through the year.","On the consumer side, we saw growth from the expansion of our auto lending business into existing geographies and dealer relationships. We are also positioned -- coming into the second quarter with ending loan balances of $88 billion, up $1 billion from the average balances this quarter.","Continuing on to Slide 7. Average deposits totaled $103 billion for the first quarter of 2018, down $1.2 billion or 1% on annualized compared to the fourth quarter. The cost of our total deposits was up 5 basis points from the fourth quarter, reflecting recent rate increases as well as continued migration of our portfolio into higher yielding products. Compared to the prior year, we saw retail and commercial growth and certificates of deposits as we continue to see a mix shift into higher cost deposits. We also saw a 10% increase in consumer non-interest bearing deposits.","NOW and money-market accounts decline from prior year is largely due to mix shift as well as the managed exit of certain higher cost corporate and public sector deposits. On a linked quarter basis, the change in our deposit balances was primarily driven by decline in non-interest bearing deposits. These deposits were elevated in the fourth quarter due to seasonal and short-term escrows. These declines were partially offset by growth in our consumer non-interest bearing deposits. We continue to have a strong stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting for 61% of our total deposit mix.","Turning to Slide 8. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $952 million for the first quarter of 2018. The net interest margin was 3.15%. These results compared to taxable equivalent net interest income of $929 million and a net interest margin of 3.13% for the first quarter of 2017, and $952 million and 3.09% margin in the fourth quarter. Purchase accounting accretion contributed $33 million, or 11 basis points to our first quarter results. This compares with $38 million or 12 basis points in the fourth quarter and $53 million or 18 basis points in the first quarter of 2017.","From the first quarter level, we continue to expect purchase account accretion to decline by approximately 10% per quarter in 2018. Excluding purchase accounting accretion, net interest income was up $43 million from the first quarter of 2017. The increase was largely driven by higher rates and low managed deposit data. Excluding purchase accounting accretion, total revenues would have increased by $67 million or 4.6% from the first quarter of 2017.","Net interest income increased $5 million from the quarter excluding purchase accounting accretion as the benefit of higher interest rates and lower short-term earning assets with the lower levels of liquidity was partially offset by the day count and the impact of taxable equivalent adjustment. We expect our core net interest margin, excluding purchase accounting accretion, to move modestly higher from the remainder of this year, which assumes continued growth in our balance sheet and a rate increase mid-year and another toward the end of the year. Reflecting March rate increase as well as the expectations for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our net income outlook for the year by $50 million to now be in the range of $3.95 billion to $4.05 billion.","Moving to Slide 9. KEY\u2019s non-interest income was $601 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $577 million for the year ago quarter as we continue to benefit from investments in several of our fee-based businesses. Growth from the prior year was largely driven by record first quarter for investment banking debt placement fees, which were $143 million, up $16 million from the year ago period as we benefit from the acquisition of Cain Brothers, as well as strength across our capital markets platform.","We also saw momentum in many of our other fee-based areas, including commercial leasing and deposit services. Compared to fourth quarter 2017 non-interest income decreased by $55 million. The decrease was largely driven by seasonal impacts in several fee-based businesses, including investment banking debt placement, cards and payments and corporate and life insurance.","Turning to Slide 10. KEY\u2019s non-interest expense was $1.006 billion for the first quarter 2018, which compares to $1.013 billion in the fourth quarter with the prior quarter adjusted for a number of notable items, including merger-related charges and the impact of tax reform and related actions. The current quarter reflected a number of seasonal and timing items, which impacted the comparison with the fourth quarter. Excluding notable items from the prior period, personnel costs were up $28 million from the fourth quarter.","The drivers of this increase were $31 million in higher employee benefits costs, primarily due to seasonal increases in employer taxes and healthcare related expenses and approximately $11 million in the accretion -- the acceleration of technology development costs into the first quarter. We also incurred $5 million in severance cost this quarter. And offsetting these increases and personnel line was a decline of $24 million in incentive compensation. The increase in personnel costs were more than offset by a net $35 million reduction in non-personnel expenses, despite the impact of $4 million increase resulting from purchase accounting true-up and $3 million of higher operational losses.","We expect that our elevated expense level this quarter will represent the high point for the year, and we will achieve our targeted expense range of $3.85 billion to $3.95 billion for 2018. Contributing to our lower expense run rate will be the remaining First Niagara cost base of $50 million, which should be fully reflected in our second quarter results. Additionally, as part of our ongoing continued improvement culture, we are implementing plans across the Company that will contribute to our results this year.","As Beth mentioned, these cost reductions include additional branch consolidations expecting to close 40 branches this year; additional savings from third-party vendor contracts; realizing efficiencies from middle and back-office functions; realignment of several business units; and adjustment to staffing models throughout the organization. With these efforts, we expect to be approaching the high end of our long-term efficiency ratio target of 54% to 56% by the end of this year. Again, we\u2019re maintaining our full-year guidance for non-interest expense of $3.85 billion to $3.95 billion.","Moving on to Slide 11. Our credit quality remains strong. Net charge-offs were $54 million or 25 basis points of average total loans in the first quarter, which continues to be below our targeted range. Provision for credit losses was $61 million for the quarter. Non-performing loans were up $38 million or 8% from the prior quarter, but represented 61 basis points of period end loans. At March 31, 2018, our total reserve to loan losses represented 1% of period end loans and 163% coverage of non-performing loans.","And turning to Slide 12. Capital remains strength for our company with a common equity Tier 1 ratio at the end of the fourth quarter of 10%. We continue to repurchase common shares during the quarter, which totaled to $199 million. We submitted our capital plans earlier this month with the requested capital actions, which are consistent with our earlier messages of continuing to increase the common dividend to a level approaching our long-term targeted payout range of 40% to 50%. Our requested share repurchases will also move our capital closer to our long-term common equity Tier 1 target of 9% to 9.5%.","Slide 13 is our outlook for 2018. With the exception of the higher net interest income and adjusting our tax rate guidance, our outlook remains the same with what we shared with you in January. We continue to expect average loan balances to increase to $88.5 billion to $89.5 billion range with deposits growing less than loans. As I mentioned earlier, net interest income is expect to be in the range of $3.95 billion to $4.05 billion with our outlook assuming one more increase in middle of the year and another later in the year.","In our appendix, we also updated our net interest guidance -- our interest rates sensitivity slide, which provides different rate and balance sheet assumptions. We anticipate the non-interest income will be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion as we continue to drive growth from our core businesses into the First Niagara revenue synergies. We continue to expect non-interest expense to be in the range of $3.85 billion to $3.95 billion with the first quarter marking the high point in expenses for the year.","Net charge-offs expect to remain below our targeted range of 40 basis points to 60 basis points and our loan loss provision should slightly exceed our level of net charge-offs provided for loan growth. And given our lower starting point this quarter, we've adjusted our full-year guidance for our GAAP tax rate down to 17% to 18%. As Beth said, this was a good start to the year for us with continued growth across our franchise. There was some noise and then seasonality in our expense but we remain confident on our outlook and expect to make meaningful progress this year toward achieving our long-term goal.","I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions]. First one is from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ken Zerbe","Just have a quick question on the efficiency ratio target. Are you guys referring to reported efficiency ratio, the 54% to 56% or are you excluding the intangible amortization?","Don Kimble","Other than cash efficiency ratio and that\u2019s why we use as our target, which would exclude the intangible, that\u2019s correct.","Ken Zerbe","And then just in terms of technology spend. I guess, how are you thinking about additional technology expense from here. Because I guess my question is, what is the risk that in future quarters we see additional, let\u2019s call it, accelerated technology spend that may -- or I assume it\u2019s all built into your expense guidance. But I guess I\u2019m curious about the up side risk there.","Don Kimble","No, it is built into our guidance and we would expect the first quarter like expenses overall, will be the high point as far as our technology spend and we will continue to manage that appropriately going forward.","Ken Zerbe","And then just one last question. On Slide 7, you mentioned the migration into higher yielding products in terms of the deposit side. Can you just elaborate on how pervasive is that and what do you expect over the course of the year? Thanks.","Don Kimble","I think you can see that in that in the time deposit line item, we\u2019re seeing much more growth there than we are in other deposit products. And that\u2019s essentially where the consumer and some commercial customers are going to get the increased rate, but we\u2019re not seeing a lot of the core money market pricing and others change yet. And so we\u2019re seeing that drift back into time deposits and we expect that to continue throughout the next year.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","Scott Siefers","Thank you for the comments about the high watermark and expenses going down from here. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re willing -- if you maybe a little more specific on your thoughts on the trajectory for the remainder of the year. I guess what I\u2019m asking is, would you expect an immediate step down in cost in the 2Q and then some growth from there or is this more ratable change over the course of the year. And then I guess the follow on question to that is almost like clockwork, I guess the way your expenses are going to project this year is almost reverse the way they typically do in the first quarter is typically the low watermark for the year and by wide margin, the fourth quarter tends to be the highest, I think mostly because of investment banking. So have you baked into the guide, that seasonal increase in compensation costs in the fourth quarter and so you still think you can lower expenses even in spite of what typically is a weaker end of the year and cost.","Don Kimble","And I would say that as we look at our outlook for expenses from the first quarter level that would imply that the second through fourth quarter should on average be down about $40 million. And so if we look at what we incurred in here in the first quarter, we had the higher benefit cost of about $30 million and also we had some one-time items that what I would mention as far as the accounting. Purchase accounting true-up which costs us about $4 million and also elevated operating losses which cost us about $3 million. And so those three combined are in that $38 million range.","We would expect the benefit cost come down meaningfully here in the second quarter. We won\u2019t recapture a 100% of that $30 million windfall but we do expect to see a meaningful adjustment down for that. We\u2019d also expect those other items of purchase accounting true-up and the operating losses not to continue for that base. But we do expect to see some other things that would occur in the second quarter, which includes some of the merit increases come through and those will be offset by some of the savings that we\u2019ll be expecting to achieve.","And to your earlier question, we are also taking in consideration the increased compensation related to higher investment banking fees throughout the rest of this year as well. And so that is embedded in our guidance for this year and as a result, we would expect to see a different trajectory as far as expenses this year compared what we would have seen in previous years and more of that\u2019s related to the timing of some these expense programs that we\u2019ve talked about and making sure that we achieve those savings as part of our continues improvement to offset those increases.","Scott Siefers","So basically regardless of what happens on the revenue side, you\u2019re going to be -- your plan is to enter 2019 off of a lower 4Q expense base than we got now almost regardless of what happens, right?","Don Kimble","It\u2019d be our expectation based on the timing of these expense initiatives we talked about.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Just an follow up to Scott\u2019s questions, thanks for all the color Don. The question is like expense are going to go down for the rest of the year but then it seems like we\u2019ll have a new seasonality so we should just expect -- should we expect first quarters to generally be the high watermark for the absolute expense quarters as we go into \u201919 as well or are we just now on a different trend down, down, down the hallway?","Don Kimble","We would expect to see some seasonality in the first quarter of every year, mainly because of the benefit expenses. I would say that this first quarter, we had about $20 million of items that were elevated compared what our expectations would have been coming into the quarter. Benefit cost themselves were about $5 million higher, we had severance costs of $5 million and then we also have the other two items I mentioned, which was the true up of purchase accounting and also the higher operational losses, which we wouldn\u2019t expect to continue going forward.","Ken Usdin","And then just on -- really helpful to give us that approaching the high end of 40 -- 54 to 56 that\u2019s a far-far away from 62.9 that you just printed given all the things you just talked about. I just want to -- can you help us understand what approaching really means, is it really directionally or is actually expected you can really, really get tight to that 56 side.","Don Kimble","We mean that we will be closely approaching that 56 side.","Operator","Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Can you give us some additional color, you had some strong commercial loan growth in the quarter, sequentially annualized it was about 12%, I guess. Can you share with us where that's coming from may be geographically? And Don I think you mentioned something about some overlapping, I am assuming with the First Niagara franchise some growth came from that area and the some further color on this growth.","Don Kimble","I\u2019ll ask Chris to provide some more color here as well. But you\u2019re right. The growth was driven by a number of things, one is that we did have some pipelines and volumes that really got pushed out of the fourth quarter into the first quarter, and so we saw growth there. We also benefited this quarters significantly from pay downs being lower and that was about $1.3 billion lower pay-offs this quarter than what we had in the fourth quarter. And so that was a huge benefit to us as well. And the growth was across the board, and I think Chris will highlight some of the market, especially some of those new markets for us that contributed to it.","Chris Gorman","So if you just step back for a second, our business is one where we\u2019re constantly out talking to our clients and things develop over time. So if you step back, we have more bankers, we have better dialogue, we have more clients, we continue to expand the clients that we have. So in any given quarter, you'll see movements like this. We had really strong performance across the board. We had strong performance in the Rocky Mountains, strong performance in the Pacific Northwest, we had strong performance in our Hudson Valley area. And we also had strong performance in some of these overlap markets that Don mentioned and those would be markets like Buffalo and some of our new markets like Pittsburg and Philadelphia. Also in our industry based businesses, we had pretty much across the board growth, so it was just a really good quarter for both on and off balance sheet growth.","Gerard Cassidy","And then shifting to the other side of the balance sheet on the deposit side, I may have not heard this so I apologize. Can you give us an idea of what the deposit betas are doing today? And what is your expectation and when you will get to your terminal deposit beta, is it later this year 2019 and about what level would that be when you look at it?","Don Kimble","As far as the deposit beta this quarter, you can look at our deposit rate went up by about 5 basis points this quarter compared to the 25 basis points increase in fed fund. So calculating just that way simplistically, it\u2019s about 25%, on a cumulative basis we\u2019re at 22%. We would expect that 25% to continue to increase throughout the rest of this year and probably getting into the 2019 time period for future increases would be more to our normalized beta, which we've historically talked about mid-50s beta. And so we would see a gradual increase from here to that point. And those are the assumptions are baked into our net interest income guidance for the outlook for this year.","Operator","Our next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Just wanted to follow-up on Scott and Ken's line of questioning. So I thought it was very clear the way you outline some of the seasonality, Don, on the first quarter expense line. But within the revenue parameters that you laid out in Slide 13, the quarterly run rate for expenses should average between $965 million to $981 million using the mid-point to high point of your expense range.","Don Kimble","That's correct and so I would just say that it's roughly on average about $40 million decline from what the first quarter level was. And again a good portion of that really comes from the removal of some of these one time or seasonal items. And so essentially the increases and incentive compensation related to stronger performance and capital markets and some of the other investments we\u2019d be making will be offset by the impact of the cost savings we talked about and timing of those.","Erika Najarian","And as a follow-up on the net interest income guide, you guys clearly outperformed on client activity trends among regional banks this quarter. I am wondering what average loan growth and balance sheet side you've contemplated underneath that $3.95 billion to $4.05 billion guidance.","Don Kimble","What we've included in here is the guidance we have for total loans. And so the midpoint of that I believe was $89 billion and the midpoint of the deposits was in the $1.04 billion range, so those would both be about $2 billion increase from where we were on average basis for the first quarter. And based on how we\u2019re positioned to-date with our ending balances for loans being up $1 billion dollars from the average for the first quarter, I think we're off to a good start here in the second quarter.","Erika Najarian","And one last one for Beth. Beth, with the stress capital buffer proposals that had come out two weeks ago or I guess last week clearly favorable for lower risk models like KeyCorp and favorable towards higher dividend payers. I am wondering if that could potentially change how you\u2019re thinking about capital return if the proposal is passed as written?","Beth Mooney","Good question Erika, and no it does not. But it certainly does augment and support how we have talked about our capital priorities.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities.","Peter Winter","If have to look at pretax pre-provision net revenue for the first quarter, it was down 4% year-over-year. And I\u2019m just wondering did you possibly frontload some of the expenses for the revenue enhancements last year, and so there should be better operating leverage going forward?","Don Kimble","I would say that the pre-provision net revenue impact really was related to more of the timing and some of the elevated level of expenses this quarter that we expect to see come down throughout the rest of the year. And as far as the investments we\u2019re making and the revenue synergies that more of those as we\u2019ve talked about before are proportionate to the revenue. And so we still believe we\u2019re on a path to achieve a run rate for those revenue synergies of $150 million a year by the end of this year and achieve $300 million target by the end of next year.","Peter Winter","And then just one quick one on credit, it\u2019s not major. But I\u2019m just wondering there was an increase in C&I non-performing. Just wondering if you could give a little color?","Don Kimble","It tend to be more deal specifics, so there really isn\u2019t any trend or any specifics as far as industry seen any stress or pressure, it really is just one item at a time. So no big or unusual transactions and no industry concentrations there.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.","John Pancari","Thanks for the color on the expense trends. I don\u2019t mean to kick the dead horse here, but I am going to kick it twice. On the expense number, just can you talk about your -- if revenues does come in weaker this year for any given reason, could you just talk about your ability and your willingness to be more flexible on the expenses, and your ability to pull back in order to get to the efficiency target?","Don Kimble","You\u2019re right on that point but keep in mind that a good portion of the revenue growth is coming from more of our fee-based businesses, and some of those are tied to the capital markets and there is a direct correlation between the expenses associated with supporting that and their actual revenues. And so revenue if revenue don't come through, we would see a corresponding reduction to the expenses. And we\u2019ve always talked as well as that we\u2019re very focused on continuous improvement.","And we\u2019ve talked about times will make investments, because we\u2019re seeing the payback and have additional revenue growth opportunities for making those investments. At times revenues won't be there, and so we\u2019ll pull back on the expenses. And you\u2019ve seen a little bit of that here with this quarter and what we\u2019re talking about, because the expense initiatives that were taken on for the rest of this year are probably elevated and toward the upper end of what our normal guidance range would be to make sure that we can manage to and live up to our commitments we made as far as our expense outlook.","John Pancari","And then separately again on expenses, you haven't announced any plans to reinvest your tax saving yet, a lot of your peers have. And so I guess, could you just about -- I know you\u2019re not signaling anything just yet and you indicated that the IT investments are ongoing, but not going to drive a big jump in cost. What is the likelihood that 2019 that you relocate the tax savings and decide to reinvest a portion of that into IT or any other area?","Don Kimble","I would say when the tax law changed, we did make an investment in our people and we increased our minimum-wage to $15 an hour, and so that was meaningful to a lot of our employees and I feel that was appropriate step to take. And we also had a one-time contribution to the retirement funds for those individuals as well. And so that was both we thought very constructive. We\u2019re very focused on continuing to drive the core and we want to focus on driving positive operating leverage for the current year and we\u2019ll expect to do the same thing in \u201919 and beyond in. And for us to do that, our investments will have to be made through benefits we have from cost savings and from future revenue growth. And so it won't be a direct result or connected to the tax reform that\u2019s occurred.","Operator","Our next question is from Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.","Saul Martinez","First is just a clarification on your NII guidance. This year\u2019s slide deck you made it clear that it's on a tax equivalent basis, in previous versions I think it wasn\u2019t explicitly specified. I just want to make sure that this numbers is on a like for like basis. I know it\u2019s not a big number but it\u2019s about $30 million, so I just wanted to make sure that we\u2019re comparing the respective guides on a similar basis.","Don Kimble","No, you're right. And the recently we added that this quarter is last quarter's call I had a question as whether or not that was taxable equivalent or not, and it was. And so on a consistent basis, we just want to make sure that I was clear for the investors to know that.","Saul Martinez","And to beat a dead horse, I guess a little further couple of quick questions on cost. The $15 million of cost savings that you\u2019ve realized, how much of that was in the run rate in the first quarter and how much do you expect to incremental expense save you expect to filter into the second quarter and beyond?","Don Kimble","We have said that the full amount is in the second quarter outlook, so we will have it achieved. And I would say that we were over half the way there in the first quarter, and then you would see that in some of the non-personnel related expenses, which are down $35 million on a linked quarter basis.","Saul Martinez","And I guess final question on the cost and maybe I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s -- I know you talked about the seasonality in some detail. But it\u2019s still not clear to me why this first quarter the seasonality in the expense line was so much greater than it has been in previous years. Obviously, couple of years ago you didn't have First Niagara, but it seems very, very pronounced. So can you just walk me through why this year it was -- is seemingly so different in terms of seasonality?","Don Kimble","Your right, first quarter of last year would have had some noise around First Niagara, so it might not have been quite as transparent as it is this year. If you look at just, for example the benefit costs, we\u2019re up $10 million on an adjusted basis this quarter compared to a year ago quarter. $5 million of which was timing related and so that was more pronounced of this quarter than what we would have expected. And then beyond that as far as expenses as I highlighted earlier, we really had about $20 million worth of expenses, but just broke against this quarter and we wouldn\u2019t expect that to continue or recur. But anything that to turned against us this quarter from an expense perspective and so that really made the overall seasonality and timing related issues even more pronounced this quarter than what it has been historically.","Chris Gorman","And going forward we shouldn\u2019t on average expect this kind of seasonality in 1Q.","Don Kimble","We would expect ongoing seasonality as far as the benefit cost and some other day count related issues going forward that's correct.","Operator","Our next question is from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O\u2019Connor","So a lot of details on expenses for the full-year and what you expect existing the year. But just if you can narrow down what do you expect the range of expenses to be in 2Q specifically just to reduce the risk of any miscommunication on that might be helpful.","Don Kimble","Matt, we typically don\u2019t given guidance specifically on a quarterly basis. But I will say that the majority of that $30 million benefit increase we should see it come down. And so I would expect to see in the neighborhood of about $25 million decline for that line item. Two of the other line items that I talked about that we wouldn\u2019t expect to continue at that level, it would be purchase true-up, which cost us about $4 million in the elevated operation losses which were about $3 million. And so those combined would imply about a $30 million reduction on a core basis to expenses, and I think that's a good walking around assumption for this point in time.","Matt O\u2019Connor","And then just separately, the trust fees, if we look year-over-year we\u2019re down a little bit. I'm just wondering what's driving that. Obviously, market level has been choppy of way, but cumulatively over the last year, up nicely and that's why one component of it. But just remind us what the puts and takes are there and why that's down little bit year-over-year?","Chris Gorman","Actually, our private banking business, which is the bulk of that, is actually on a really good trajectory. You probably saw we had $39 billion of AUM and we continue to gain a lot of traction there. That was somewhat offset by challenging comp periods for both our equity and our fixed income trading businesses.","Matt O\u2019Connor","And how much are the trading revenues versus the private bank roughly about disclosed?","Chris Gorman","We've never disclose that, but it's relatively small vis-\u00e0-vis the private banking business.","Matt O\u2019Connor","And why were those areas weak? I think, if we look at the broader and some banking universe thinking equity overall was flat to up depending on the mixes between the two?","Chris Gorman","In that business, both our fixed income and our equity business, we really are just facilitating liquidity for our clients. The equity platforms in general I think are under a lot of pressure in terms of margins. And we just didn\u2019t have the quarter and fixed income that we've had previously.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Steven Alexopoulos","I wanted to start, first follow-up on a commentary around accelerating the tech project. I saw the headlines that KEY upgrading its lending platform, one the airplanes upgrade the entire core. And is that what's driving this accelerated tech project that's my first question?","Don Kimble","Good question, and two of the initiatives that we've really kicked off and this year it has been more of the consumer lending platforms, both for residential real-estate related and also for non-residential real-estate, so there are two initiatives. Those really are the area of increase for this year. I would say that in future years, we\u2019ll continue to have a component of our technology development to continue to reinvest in the core. And so we will see opportunities there to make those investments, and those will be again more consistent with the overall plan and efforts.","This year, we also have some digital investments going on that we think that will be an ongoing part of our business model as well, because we believe those are critical for us continue to stay current and make sure that we're making the appropriate investments in the digital aspects for both our consumer and commercial customers.","Steven Alexopoulos","And what\u2019s the anticipated tech spend this year?","Don Kimble","When we look at technology spend that we would tend to have captured in a couple different buckets. One is for personnel and contractors, which all will go through the personnel line item where we saw that elevated level. And that would be in the $120 million to $125 million range for this year. I would say our total technology spend is closer to $200 million, which would include some software and hardware investment as well. And that's fairly consistent with what we\u2019ve had on a run rate. But keep in mind in some prior periods more of the efforts were focused on the integration and conversion for First Niagara. And so we\u2019re seeing those efforts more aligned now to the platform, the digital and just ongoing core investments in the business.","Steven Alexopoulos","And maybe for Beth. With the potential upgrade in costs which are significant upgrade the core overtime. Do you think you have enough scale at the size to make the needed investments in tech or do you think you need get larger share?","Beth Mooney","As we look at it, we think we have the adequate resources to support both our business strategies and the investments that we need to enable those. And that would include people, product and capabilities as we\u2019ve talked about in the past. So being smart in allocating and prioritizing our investments is always part of how you do this, but certainly a discipline that we believe we have and do believe we are well-positioned to compete.","Steven Alexopoulos","If I could squeeze one more in. On the expense initiatives, you talked about realigning business unit staffing adjustments. Can you give a little more color on what you're doing there? Thank you.","Don Kimble","Realignment of those businesses, as we\u2019ve gone through the integration with First Niagara, we identified some areas where we can make things more efficient and more effective. And so we have combined some areas and that\u2019s -- a lot of gain some efficiencies from a business alignment. And then as far as the staffing models, we just have a number of areas where we\u2019re performing outside what our normal models would be and we\u2019re achieving those targeted levels through normal attrition of other efforts. And so it\u2019s just making sure that we continue to adhere to those models and continue to deliver the synergies we would expect to see from the combination.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Mike Mayo","So still on the efficiency topic, so retail efficiency is 69% and that\u2019s flat with the year ago despite the First Niagara merger savings and everything else that you're doing. If you could just give some color why that has improved despite the merger savings? And maybe it\u2019s some allocation to the business line or maybe you're not happy with the progress, or maybe your spending the benefits of the savings or some other reason. If you could give some color on that would be great?","Don Kimble","And as far as the efficiency ratio for the overall Community Bank that we are seeing the improvements that we want to see that we are seeing the savings come through for the merger. The Community Bank was a disproportionate party that was impacted by some of these seasonal and\/or unusual costs this quarter and that drove their efficiency ratio up. We would expect to continue to see some strong positive operating leverage from the Community Bank going forward and expect to see some of these seasonal items go away and show some meaningful progress going forward from that.","Mike Mayo","A follow up, it sounds like you\u2019re not -- you\u2019re probably super excited about having a 69% efficiency ratio in that business line. It sounds like you expect that to improve. But if you\u2019re spending $200 million a year on your technology budget, just going back to scale question at a timeline, the technology budget of say JPMorgan of $11 billion and you\u2019re spending $200 million a year on technology. Is the investing phase potentially going to last longer than you expect? And if you could just clear is that right the $200 million a year on technology?","Don Kimble","You\u2019re right. As far as the overall spend, I would say that we can remain very competitive with that. The other thing that we have going forward is our ability to partner with fintechs and other providers. And so while we might not be developing our own capabilities like some of the larger banks might, we believe we can get some of the same benefits. And we\u2019ve talked about that in the payment space where we have a number of strategic partnerships where we can bring to market very competitive and very technically advanced types of products and capabilities to our customers without having to develop that ourselves. And so the $200 million is just consistent with how we look at as far as the spend and believe it\u2019s appropriately positioned going forward.","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin Reevey with D. A. Davidson. Please go ahead.","Kevin Reevey","So first question is for Chris or for Don. Are you seeing any increase in your line utilization at the end of the quarter versus the prior quarter?","Don Kimble","Actually, our utilization across both our community and corporate banks has been relatively flat.","Kevin Reevey","And then moving towards your order book, I know it\u2019s a small percentage of your overall loan portfolio. How is the order book behaving?","Don Kimble","The order book has done very well. But again we focus on a FICO score of about 760, the delinquencies has been holding up very well and we\u2019re fine with the performance of the that business. And as we highlighted, that\u2019s been an area of benefit to us as far as taking that product across the legacy key footprint to the dealers that we already have relationships with. And so we\u2019re seeing some synergies from that as well.","Kevin Reevey","And then my last question is on revenue enhancements from the First Niagara, it\u2019s a follow-up to Gerard's question. Can you talk about any revenue enhancements that you're seeing from there?","Don Kimble","Again, on that front, we do expect that those are moving in line with outlook that we expect to be at $150 million run rate by the end of this year and $300 million by the end of next year. Where we're seeing benefits already are on the commercial payments space where we continue to see a nice adoption rate going from the former First Niagara customers and some of the products and capabilities we have there. We\u2019ve seen some strong growth as far as the capital markets related activities, especially on the commercial real estate customers or First Niagara. And we placed about $400 million of debt on that front, so that\u2019s been a real win for us.","We talked about indirect auto earlier with you Kevin as well, and so we\u2019re seeing growth there. One thing that hasn\u2019t shown as much on the bottom line so to speak that we\u2019re seeing good activity is the residential mortgage. And if we look at the application volumes here for the first quarter, they\u2019re up 41% from a year ago. And so we haven't seen volume come through as far as closed deals and that we are optimistic that we\u2019re starting to see some pick up here in the second quarter and beyond.","Beth Mooney","And Kevin, I would add that on mortgage side part of what we talked about last year was ramping up our staffing as well as investments and making sure our platforms from a underwriting through servicing we\u2019re ready to accommodate what we saw was probably the largest driver of our revenue synergy.","And so I would say we entered 2018 staffed and ready, but that is something that will definitely build throughout the year, and is reported on our income statement in the way where we will be able to track it.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to Jeffery Elliot with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Jeffery Elliot","Maybe back to that little pick-up in C&I non-performers, I mean I hear you say that it's nothing industry specific. But is there anything in terms of the characteristics of those companies or deals anything might leverage or interest cover that stands out as a common factor across loans that have gone into non-performing?","Don Kimble","There really aren't any comment threads there at all, but what we're seeing in our small leverage portfolio that are relatively stable and it continues to perform well. It is more of a deal-by-deal basis that we're seeing some increases there, and it's very slight. And it's up from the fourth quarter but down from the first quarter of last year, and as the percentage of total loans at 61 basis points, which is still pretty low compared to the industry overall.","Jeffery Elliot","And more broadly, we started to see some more press on rising leverage in the corporate sector. We've heard from one or two other banks comments on that as the sign that we might be getting later in the cycle. Do you agree that that's a concern or how do you think about that?","Chris Gorman","So there is really two things, one is our book. Our leverage book has been flat for some period of time, so that's a book that is a small percentage of our total loan portfolio, and secondly it has a lot of velocity. With respect to leverage in general and what we're seeing in the marketplace, there is in fact rising levels of leverage in some transactions in some parts of our business and obviously that's something we watch very closely.","Operator","And next we go to Marlin Mosby with Vining Spark. Please go ahead.","Marlin Mosby","Focusing a little bit more on the revenue side. You had a pipeline for the investment banking debt placement, just curious about the step down that we have this particular quarter. Do you think that's a temporary pull-back or do you think that this is more normal levels and there is a little bit of pull through or acceleration as rates were going up that people are trying to do deals faster than the rates were climbing. So just thought about that revenue stream as you move through rest of the year?","Chris Gorman","What I think you\u2019re really seeing is a pretty typical seasonality that we experienced in that line. We always look at that line on a trailing 12 basis. And so if you look at, for example, in absolute terms this is a record first quarter for us. If we look at our backlogs now vis-\u00e0-vis a year ago, our backlogs are actually better than they were a year ago. So we feel pretty good about where the business is.","There was one thing and we noted there were few of pay downs in the first quarter and when you have fewer pay downs, typically that can adversely impact the fee line and investment banking and that placement fees as well. But we feel really good about where the business is and particularly where it is vis-\u00e0-vis this time last year.","Marlin Mosby","And then, Don, I have two questions for you and in terms of one if you look at the roll-up of security yields, as well as just our interest rate swaps as they now re-priced, you\u2019ll get actually the pull up in those yields. So could your net margin actually continue to increase, let's say the fed stop raising rates just because where medium and longer term rates are as there benefit. And then also the tax rate popped down this quarter. Is that related to the stock price and probably benefits and is that -- was that an unusual item? So just two items I want you to look at. Thanks.","Don Kimble","As far as the overall margin, we do believe that they\u2019ll be a lift there as far as the cash flows are for our investment portfolio. I think we highlighted that the new purchases were coming on at about a point higher than what the roll-off of the portfolio, and we\u2019re seeing about a $1.2 billion plus of the cash flow each quarter now on the investment portfolio, same thing on the swap books. We had about $1.4 billion of maturities to the swap book and the roll off rate versus the new rate for those replacement swaps is about 160 basis points wider. And so we\u2019re seeing lift there as well. And so we think those would both be additive.","And so when we think that there could be some lift there, we would refer to the core margin as being relatively stable even if rates don't go up with maybe some slight bias for something with lift there, because offsetting that would be the continue drift to the portfolio on the deposit side more on the time deposits, and also seeing some of the impact as far as a continued reduction in purchase accounting accretion, which would decrease our margin by about a basis point a quarter.","And then as far as the taxes, you're right but they\u2019re really two components that drove that each in the $10 million range as far as the benefit this quarter, one was for the employees stock purchases and vesting that occurred; and that really is more heightened as far as the first quarter based on when some of the stock plans do vest; the other was higher tax credits. And the way that we would look at that is it did have a benefit to us this quarter, but that really essentially offset some of the timing issues we saw on the expense side. And so we feel pretty good about the quarter being at $0.38 and feel that both of those essentially offset each other and provide for a baseline for us going forward.","Operator","And we\u2018ll go to Kevin Parker with Piper Jaffrey. Please go ahead.","Kevin Parker","One of your competitors is mentioning that there is increased competition in the market due to the effect of tax reform. Have you contemplated increased competition on loan yields in your NII guidance and are you seeing some of that increased competition in your markets today?","Don Kimble","I\u2019ll take the first crack at this and hand it over to Chris to get more color on the competition. But I would say that pricing on the commercial front has been extremely competitive here over the last year plus. And we\u2019re not seeing any change or acceleration of that competition, or any more pressure on the pricing after the tax reform than what we did before. And so I don't want to characterize this as there isn't some impact there, but I would say that it\u2019s the continuation of what we\u2019ve been seeing. Our outlook for the net interest income guidance for us does assume that we continue to see a very competitive marketplace as far as pricing for new loan volumes and re-pricing.","Chris Gorman","Don, one thing that I would add to that is in the real estate area, I think level of intensity has even increased to a greater degree than on the C& I front. And you see that really reflected in our business, because we have -- our approach to serving our clients has remained unchanged. But you can see that were getting significant growth in terms of commercial mortgage were up 21% on quarter-over-quarter basis. And so what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re figuring out really the right place to take our clients and to fund their needs.","Kevin Parker","Are you seeing any particular markets or asset classes within commercial real estate where you're seeing greater competition versus others?","Chris Gorman","I would say real estate broadly and then specifically, we see it in multifamily probably as much as anything. Also industrial is an area where there has been significant price appreciation. Over the last year, there's been about an 11% appreciation in industrial space and then last quarter, there was mid single digit, so that scenario that's hot as well.","Operator","And with no further questions, I'll turn it back to you Ms. Mooney for any closing comments.","Beth Mooney","Thank you, Operator.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ms. Beth Mooney. Ms. Mooney, please go head, ma'am.","Beth E. Mooney","Thank you, operator. And good morning, and welcome to KeyCorp's Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call.","Joining me for today's presentation is Jeff Weeden, our Chief Financial Officer. And available for the Q&A portion of the call are the leaders of Key Corporate Bank and Key Community Bank, Chris Gorman and Bill Koehler. Also joining us for the Q&A discussion are our Chief Risk Officer, Chuck Hyle; and our Treasurer, Joe Vayda.","Slide 2 is our forward-looking disclosure statement. It covers our presentation materials and comments, as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call today. ","Now if you would turn to Slide 3. This morning, we announced fourth quarter net income of continuing operations attributable to common shareholders of $201 million, or $0.21 per common share. Our fourth quarter results reflect continued improvement in credit quality, solid loan growth and further evidenced that we're gaining traction in leveraging the alignment of our franchise across business lines to support the needs of our clients. There were also some unusual items in the quarter that impacted our revenue and expense levels that Jeff will cover in his remarks. Key's dramatic improvement and credit quality this year continued in the fourth quarter with net charge-offs declining for the eighth consecutive quarter to 86 basis points of average loans. Nonperforming assets and the level of criticized loans also continued to show meaningful improvement. ","Our progress reflects the actions taken to improve our risk profile and strengthen our credit culture, which can be seen in our credit metrics, as well as in the quality of our new loan originations. We were also encouraged by the second consecutive quarter of period-end loan growth with average balances increasing for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2008. Driving the loan growth was a 5.4% increase in average commercial, financial and agricultural loans, marking the third consecutive quarter of growth for this portfolio. This confirmed our belief that we've reached an inflection point in loan balances in the third quarter of 2011 and that we have created a business model that is distinctive and positions us to win in the marketplace. ","Before Jeff discusses our quarterly results, I want to step back and review the progress we made in 2011 and share some thoughts on our priorities for 2012. In 2011, we benefited from the actions taken to strengthen our balance sheet, reduce risk, reposition our business and rebuild capital. As you can see in our full year results, we have returned to solid and sustainable profitability, reached an inflection point in our loan portfolio and established peer-leading capital levels. For the full year 2011, net income from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders was $857 million or $0.92 per common share, which was a significant increase from the $413 million or $0.47 per common share in the prior year. The year-over-year increase was largely driven by the dramatic improvement in credit quality, good expense control and our success in growing our business. ","In 2011, we also continued to focus on customer service. I was pleased with the recognition we received over the course of the year that affirms our relationship strategy and validates our customers' belief they receive value from Key's products and services. Recent recognition includes a survey by American Customer Satisfaction Index showing that Key is one of only 2 large banks that improved its overall customer satisfaction score for 2 consecutive years. And Key scored significantly more positive than the banking industry overall. Additionally, Key ranked fifth nationwide in overall customer satisfaction in the J.D. Power and Associates 2011 Small Business Banking Satisfaction Survey and achieved the highest score in the industry for in-person account activities. ","The final item on this slide focuses on maintaining a strong balance sheet and remaining disciplined in our approach to capital management. Our strong capital position provides us with the flexibility to support our clients and our business needs and evaluate other appropriate capital deployment opportunities. ","One exciting opportunity was our recent announcement that we have signed an agreement to acquire 37 retail branches in Buffalo and Rochester, New York. The acquisition will strengthen our upstate New York franchise and benefit our local communities, clients and shareholders. ","And finally, earlier this month, we completed our 2012 CCAR submission and look forward to working with our regulators and board to evaluate appropriate opportunities to deploy capital, which could include an increase to our common stock dividend and potential share repurchases. Until the process is completed and we receive a response back from the Federal Reserve, we will not be able to comment further. ","Turning now to Slide 4. This shows the progress that we've made towards our long-term goals. 2011 was clearly an inflection point for our company, and I want to recognize the dedication and hard work of our employees that contributed to our success. And as we look to 2012, we remain confident that despite industry headwinds, we've positioned Key to win in the marketplace and continue to make progress on its financial goals. ","With the foundation of a strong balance sheet and our relationship strategy in place, our outlook for 2012 is built on solid loan growth driven by CNS lending, and I would point out that our growth will continue to be a result of: higher quality, relationship-based loan originations and not purchase loans; our net interest margin that is stable to improving; capitalizing on opportunities to leverage our relationship model with our market sensitive businesses to grow fee income; remaining focused on expense management; continued improvement in credit quality; and while the pace of the improvement will slow, we expect continued progress towards our goals. ","And finally, one of the most important decisions that we'll make over the next several years relates to the way we manage our capital, making sure we remain disciplined and opportunistic in making decisions that enhance shareholder value. ","Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff, who will review our fourth quarter results and provide more detail on our expectations for 2012. Jeff?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Thank you, Beth. Slide 6 provides a summary of the company's fourth quarter 2011 results from continuing operations. As Beth commented on earlier, for the fourth quarter, the company earned a net profit of $0.21 per common share, compared to $0.24 for the third quarter of 2011 and $0.33 for the fourth quarter of 2010. The fourth quarter contained a number of moving parts, including a charge of $24 million related to our obligation under our total return swap on the Visa Class B shares we sold in 2009 and a $10 million loss on the redemption of certain capital securities. I'll touch more on these items, along with expenses and credit quality, in a few minutes. ","Turning to Slide 7. Average total loans increased $656 million during the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of 2011. This represented a 1.4% unannualized increase from the third quarter, and is the first time we have grown through the runoff portfolio since the fourth quarter of 2008. As can be seen on this slide, average balances of commercial, financial and agricultural loans increased from $17.4 billion to $18.3 billion, or approximately 5.4% unannualized, and our utilization rate of CF&A loans improved from 44.4% in the third quarter to 46.3% in the fourth quarter of 2011. ","During the Q&A segment, Chris Gorman, Bill Koehler and Chuck Hyle will be able to provide additional color on the quality of the credits and the spreads we were achieving. However, in a brief comment, we were pleased with the overall quality and the fact that spreads held or expanded during the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter. ","Moving to Slide 8. On the deposit side of the balance sheet, our trend of improving mix of deposits continued during fourth quarter, where we experienced a $1.6 billion or 3.5% unannualized increase in nontime deposits. As noted on this slide, average balances of time deposits declined approximately $900 million during the fourth quarter. And at quarter end, we had approximately $10.4 billion in time deposits outstanding. We have identified, under the highlights section of this slide, the scheduled maturities of our CD book and the rates that apply to these balances. Approximately $6.8 billion of our CDs outstanding at December 31, 2011, mature over the next 4 quarters, and included in these totals are approximately $2.5 billion of higher-costing CDs originated prior to 2009. ","To provide some additional detail on these higher-costing CDs: $238 million at a 4.95% cost mature in the first quarter; $688 million at a 4.57% cost mature in the second quarter; $1,025,000,000 at a 5.06% cost mature in the third quarter; and $529 million at a 4.88% cost mature in the fourth quarter. These repricing opportunities will benefit our net interest margin. ","Turning to Slide 9. We continued to experience an improvement in our asset quality statistics again this quarter. Net charge-offs declined to $105 million or 86 basis points of average loan balances for the fourth quarter. In addition, our nonperforming loans declined to 1.47% of period-end loans at December 31, 2011. Our reserve for loan losses stood at $1 billion or 2.03% of period-end loans and represented 138% coverage of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2011. ","As we have identified on Page 21 in the Appendix of today's materials, criticized loans outstanding declined for the 10th consecutive quarter at December 31, 2011. ","Looking to 2012, we anticipate continued improvement in asset quality with lower levels of nonperforming assets and net charge-offs for the year. Specifically with respect to net charge-offs, we anticipate the amount to be comparable to the second half of 2011 for the next couple of quarters. Regarding provision and reserves, we anticipate the amount provided to be less the net charge-offs in 2012. However, we would anticipate, as loan growth continues, we would migrate during the course of the year for provisions to be closer to the level of net charge-offs. There are a number of variables to consider, of course, including the composition of the loan portfolio at each quarter end throughout the year. ","Turning to Slide 10. For the fourth quarter of 2011, the company's taxable-equivalent net interest income was $563 million and the net interest margin was 3.13%, up from $555 million and 3.09% for the third quarter of 2011. Average earning assets were relatively stable for the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. An improvement in asset and funding mix aided both the net spread and net interest margin for the quarter. ","Our expectation for 2012 is for the net interest margin to show modest improvement and for average earning assets to remain in a range of $71 billion to $73 billion. Helping to offset some of the headwind on the margin from the continuation of the low-rate environment is our ability to reprice maturing CDs throughout the year, as well as scheduled debt maturities. ","As a result of the announcement on January 12 that we will be acquiring 37 branches in Western New York this year, with approximately $3.4 billion in deposits and $400 million in loans, we will use this excess liquidity to simply retire debt and fund loan growth. During the first 6 months of this year, we have approximately $2 billion of debt maturities with approximately $1.4 billion occurring in the second quarter. The all-in cost of the second quarter maturities is approximately 1 month LIBOR plus 200 basis points. ","Our noninterest income was down for the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, primarily for the following factors. First, we recorded a charge to our dealer trading and derivatives income line of $24 million related to our estimated cost associated with the total return swap we entered into in 2009 when we sold our Class B shares of Visa to a third party. On December 23 of last year, Visa announced that they would be funding more of their escrow account for litigation and canceling Class B shares. This action created a charge for us under the total return swap. Next, in the fourth quarter, we incurred a charge of $10 million compared to a gain of $13 million realized in the third quarter when we redeemed certain capital securities. Retirement of the capital securities will benefit our future net interest margin. Also during the fourth quarter, principal investing incurred a loss of $8 million compared to a gain of $34 million during the third quarter. And finally, we had the impact of the new government pricing controls on debit card interchange, which reduced our debit card income by $15 million compared to the third quarter 2011. ","Turning to Slide 11. Expenses increased during the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the third quarter by $25 million to $717 million. During the fourth quarter, we incurred additional expense for professional fees, marketing, personnel, other real estate owned and various other miscellaneous items, which were partially offset by a credit to the reserve for unfunded commitments. Some of these additional costs incurred are typically higher in the fourth quarter and should subside as we get into 2012. ","In 2012, we will continue to focus on cost control efforts as we invest in client-facing positions and technology, continue to optimize our nonclient-facing positions and occupancy costs, expand for marketing where we can deepen client relationships to improve future revenue and implement other efficiency initiatives. ","Slide 12 shows our pretax, pre-provision net revenue and return on average assets. Pre-provision net revenue at $260 million for the fourth quarter was negatively impacted by the $24 million charge for Visa, the $10 million charge for the redemption of certain capital securities and the $8 million loss from principal investing. By contrast, the third quarter benefited from a $13 million gain on the redemption of capital securities and $34 million in gains from principal investing. As we look at pre-provision net revenue for 2012, we anticipate PPNR to be in a range around $280 million to $330 million per quarter. ","And finally, turning to Slide 13. Our tangible common equity ratio and estimated Tier 1 common ratio both remained strong at December 31, 2011, at 9.88% and 11.28%, respectively, placing us in the top quartile of our peer group on these ratios. As Beth commented on, with respect to the capital management, our priorities include reviewing the dividend for possible increase and seeking authority around potential share repurchases. However, until the Fed completes their review under the CCAR process, we are not able to comment further at this time. ","That concludes our remarks. And I will turn the call back over to the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A segment of our call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Todd Hagerman with Sterne Agee.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Beth, I was just wondering if you could just give us a little bit more color, just in terms of the HSBC acquisition. The question is, you guys certainly don't need any more capital. You're flushed with liquidity, and as Jeff mentioned, you're paying off some debt. But I just want to explore a little bit further, just in terms of how you're thinking about that excess capital, the excess liquidity. And again, given the franchise, your execution strategies and so forth, is this another way in terms of how you're looking to redeploy again that kind of the excess capital? I'm just trying to better understand the acquisition relative to kind of your excess liquidity, excess capital position and kind of how you guys are thinking about kind of your capital management over the next couple of years.","Beth E. Mooney","Yes, Todd, that's -- I'd be delighted to take that question. And I think the primary driver of the acquisition of 37 branches in Western New York is to strengthen our franchise in the markets of Buffalo and Rochester. We have talked about how share density and increasing our presence at markets over time helps us acquire clients, increase our revenue and enhance our business operations. So we viewed this, first and foremost, as an opportunity to strengthen our franchise in 2 important markets to Key. Relative to liquidity and capital, the liquidity front, as Jeff mentioned, those deposits of $2.4 billion that we'll close in the second quarter are paired around upcoming debt maturities. So our first use for that will be to simply pay off those maturing debts. And as it relates to capital, we have said we will opportunistically look at acquisitions that enhance our franchise that could potentially use some capital. And given the size of this particular transaction, the amount of capital that it uses is really minimal.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And so to the bigger question then again, most of the companies have been receiving the question this quarter just in terms of as you think about capital, you certainly -- you mentioned kind of the dividend preference certainly. But again, has the kind of priorities shifted at all, just in terms of as you think about capital return and the deployment of capital between dividends, buybacks, selective acquisitions or opportunistic acquisitions?","Beth E. Mooney","Todd, we have -- our priorities around capital have not changed. And I will just reiterate them to kind of set clarity around that because it wasn't included in our remarks. Our primary use of our capital is investing in our businesses and supporting our clients and our loan growth. Second would be our common stocks dividend. Third, we would look to the return of capital in the form of share repurchase to our shareholders. And then fourth, our capital position allows us to be disciplined and opportunistic about ways that we could invest in our franchise to include selectively acquisitions over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erika Penala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to dive in a little bit more on the components of your PPNR guidance for $280 to $330. Jeff, correct me if I'm wrong, but if I add back some of the extraneous items in the fourth quarter, it seems like the PPNR level is $294? Appreciative of the NIM expansion and continued loan growth could get you to the higher end of your range. Could you give us a sense of what a core run rate of expense that is sort of embedded in that PPNR guidance? And also what you're expecting for fee income trends, specifically for Durbin mitigation?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","With respect to the expenses, it would be very similar to our guidance that we gave last year in the first quarter. That last year, we gave in the guidance of around $700 million to $725 million. I would say that would probably be in the -- right around the $700 million level is where we're looking at for expenses. I think on Durbin, the mitigation plans really won't to be in full swing as far as fully implemented until we get into later this year and into 2013. So that's one \"area.\" But we also are seeing very good activity, I think, with regard to our loan syndication activities. You've seen where we've had good loan origination-related activity here in the third and the fourth quarter, and syndication of our loan-related fees have been -- held up quite strongly. I think with respect to the other item, as you're talking about too, the net interest margin, we are guiding for a stronger margin in 2012. And certainly, with, I think, the leverage that we have on the CD and on the debt side that will be something that will be achievable for us.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And the second question I had was some just clarity on your guidance with regard to the reserve. I guess is it -- what guidepost can we -- should we look at? I understand that you mentioned that it's really dependent on the portfolio mix at the end of the quarter. But as far as thinking about the timing of provision, matching charge-offs, are we looking at your coverage to NPLs? Are we looking at allowance versus loans? What sort of a guidepost for us to look at in terms of not looking at credit leverage as a support for EPS in 2012?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Well, there are multiple of factors that we go through. I think in terms of whether you're looking at nonperformers, coverage of nonperformers, it's certainly one that we look at. We also look at what our forward loss expectations are, too. So when you look at the portfolio, we build it up each and every quarter. It's based on probability of default of credits and then loss given default of individual credits. So those are all factored into it. Individual benchmarks to look at, you can use certain things on the consumer side, it\u2019s usually about 12 months forward look plus 1 standard deviation is kind of our view on the consumer side. But commercial credit is much more unique in looking at the individual underlying credits and the quality of the credits. Chuck, anything you want to add to that?","Charles S. Hyle","Yes. It's a little hard to predict these things. It really does all boil down to commercial portfolio composition. And as Jeff and Beth indicated in their comments, I think our criticized classified numbers continue to come down in a pretty good pace. I think they were down 14% in the fourth quarter. And I think another important factor is that the new origination for the quarter continues to improve the overall quality of our commercial portfolio. In other words, the credits that were underwriting and taking on the book are of even better quality. So all those things help move things in the direction that we've seen over the last number of quarters. The kind of ailing [ph] force, of course, is an increase in volume. And that's what we're beginning to predict, and we'll see how that plays out over the next couple of quarters.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Could you let us know what you're providing terms of the new CF&A or C&I growth? How much you're providing for new C&I growth?","Charles S. Hyle","You mean in terms of the reserve?","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes.","Charles S. Hyle","I don't -- we don't disclose -- we don't really look at it that way. We look at it in the -- we look at the total portfolio. We look at what's in the portfolio. We look at correlations within the portfolio. And we do an individual bottoms-up approach. What we do track is the probability to default of the new business that we do. And directionally, that is, as I said earlier, improving the overall tone of the portfolio.","Operator","Next up with Nomura, we have Brian Foran.","Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I guess to start, just to clarify the NIM, the modest improvement, is that from where we are today? Or is that from a full year level?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Brian, that's from where we are today. So we expect to see improvement as we go throughout the year.","Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And then on capital, I know you already addressed it. But one question I get over and over again so figured I'd ask you is, with the capital ratios so high and with the stock value below tangible book, I definitely understand the strategic rationale for improving density in your markets. I definitely understand the attraction of certain shareholders to a recurring dividend. But does the thought process around buybacks change based on the stock price? I guess a lot of people kind of look at that ability to buyback stock below tangible book is almost like a free money trade.","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Brian, this is Jeff again. I think what we all have to be conscious of is the fact that it's not really something that the board and management has directly within their control anymore. So what all of us have to do is go through this process of submitting our plans to the regulators, and then it's reviewed. So our priorities, I think, were laid out as to how we want to employ our capital. And we don't disagree with you that having the opportunity to do some share repurchases at these particular levels would certainly be accretive and attractive to us. But everything has to be balanced in the approach and how we are viewing our overall capital plan going forward.","Beth E. Mooney","And Brian, I would just add, this is Beth, that in our comments about our 2012 CCAR submission, we said that we contemplated both potential increase on our common stock dividend, as well as the potential for share repurchase. And we, like the other banks that participate in the CCAR process, will get further guidance from the Federal Reserve in the middle of March.","Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just one other clarification on the interest earning asset guidance. That includes the HSBC branches? Or that excludes them?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","That would include those particular branches because we have debt maturities that are coming up. So it's a little bit of a liability-driven approach here. We have plenty of liquidity. So we'll improve our mix of our assets as we have loan growth. We'll have cash flows coming off of our investment portfolio that will be reinvested into loans. And then as we get into the second part of 2012, we have the opportunity with the deposits coming back on and continued loan growth to show overall growth in the average earning assets.","Operator","We have now Ken Usdin with Jefferies & Company.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","To follow up on that last point, I was just wondering if you can walk us through, again, that trajectory of earning assets. We understood the 71 to 73 type of number you're thinking about for full year. So I'm assuming that, that includes the acquired branches. At what point do you see that balancing act starting to level out in terms of earning assets bottoming? And within that, how close are we also seeing the exit and the continued ops portfolios getting to a bottom as well?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Yes, okay. So with respect to the average earning assets, we basically have been holding right around the $72 billion mark here the last 2 quarters. And so we are getting towards that bottoming part of that process. I think as we look at the first quarter and the second quarter, we have those debt maturities. I think that would be where we would have the kind of that low part of that particular range. And then as we get into the third and the fourth quarter, we'll be building at that particular point in time. So that's how I would try to look at it from an asset -- average asset perspective.","Kenneth M. Usdin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And within it, on the -- are you changing -- because you're going to be focusing on letting some of those long-term maturities roll off, any -- can you talk to us about any different change in your deposit strategy here? Because obviously, the core deposits, you've been letting the higher-cost CDs run off. We haven't seen a lot of core deposit growth in the last few quarters. So could you talk about any changes you're making there and also how much leeway you have to continue to pull down pricing aside from the obvious CD rollover?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Yes. Well, I'll ask Bill to comment in just a second on the overall deposit strategy. But I think in terms as you look at CDs rolling off, that's certainly beneficial to us. We have sufficient liquidity. And I think the market right now, overall, has been very, very strong. I would point out the fact that what we have seen is over a $4 billion increase in deposits in the -- in terms of the noninterest-bearing deposits year-over-year. So we have seen very strong flows on our noninterest-bearing deposits. And of course, clients are using those deposits at this point in time to offset certain deposit service charges on the annualized accounts that we have out there. But overall, it hasn't made sense for us or others in the industry to bid up for deposits at a time when loan demand has been relatively soft throughout the 2011 that we did see some improvement here as we got into the latter half and we expect that to continue into '12. One point I would make on those exit portfolios, cause you asked that question, too, those are running down much more slowly at this particular point in time. And so becoming much more problematic as you look at the amortization of those. And they'll probably in that $200 million to maybe $250 million going forward. And we were able to grow through those, not only on an endpoint basis, ending balance basis, but also on an average balance basis during the fourth quarter. Bill, do you want to comment?","William R. Koehler","Sure. The one thing I would say on deposits, as we look at our rate shops, of course, every market is different. But we think we're sort of at the midpoint, maybe on the lower end of the midpoint, within our markets on the any given day. And our deposits still continue to grow. We think that's an indication of our relationship strategy and the intermediation that's happening in the market and applied to quality. So we feel good about that aspect of the growth in our deposits.","Operator","We'll now go to Mike Turner with Compass Point.","Michael Turner","On the principal investing losses in the quarter, I know that's a very volatile line item. You've kind of averaged around $20 million a quarter up through the third quarter. Can you maybe talk about what those losses were comprised of? And how you think about that business going forward?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Well, certainly under Dodd-Frank, we think about that business going away going forward because a number of the individuals that used to be a part of the company were basically spun off here, left the company in the second quarter of this year and are still managing those particular funds. But they\u2019ve got their own operation at this point in time. Most of the overall balances that we have in principal investing, which is approximately $700 million, $500 million of which are funds and $200 million of which are direct investments. And they both continue to pay down. So we saw realization of sales in the fourth quarter of this year. Now some of the -- as we look at this, it is choppy and volatile. And I would expect that we would see that to continue going forward. It's very difficult for me to predict exactly where it's going to come out on any given quarter because of the underlying investments and how they may or may not perform.","Operator","Next up with Morgan Stanley, we have Ken Zerbe.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just going back to the reserve a little bit. Obviously, we've heard your comments about provisioning matching charge-offs a little later in the year. Have you -- or can you share any kind of discussions with the regulators or the SEC or anyone who cares about your reserve ratio in terms of what level is appropriate? Because you're still at 2% reserves, seems very high. But we've been releasing -- you've been releasing a big commentary that would suggest that the pace of reserve release excluding loan growth, of course, is going to slow, if not kind of stop? So we're trying to know how much of your reserve ratio depends on your model factors versus sort of external regulator factors?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Well, the one comment -- this is Jeff, and then Chuck will comment also on this. But I think you have to look at the fact that we reserves set up for specific individual loans to the extent those loans get resolved. Those reserves are no longer necessary. And so that's what we're seeing some of that particular action as nonperforming loans continue to go down. There were specific reserves assigned to them, and those particular reserves get released. I think the overall pause is migration of the book, and it's difficult to tell you how long that will continue before it just becomes a stabilization and then you start getting into more of a factor involving just normal loan growth. Even if it's at the same existing credit quality, we'll require additional reserves to be taken at that particular point in time for that particular production. But I think what I wanted to convey in the initial comments were that we still expect to see the reserve come down during the course of 2012. However, with the pace of which it came down in 2011, which resulted in an overall credit to the provision expense for the year, we do not expect that in 2012 at this particular point in time. And in fact, as we migrate towards the year, we expect to see provision expense increase. But it still may not be. I can't tell you specifically if it will equal net charge-offs at that particular point in time.","Charles S. Hyle","Ken, this is Chuck Hyle. I'll just add 1 or 2 comments to Jeff's. And one is that, as we said before, this process is a bottoms-up commercial loan by commercial loan analysis that we do every quarter. It's quite rigorous and it's quite detailed. And that's basically every quarter we do this. And that's what drives -- ultimately drives the allowance. And while we look at multiple of factors, that is the core of the analysis that we do. I would say the commercial book -- we've seen terrific progress on the commercial book over the last 2 years. And as we've said over the last quarter or so, I think that progress, the reduction in bad loans and so forth, is kind of reaching a more normalized state. But on the consumer side, while we've seen some progress, it hasn't been dramatic progress. And I think that we will not see incremental progress on a consumer side of the book until we see better underlying economic news, particularly the unemployment rate. And while our consumer book never deteriorated very dramatically during the cycle, the improvement, I think, the pace of that improvement has been slow. So I think there are slightly different stories in those 2 books. We'll see how they play out during the quarter. And again, as we've said earlier, the volume that we create over the next couple of quarters will have an impact on the reserves as well. But it's a very rigorous, very kind of mathematical process that we go through as we establish our reserves.","Operator","Next up, we have Chris Mutascio with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I wanted to talk about the guidance a little bit if I could. Your pretax pre-provision range, the high end of that range, is essentially what you did in all of 2011, that $1.3 billion. And then you mentioned that your provision expense that you've been talking about, pretty much has nowhere to go but up. If we can extrapolate that out from an operating perspective, in other words, your pretax pre-provision income, then taking out the provision expense, it seems to me that your operating income, or your pretax income, had a fair amount of degradation to happen and to occur in 2012. What is the offset to that? Were your tax rate stay fairly low? Is it share buybacks? Or do you expect EPS to actually flatten out and turned down because of provision impact in 2012?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Well, this is Jeff Weeden again. I think if you look at the consensus out there in the street, you would see that the estimates for 2012 would actually be below the 2011 earnings of the company. And I think you summarized it in the sense that with the negative provision in 2011, having a positive provision in 2012 wouldn't automatically create some degree of headwinds there. I think what we overcome over time is really with the continued loan growth and margin expansion and also being able to offset some of the other headwinds that we have with respect to the debit card fee income of related items. So it is from the perspective as you described it. I mean, I think we've given pretty specific guidance on the range of pre-provision profitability. We've given pretty specific guidance, even with respect to charge-offs for the next couple of quarters and provision expense remaining below that, but I can't tell you exactly how much below it will be until we actually go through the end of each and every quarter. Tax rates will remain relatively comparable. So I think in tax terms, the tax rates can change depending upon the income in any given quarter. But factor in a normal tax rate and then we apply tax credits against that, that we originate on an ongoing basis, and that has a reduction -- natural reduction, to the overall effective tax rate.","Operator","Next up, we'll go to Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a question in terms of the balance sheet. And you noted that the securities portfolio available for sale is down about 8%, but the securities that you're holding to maturity are actually up by a similar amount of the AFS securities going down. Could you just give us a little more color as to what you're longer-term thinking is for those 2 line items? And I noticed that the securities that you're holding to maturity have somewhat lower yields on those. And if you could just add some color on that as well, that would be helpful.","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Yes. I'll take the lower yield right away because those where our new originations are going into. So the new coupons are just of lower than the overall portfolio, just given the nature of the market today. With respect to the overall size of the portfolio, it will, in all likelihood, come down as we have loans that we're funding as part of the change in the overall asset mix. We've had a higher level of investment securities during the last couple of years as we have basically had this part of liquidity. And so as liabilities have been repricing, that's been coming out of that particular area. Now that we've reached kind of the floor on some of the liability side of the equation on the deposits, we still have some debts maturing. But as we look at it, we're using the cash flows coming off of the investment portfolio. We'll fund new loan growth for the overall company, and that will just be an improvement in the asset mix itself and benefit the margin.","Operator","Next with Deutsche Bank, we'll go to Matt O'Connor.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered, at this point, here. But just as we think about the rating agencies and what they're looking to see from you guys to get an upgrade, any thoughts on that? I think you still have some deposits in the commercial mortgage servicing business that could come back if you're catching upgrade. And obviously, that can help on the funding mix even more so.","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Yes.","Beth E. Mooney","Matt, I would just say, overall, obviously, as S&P did their review of the regional banks last year, they saw to move Key to a positive outlook that we're pleased to see. And obviously, Moody's has looked at the bank arena. And Jeff can comment more specifically on some of the components, but I think there is an overall perception within Moody's related to the earnings power of our industry in this particular economic regulatory and interest rate environment. So we continue to look to the strength of our balance sheet, the strength of our capital ratios and the things that we have done to basically position our company. And I think the rating agencies will continue to monitor that for Key, as well as the industry over time. And I would let Jeff comment more fully on Moody's.","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Yes. I think in terms of capital reserves, asset quality, we're all -- the company is in very good shape. I think what it really is looking at is just to continue to show improvement here in the future on pre-provision profitability of the company. So we feel good about the direction that we're headed as a company. But I cannot predict when any particular rating action may take place. So if it does, it is positive for us. But even at our current ratings, we are in, I think, a relatively good shape.","Operator","We'll go next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I've got a multipart question for Jeff and Beth. The first is, how do you guys -- what is your cost of capital? What kind of number have you guys come up with for that number? And second, if you look at the new Basel III Tier 1 common ratios that everybody will be managing to, and if we assume your SIFI buffer will be 50 basis points because you're a national SIFI and the Fed seems to be saying that there's going to be a modest SIFI buffer for the national SIFIs. Where are you guys comfortable carrying your Tier 1 common ratio? I assume it's going to be something above that. And then finally, Beth, philosophically, if you guys have capital that stays above 10% or so, and again I know the regulators are very influential on this but this is more of a philosophical question. Would you be comfortable in giving back to shareholders more than 100% of your earnings? Not necessarily this year, of course, but philosophically, with that excess capital, if there is really no real great growth opportunities, would you guys give it back in the forms of dividends and stock buybacks in excess of any year as current earnings?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Okay. Gerard, on the cost of capital, I think you can go out and you can look at any number of different players that are out there and compute the cost of capital, given the current rate environment and the betas out there, whether it's around 10% or something along those particular lines. With respect to Tier 1 common and Basel III, I think in this regard, we do have to wait to see specifically what comes out of the SIFI buffers, if any, and the requirements of those rules. I guess we were hopeful that they would have been out by now, to begin to see that and formulate it. But we expect those out in the not-too-distant future. With respect to how well-managed capital, we'll take that all into account. Does that mean that -- I think as you look at the capital composition has changed also. So we have not only look at Tier 1 common, but you have to look at Tier 1 in total capital, what those requirements are. And so with that in mind, more -- does it end up being a Tier 1 common level that's closer to a 9%, 9.5%, 10%? We don't really know yet at this point in time. Where we are right now at the end of the year on a Basel I basis was a Tier 1 common of around 11.28%, 11.3%. And we're in very good shape on that. So Beth, do you want to comment on the...","Beth E. Mooney","Yes, Gerard. I would say that clearly on the philosophical point of view, our priorities are driven by the view of what creates the most value for our shareholders. And we've talked about obviously having capital support, our organic growth, as well as the growth that's required for our clients, dividends, share repurchase and then excess capital available under the right circumstances and in a disciplined way for other opportunities that could include acquisition. Embedded in that is our philosophy. And clearly, at any point in time, you're right. How we utilize capital is being governed by the CCAR process in conjunction with the Federal Reserve. And at current share prices, share repurchase would be important -- would be attractive to shareholders because that return of capital would be enhancing to their value. So in conjunction with our board and our regulators, we will look at that each and every year. And in my comments, I used the word some of the most important decisions we will make as a board and management team, in conjunction with our regulators in the coming years, is how do we use that capital in a disciplined way that creates franchise and shareholder value. So clearly, continuing to look at those 4 priorities in each and every year against those opportunities, against what's the right thing to do to make sure we're taking care of our shareholders, is top of mind of the board and management in conjunction with our regulators.","Operator","Next up, we have, pardon me, Steve Scinicariello with UBS Securities.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just want to follow up on the additional opportunities that you might see similar to the HSBC branches. And as it relates to kind of optimizing your franchise, I mean, that was such a great move. And I'm just curious as to how many other types of opportunities you might see kind of across the franchise. And even if you're not seeing them, what other areas, maybe across your geographics franchise, would you like to do those kinds of deals?","Beth E. Mooney","Steve, this is Beth, and I would say that additional opportunities are hard to predict because these tend to come along for reasons that aren't necessarily something that you can plan or anticipate has to do with the circumstances of an organization that would be in a position to look to sell something or sell a whole bank. We have said in the past that we believe we can create value in a disciplined way by looking at the breath of our geographic markets and where appropriate if opportunities were to come along that would allow us to do a fill-in acquisition that would enhance our market presence, would strengthen our ability to leverage our business model, acquire clients and utilize the capabilities of our corporate and community banks, that again was the word discipline being operative in that sentence, that we would look at those. And across our franchise, there could be a variety of areas and opportunities in that regard. So I appreciate your comment about a recent announcement as being attractive. I think that is indicative of the kind of the things that we are trying to think about to strengthen and enhance our franchise. And with that, I know Bill Koehler, our President of Corporate -- Community Bank, might have some additional thoughts about how he looks at our various geographies.","William R. Koehler","I will make 2 comments. The first is, we have benefited from balance and diversification across all our geographies. So we want to take advantage of that and recognize it as so. The other point I would make relating to our branch network is, we can't wait for those opportunities. We have opportunities to rationalize and optimize our existing branch network, and we're looking at those. Whereas in 2011, we built 39 or 40 branches. This year, we will build more like half that many. And we will shift the focus as well, towards relocations and consolidations in order to reposition as best we can our branch footprint to more attractive trade areas, so we can find other opportunities to gain efficiencies and productivity.","Operator","And next up with JP Morgan, we have Steven Alexopoulos.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to start looking at the $1.5 billion of C&I loan growth. Were you guys active in buying loans during the quarter, potentially from Euro banks?","Christopher Marrott Gorman","Steve, it's Chris Gorman speaking. Just a couple of quick comments. The answer is no. We were active in originating deals, and in fact, distributing them. But we -- all of it is really organic growth. And we've gone about the business of really targeting who we want to do business with. For example, in our KeyBank Capital Markets group, we grew our customer base by 10%. But that 10% had twice as much in terms of fee income. And as Chuck Hyle mentioned earlier, the weighted average probability of default was significantly below that, which resides in the portfolio. So it was truly targeted organic growth that we experienced and we expect to continue to experience as we go forward.","Beth E. Mooney","And Steve, this is Beth. One of the things I underscored in our opening remarks when I've shared some of the priorities and thoughts around 2012 was critical to our success, as well as our business plan, is continued growth in that position and deepening of relationships in our commercial, industrial and agricultural loan book and that, that will be through the execution of our relationship strategy and not purchased loans.

Long - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Thinking about the loan growth, obviously, your expectations are for continued loan growth here. But relative to the fourth quarter, obviously, it was quite strong. Is there any seasonality we need to think about here in the fourth quarter? And also, were there any accelerated depreciation tax advantages some of your clients may have taken here at the end of the year that would have run that fourth quarter number a bit higher?","Christopher Marrott Gorman","David, it's Chris. A couple of things there. We always, on a seasonal basis, particularly in our leasing business, do, in fact, have an increase in the fourth quarter. So there is some seasonality to it. In addition to that, there were some specific things in the fourth quarter, for example, where we were bridging transactions, where we're doing the takeout. In one case to Fannie and Freddie and another to a consortium of insurance companies we're going to do a private placement. So A, there is some seasonality to it. B, on top of the seasonality, there was some transaction-specific activity in the fourth quarter that will not duplicate itself as we roll forward into 2012.","Beth E. Mooney","And David, I would just add that pipelines across our businesses continue to be strong. Levels of new business volume originations are increasing. But in all things, there is seasonality and there are timing cases. So as we think about 2012, we feel good about continued loan growth. But in any given quarter, the level of growth, such as we had in the fourth quarter, is often influenced by other factors.","Operator","We'll take Paul Miller from FBR Capital Markets.","Kevin Barker - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","This is Kevin Barker filling in for Paul Miller. I just have a quick question and a follow-up on the commercial loan growth. Do you find that a lot of the loan growth coming from that side is being invited into more syndications with Euro banks exiting a lot of the market?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","So Kevin, it's Chris again. A couple of things. There is no question that the exiting of the European banks has had an impact on the entire market. So we are clearly seeing that. And you're also seeing on the supply side, if we go back, for example, in the real estate business, 5 years ago, the CMBS market was a $300 billion market. Last year, it was a $30 billion market. This year, I think it's going to be a $25 million or $35 billion market. And there is a wall of refinancing. So there are some issues on the supply side that are driving our ability and other people's ability to grow loans. Having said that, our growth was not, in fact, driven by buying into syndications and filling out where the European banks used to be. As we said earlier, it was really lead business. We lead 70 -- we're focused on the middle market obviously, but we lead 70% of the deals we're involved with.","Operator","That's all the time we have for questions. I'll turn everything back over to Ms. Mooney for any further or concluding comments.","Beth E. Mooney","Thank you, Operator. And again, we'd like to thank everyone for taking time from their schedule to participate in our call today. And if you have any follow-up questions, you can direct them to our Investor Relations team, Vern Patterson or Kelly Lambert, at the phone number of (216) 689-3133. And for today, that concludes our remarks.","Operator","Once again, everyone, this will conclude today's program. We thank you for joining us. Please enjoy the rest of your day."],"12322":["KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) Q1 2013 Earnings Call April 18, 2013  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Beth E.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Beth Mooney, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead.","Beth E. Mooney","Thank you, operator, and good morning, and let me add my welcome to KeyCorp's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me for today's presentation is Jeff Weeden, our Chief Financial Officer. And available for the Q&A portion of the call are the leaders of Key Corporate Bank and Key Community Bank, Chris Gorman and Bill Koehler. Also joining us for the Q&A discussion, our Chief Risk Officer, Bill Hartmann; and our Treasurer, Joe Vayda.","Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments, as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call today.","Slide 3 shows some of the highlights of our first quarter results. There are 3 important takeaways this quarter.","First, our business model is producing results and positions us well in the current environment and beyond.","Second, we are becoming a more efficient company, and our expense initiative continues to show traction and gain momentum.","And third, our shareholders are benefiting from our disciplined approach to capital management.","Let me start with our business model. In the current environment of economic uncertainty and excess liquidity, we are seeing more competition for lending opportunities. In some cases, this is leading to more aggressive behavior from competitors, be it on price, terms or other structural considerations. At Key, we have remained disciplined, and we are relying on our value-added, relationship-based approach to win new business, expand relationships with existing clients and generate robust fee income to go with our strong C&I performance. We are confident that we are well positioned to grow and take share in our targeted markets.","In the first quarter, average loan balances were up 6% from the same quarter last year. And within that, the exit portfolio continued to run off and average C&I loans grew 16%.","While our loan growth has been a positive story, we did see clients remain cautious in regards to the overall strength of the economy, particularly towards the end of the quarter.","Second, on efficiency. We continue to deliver on our commitment to reduce expenses and move our efficiency ratio to the 60% to 65% range. Through the first quarter, we have realized annualized run rate savings of $105 million against our targeted goal of $200 million in expense savings. It is our expectation that we will continue to incur costs related to our initiative, especially in the first half of the year, and we would expect this to impact our second quarter expense levels. Overall, our plans to deliver these savings are right on track, and by the first quarter of next year, we expect to be within our targeted efficiency range.","And it's important to note that this is not an endpoint, but an important milestone for Key. We are already working hard to identify new revenue and expense opportunities that can improve our efficiency ratio even further and deliver positive operating leverage.","And third, as we have said before, how we deploy our capital will be one of the most important decisions we make. As part of our disciplined approach to capital management, we have continued to actively manage our businesses to focus on our best growth opportunities. We also identify businesses that do not fit our relationship-based strategy and would not be the best place to continue to make ongoing investments.","And as an example, in the first quarter, we announced the sale of Victory Capital Management, and we are requesting a no objection from our regulators to return the net after-tax gain to our shareholders through share repurchase.","In addition to actively managing our business portfolio, we repurchased $65 million in common shares in the first quarter. And over the next 4 quarters, we expect to return a significant portion of our net income to shareholders through the capital actions we announced last month at the conclusion of the CCAR process. Our plan, which received no objection from the Federal Reserve, included a stock repurchase program of up to $426 million, which our board has approved, and a 10% increase in the quarterly common stock dividend, which the board will consider at its regular May meeting.","Slide 4 highlights our 2013 priorities, which have been consistent areas of focus. They include continuing to leverage our business model, taking advantage of our competitive position in the market, improving our efficiency and remaining disciplined in the way we manage our capital. We believe that by executing on these priorities, we can continue to grow, take share and deliver long-term value to our shareholders.","Now let me turn the presentation over to Jeff for some details on our first quarter results. Jeff?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Thank you, Beth. Slide 6 provides a summary of the company's first quarter 2013 results from continuing operations.","During the first quarter, and for all periods presented, we moved Victory Capital Management to discontinued operations due to the pending sale, which is scheduled for the third quarter.","As we reported this morning, the company earned a net profit from continuing operations of $0.21 per common share for the first quarter compared to $0.20 for both the fourth quarter and the first quarters of 2012.","Before moving to the more detailed discussion surrounding the quarterly results on the following slides, I would note that seasonality does come into play when looking at our first quarter versus our fourth quarter, and as a result, we will also make reference, when appropriate, to the same period last year for comparison purposes.","Now turning to Slide 7. Average total loans for the first quarter were up $767 million or 1.5% unannualized compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. And compared to the first quarter of 2012, average total loans were up $3.2 billion or 6.5%.","During the first quarter of 2013, commercial clients were somewhat cautious following the very strong demand we experienced in the fourth quarter of last year. We also saw normal seasonal activity with respect to consumer lending in the first quarter as consumers paid down their debt they drew on last year, along with normal amortization of loans in our exit portfolios.","As Chris Gorman and Bill Koehler can comment on later, our commercial loan pipeline still remains solid, and we are fully engaged in our spring borrowing campaign on the consumer side.","Last quarter, we provided an outlook of the average total loan growth for 2013 in the mid to upper single-digit area. And today, we still anticipate average total loan growth for the year in the mid single-digit area, led by strong commercial lending.","Continuing to Slide 8. On the liability side of the balance sheet, average deposits, excluding foreign branch balances, were up $120 million from the fourth quarter and up $4.3 billion from 1 year ago. During the first quarter, we believe we experienced the same trend as the industry, with deposits declining in January and then coming back in the latter part of the quarter. Over the past year, our mix of deposits has significantly changed, with CDs declining and lower-cost transaction accounts increasing over 14% from 1 year ago. As a result, our deposit costs declined to 29 basis points for the first quarter of 2013.","Turning to Slide 9. For the first quarter of 2013, the company's net interest margin was 3.24% compared to 3.37% for the fourth quarter and 3.16% for the first quarter of 2012. The net interest margin declined more than expected during the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2012.","Back in January, during our fourth quarter earnings call, we anticipated the margin declining to the 3.30% area for the first quarter as a result of approximately 4 basis points of onetime benefits in our fourth quarter numbers and normal downward repricing pressure on assets.","Our actual margin declined to 3.24% as a result of not only these anticipated items, but also from higher-than-expected levels of short-term investment securities resulting from softer loan demand than anticipated, higher levels of deposits and a change in mix of funding.","We deployed some of this excess liquidity in the form of added investment securities late in the quarter, which should benefit net interest income next quarter, but this will continue to place some degree of pressure on the net interest margin.","Taxable equivalent net interest income was $589 million for the first quarter compared to $607 million for the fourth quarter and $559 million for the first quarter 1 year ago.","Compared to the first quarter of last year, net interest income increased $30 million or 5.4% due to both growth in average earning assets and an improvement in the net interest margin as funding costs declined.","Compared to the fourth quarter, net interest income declined $18 million due to 2 fewer accrual days and a decline in the net interest margin from asset repricing and higher levels of short-term investments, more than offsetting the overall increase in average earning assets.","Our current expectation, given the outlook for little change in interest rates, is for the net interest margin to trend lower from the first quarter level throughout 2013. We anticipate the net interest margin to decline by approximately 4 to 7 basis points in the second quarter and continue with modest pressure in the 1 to 3 basis point area per quarter in the second half of the year.","We do have $750 million of debt maturing in May, with some additional benefit coming from CD repricing. However, we also recognize that asset yields remain under pressure, and we have higher levels of liquidity as clients remain cautious in committing their capital.","We anticipate average earning assets for the balance of 2013 to be in the range of $74 billion to $76 billion.","Non-interest income in the first quarter was $425 million, down from $439 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 and $442 million in the first quarter of last year. The first quarter is typically down from the fourth quarter due to seasonal factors, as well as the strong performance we experienced in the fourth quarter of last year.","Compared to the first quarter of 2012, investment banking and debt placement fees are up 30%, as we continue to do more business with our commercial clients and win market share. Cards and payments income is up 28% compared to the same period 1 year ago, reflecting our reentry into credit cards during the third quarter of last year. I would also note, last year's first quarter, there were higher gains from principal investing, as well as we benefited from the early termination of a leveraged lease, which resulted in the recognition of a $20 million gain.","Turning to Slide 10. Non-interest expense for the first quarter of 2013 decreased to $681 million, an improvement of $53 million from the fourth quarter and better than our expectations.","Compared to the same period last year, expenses increased $2 million, and included in the current period expense was an $11 million increase in amortization expense, plus other costs associated with our acquisitions completed in the third quarter of last year.","Overall, we are seeing the benefits from our expense initiative come through to the bottom line. As Beth commented on earlier, we have captured approximately $105 million in annualized savings as of March 31, 2013.","We expect expenses to be higher in the second quarter as we close 33 more branches and continue with our other expense initiatives. In the first quarter, we incurred approximately $15 million of expenses associated with Fit for Growth. In the second quarter, we expect these costs to increase to the $34 million to $38 million range as we move forward aggressively with our implementation plans. In addition, we expect to incur additional expenses from marketing associated with our spring borrowing campaign, and also for contract programming as we continue to implement new technologies.","In total, we anticipate expenses for the second quarter of 2013 to be in the range of $720 million to $730 million and then decline to the $680 million to $700 million range by the fourth quarter of 2013. Included in this forecast are charges related to Fit for Growth, however, at a much lower level than those anticipated in the second quarter.","Turning to Slide 11. Our net charge-offs declined to $49 million or 38 basis points of average total loans in the first quarter of 2013. Total commercial net charge-offs were $5 million or 6 basis points of gross charge-offs, as gross charge-offs declined and recoveries remained strong. The breakdown of asset quality by loan portfolio is shown on Slide 16 in the appendix. We anticipate that net charge-offs will remain at or below the lower end of our targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points for the balance of the current year and for provision expense to be near this same level.","At March 31, 2013, our reserve for loan losses represented 1.70% of period-end loans and 137% coverage of nonperforming loans.","And turning to Slide 12, our tangible common equity ratio and estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio both remained strong at March 31, 2013, at 10.24% and 11.39%, respectively. We have also updated our estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio based on the Fed's NPR on a fully implemented basis at March 31, 2013, to be 10.28%.","During the first quarter, we repurchased 6.8 million shares of our common stock at an average cost of $9.56 per share and reissued 3.6 million shares for employee benefit plans. These actions completed our 2012 CCAR activities.","As Beth mentioned, our 2013 capital plan includes an increase in our common share repurchase authorization for the next 4 quarters to $426 million. In addition, our plan includes a 10% increase in our common dividend to 5.5% -- $0.055 per share beginning in the second quarter, which management will recommend to the board next month at their -- our scheduled meeting. And we are working with our regulators to obtain a non-objection to the use of the estimated $145 million to $155 million net gain from the pending sale of Victory Capital Management to repurchase additional common shares in the open market. The determination of the gain and the closing are subject to certain terms and conditions of the sales contract. The process remains on track for a third quarter closing.","That concludes our remarks, and now we'll turn the call back over to the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A segment of our call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Let's begin with Mr. Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just within the net interest margin, as we look at some of the moving pieces, the commercial loan yields actually seem to be holding up quite well versus some pressure elsewhere, and I'm just wondering if you can elaborate on that in terms of what you're seeing in the marketplace and how they're kind of relatively stable or even up a basis point quarter-to-quarter.","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Matt, this is Jeff. I'll comment a little bit about some of the geography in the margin, and then Chris and Bill can comment more fully on what they're seeing in the overall marketplace. In the first quarter, we've redirected some of the interest rate swaps, and so that had a positive benefit on the commercial C&I loan yields. And so that added approximately 11 basis points to that particular yield. I think where you see it come out of is really down on the other consumer loans. That particular yield dropped. I think a better way to look at it is looking at it from a -- the overall yield perspective on total loans. Total loans were down about 11 basis points for the current quarter. And Bill and Chris, you want to talk on it?","Christopher Marrott Gorman","Sure. Matt, it's Chris. You're correct. Our spreads, we've been very pleased that our spreads have really held in nicely. But make no mistake, as Beth mentioned in her initial remarks, there is a fair amount of pressure out there from a structural perspective and from a pricing perspective. And what's really going on is there's really an imbalance in kind of the supply-demand. If you look at -- the loan market has had record inflows of new money. There's been more CLO issuance in the first quarter than all year in 2012. There's been 3 mid-market CLOs that have been raised. So it's something we're watching very closely. We've been pleased that our relationship strategy has enabled us to continue to gain clients. And our strategy is going to be, going forward, what it's been, and we'll continue to do what we need to do to take share. Keep in mind, a lot of our business -- half of our business is non-interest income, so we have some other levers that we can pull. And on that front, if we choose to, we can act as agent instead of principal, which we think gives us a fair amount of flexibility. And the other thing we're focused on a lot here at Key is -- on this, very focused, who we want to do business with in terms of garnering new clients, but doing more with our existing clients. So we feel like we fared pretty well to date. But make no mistake, there is a -- there's a supply-demand imbalance out there.","William R. Koehler","And Matt, this is Bill. The only thing I would add to that is where we see the most competition are some of the strongest credits where -- that are likely to be fully funded, so people who are looking to put their excess deposits to work. Again, where we are -- where we can find opportunities like that, but within the context of a broader relationship strategy, we will compete as well as anyone. At the same time, if it's just an asset play, that's not the strategy we're trying to employ.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just separately, quickly, Jeff, the timing of when you would expect to hear back regarding the buybacks of the Victory relay gain?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","The timing kind of remains open at this particular point in time. We may not hear back until the actual closing of the transaction, which is scheduled for the third quarter. So as soon as we hear something, Matt, we'll be sure to communicate that.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So last quarter, you were looking for $150 million to $200 million of cost saves for this year, with most of that realized in the second half of the year. And now we're a quarter later and you've taken the range to the upper end and half the cost saves are already in the run rate. Can you help us think about what's driving this incremental cost save opportunity to the upper end so quickly? And the timing seems to be coming in a bit faster than expected.","Beth E. Mooney","This is Beth. I'll go ahead and answer that. And what I will tell you is we did, as we came into the quarter, firm up our expectations that we would reach the higher end of our range of -- at $200 million and announced that, within the quarter, that we had gone to the high end of the range. That was a combination of, as we announced at the end of the year, that we had realized $60 million worth of run rate savings and had a conscious effort to try and accelerate the timing of the benefits for improved performance. And within the first quarter, we garnered an additional $45 million worth of run rate savings, so we did get ourselves halfway to the goal as it were through the first quarter. A variety of things happened, one was just concerted effort to accelerate timing. We have had success in our vendor and spend management areas, both within contract renegotiations, as well as just generally recasting how we use them. I will tell you that we have gone heavily after process improvement and looking at more efficiently how we can support our growing business demand. We've talked about variabilizing our expense base and other things. And then I would tell you that is, in all things, just focused attention brings improvement across a multiple of areas. As we go through the balance of the year, we have, in the second quarter, accelerated for our branch closures, will be happening in the second quarter and several other big saving moves. So these are opportunities that we have realized and gave us more confidence on the upper end of our range and continue to position us for the 60% to 65% commitment by Q1 '14.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And Beth, if I could ask a follow-up, was the sale of Victory part of a broad-based sale evaluation of all the business lines? Or was that just a one-off situation?","Beth E. Mooney","I would describe it as a asset within our company that we have questioned its strategic fit with our relationship strategy over the last several years. And as we looked at its client base, which is largely mandated institutional investors, it did not really fit with our client base and there was not a lot of linkage to what we are doing in terms of assets under management and our private bank. So we determined that we were not the best owner for that asset and not the best owner to continue to invest in that asset for its own growth. So we made a strategic decision, as we look at our mix of businesses, that Victory was a good one to sell, and with step one, announcing that, and then that, as we said, created an opportunity to request an additional return of that net after-tax gain to our shareholders.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Keith Murray with Nomura.","Keith Murray - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Can you just talk on the revenue opportunity side? I mean, you guys have plenty of capital. You're making progress on expenses. It just seems like, to get the returns in the place that you need them, are there revenue opportunities that we're not seeing?","Christopher Marrott Gorman","Yes, Keith, this is Chris. We're seeing a lot of revenue opportunities, actually. Our business, as Beth pointed out, very, very relationship-focused. And whereas Victory, we couldn't leverage the relationships because consultants controlled it or our clients no longer had defined pension plans, there are a lot of adjacencies that we've, frankly, been looking at. And there's a fair amount of deal flow externally right now that we've been looking at. So that's sort of to augment our whole relationship strategy. The other areas where we've been investing heavily with a fair amount of success is people. We feel like we have a unique business model that's underleveraged. And we've been hiring senior-level people that can help us leverage our platform. And we've hired 85 or so such people since the beginning of 2010. And we do a lot of metrics around here, and those have been very accretive. The other 2 areas where we've been investing and will continue to invest, one is in our payments business, what we call enterprise commercial payments. As you know, that's a very sticky business. That's a business that enables us to talk to our clients all the time. Mid-market companies are very much looking for not just the ability to execute, but information about their working capital. We've made some significant investments in that area. And then lastly is health care. One of the things that we're really proud of is we've put together, along with the Community Bank, really a bank-wide industry group focused on facilities-based health care. And we've invested a lot. We have -- right now, we already have a lot of clients. We've rationalized those clients, and we've invested in some more talent and some specific product offerings around facilities-based health care.","William R. Koehler","And Keith, this is Bill. I would add a couple other items. Our past calls and comments about our investment in credit card, that's a new and emerging opportunity that we're really excited about. Client penetration is improving. New account growth is improving. We have opportunity to focus on the utilization and activation of those cards as we move forward. And we see a lot of opportunity to improve our penetration over time in the client base. And then we are very pleased with the momentum we're building in our private banking business. As we see our value proposition in working very actively with middle-market companies, not only within the Community Bank, but also privately held and publicly held companies in the corporate bank, we think there's an opportunity to cross-sell that product in a very impactful way. And our clients are telling us they like the combination of the ability to talk to them about their commercial needs as well as their personal investment needs \"at the same time.\" And we think that's very relevant and very impactful, and we're -- that's what our clients are telling us.","Keith Murray - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then just switching gears to the stress test process. One, was there any surprises in the process this year as you went through it? And then two, can you guys see a period where you can feel comfortable asking for more than 100% of net income as a capital return, given your high starting point?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Well, I think the -- Keith, this is Jeff. I think, in terms of the overall process, that both sides are learning and that I think we are getting better at our stress testing and our modeling capabilities and being able to really fully understand the balance sheet, the flows of the balance sheet, et cetera, under various stressed environments. So from a perspective, I wouldn't say there were any major surprises on our part as we went through 2013's stress test process. I think the other part of your question, I think the future is still something that we'll have to see play out over time, and I don't think we can make a representation at this point in time about future capital actions. That's something that we will discuss, obviously, with our Board of Directors and go through also with our regulators.","Beth E. Mooney","And Keith, this is Beth. I would just add that we were satisfied with our outcome of the submission of our CCAR this year. We have the opportunity to increase our dividends, 10%, share repurchase by 24%. We are making the request for the gain on Victory Capital. So this continues to be a priority of ours, to manage our capital in a way that includes a return to our shareholders.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Craig Siegenthaler with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Nicholas Karzon - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is actually Nick Karzon standing in for Craig this morning. I guess, the first question, on the non-interest-bearing deposits, it looks like there was an 8% decline quarter-over-quarter. And I was wondering if there is some seasonal volatility there, or if tag or something else was in play?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Yes, there is definite seasonal volatility that -- in that particular line item. We had both plants that borrowed in the fourth quarter and left deposits with us and then deployed those deposits in the first quarter. So there's some of that particular activity that's in that -- both the spot balance can go up, but also in the average balances in the course of the quarter. So people are raising capital and then deploying that capital.","Nicholas Karzon - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then as a follow-up, just a quick question. On the average total loan growth guidance, I guess, the previous guidance was mid to upper single digit. Is that coming down to mid single digit, if I heard correctly, or is it still mid to upper single digit?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Mid single digit is what we commented on this morning.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I wanted to just make sure I understand the -- kind of the expense commentary correctly. It sounds like, if I heard you correctly, it sounds like the range toward the end of the year is $680 million to $720 million a quarter. So I think that the first quarter then, once you remove the Fit for Growth cost, it sounds like that's going to be kind of the low watermark for the year. And even though things will be pretty well contained, the cost base will be -- kind of be higher than here on kind of a run rate basis going forward. I mean, does that mean all of the future savings are going to be kind of reinvested elsewhere? Or -- I mean, are there some additional opportunities to bring down that run rate cost base as we go forward? How are you guys thinking about that dynamic?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Well, Scott, I think in terms of looking at the expenses and how they progress, the fourth quarter still has Fit for Growth charges in it, so we still have other initiatives that are decked out for the fourth quarter. So the range we gave of $680 million to $700 million, that includes Fit for Growth charges that are in there. And I think the other thing that we always have to look at is there is seasonality associated with our overall activity. And generally, we have increased business activity, particularly on the commercial side, in the fourth quarter, and then that will drive additional activities. I think Chris talked about the other investments. We talk about investing, we're talking about people that we're investing into to drive more revenue growth for the company on a go-forward basis. So we won't really get to our full, what I'd call, run rate benefits until we get into the first quarter of 2014. So we're being very aggressive on moving through 2013 with getting our initiatives in place. There's a lot that's going to happen in the second quarter. During the call, we announced this in the -- at the end of the second quarter of last year. These initiatives do take time to go through and plan, and they -- we've been doing that aggressively. And I think we're in a pretty good place right now with all those particular things that are decked out to go.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, that sounds good. I appreciate that color. And then separately, Beth, you gave some good color on just sort of the way some of your customers that are feeling it on the commercial side. I wonder if, Chris or Bill, if you might give some additional thoughts on sort of what you guys are seeing, either geographically or kind of by client size, where you see things particularly strong or weak, if there are any distinctions?","William R. Koehler","Scott, this is Bill. I would say, on the commercial side, we are seeing some leasing strengths in the Northeast in our pipelines. Now the first -- the fourth quarter, it was a little slower for them. We've seen consistent activity in the Great Lakes at nice, healthy levels for a number of quarters now. And the West has been a little softer, but still at pretty good levels relative to, certainly, a year or 2 ago. So that's on the commercial side. I would say, on the consumer side, it's continually improving tone, but I think -- I still think there's, in the overall context, some work to be done in terms of consumer confidence, still. Our home equity pipeline continues to build. Spring borrowing, early days in the pipeline, is building around what we expected. And I think that's a function of improving home values and general improving confidence. But I think it's at a moderate pace, is the way I would describe it.","Christopher Marrott Gorman","And Scott, this is Chris. I would say -- so Bill covered it from a geographic perspective. As you know, our business is by industry sector, all domestic, I might add. So here's what we're seeing. I don't think there's a lot of consistency. I think it's spotty. I think the people that are doing well, most of the positive activity is domestic when you look at some of the factors out there. I think there's still a lot of excess capacity in the system. I don't see a lot of people out there hiring. What we do see is an extension of overtime. We see that fairly regularly. And I think the biggest challenge out there, from a business perspective, is there's no huge impetus to go long, so to speak. I mean, commodity prices are under pressure. Throughout the entire supply chain, there's availability. So while our clients are in great shape from a financial perspective, the profitability is there, they'd like to do something strategic. I just think that there's not a huge impetus to do so based on sort of the economic environment that we're operating in.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions on fees, if you don't mind. On the -- well, just first of all, if you could just give us some context of your overall outlook from here. I just -- and within that, I just wondered what your -- what the investment banking and debt pipeline looks like, and if there was anything in the other category to note.","Christopher Marrott Gorman","So Ken, it's Chris. Let me speak a little bit to our investment and debt placement pipeline. We had a record first quarter on a trailing 12 basis. It's at a record $339 million. The pipeline is, on a year-over-year basis, is stronger than it was. So as we look into the pipeline really across the board, whether it's on balance sheet, off balance sheet, it's stronger. I would put the caveat out there, though, based on the discussion we just had, as you well know, it's subject to not only the economy, but also to market conditions. But we feel good about the forward momentum of the business.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And Jeff, on the overall outlook just for fee growth and whether there was anything to note in the other line this quarter?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Well, I think, overall, on the fee growth, we typically have a momentum that we go through the course of the year. So we would typically see second, third, fourth quarters, that first quarter is typically the softest quarter that we have and that we usually build from that point on. In the other category, it really is a number of just items that, more or less, that were positive this quarter versus they were negative in the prior quarters. So if you look at it from a perspective, the miscellaneous items may have been $5 million positive this quarter in a couple of items where they were actually negative revenue in previous quarters. So that's a lot of the overall change that's there. I would expect that, that number will be somewhere in that other, other category, somewhere between $20 million and $30 million on a kind of a go-forward basis.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just lastly, one on the expenses. I get all the commentary just around reinvesting and about run rate goes higher from here. But just against that backdrop of what you had originally been saying for the fourth quarter of this year and the fact that you've just achieved so much better in a positive way this quarter, I hear that you're saying that you feel more confident about getting into that 60% to 65% zone. But why, on an absolute level, wouldn't we be ending the year kind of better then you had originally had indicated?","Beth E. Mooney","Ken, this is Beth. There's a couple of things. I think, as Jeff outlined when he talked about some of his thoughts on the fourth quarter, it does still include a level of Fit for Growth charges, so $680 million to $700 million would include that. And then as you look at seasonality of expenses, there are a couple of things in the fourth quarter that will elevate historically in terms of professional fees and various kinds of expenses. And we -- and frankly, in the first quarter, had relatively low marketing expenses. So if you kind of sort through some of that, that still means that there is a continued improvement in our run rate as you go through the year. And the second thing I would observe is, as we currently sit here, we do have plans to invest in our business. That's something we have talked about, is that we have plans to grow our businesses, to grow our revenues. Those will be subject to our estimate of the business plan, the economic condition, the business case, our capability, our resources. But as we go through the year, we do want to continue to support what we see as the momentum with growth of our businesses as well. As we go through each quarter, I think our goal is to give you good clarity and transparency about how that works.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","My question is on efficiency, I guess, both capital and expense. But on the capital efficiency, why would you request to increase the dividend with your stock trading below tangible book? And how aggressive might you be in repurchasing shares? I mean, the shares are down, it's 0.5% in the first quarter. But your stock's at $9.49 and tangible book is $9.78. So how aggressive will you be, and what's the time frame?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Mike, this is Jeff. We have just a modest increase in the overall dividend. It's going up $0.005 per quarter, so it is -- it represents a 10% increase for the next 4 quarters. I think in terms of the overall return of capital, I believe that our numbers will rank one of the higher of the CCAR-related banks that went through the overall process. And we still have to go through a process. So it's not like you can go and buy back stock at any given point in time just because you have a desire to do so. It is a process that you have to work through each and every year with your board and with the regulators. I think we are returning capital, and we agree with your comment as to where we trade and with the desire to return capital. The dividend itself, in terms of the overall dollars, is not a significant dollar amount.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then on the operating efficiency. I know you've had several questions on this, but it looks like you all have $95 million of savings and these extra expenses this year could be potentially close to that number. So I'm not sure how to think about that. I mean, if you take in the extra potentially $50 million more in the second quarter, and maybe it's going to be $30 million after that, it could be $20 million after that, you literally could be an extra $95 million of expenses above your first quarter level in a year when you're getting $95 million of savings. So I guess, the question is, how much of these savings are really going to be sustainable? I guess one question is, what are the expenses in the first quarter of '14? Not that we have that specific number, but just so we know how you're thinking about things.","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Yes. So Mike, I think in terms of the first quarter of 2014, the fourth quarter, we have Fit for Growth charges in there, so we already know certain things that are related to real estate, et cetera, that will happen towards the end of the year. Those particular charges will hit in '14. We'll get a -- or '13 and we'll get a benefit into 2014. The range that we've provided has, and I'll just say it in approximate terms because this can change, but it's about $20 million worth of Fit for Growth charges that are embedded in that $680 million to $700 million number that we provided in our guidance for the fourth quarter of this year. So I think we have to look at it in the sense of, as we roll into 2014, we will have -- we will be within our targeted range, and we will continue to work on other initiatives. So this isn't something that, what I'd call an initiative that it's, if we get this out of the way and we go on our merry path, what it really relates to is a cultural change within the overall organization of striving for continuous improvement, identifying ways that we can do better on end-to-end processes throughout the company and deliver positive operating leverage to our shareholders on a go-forward basis.","Beth E. Mooney","Mike, I would just add that a number of the initiatives that we are undertaking this year will also create benefits in '14. I think Jeff said that earlier, that we are doing a number of things for which the value will also be fully realized in 2014. So I think it's important to note that they are sustainable and that we, every day, think about the interplay of investing in revenue, becoming a more efficient company, and believe we need to do both in 2014. I think you'll see more clarity, and we will be within that targeted range of 60% to 65% as we start the year.","Operator","We'll go next to Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a quick question on credit, actually. Was there anything unusual in terms of credit that led to the reserve build this quarter? I guess I'm just trying to figure out if the 1.7% reserve ratio is a stable number from here. And if I missed it, and if you can just repeat your guidance for provision and charge-offs, that would be great.","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Okay. Ken, this is Jeff. Bill Hartmann can also provide some additional context to this, too. We go through and look at our methodology all the time and look at how we're reserving. And so as we go through that process, there are refinements that are made. I think in terms of how we want to look at the reserve and charge-offs and provisioning going forward, we provided guidance that we expect to be at or below the lower end of our range. So our targeted range is 40 to 60 basis points. We expect to be actually below that for the course of 2013 and that provision expense will probably be fairly close to net charge-offs. So this quarter, it was $6 million. I can't tell you exactly where it'll be for the next few quarters, but it won't be far off from where net charge-offs are.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So the 1.7% ratio is probably a stable number going forward?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Well, it could be...","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Aside from loan growth, of course.","Jeffrey B. Weeden","It could -- yes, besides from loan growth, it could be 1.65%, it could be 1.75%. I can't tell you specifically because you really do have to look at the credits each and every quarter as we build up the reserve.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Paul Miller with FBR.","Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","It's Jessica Ribner for Paul. We just had one question about your branch network and what your thought process might be surrounding it, especially as people's habits change vis-\u00e0-vis branches.","William R. Koehler","Jessica, this is Bill. We think about that a lot. I think we start from a fundamental belief that the branch will remain meaningful to many of our clients going forward. We -- clients across -- in all our segments transact in some way with the branch and the Community Bank, so middle-market companies, small businesses and consumers. What we also recognize is consumer behavior is changing and as -- and is changing as technology changes. So we have to find the right way to invest in our branch network in a way that complements the physical presence with a virtual presence in the context of our relationship strategy. And what we've done in the more recent period is pulled down the investment in our branch network over the last few years with now a focus on rationalizing and optimizing. And we've begun to layer in investments in the virtual space with some of our mobile applications and online banking and things of that nature. And as we move forward, that's where the primary focus of our investments will be.","Operator","We'll go next to Josh Levin with Citi.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You talked about the competitive environment and how lenders are competing on price and then term and now structure. And you say that Key is remaining disciplined, and I, by no means, am picking on Key with this question. But every bank says the environment is competitive, but they're remaining disciplined, but their competitors aren't. So who's making these loans? I mean, is it smaller banks? Is it larger banks? Who is the marginal lender who is being -- who lacks discipline in this environment?","William R. Koehler","So Josh, this is Bill. I would just say this. We're seeing competition in a number of places, and our focus has to be identifying those clients who value our relationship strategy and the broad capabilities we can bring to bear, be it our payments capabilities, our local expertise, our decision-making, the capabilities that Chris and his team have in the Corporate Bank around industry expertise and capital markets. That's where we're focused. So to the extent in an environment like this where we are going to stretch, so to speak, we're going to do it and we're doing it in the context of a relationship strategy and the ability to manage our risk appropriately and our returns because we can bring real value to the equation and we have really good access to management teams. We know what to do and we understand the business and we can bring value to the equation.","Christopher Marrott Gorman","Yes. Josh, it's Chris. I would say the competition is across the board. As you look at the really high-quality middle market companies, there's just a supply-demand imbalance. There's a few kind of headline transactions that you read about. Those clearly aren't middle-market companies. There's just not a lot of activity. So you really see just a whole bunch of competitors chasing the same companies. The other thing, as I mentioned earlier, is there's a lot of fund activity, and with the cost of equity in these funds, they're able to refinance a lot of transactions. But I would say where I see it as most pronounced are transactions that maybe only take one provider of capital. Whereas in our syndicated finance business, we lead about 70% of all the deals we're in, so we get a pretty good insight. There is probably a better market discipline in syndicated finance than there is for these quality transactions that one source of financing can fund. That would be my observation.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And you talked quite a bit about your relationship approach. So when you're thinking about you might make a loan to a client at a certain price and that client also might park deposits with you or generate fee income, what metric or key metrics are you looking at to evaluate what that -- the true economic value that client relationship is worth to your bank?","Christopher Marrott Gorman","So the first thing we look at, Josh, is each and every relationship that we have, we have relationship reviews. We talk about what our penetration is, what their share of wallet is, what we're getting out of that share of wallet. And we have a relationship ROE target of 22%. So that's as a start. Then the other thing we spend a lot of time doing is really evaluating what we call expanded relationships, and what we call an expanded relationship is someone we've done more than $100,000 with on a year-to-date basis than we did in -- at the trailing 12 period ended 12\/31. And for example, we have in -- 56 such relationships that have generated about $28 million in the Corporate Bank this year. And when they're expanded, they're not expanded by $100,000 or so, they're expanded based on those numbers by, say, $5,000 or so -- $500,000 or so. So those are the real -- we spend a lot of time looking at metrics, a lot of time looking at market share, making sure we're targeting the right clients and prospects.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Erika Penala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Erika  Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked and answered except just one follow-up question to Keith on capital. Jeff, according to your guidance on average loan growth and average earning assets, it seems like you'll keep your securities to earning assets ratio relatively the same for the balance of the year. I guess, given that you're such a capital return story, have you thought about how to think about the portfolio size going into next year's CCAR as it seems like the Fed is more interested in starting to test for interest rate risk for future years?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Yes, Erica. In terms of our investment portfolio, we've stayed very disciplined with keeping the weighted average life of that particular portfolio. It's 2.8 years at the end of the first quarter. So it is something that we look at, we test, we shock. We look at it all the time. I think in terms of the overall size of the portfolio, we said about the minimal size of that portfolio is going to be around $16 billion. And of course, it will grow depending on the amount of liquidity that we have or we'll make other determinations, just like we may have more short-term liquidity or do other things in terms of managing our overall interest rate risk as a company. We're asset-sensitive at the end of the first quarter. We were asset-sensitive at the end of last year. Net asset sensitivity is about 1.4% to 1.5% to a 200 basis point movement in rates over the course of the next 12 months.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steve Scinicariello with UBS.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a big picture strategy question for you guys. Just given the many levers you guys have to pull, whether it's expense leverage, capital leverage, credit leverage, franchise leverage, market share opportunities and revenue improvement opportunities as well, how do you go about kind of prioritizing each of those areas when you look at them? And then secondly, which of those do you feel provide you with the biggest near-term bang for the buck and the biggest longer-term bang for the buck?","Beth E. Mooney","Steve, this is Beth. I'll go ahead and tell you that we're in an environment where you've got 3 really strong revenue levers in terms of revenue expense and capital, and we grade each of our priorities against what it will do to enhance our revenue and grow our relationship clients, what it will do to make us -- how do we manage our cost base to be more variable, as well as more efficient. And then third, is it going to be good for our shareholders and our capital return, as well as return on capital over time? So I would tell you that in an environment like we're in, those are the things we look at every single day. And then within those, we prioritize which will be most impactful, which are most accretive to our strategies and which will, with our current resources and capabilities, provide the most benefit in our ability to execute. So that is the lens with which we have those discussions.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then just kind of getting a little more color about that. Do you feel like 2013, we're going to see more in terms of expense saves and then 2014 is more about revenue improvement? Or can we see kind of a mix of all of these things, even this year, in this tough environment?","Beth E. Mooney","I think the mix is going to be also subject to what the environment does produce. But obviously, we are focused on growing loans. We are focused on the ability to bring in quality relationships. And as Chris talked about, expanding relationships, we've invested in new product capabilities. We still have some incremental liability repricing, management expensing -- managing our expenses, investing where appropriate. So I think all of those, when you think of them as levers, could produce outcomes against all those, both the ability to be more profitable, to grow revenue, as well as grow clients.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Beth, coming back to something you said about the Victory Asset Management sale. You indicated that you -- it wasn't a strong fit with the client-facing strategy that you have. Are there other businesses that fit that category that potentially could be sold in the future?","Beth E. Mooney","Gerard, as we looked at our portfolio of businesses as we made the decision to market Victory, it was unique in that regard in terms of how we had repositioned it after the financial downturn to be really an institutional money manager. And then the other businesses we have discussed, we've worked very hard and very purposely at making sure they do fit within our relationship strategy, that we bring our Corporate and Community Banks closer together, as well as the integration of those businesses. So our focus with our current business mix is to build them around that relationship strategy and our go-to-market point of view.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So is it fair to say, from our expectation standpoint, we should not anticipate further sales of businesses in the next 18 months or so?","Beth E. Mooney","I would say that Victory is -- we're looking forward to completing that transaction and developing and growing the businesses we have.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mike Turner with Compass Point.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","As far as your, I guess, NII or NIM guidance, what level of competition does that assume? Meaning, are you assuming pricing will kind of remain where it is or additional pressures will come out?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Mike, this is Jeff Weeden. We're assuming that we're going to have continued pricing challenges out there in the marketplace, but I don't think it's going to be any greater than what it has been for the last few quarters. So we've actually seen relatively stability with respect to the spreads. Now where we're seeing the pricing come down or the yields pressure come down really relates more to the fact that we have some of the, what I'd call, term loans that we've had in the past are repricing down. And those are repricing down at much lower rates as they mature. LIBOR-based, we've been saying basically between LIBOR plus 200 to 275. Now that may be down 25 basis points from a year ago, but it is still hanging in there, and I think this relationship strategy and staying to targeted clients is where that pays off and benefits us.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","And Chris, I don't know if you could comment -- I don't know how many leveraged loans you guys do, but have you seen any impact -- or do you expect any impact from the recent guidance that came out? And then also, maybe not necessarily related to leveraged loans, but do you have a defined risk parameter in lending where, if competition gets too much, you'll just back off? Or is that something that's more dynamic?","William L. Hartmann","Mike, this is Bill Hartmann. When we looked at a detailed analysis of the guidance that was provided -- the interagency guidance that was provided, we think that our business actually stacks up pretty fine to that guidance. There are some other people that are in the market that we see that have been on the more aggressive end, who may potentially be impacted by that, but we think our business model stacks up pretty well. And when the market turns overly aggressive, in the past, we have always held true to our convictions and let the market go where it has to go.","Christopher Marrott Gorman","Yes. Mike, just -- this is Chris. Just to augment with some of the detail that Bill just mentioned, our leveraged loan book here, first of all, we look at our leveraged loan book throughout the entire company, which is one of -- part of the guidance, and that's how we do it. If you think about it, our leveraged loans are maybe, say, 3% of our total loans. So it's not a huge part of our business. The other thing is we have not grown that book of business since the end of '11. We've been just recycling the capital. So I agree with Bill. I think we're in pretty good stead under the new regs as we currently understand them.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Terry McEvoy with Oppenheimer.","Terence J. McEvoy - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Keith's talked a lot about growing the payments and technology, and it's right here on Page 3. Could you just talk a little bit about the investments that have made -- been made the expenses? Are you starting to breakeven? And then maybe more importantly, where will we see the results? If I look at the cards and payments numbers, 90% of it's out of the Community Bank. And will, over time, we start to see that in other lines of business at Key?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Okay, this is Jeff. I think in terms of where the revenue is coming through, you'll see it -- in the cards and payments side of the equation, you're right, a lot of that is going to be over in the Community Bank, but it's also a growing presence over in the Corporate Bank, too. And so it is across both of our major lines of business. It goes -- it's one of those businesses that -- it's the reason it's called enterprise commercial payments within the company, is it encompasses the entire enterprise. I think what you've seen really in some of the investments that we've made were with respect to cards that we had made last year, and I think that particular business is approximately breakeven. And it's approximately breakeven because you're still seeing some reserve build that's out there. So x that reserve build that you saw in the first quarter here in that particular line, it would have had a profitability that would have been quite acceptable, plus it has amortization expense associated with the purchase credit card receivable. I think the other area where we've made -- have made investments, and of course it's early in this particular process, is really in the merchant side of the equation, and Chris will talk about that for just a second.","Christopher Marrott Gorman","Sure. So on the merchant side, having control of the merchant card is very important, very, very critical for a lot of Business Banking clients, very important going forward in health care because it's going to be part and parcel of that whole information loop between the provider, the insurance company and the patient. And we've brought that back in-house. We had used an outside provider, and we brought it back in-house so that we could control the client experience, we could control the pricing. And so that sales force has just hit the ground running. The other 2 areas where we're going to continue to invest are both on the prepaid side and the purchase card. And particularly within our public sector business, the prepaid card is very, very important as we go forward. So it will show up in a few revenue pools kind of across the enterprise. I would say merchant would be really skewed to small business and Business Banking. And the prepaid investments that we're making we think can give us a real lift on our public sector business.","William R. Koehler","And this is Bill. The other area that I wouldn't want us to lose sight of is debit, debit processing. We, about 18 months ago in the face of Durbin, undertook a project to enter into a partnership with MasterCard around debit processing. And we completed our full conversion in February to -- which dramatically reduces our cost of processing as we move forward.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from John Moran with Macquarie Capital.","John V. Moran - Macquarie Research","Just we're a couple of quarters away, removed now from sort of the HSBC branch transaction in upstate. Obviously, that was -- it was kind of an opportunity on the funding side, probably more so than anything else. I was just wondering if you could provide a quick update on asset generation opportunities in that market. There's a lot of disruption, and maybe spend a second outlining the strategy up there.","William R. Koehler","Sure. This is Bill. We feel very good about the success we've had in integrating that business -- or the branches with our business there. Our client retention has been very good, especially relative to plans. The employee retention, very good relative to plans, and the tone in the market has been very positive for us. We -- one of the things we did like about the capabilities that we acquired was a focus on the mass affluent client. And there are some things we can learn from that team that we're building into our product offerings around investments, in particular, where we thought that we had an opportunity to up-tier some of our capabilities by leveraging some of their capabilities, and we're working around that as we go. So it's folded into our business very well, and we like the momentum we have.","Operator","That concludes our question-and-answer session.

I\u2019ll provide some overview comments on the first quarter and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Don to give you more detail on our financial results. The first quarter was a solid start to the year. We produced bottomline results consistent with our expectations by managing expenses and growing revenue in many of our businesses, which helped offset the impacts of higher provision expense and lower revenue in investment banking and debt placement fees.","Revenue was up from the prior year and expenses were well managed resulting in modest positive operating leverage for the quarter. We had solid loan growth with average balances up 5% from the prior year and as in prior quarters continued to be driven by an increase commercial, financial and agricultural loans which were up 12%.","Most fee income categories were in line with our expectations and reflected growth from investments we have been making in areas such as trust investment services and cards and payments.

The decline was due to lower revenue from loan syndications and financial advisory fees.","Although, investment banking and debt placement fees can vary on a quarterly basis, we expect this business to grow in 2015 from its record level of performance in 2014. Expenses were well-controlled up only $5 million from the same quarter last year, despite the impact of the Pacific Crest Securities acquisition.","We remained committed to continue to improve productivity and efficiency, resulting in our outlook for positive operating leverage for the year. Additionally, we absorb higher credit costs with our provision up $31 million from a year ago period and in the quarter, our provision expense exceeded net charge-off.","Our asset quality remained strong, as net charge-offs continue to be well below our targeted range. And while the lending environment remains competitive, we are remaining disciplined on quality and structure, and staying true to our relationship strategy.","During the quarter, we also remained disciplined in managing our strong capital position. We repurchased $208 million in common shares in the first quarter, completing our 2014 capital plan. We were pleased to receive no objection to our 2015 capital plan from the Federal Reserve.","We expect to return a significant amount of our net income to our shareholders over the next five quarters, including a share repurchase program of up to $725 million and subject to approval by our Board of Directors, and increase in the quarterly dividend of 15%.","We anticipate these actions will lead to an estimated payout ratio that is among the highest in our peer group for the third consecutive year. Overall, it was a solid start to the year. While the pace of economic recovery and the low interest rate environment remain challenging, we believe we are well positioned.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Don to discuss the details of our fiscal results.","Don Kimble","Thanks Beth. I\u2019m on slide five. This morning we reported net income from continuing operations of $0.26 per common share for the first quarter compared to $0.26 for the year ago quarter and $0.28 for the fourth quarter. I will cover many of these items on this slide throughout my presentation. So I\u2019ll now turn to slide six.","Average total loan growth continued in the first quarter with balances up $3 billion or 5% compared to year ago quarter and up $971 million from the fourth quarter. Our year-over-year growth was once again driven primarily by commercial, financial and agricultural loans and it was broad based across Key\u2019s business lending segments. Average commercial, financial, and agricultural loans were up $3 billion or 12% compared to the prior year and were up $1 billion or 4% on annualized compared to the fourth quarter.","Continuing on the slide seven, on the liability side of the balance sheet average deposits were up $3 billion one year ago and down $284 million from the fourth quarter. Deposit growth of 5% from the prior year was driven by growth in non-interest bearing deposits and strength from our commercial mortgage servicing business. Compared to the prior quarter, balances decreased slightly primarily due to expected declines in our CD balances. And the cost of our total deposits remained low at 15 basis points compared to the 20 basis points one year ago reflecting our more favorable deposit mix.","Turning to slide eight, taxable equivalent net interest income was $577 million for the first quarter compared to $569 million in the first quarter of 2014 and $588 million in the fourth quarter of this year. Net interest income was up $8 million from a year ago with a benefit from higher loan balances offset by lower earning asset yields. Compared to the fourth quarter, net interest income was down $11 million primarily as a result of fewer days in the quarter.","Our net interest margin was 2.91%, which was down 3 basis points from the prior quarter, reflecting the impact from lower earning asset yields. We expect to maintain our modest asset sensitivity and the duration and characteristics of Key\u2019s loan and investment portfolios continue to position us to realize more benefit from a rise in the shorter end of the yield curve.","Slide nine shows the summary of noninterest income which accounts for 43% of our total revenue. Noninterest income in the first quarter was $437 million, up 1% from the prior year and down 11% from the prior quarter. Compared to the prior year, we saw growth in several of our fee-based businesses including trust and investment services and cards and payments. We also benefited from higher principal investing gains and corporate-owned life insurance.","Offsetting this growth was a $16 million decline in investment banking and debt-placement fees that resulted from lower financial advisory fees as well as the impact to the timing of closed transactions. Additionally, operating lease income and other leasing gains declined due to the early termination of leveraged lease in the year ago period.","Compared to the fourth quarter, lower non-interest income results reflects seasonality and several fee categories as well as variability in our model I referenced earlier. The growth we saw in the quarter was more than offset by the decline in investment banking and debt placement fees which was primarily caused by lower revenue from loan syndications and financial advisory fees.","Turning to slide 10, non-interest expense for the first quarter was $669 million, up $5 million from the year ago period and down $35 million from the fourth quarter. First quarter expenses were 1% higher than our prior year primarily related to the Pacific Crest acquisition and higher employee benefit cost. Compared to the fourth quarter, expenses were down 5% as lower incentive compensation, marketing cost, salaries, and professional fees more than offset higher employee benefit cost.","This quarter, our cash efficiency ratio was 65%, which reflects our hard work and improvement over the past few years. The efficiency ratio remains an important measure for us and we expect to continue to make progress in 2015. We remain committed to generating cost savings through our continuous improvement efforts, which will enable us to make investments and offset normal expense growth.","Turning to slide 11, net charge-offs of $28 million or 20 basis points of average loans in the first quarter which continues to be well below our targeted range. In the first quarter, we began reporting provision for credit losses on our income statement. This line includes provision for loan on lease losses as well as the provision for unfunded commitments which was moved from non-interest expense. Prior years have been adjusted for this comparison.","In the first quarter, provision for credit losses of $35 million was $31 million higher than a year ago period. Additionally, this quarter, provision exceeded charge-offs. At March 31, 2015, our reserve for loan losses represented 1.37% of period-end loans and 182% coverage over non-performing loans.","Turning to slide 12, this quarter, we begin reporting our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, which was implemented as part of the Regulatory Capital Rules for banks like Key at the beginning of this year. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was strong at March 31st at 10.8%.","As Beth mentioned, we repurchased $208 million in gross common shares in the first quarter, which completes our 2014 capital plan. And we are now moving forward with our 2015 capital plan including a new share repurchase program of up to $725 million in common shares over the next five quarters and an increased dividend subject to Board approval. Importantly, our capital plans reflect our commitments to remaining discipline in managing our strong capital position.","Moving on slide 13, as we look ahead for the remainder of 2015, we remain on track and our committed to meeting the full year outlook that we shared on our fourth quarter call in January.","Average loans should grow in the mid single digit range as we benefit from the strength in our commercial businesses. We anticipate net interest income growth in low to mid-single digit percentage growth compared to 2014, which does include the benefit from higher rate as we currently are modeling short-term rates to increase 25 basis points late in the year.","Without the benefit of higher rates, we would anticipate net interest income to be up in the low single digit range. Our net interest margin should remain relatively stable and based on interest rates it may increase later in the year.","Non-interest income is expected to be up in the mid single digit percentage range for the year and full year reported expenses should be relatively stable with 2014. Credit quality should remain a good story with net charge-offs to lower targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points and we also expect provision to approximate net charge-off. And finally, we expect to continue to execute on our share repurchase authorization, consistent with our capital plan.","With that, I will close and I turn the call back over to operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Steven Alexopoulos","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","Steven Alexopoulos","Maybe I will start. Looking at the pullback of the investment banking and debt placement fees, the drop was far more dramatic than what I was looking for. Even expected loan syndication and debt placement fees performed. Could you quantify how much of that decline actually came from those two items? Maybe talk about how the rest of the business performed in the quarter and then comment on the pipeline and where you expect this to rebound to?","Chris Gorman","Sure, Steve. It\u2019s Chris Gorman. Good morning. So as we look at this business and we\u2019ve always felt this way. If we really need to look at it on a trailing 12-month basis and as Beth mentioned in her opening comments, we still anticipate that we will grow our investment banking and debt placement fees in 2015, as we have in each of the last five years. Now the two areas that you point out where we had challenges were specifically isolated on our financial advisory and our syndications business and those to some extent are related.","We do a lot of buy side work and as you know in the M&A business in general, there is a lot of variability and we ran into some issues seasonality\u2019s part of it, timing as it relates to specific deals is part of it. And the other thing is in this kind of an environment. In some instances, our clients were not able to win the deals that we were advising them on just based on the climate. So those were a few of the things that impacted those specific areas. Now the areas that -- the other areas from a product perspective were impacted are things like our balance sheet. We are obviously able to grow our balance sheet well and we also saw strength in certain sector in our industrial and reclass.","As it relates to the backlog, the backlog is strong. It\u2019s up about 130% of what it was last year. One of the things that gives us a lot of comfort is you look at held for sale and as you look at what we have in terms of held for sale, that\u2019s elevated two times what it was at year end and I\u2019m looking at 331 ending numbers and maybe four times what it was a year ago. So if you look at all those things and I\u2019m not with our clients a lot, the activity is -- there is not for lack of activity, a lot of activity, lot of good discussions. So in general that\u2019s why we feel pretty good as we look forward.","Steven Alexopoulos","So, Chris, if you look at that trailing average that you cite, you are anyway a net $80 million to $100 million range per quarter. Is that where you expect to -- at least it will move back to here in near term?","Chris Gorman","So, we don\u2019t look on it. We don\u2019t look at it on a per quarter basis. But as you think about if we are going to grow at year-over-year and last year, we did -- I don\u2019t know 392 or so. Obviously that means on an average, we are going to have to have some pretty significant quarters in the last three quarters of the year.","Don Kimble","Yes. Steven, this is Don. And you\u2019re right that that would imply an average of about a $110 million a quarter for the rest of this year. So there would be a meaningful step-up from where we were in the first quarter.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. And Don on, the margin guidance was unchanged, which is really full year guidance. But until we get higher short-term rates, should we think about NIM pressure somewhere to what we saw this quarter?","Don Kimble","We would think generally they would be fairly stable with where it is. But I\u2019ll tell you that this past quarter some of the impact was the issuance of the debt, which cost us about a basis point. We did have some loan fee that came through in the fourth quarter that wouldn\u2019t be recurring in nature. And also, we\u2019ve been expecting that our loan growth would exceed our deposit growth. And as strong as our loan growth has been, our deposits year-over-year were also up 5%.","And so that efficiency of the balance sheet didn\u2019t materialize as much as we would have expected in the first quarter this year compared to year ago. So that what helps keep that margin stable over for the remainder of the year is having a little bit more efficient balance sheet.","Steven Alexopoulos","And just one final one on the EMP portfolio, are you seeing any surprises thus far in the spring with redetermination of borrowing basis? Thanks.","Bill Hartmann","This is Bill Hartmann, Steve. We\u2019ve seen exactly what we expected to see in that portfolio. No surprises.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Don, I was wondering if you can just provide a little more context in terms of the loan growth. There was really good more so at period end. And also, I saw that you moved a bunch over to held-for-sale. Can you talk about like the progression of growth throughout the quarter? And then also then just that color on the -- what\u2019s moving to held-for-sale and when do you expect to get rid of that?","Don Kimble","No, you\u2019re right. As far as the loan growth, we had a strong finish to the fourth quarter, which set up the first quarter well, but we also saw period end loan growth from fourth quarter to first quarters. We\u2019re very pleased with that.","Now as far as the loans held for sale, those are designated at a time of origination to be placed into that category. And so it really reflects the timing of when transactions are closed. And that\u2019s what also gives us confident as Chris mentioned earlier as far as the outlook for fee income going forward.","Ken Usdin","Okay. And my follow-up is, Don, underneath the surface, you\u2019ve had the good expense control again underneath the line. And I\u2019m wondering the $7 million of the continuous improvement and I think you\u2019re still on track to do around the same amount that you had indicated before the 30. Are we kind of had a good level for expenses? Can you still expect that stable? Any drift as this investment bank revenue potentially comes up and we will see that naturally shift back up. It seems have been again a seasonally lower number given the pullback in the investment bank as well. So I just want to understand that trajectory.","Don Kimble","You\u2019re right. That first quarter has some seasonal impacts as far as the negative, the benefit costs and highest in the first quarter compared to the rest of the year. But that we also tend to have lower marketing expenses. And in this quarter as you highlighted our incentive expense was lower because of the lower investment banking and debt placement fees. And so as those revenues pick up that we will see an increase to the incentive line item as well, but that still would help us meet our positive operating leverage target for the full year with having that type of growth.","Ken Usdin","Okay. Great. Thanks, Don.","Operator","Our next question is from Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Scott Siefers","Good morning, guys. Just had a quick question on sort of the health of particularly the Midwest manufacturing base because as you have a couple cross-currents, on one hand energy is obviously kind of a tailwind for their cost, but by same token the strong dollar seemingly would be more of a headwind. I wonder if you can just sort of talk about what your customers are thinking and saying about health of their overall businesses?","Chris Gorman","Sure. Scott, it\u2019s Chris. So as you can imagine, it sort of depends by vertical. I would say that our manufacturers -- obviously the dollar has made it more challenging for our industrial clients, so that\u2019s one area. Areas that are particularly benefited in the current operating environment are specialty chemical business where natural gas is a feedstock. We\u2019re doing a lot of business right now in specialty chemical.","Conversely, obviously, our oil and gas business, which we talked about earlier, the pullback in terms of CapEx in most of the shale plays is 30% to 40% and I think you\u2019ll see that triple through in the secondary and tertiary effect.","And then lastly, one thing that really impacts the Midwest in the significant way is the automotive business and our analyst is looking for sales at retail this year to be $16.9 million units up from $16.4 million.","And there is also a positive mix shift lot of SUV\u2019s and pickup trucks which are higher margin. And then one thing that hasn\u2019t been discussed a lot is the Class 8 Truck market which is also strong. So that\u2019s kind of a walk through kind of what\u2019s going on in the Midwest economy.","Scott Siefers","Okay. That\u2019s perfect. And I think most of my others were already answered. So appreciate it.","Don Kimble","Sure. Thank Scott.","Beth Mooney","Thanks Scott.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Good morning.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Erika Najarian","Just a quick one for me as well, I am sorry Don, if I missed this in the prepared remarks? But could you give us an update on where you are on the LCR and also if your guidance for stable NIM if the fed doesn\u2019t move this year contemplate any further LCR related balance sheet actions?","Don Kimble","As far as LCR for the fourth quarter we are operating on a regular basis at high 80s, so we are in good shape as far as being able to achieve that 90% target for the first quarter of next year.","We\u2019ve also continued to migrate our investment portfolio to more Ginnie Mae that we are in at about 44% of the total portfolio and as we have cash flows from the existing portfolio we\u2019ll continue to reinvest those in Ginnie Mae.","And so we do not expect any significant impact on our margin going forward from any further actions and believe that that the guidance doesn\u2019t contemplate us achieving that 90% plus coverage ratio by next year.","Erika Najarian","Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Kevin St. Pierre with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Kevin St. Pierre","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. You had very solid growth in commercial loans, but the 6 basis point decline in the yield let to sort of flattish interest revenue from the commercial portfolio? Could you comment on how much of that is driven by the competitive environment? Don you mentioned some fees which may have not come through, can you talk about the decline in the yield?","Don Kimble","The decline in the yield, we had about $2 million of higher fees that came through in the fourth quarter that didn\u2019t reoccur in the first quarter and weren\u2019t present for the first quarter of last year. And so if you take a look at the total loan yields over the last year it would have been an average rate of compression less than that 6 basis points that you saw a reference.","So we don\u2019t think it\u2019ll continue at that same type of pace, but that there still is pressure on loan yields that we are seeing new originations still coming in about 25 basis points lower than where we were a year ago and not seeing that pressure come down much at all.","Kevin St. Pierre","Okay. And maybe just a bigger NIM question or a broader question. We have seen about eight plus quarters of a steady lead down in the NIM and now you are guiding that, if rates don\u2019t move up will still be sort of flattish? What from a big picture perspective has changed, why -- that we wouldn\u2019t expect that continue to 3 to 5 basis points lead downward over the next few quarters?","Don Kimble","Yeah. There are two components that would be driving that. One is that our yield on our investment portfolio is now down to 2.1%, so the further reduction there should not have as much of an impact as what it has had historically.","And the second is that we still believe that our loan growth will exceed deposit growth and that will allow us to have a little bit more efficient balance sheet. And so, even though we would expect pressure to remain on loan yields, we think the mix of the balance sheet should offset that allowing us to maintain a more stable margin.","Take a look at our overall cash position. It was about $2.5 billion again this past quarter, which is above where we would typically target of around a $1 billion. And so that\u2019s continued to put pressure on the margin from that perspective as well.","Kevin St. Pierre","Great. Thanks very much, Don.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ken Zerbe","Great. Thanks. Just in terms of your expense guidance have stabled, is -- how much is in incremental efficiency charges is in that number this year?","Don Kimble","We\u2019ve talked about our range consistent with where we are operating for the first quarter, which is in the $30 million plus or minus range and so we had $7 million of charges in Q1 and we\u2019d expect that to be about that same range for the full year.","Ken Zerbe","Got you. And does that drop-off in 2016 or is that just more of a stable ongoing number that we should expect?","Don Kimble","We are going to be continued to focus on continues improvement throughout the organization. And so I don\u2019t know its going to continue at $30 million, but we will have some level continue going forward, just because we believe that this ongoing opportunity is to right size our branch distribution of 2% to 3% a year, and we will also have other effort to look at end-to-end processing type of opportunities to get more efficiencies to help fund some of the investments going forward. So, we really look at this as more of a core component of our cost base for now.","Ken Zerbe","Understood. Okay. And second question is just in terms of loan growth, obviously very strong C&I growth with some of the other categories other than construction, probably not as strong. I know your focus has been on C&I, but do you guys have any commentary on more of the weakness in some of the other categories? Thanks.","Don Kimble","As far as the weakness, one thing it does impact to have, we still have about $2 billion of exit portfolios that are mainly in other categories, a lot in the consumer book and also some in the commercial leasing book. So as that continues to run down at about $150 million to $200 million a quarter that will put pressure on those portfolios. Then you look beyond that, we don\u2019t have the typical consumer book of business that really is primarily focused on our home equity and our first mortgage position and doesn\u2019t include an indirect auto portfolio where others are seeing much stronger growth than what we would experienced during the last year or so. So, I would say that it\u2019s more demand focused as far as the weaker growth then also reflective of that exit portfolio I mentioned.","Ken Zerbe","All right. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next, we will go to John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","John Pancari","How much of the $6 million linked quarter decline in comp expense was tied to the lower investment banking incentive accruals?","Don Kimble","We do provide a little bit more of a breakout on that on page 20 of the earnings press release. You can see that our incentives were down from $105 million in the fourth quarter to $70 million in the first quarter this year that this comparable amount in the first quarter of 2014 would have been $72 million. So it\u2019s a decline in both the year-over-year and also linked quarter information.","John Pancari","Okay. So should that be the extent of the snapback that we could see in the comp expense line, assuming we see the investment banking activity rebound?","Don Kimble","The $35 million change is probably outside what you would see from taking the investment banking backup from the fourth quarter -- from the first quarter of this year to fourth quarter of last year. But we should see some increase in incentives when those revenues do come through at a stronger pace.","John Pancari","Okay. All right. And then also related to expenses, your long-term below 60% target for the efficiency ratio, can you just help us understand how much by way of higher rates is in that assumption for the fed funds target?","Don Kimble","If you look at slide 16 of the deck, it does have to walk forward of that efficiency ratio and you can see based on that there is probably a range of that impact. We\u2019ve talked about we would expect our efficiency ratio to be in the low 60s without the benefit of rates and in the high 50s with the benefit of rate. So we haven\u2019t gotten more specific than that.","John Pancari","Okay. All right. Good. Thanks. And then lastly on the energy portfolio. Sorry, if you already said this. But did you take an energy related loan loss provision this quarter, or did you reallocate incremental reserves from unallocated to allocated for energy this quarter?","Don Kimble","As we talked about last quarter, we did set aside a portion of our judgmental reserve for the oil and gas portfolio and we did see the portfolio moving in line with our expectations and so we did not have any adjustment or increase to our overall allowance this past quarter for that migration.","John Pancari","Okay. And you haven not quantified what your energy specific reserve is as of this time?","Don Kimble","We have not, no.","John Pancari","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jason Harbes","Yeah. Hi. Good morning. It\u2019s Jason Harbes actually for Matthew.","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","Jason Harbes","Hey. Good morning. So nice strength in the trust and investment services line this quarter from I guess Pacific Crest. So just curios as to get your take on how sustainable you think that is this year and just to get a sense for your appetite to do additional acquisitions along those lines?","Chris Gorman","Jason, it is Chris. As it relates to Pacific Crest, we feel really good about where the business is positioned. We think we will continue to be able to generate revenues in trust and investment services. Just this Monday, we actually combined the two broker\/dealers. So now Pacific Crest is a fully integrated vertical, technology vertical within our corporate and investment bank.","As it relates to other acquisitions, there are clearly businesses out there that are very niche, very focused and that we think could fit into the platform that we built. So just as we a couple of years ago grew by adding things in our third party commercial loan servicing business and last year grew by acquiring Pacific Crest. There are other opportunities out there, but in the ordinary course we always are looking.","Jason Harbes","Okay. Thanks. And just as a follow-up or maybe switching over to credit. The credit costs came in a little higher and it looks like the NPAs in the commercial side picked up as well. I mean, was that a function of anything in particular or perhaps energy, or just want to get your take on kind of what\u2019s driving the credit cost higher and to get maybe your outlook for credit cost going forward?","Bill Hartmann","Jason, this is Bill Hartmann. If we look back over the last several quarters, what we have seen is a very strong asset quality being pretty consistent from quarter-to-quarter. So we think that we\u2019ve actually kind of normalized at this level. And we have also indicated that because it\u2019s -- the statistics are so low at this point any one or two smaller items could actually move the numbers around a little bit. And so we will expect to see some modest variation from quarter-to-quarter.","Jason Harbes","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Beth Mooney","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Sameer Gokhale with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.","Sameer Gokhale","Hi, thank you. Good morning.","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Sameer Gokhale","I have few questions. Firstly, I was just curious if you could talk a little bit about C&I loan growth. You\u2019ve been asked a few questions about that. But one other things I have been puzzling over is what is -- has been keeping C&I growth so high for so long. And it would be helpful to get your perspective on what you think is continuing to drive that, simply because at one point it was inventory builds than we heard about companies that were spending on infrastructure, especially technology infrastructure, but you continue to see C&I loan growth juggling along and pretty attractive rates and your results show the same thing. So at this point when you look at the drivers of C&I loan growth, what would you attribute those to?","Chris Gorman","Sameer, it\u2019s Chris. It\u2019s obviously situational company by company. But as we kind of step back and look at it, it is not an increase in utilization. Our utilization rates have been flat for the last four quarters. In certain instances, we do see people investing in property, plant, and equipment demands hiring a lot of people. We do see some transactional activity, which obviously helps growth. And in our instance, we believe we have been able with our unique model to take some share. We\u2019ve added 142 clients in the first quarter and we think that\u2019s a factor as well.","Sameer Gokhale","Okay. It\u2019s just interesting within the context of the Fed data showing 10% growth in C&I loans for everybody across the industry so and it seems like everybody is doing similar things in generating growth, which led me to think maybe to some more underlying fundamentals driving that, but your perspective is helpful.","The other thing I was curious about is, if you could just talk again or just remind us about your go-to-market strategy in your investment banking business. And the reason I asked that is because for quite some time now we have been hearing about the large cap banks and how from an investment banking standpoint, it used to be the case where they could more easily use their balance sheets to help their capital markets businesses, doing investment banking and then promising loans and packaging those deals and they have had a very difficult time from what we are hearing and doing that for quite sometime now.","So I was wondering from where you said and as you managed that business, do you go to market using your balance sheet more readily perhaps to help support your investment banking business, or is that something that\u2019s going to affect you as well, so your perspective there would also be helpful?","Don Kimble","So our approach is a very focused relationship approach and we are very targeted and that we focused on certain sectors and specifically middle market companies within those sectors. As it would happen, as our businesses continue to evolve often we start a relationship with an advisory or transformative kind of transaction.","But we do think there is huge value and we see it resonate with our clients to have an integrated corporate and investment bank where we can use our balance sheet or we can -- as principal or we can act as agent helping our clients access the markets and grow their business.","Sameer Gokhale","Okay. And then just a couple of other quick ones, GE Capital that\u2019s selling a bunch of different businesses and assets, have you express an interest in acquiring any of those businesses or portfolios?","Beth Mooney","Sameer, this is Beth. As you would expect, we don\u2019t typically comment on any specific transactions that might or might not in the market. And as a historical precedent, we haven\u2019t bought portfolios for say just to supplement our balance sheet. But where we would see perhaps client opportunity fit with our business model and risk profile, I think as you\u2019ve seen some of the puts and takes that we have done over the last couple of years, we have reviewed those types of opportunities in the past.","GE, I would say has been a strong competitor in the market. We see them in many of our businesses. And we think these kinds of situation often create opportunities for our teams as markets get disrupted.","Sameer Gokhale","Okay. Thanks, Beth. And then just my last one was on the tax rate would seem to be a little below where you\u2019ve been trending over the last few quarters, anything unusual going on there this quarter?","Don Kimble","We did have a few credits come through this quarter that we talked about for the future quarters that we see an effective tax rate in the 26% to 28% range for those future quarter. So there was a slight benefit this quarter.","Sameer Gokhale","Okay, okay. Thank you.","Beth Mooney","Thank you.","Operator","And next go to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","Gerard Cassidy","Don, can you share with us on your buyback? Are you permitted if you want to do more of it in the first or second quarters of the period which starts of course, second quarter of this year for the CCAR fiscal year? Can you do -- does that spread out evenly overall four or five quarters or can you frontloaded if you wanted to?","Don Kimble","Great question. And as we submit our capital plans, the instructions are that we need to keep our capital actions consistent with our overall plan, which doesn\u2019t necessarily allow for our frontend loading of those share buybacks. The other thing we do have is that when we issue shares for employee benefit-related plans and that we\u2019re able to buy those back and those tend to happen in the first quarter of each calendar year. And that\u2019s why you saw a higher level of share buybacks here in the first quarter of this year compared to what you\u2019ve seen in the previous three quarters.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. And on your slide 9 -- 15 where you guys give us the progress on targets for success, some of them have obviously been met and you exceed some of them. What kind of interest rate environment, would you envision to have your net interest margin get to that target of 3.5% from where you are today at 2.91%?","Don Kimble","We do have to see a much more normal rate environment which would be up to about 300 basis points from where it is today before we could start to get to that three-fifth margin. So it\u2019s something that would be very difficult if not impossible for our balance sheet to achieve until we\u2019ve start to see that rate environment change.","Gerard Cassidy","Sure. And coming back to your comments on about the efficiency of the balance sheet and seeing that deposit growth? Are there any plans, I know your CDs have been coming down, the higher cost deposits? Are there any other plans you could put in place to reduce some of the higher cost deposits quicker to make that balance sheet more efficient?","Don Kimble","One area that we\u2019ve been focused on as it is making sure that where we have collateralize deposits that we encourage those to be full relationships for us to support that kind of deposit to be on our balance sheet. And so we\u2019ve seen some of those balances leave and we would expect to see a several more leave between now and the end of year.","But as we look at our deposit mix we have been very aggressive as far as managing rates and making sure that we are focused on supporting more of the relationship in total. And so we are trying to make sure that we match up our higher rates with our best overall customers.","Gerard Cassidy","And then just finally, I want to make sure I heard you correctly you guys talked about that the loan growth at the end of the fourth quarter accelerated for the fourth quarter result? Did you see that gain at the end of March, there was an acceleration of loan growth as well?","Don Kimble","We did -- that [period] [ph] balances are up at the end of the first quarter compared to the average. And so we had a nice close to the end of the quarter, which positioned as well in the second quarter as well.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. Thank you for your time. Thank you.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Beth Mooney","Thank you.","Operator","And we will go to Jeffrey Elliott with Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Elliott","Hello, there. I wondered if you could discuss in a bit more detail what you can do to deliver on the long-term cash efficiency ratio target if rates don\u2019t go up so going down into the low 60\u2019s excluding rate rises, because I guess, if I look at 1Q \u201815 you were at 65.1% and 1Q \u201814 you were at 65.1%? It kind of feels like without rates, that\u2019s being going side ways or I guess you\u2019ve got some plans that you think should enable you to get it down?","Don Kimble","As far as the year-over-year stability that we had some non-recurring type of revenues in the first quarter of last year, including the gain on the sale of the leverage lease transaction, which helped benefit the first quarter of last year.","As you look at our long-term plans it\u2019s focused on driving positive operating leverage. And so that starts with growing revenues and even with our full year guidance for 2015 we talk about showing year-over-year growth and net interest income even if rates are flat. And we experience that during the first quarter if you look at the year-over-year change in our net interest income its up $8 million despite the fact that rates are flat with the first quarter of last year.","Other revenue initiatives would include the benefit of some of the investments we have been making. We\u2019ve been adding to our frontline distribution capabilities for both the Corporate Bank and the Community Bank, and those aren\u2019t all fully mature yet and so we will see additional benefits from those investments.","We\u2019ve been making investments in payments space and if you look at our cards and payments revenue it\u2019s up 10% year-over-year, if that reflects the investments we\u2019ve been making there and so our guidance for the full year of this year is mid single-digit growth in fee income.","And so we believe that we can generate revenue growth and keep our expenses relatively flat. And the initiatives we are focused on on driving that expense level to be flat would include continued focused on reducing occupancy cost both through non-branch space where we\u2019ve talked about reducing that by 15% between now and 2016.","Earlier we mentioned that our branches are expect to go down by 2% to 3% per year as we make that infrastructure more efficient. And we are having on going efforts to take a look at our front and back office functions to see on an end-to-end basis like we make those efficient and that\u2019s just could be part of the culture here and driving that continuous improvement.","And so the combination of all those that revenue growth supporting -- supported by keeping the expenses flat from getting cost saves to -- save for the investments we are making give us confidence, so we can drive that efficiency ratio to that low 60% range even without the benefit rates.","Jeffrey Elliott","And then just to follow-up on some of the earlier questions on credit and we are taking up criticized assets, I appreciate that your credit is pretty good and [want to see more rise which] [ph] can move things around a bit. But on the other hand it looks like it\u2019s the end of a 23 quarter half of those criticized assets declining every quarter? So can you be little more specific on, what the areas well resulting in the uptick and how you think about things from here?","Bill Hartmann","Yeah. This is Bill Hartmann, Jeffrey. So we track the portfolio very closely and we are not seeing any trend that might be suggesting that there has been any change in the environment for credit.","Again kind of reiterating what I said earlier, we\u2019re at such a low level across our loan books that one or two names that might occur are going to change the -- are going to change some of those statistics modestly. But we are not seeing that that\u2019s going to have a significant move in our credit losses at all.","Jeffrey Elliott","And could you say what industries or different kind of flavor of larger clients, smaller clients, geography, I mean anything at all to give us an idea where this is come from?","Don Kimble","We really can\u2019t say that because it didn\u2019t in anyone industry or geography. We are not seeing any trend. It\u2019s just -- we are operating with a lot of small numbers and any day you could have something that changes. And it\u2019s just the way normal business environment is.","Jeffrey Elliott","Right. Thank you very much.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Beth Mooney","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Jill Shea with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Jill Shea","Hi. Good morning. Thank you. You touched on this a little bit on the prior question just about the deposit mix and CDs and time deposits coming down, but could you just speak more generally about total funding cost and what you sort of factor in, in terms of your outlook for holding the NIM relatively stable from here?","Don Kimble","Yes. Our outlook would assume that we basically continue to see funding costs remain relatively stable, but that show again a change in the mix overall as far as the balance sheet and see that the loan growth would exceed the deposit growth and allow us to come up with the more efficient balance sheet.","Jill Shea","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","And we will go to David Eads with UBS. Please go ahead.","David Eads","Hello. Thanks for taking the call. Just quickly on expenses, we have a nice tick-down in the business services and professional fee line both on a sequential and year-over-year basis. It\u2019s a little bit surprising just given -- we\u2019ve heard about on pressures about regulatory and technology spending front of note. I was wondering if you could touch on kind of where you see the outlook for that expense line item.","Don Kimble","Generally we would see -- this has been the new line baseline for us and not seeing significant changes one way or the other from that line item.","David Eads","Great. And then just if you could touch a little bit more on kind of your energy vertical kind of because you have such a unique perspective there. Are you guys seeing the clients looking to tap capital market early and like how long do you think that is going to last and how much kind of appetite there is from investors? And then I guess what that kind of means for your -- the outlook for either putting more or less in terms of energy on the balance sheet?","Chris Gorman","David, it\u2019s Chris. We have seen that our clients have been able to go to the markets. And so that one of the things that gives us confidence with respect to the portfolio. In our portfolio, less than 40% of the capital structure is typically senior debt and what we\u2019ve seen is that our clients have been able to go to the high yield market. So it\u2019s -- we feel that there will be a time when there is an opportunity to continue to grow the business, but I think right now we are in the mode of advising our clients as everybody works through what has been a very sudden price change.","David Eads","Right. Thanks.","Beth Mooney","Thank you.","Operator","And we will go to Nancy Bush with [ANB] [ph]. Please go ahead.","Nancy Bush","Also note that\u2019s NAB, but that\u2019s okay.","Beth Mooney","Good morning, NAB","Nancy Bush","Good morning. Going back to your commentary on commercial line utilization, we heard yesterday from I think both USB and PNC that they were seeing an uptick or it was sounded like a very modest uptick in the utilization of commercial lines. And I guess I am just a bit mystified along with a lot of other people at this point. How we continue to see loan growth optimism about the economy etcetera, etcetera without seeing anything happen in utilization of commercial lines? Can you just tell me what your conversations with your customers tell you about what seems to be a phenomenon?","Don Kimble","Nancy, you are right. I mean, as we sit down with clients, rate never having been this low for this long. I think some of the basic behaviors have changed, but you just described exactly what we\u2019re seeing and that our deposits continue to grow.","They continue to have cash. They are really not -- our clients are not really tapping their lines. I think to some degree, companies are going to just run with higher levels of cash going forward, but it is the unique phenomenon. E.J., do you have a perspective?","E.J. Burke","Well, Chris, I would agree with that. Our client\u2019s outlook and leverage -- in the Community Bank our clients prefer to use their own. They are generating a lot of cash in their business. Our cash balances like in the Corporate Bank have been rising. We had a good growth in cash balances in the -- our first quarter or so. Our clients just don\u2019t deal like they want to take on rental leverage right now. Their businesses are good. They generating the cash but they just don\u2019t want to take on a lot of leverage right now.","Nancy Bush","With rates as low as they are, I guess my question is sort of what are they waiting for? I mean, do you think that if they became to see the prospects or more definite prospects of rates rising that maybe they are within the lines at that point or what the signal are they waiting for?","Don Kimble","I think, they are still -- Nancy, I think most of them are generating a fair amount of cash. Most of them have had really improved the operating efficiency of their business.","Nancy Bush","Right.","Don Kimble","And I think what they are waiting for is to really make that step change. And the step change would be to invest in the brand new plan to hire lot of people or to make an acquisition. Other than that they are really just generating enough cash that are -- frankly they don\u2019t need to tap their lines.","Beth Mooney","And Nancy, I would add in my conversations with clients. I often get asked my view of interest rates. I would summarize it that they often say absent any sense that rates are about to make any compelling move. It doesn\u2019t factor in. So it creates this no particular sense of urgency to think about debt and their capital stack or how they are operating their businesses?","Nancy Bush","Yeah. But that would deck the question or whether down the roads somewhere, we are going to get a surge in commercial line utilization, as everybody runs for the door at the same time. So hopefully that will happen. But I\u2019m just -- like all other people having trouble putting all the pieces of this puzzle together and saying when things get dramatically better for the banking industry and demand?","Don Kimble","Nancy, when you figure that out, let us know because....","Nancy Bush","Yeah, I will. I will be charging a lot more money then by the way. Thanks.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Beth Mooney","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Bill Carcache with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Bill Carcache","Thank you. Good morning.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Bill Carcache","Don, I wanted to follow up on some of the comments that you made on the non-commercial side after about 11 quarters of year-over-year growth. It looks like this was the first quarter where we saw a decrease in Key Community Bank home equity loans. Is that slow down a function of something happening on the demand side or did you say or is that something that you are doing and thus giving you commercial focus, can you talk about your strategic commitment to home equity and your growth outlook, it\u2019s about 18% of your book? So just let me get a sense as we look forward, does that probably go up or down or kind or stay flat?","Beth Mooney","Bill, this is Beth. I\u2019ll go ahead and say a commitment as you said with our commercial focus commitment to our equity book. I would tell you well our business model, as we\u2019ve talked about is a heavy commercial focus. We are also very committed to our consumer clients in having a relative balance within our business mix is critical to our business model, our performance and [Technical Difficulty] the company.","Our primary lending vehicle in our consumer arena is home equity. It does have seasonal attributes win demand typically surfaces and kind of the fourth -- the first quarter is not a you are aware are a period where we often see seasonal demand but it is a core product. We have grown that. If you look over the last couple of years that has been in an area where we have invested and grown and we considered it a core product of our consumer capability. And I would ask Dennis to add anything about what he sees as particular attribute of how it is trend over the last several quarters.","Dennis Devine","Thanks Beth. You look across the industry and you\u2019re not seeing the growth in the home equity book. And so give the dominant position that we\u2019ve been got from a consumer leading perspective there. You compare as just as Beth said first quarter the last year, you didn\u2019t see a big pickup in that book either. So this seasonal demand, second quarter and third quarter you will see growth on the midst of a campaign from new volume perspective, from an origination perspective, we\u2019re stronger that we have been at some time.","And so it is a core part of our business. It has occurred again and again, a core part of the relationship strategy. This is through the branch and our focused effort of expanding relationship into our existing client base. Thus as you\u2019ve seen a heavy first-lien position there.","You see really stable credit quality within that book as well and it\u2019s a core part of our offerings to our clients. So you\u2019ll see stable and just what Don had shared earlier. Consumer loans have been stable since some offset run off in other parts of our exit portfolio as well.","Bill Carcache","Thank you.","Beth Mooney","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our final question will come from Kevin Barker with Compass Point. Please go ahead.","Kevin Barker","You\u2019ve been conducting brand consolidation and other efficiency initiatives for last couple of years. And you\u2019ve seen some incremental decline in overall expenses because of these initiatives. But I mean in order to really get the efficiency ratio below 60%, you would need either higher rates or a broader initiative. I mean, given your footprint, why not sell some of the branches and smaller footprints, where you don\u2019t have scale and reinvest the proceeds, either in higher yielding assets or even buyback stock?","Don Kimble","This is Don. And I\u2019ll take the first crack at that and one is that we do believe we can get below 60s without those types of structural changes that we believe just by focusing on positive operating leverage consistent for our guidance for this year, we should show revenue growth and be able to keep expenses flat and that will help drive down the overall efficiency ratio.","When you take a look at downsizing through sale of certain portions of our franchise, keep in mind what you lose from that is the revenue associated with that book and only the incremental cost associated with supporting that on a direct basis. But we do have an infrastructure here from a technology platform and other perspective that you really can\u2019t reduce proportionately for the sale of those types of branches and geographies.","We do take a look at the performance at a branch level and make sure that we are getting increased productivity from those branches in achieving the types of positive operating leverage and efficiency improvement that we would expect and think that we can get there organically without having a go-to other more strategic type of transactions. Beth?","Beth Mooney","And Kevin, I would add that if you look at our business model in any given market, it\u2019s bigger and broader than just our retail network. It is foundational to what we call broader market presence which would include our business banking clients, our commercial middle market, our private banking clients. So in any given market, we are larger in generating more revenues than just our branch presence. And yet without the branch presence you lose critical mass with the ability to serve those clients. It is an integrated model within the community bank and I don\u2019t think the branch density in any given market is necessarily indicative of what was a broader performance than any market would be.","Kevin Barker","What level of deposits per branch or loans per branch do you think you need in order to generate positive operating leverage off of that specific branch?","Don Kimble","What we\u2019re focused on right now within the retail space, I\u2019ll let Dennis comment more on this, it\u2019s really looking at sale per person per day. And by focusing on that, we could continue to drive up the loan balances and deposit performance at each of the branches. Dennis would add to that.","Dennis Devine","That\u2019s right. The core focus on the community bank is positive operating leverage. And so every branch you find at a different place in terms of average deposits or average loan today. But you see two things going on. Year-over-year, if you look at any given period, growth in core deposits, you see that in the community bank, you see growth in the balance sheet and it is best described across the community bank and across the different asset categories while the branch count continues to come down.","And so the growth you see in the balance sheet, the growth you see in year-over-year fee income, all occurred with 3% fewer FTE in substantially fewer branches that we had a year ago. That plays out in the trust and investment services category in particular that you see within the community bank. That\u2019s a function of Key investment services. We\u2019ve had one of the strongest quarters we\u2019ve ever had as well as within the private bank. And so it\u2019s bringing to life the entire relationship to our clients in those branches is what we are looking to do.","Kevin Barker","Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Beth Mooney","Thank you.","Operator","And Ms. Mooney, I\u2019ll turn it back to you for any closing comments.","Beth Mooney","Again, we thank you for taking time from your schedule to participate in our call today. If you have any follow-up questions, you can direct them to our investor relations team at (216) 689-4221. That concludes our remarks. Again thank you and have a good day."],"12601":["KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) Q2 2018 Earnings Conference Call July 19, 2018 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Beth Mooney \u2013 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Don Kimble \u2013 Chief Financial Officer","Chris Gorman \u2013 President of Banking","Analysts","Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Brendan Jeffrey \u2013 Sandler O'Neill","Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies","Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 JPMorgan","Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC","Peter Winter \u2013 Wedbush Securities","John Pancari \u2013 Evercore","Saul Martinez \u2013 UBS","Erika Najarian \u2013 Bank of America","Kevin Reevey \u2013 D.A. Davidson","Operator","Good morning and welcome to KeyCorp\u2019s Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chairman and CEO, Beth Mooney. Please go ahead.","Beth Mooney","Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to KeyCorp\u2019s Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. In the room with me are Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer; Mark Midkiff, our Chief Risk Officer and Chris Gorman, President of Banking.","Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments, as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call.","I\u2019m now turning to Slide 3. KEY reported strong results for the second quarter, with earnings per common share of $0.44, up 22% from the year-ago period and 16% from the first quarter. Our cash efficiency ratio was 58.8%, and our return on average tangible common equity was 16.7%. Results this quarter included a number of notable items, including a gain from the sale of our insurance business and some offsetting items that were unique to this quarter.","Don will walk through the line item detail in his comments. We continue to generate positive operating leverage from both the prior year and prior quarter. With our results driven by continued revenue growth as well as strong expense discipline.","Net interest income benefited from a four basis point improvement in our net interest margin and growth in average earning assets. Average loans grew 2% from the prior year and prior quarter, driven by double-digit growth in commercial and industrial loans as we continue to grow the number of relationships and do more with our existing clients.","With a solid economic backdrop and positive client sentiment, we continue to see good business flows and activity. We are taking share and our pipelines remain strong. Our fee-based businesses, once again, reflected our ability to offer a full range of solutions to our clients. Investment banking and debt placement fees reached a new record level for the second quarter, driven by strong advisory fees.","Cards and payments were up 15% from the prior quarter, reflecting the investments we have made in the business and our success across our franchise. Expenses this quarter included some notable items related to efficiency initiatives as well as cost incurred from the sale of our insurance business. Excluding these items, expenses were down $40 million or 4% from last quarter, reflecting both seasonal trends and cost savings. This included realizing the remaining First Niagara cost savings, bringing our total annual savings to $450 million or approximately 46% of the acquired expense base.","As we discussed in our first quarter call, we also implemented a number of expense initiatives that benefited both the current quarter as well as future period. These initiatives included branch consolidations, savings from third-party vendor contracts and adjusting staffing models and business realignment. These actions are part of the path and plan to approach the high end of our long-term cash efficiency ratio target of 54% to 56% by year-end and we remain committed to achieving our expense outlook for the year.","The final two sections on this slide highlight our strong position in terms of both risk management and capital. Credit quality remains a strength, with net charge-offs to loans of 27 basis points. And our approach to capital has remained consistent and focused on maintaining a strong capital position, while returning a large portion of our earnings to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","KEY\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1 ratio ended the quarter at 10.1%, consistent with our 2018 Capital Plan, our Board of Directors recently approved a 42% increase in our common stock dividend payable in the third quarter, which was our third increase over the past year and will reflect a 3.4% dividend yield for our shareholders.","Our Capital Plan also included a share repurchase authorization of $1.2 billion. These actions are consistent with our stated capital priorities, which we believe will continue to drive long-term shareholder value.","I will conclude my remarks by restating that it was a strong quarter with broad-based growth across our franchise in both our commercial and consumer businesses. We grew loans including 5% linked quarter growth in C&I. We grew fees with record quarters for investment banking and debt placement fees as well as cards and payments. We managed our expenses, which excluding notable items were down $40 million from the prior quarter and we maintained our credit quality with the net charge-off ratio of 27 basis points.","And finally, we were disciplined with our capital, including a 42% increase in the common share dividend bringing us closer to our targeted payout range of 40% to 50% overtime. Our results this quarter represent a step change in our performance with meaningful improvement in productivity, efficiency and returns and with a definitive move toward our long-term performance targets. We remain committed to achieving our guidance for the year and continuing to deliver value for our shareholders.","With that, I will close and turn the call over to Don. Don?","Don Kimble","Thanks and I\u2019m on Slide 5. As Beth said, we reported second quarter net income from continuing operations of $0.44 per common share. Our results compared to $0.36 per share in the year-ago period and $0.38 in the first quarter. There were a number of notable items during the quarter, which in total, resulted in a $2 million after-tax impact. In the year-ago period, we had notable items with a $27 million after-tax benefit. Notable items are listed on the bottom of this slide and additional detail can be found in the appendix of our presentation materials. I\u2019ll cover many of the remaining items on this slide in the rest of my presentation.","So, I\u2019m now turning to Slide 6. Total of average loans of $89 billion were up $1.7 billion unannualized from the first quarter. Second quarter growth was driven by strong commercial industrial loans, which were up $2.3 billion or 5% linked quarter unannualized. We saw a growth across commercial client segments in both our Community Bank and Corporate Bank.","We continue to see good growth from new business activity, which was partially offset by elevated paydowns and lower line utilization, which impacted our period-end balance. We entered the second half of the year with strong pipelines and continued to expect loan balances to be within our targeted range of $88.5 billion to $89.5 billion for the full year.","Continuing on to Slide 7. Average deposits totaled $104 billion for the second quarter of 2018, up $1.4 billion or 1% unannualized compared to the first quarter. The cost of our total deposits was up 7 basis points from the first quarter, reflecting recent rate increases as well as the continued migration of our portfolio into higher-yielding products. Our deposit beta for the current quarter was 41%, resulting in a cumulative beta of 25%, which we expect to migrate higher overtime.","Our outlook assumes our betas will be ramping up to more historic levels in the mid-50% range during the second half of this year. On a linked quarter basis, deposit growth was primarily driven by higher, NOW and money market balances, as we benefit from strong retail deposit growth, commercial relationships and a continued shift into higher-yielding deposit products. We continued to have a strong, stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting for over 60% of our total deposit mix.","Turning to Slide 8. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $987 million for the second quarter of 2018 and the net interest margin was 3.19%. These results compared to a taxable equivalent net interest income of $987 million and a net interest margin of 3.3% in the second quarter of 2017, and $952 million and 3.15% in the first quarter. Purchase accounting accretion contributed $28 million or 9 basis points to our second quarter results. This compares with $33 million or 11 basis points in the first quarter and $100 million or 33 basis points in the second quarter of 2017.","Excluding purchase accounting accretion, net interest income was up $72 million or 8% from the second quarter of 2017. The increase was largely driven by higher interest rates and earning asset growth. Net interest income increased $40 million or 4% from the prior quarter excluding purchase accounting accretion benefiting from higher interest rates, strong commercial loan growth, asset sensitivity and one additional day in the quarter.","As noted earlier, our deposit betas increased faster than originally expected. As a result, we have included in our outlook a deposit beta ramping up to the mid-50% range during the second half of this year. With this, we expect our core net interest margin, excluding purchase accounting accretion to move modestly higher in the remainder of this year, which assumes continued growth in our balance sheet and one more rate increase toward the end of the year.","Moving on to Slide 9. KEY\u2019s non-interest income was $660 million for the second quarter of 2018, compared to $653 million for the year-ago quarter, with both periods including a number of notable items. In the current quarter, this included a $42 million lease residuals, which impacted our operating lease income. The loss was from a leveraged lease on a coal power plant that was originated over 20 years ago. It is unique and singular in terms of the nature of the asset, site and structure, and we have not originated a leverage lease in over a decade.","We also recognize the $78 million gains in the sale of our insurance business, which impacted other income. In the year-ago period, the $61 million of notable items included a gain from the merchant services acquisition and a purchase accounting finalization. Excluding all notable items, non-interest income was up $32 million or 5% from the year-ago period. Not included within the notable items, but also impacting the second quarter results was a $9 million charge related to the Visa\u2019s litigation escrow account funding.","Growth from the prior year was largely driven by continued momentum in our fee-based businesses, including a record second quarter from investment banking and debt placement fees, which were up $20 million from the year-ago period as we benefited from the acquisition of Cain Brothers and stronger advisory fees.","We also saw growth in mortgage servicing and corporate services. Compared to the first quarter of 2018, non-interest income increased by $23 million excluding notable items. Investment banking and debt placement fees as well as cards and payments related revenues, each grew as we benefitted from ongoing momentum across the franchise.","Turning to the Slide 10. KEY\u2019s non-interest expense was $993 million for the second quarter of 2018. Again, there were a number of notable items that impacted our results, including expenses related to our efficiency improvement efforts and cost related to the sale of our insurance business. These items totaled $27 million for the current quarter, which we would not expect to continue in the back half of this year.","As we discussed on our first quarter conference call in April, we implemented plan this quarter reduced cut cost including plans for branch consolidation, savings in third-party vendor contracts, middle and back office efficiencies, business unit realignment and staffing model adjustments.","These plans represent initiatives that were kicked-off last year coming out of our First Niagara integration, which keep us on a path to approaching the high-end of our efficiency ratio target by the end of this year. These costs are clearly outsized compared to our normal continuous improvement efforts, which will continue into next year. Compared to the first quarter, excluding notable items, expenses of $966 million were down to $40 million or 4%.","This decline reflects expected seasonal trends in the realization of cost savings. One of the largest drivers was employee benefit expense, which was down $23 million on a linked quarter basis. Excluding notable items which totaled $60 million in the year-ago period, non-interest expense grew $31 million from the prior year as a result of the acquisitions and investments we\u2019ve made across the organization.","This includes Cain Brothers, HelloWallet, the addition of client facing roles and investments in our mortgage \u2013 residential mortgage business. Costs associated with these investments offset and benefit from the merger-related cost savings. We continue to expect to be within our full-year guidance range with non-interest expense of $3.85 billion to $3.95 billion and again, approaching the high-end of our long-term efficiency ratio target of 54% to 56% by the end of this year.","Moving to Slide 11. Our credit quality remains strong. Net charge-offs were $60 million or 27 basis points of average total loans in the second quarter, which continues to be below our targeted range. The provision for credit losses was $54 million for the quarter. Non-performing loans were relatively stable with the prior quarter and represented about 62 basis points of period end loans. At June 30, 2018, our loan loss reserve \u2013 our total reserve for loan losses represented 1.01% of total period end loans and 163% coverage of our non-performing loans.","Turning to Slide 12. Capital also remains the strength of our company with a common equity Tier 1 ratio at the end of the second quarter of 10.1%. As Beth mentioned earlier, we increased our common share dividend by 14% during the quarter and we continue to repurchase common shares, which totaled to $126 million. Our 2018 capital plan included last week\u2019s announcement of a 42% increase in dividend, positions us for a meaningful increase in shareholder payout and progress as we move toward our long-term targeted levels of capital and common dividend payouts.","Slide 13 is our outlook for 2018, which remains the same as what we shared with you in April. We continue to expect average loan balances to increase to the $88.5 billion to $89.5 billion range with deposits growing less than loans. Net interest income is expected to be in the range of $3.95 billion to $4.05 billion. This assumes one additional rate increase in November and in our Appendix, we have updated the interest rate sensitivity slide, which provides different rates and balance sheet assumptions.","We anticipate the non-interest income will be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion as we continue to drive growth from our core businesses and deliver First Niagara revenue synergies. And we continue to expect non-interest expense to be in the range of $3.85 billion to $3.95 billion. Net charge-offs are expected to remain below our targeted range of 40 basis points to 60 basis points, and our loan loss provision should slightly exceed the level of net charge-offs to provide for loan growth.","As we continue to expect our GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 17% to 18%. Beth said, this was a strong quarter, with continued growth across our franchise. We are benefiting from the results of our efforts to improve efficiency and returns and look forward to continuing to deliver on the commitments we have made.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to the operator for instructions in the Q&A portion of our call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Good morning.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","Matt O\u2019Connor","I was just wondering if you could talk about the competitive landscape a bit. We\u2019re seeing some kind of the bigger banks talk about expanding into some of your markets. Actually, one of your regional competitors have talked about increasing your marketing spend in a big way going forward. So, I\u2019m just wondering it\u2019s always been very competitive environment, I think, for the banks overall and maybe in the Midwest in particular, but I just wondering if you could talk about the start?","Beth Mooney","Yes, Matt. This is Beth. I\u2019ll start and then look to Chris to see if he has any additional color or commentary. But I would tell you that it is always a competitive landscape, but as you can see in our performance, we continue to grow loan, we continue to grow deposits with particular success in our commercial franchise. Post First Niagara, we too have increased our marketing spend and believe our business model is well positioned with our relationship strategy, our targeted value propositions in our consumer to our commercial businesses.","So as we look, I don\u2019t see any particular shift in the landscape that would suggest that this is outsized competitive intensity and our franchise also, we enhanced it with the First Niagara acquisition and the northeast in particular. The strength and the growth we have in our western markets. So again, we feel like we have a balanced franchise, a competitive value proposition I have seen, strong results and momentum across our businesses.","Chris Gorman","Matt, it\u2019s Chris. The only thing I would add to that, you asked specifically about the Midwest. As we look at what\u2019s going on in the Midwest, we\u2019re probably having the strongest year in the Midwest that we\u2019ve had in the last three years. So, we feel like we have good momentum, since you asked about the Midwest. Other areas where we have a lot of momentum are in Metro New York, Colorado, Salt Lake City and Portland, and our Community Bank. And I think we benefit there from pretty robust economies and a lot of in migration.","As we think about our Corporate Bank, where we have a lot of momentum there is really an M&A, which is taking shares specifically around the healthcare area. And as we think about our other businesses, we\u2019ve got a lot of momentum and technology as well. So I think it\u2019s a step back, yes. It\u2019s a competitive landscape. Yes, the level of competition is stiff. But I think all the investments we\u2019ve made over the last five years in bankers and other investments are really paying off.","Matt O\u2019Connor","That\u2019s helpful color. If I could just ask a separate, related \u2013 unrelated question on asset quality. I mean overall, quite strong, if you look at the early-stage delinquencies, they bounced up and I realized it\u2019s off of really low levels last quarter and also low levels a year ago. But they did jump up a bit there. I was wondering, if there\u2019s any color on that you could provide?","Don Kimble","Yeah. Hi, Matt. This is Don. As far as the early-stage delinquencies, those are really influenced by some loan renewals that didn\u2019t get completed by the end of that 30-day window. And so we don\u2019t see that as a trend as far as overall credit quality. And so we think that the things are progressing as expected with normal seasonality.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Just on the delay of the renewals, is that I guess what would be driving that?","Don Kimble","Just getting the paperwork signed, and that\u2019s really the only thing that drives that. And unfortunately, does create some bumps every now and then in that 30-day delinquency bucket.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. All right. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ken Zerbe","Great, thanks. I guess one of your regional competitors this morning, got a little more negative, it seemed on their deposit pricing in terms of higher deposit beta, even so far is taking down their NIM guidance just a little bit despite moving up rate hikes. I was hoping \u2013 given you have a very similar overlapping footprint, I was hoping you could actually talk about what you\u2019re seeing in the markets from a deposit pricing standpoint. And certainly, also your expectations about for deposit betas or deposit costs over the course of the rest of this year? Thanks.","Don Kimble","Right. And we did see the deposit betas pop up this quarter. And as we said, our deposit beta was 41%, and our cumulative deposit beta is 25%. So we did see a change. What we have seen change in, really, is more on the commercial side and a continued migration of some of the consumers into a more higher-yielding offerings, whether it\u2019s time deposits or higher-yield money-market type of product. We\u2019re especially seeing that in the wealth area of our bank, our private banking type of customers that are accessing that. But we have adjusted our guidance a little bit by saying that we expect to see the betas continuing to ramp up to close to or into that mid-50 range throughout the rest of this year. So, it is more competitive from that perspective, but we still feel very comfortable with our outlook as far as net interest income and overall margin. And so it\u2019s something we\u2019ll continue to watch. But we feel we\u2019re in good shape there.","Ken Zerbe","Got it, okay. And then just separately, in terms of your tax rate, I saw the guidance. I think it was unchanged. But it seemed that this quarter may have been a little light. You\u2019ve been backing out sort of the tax impact of the one-time items. Does \u2013 are you implying potentially that the second half tax rate could be just incrementally higher to stay within your range? Or is there any reason to think second half tax would change?","Don Kimble","Not seeing a significant change for the second half tax rate. I would say that second quarter did have some credits as well. But I think that the range is still appropriate, which implies maybe a slight tick-up in the overall tax rate.","Ken Zerbe","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","Brendan Jeffrey","Hey, good morning, guys. This is actually Brendan from Scott\u2019s team. So, as I look at guidance for both season expenses for the second half of the year, it seems like it implies a pretty good ramp in fee income from the first half while expenses are going to be relatively flat compared to the first half, if not down a little bit, just to get to the midpoint. I\u2019m just curious, one, what are the specific drivers of the in-fee income that can deliver that growth in the back half of the year. And then two, what are the levers on the expense side that allow you to ramp up fee income while holding expenses relatively flat?","Don Kimble","Great. As far as fee income that \u2013 we tend to see, especially the fourth quarter, be a peak quarter for us in several categories, including investment banking, debt placement fees and some of the other activity-based accounts, including cards and payments-related revenues. And so we would expect to see some seasonal growth from those categories, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve continued to maintain our outlook for fee income.","On the expense side, what you\u2019re looking at there is a guidance range. It would be using our second quarter baseline of the $966 million in expenses, and assuming that we can continue to remain that rate \u2013 maintain that in the same general level and have that relatively stable. We think we can achieve that by continuing to benefit from the remaining portion of the cost savings for some of the charges we just took and some of the efforts we announced earlier in the quarter. And also, our outlook does continue to assume that the additional assessment from the FDIC premium does go away in the fourth quarter, and that\u2019s about a $12 million benefit for us. And so that\u2019s all predicated on that adjustment coming through, and it\u2019s consistent with our outlook that we\u2019ve had throughout the year.","Brendan Jeffrey","And then FDIC $12 million benefit, is that per quarter or for the entire back half of the year?","Don Kimble","That\u2019s in the fourth quarter only. So that is per quarter.","Brendan Jeffrey","All right, great. All right. Thanks for taking my question.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Thanks a lot. Hey Don, just \u2013 first, I just wanted to double confirm. The full year guides for \u2013 and \u2013 for fees and for expenses, are those all just GAAP basis inclusive of the items this quarter?","Don Kimble","That is true that we\u2019re showing reported results. And so it does include those actual numbers. And I would say that we would still be within the guidance range even if you went on adjusted for notable items, but it does include reported results.","Ken Usdin","Okay, got it. And then as you look forward, you reiterated your view that you expect to get towards the high end of the 54% cash efficiency \u2013 54%, 56% cash efficiency ratio by year-end this year. Any color you can give us on \u2013 do you believe you have a chance of getting inside that range for full year of 2019?","Don Kimble","We\u2019ll provide 2019 guidance later, but I would say that we\u2019re clearly on our trajectory to continue to show positive operating leverage. And we think that our efficiency ratio will come down, and so we think that we\u2019re on the right path. And we\u2019ll provide more clarity on the 2019 outlook later.","Ken Usdin","Okay, great. And then just last true up then. On the expense side, are \u2013 will you \u2013 do you expect to continue to have in the second half of the year some of these efficiency-rated \u2013 efficiency-related items as well? Or was that a second quarter cleanup type of thing?","Don Kimble","That really, for the most part, was a second-quarter cleanup. We will have some minor type of severance charges later in the year. But if you look at the charge we took in the second quarter, it\u2019s four to five times what we would typically see in any normal quarter for these types of continuous improvement efforts. And it really reflects the accumulation of those plans that we weren\u2019t able to implement last year and are putting into place this year.","Ken Usdin","Got it. Okay. Thanks, Don.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Steven Alexopoulos","Hey good morning, everybody.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","Steven Alexopoulos","You guys had really solid commercial loan growth in the quarter. I\u2019m curious, what impact \u2013 the tariffs always talk of a trade war. What impact is that having on confidence levels of your commercial customers? And is it impacting loan pipelines at all yet?","Chris Gorman","Steve, it\u2019s Chris. We\u2019re out talking to our clients all the time. Clearly, it\u2019s a topic of discussion, but it hasn\u2019t manifested itself really in any change of plans that we\u2019re seeing. Also, keep in mind that the tariffs that have been imposed and those that are being discussed do have different impacts for different clients. But short answer to your question is we are not seeing the impacts yet.","Steven Alexopoulos","I think, Chris, could you give a little color, which industry verticals are driving such strong loan growth here?","Chris Gorman","Well, it was really across the board. I mean, let me start with our Community Bank. We really had just very strong loan growth across ours geographies. And as I mentioned a little earlier, the particular highlights were places like Metro New York and some of the places in the west. We\u2019re also really pleased with the traction that we had in the Midwest. And so those are kind of from the geography perspective, Steve, where we\u2019re getting a lot of growth. As it relates to our Corporate Bank that it would be where you would expect to see debt growth, and that would be in places like industrial, some portions of real estate, some portions of energy.","Steven Alexopoulos","Great. And maybe just to shift directions for a second. We\u2019re seeing regulatory relief now being provided to banks below $100 billion in assets. And given that you guys are at the lower end of that $100 billion to $250 billion range, I\u2019m curious, have conversations with banks your size started yet regarding potentially getting regulatory relief.","Beth Mooney","Obviously, there is a window in which the regulators get to assess the potential timing and magnitude of how they will implement the regulatory relief. And clearly, we, in the industry, have a point of view and are in \u2013 always in discussion with our regulators. But it is early days since the passage of the Senate bill, and there is nothing further that I would comment on it at this point.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. And Don, can you remind us what level of CET1, do you think you need if you are out of CCAR at some point.","Don Kimble","We\u2019ve talked about as having a CET1 of 9% to 9.5%. And we believe that is an appropriate capital range for us, and it also allows us to maintain a strength in our capital. So, we don\u2019t have to issue capital in the downturn and continue to maintain our debt ratings that we have as well that we like being A-rated bank, and that\u2019s helpful to reinforce that.","Steven Alexopoulos","Perfect. Thanks for taking my questions.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Beth Mooney","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning, Beth. Good morning, Don.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","Gerard Cassidy","Don, can you share with us \u2013 there\u2019s been a number of discussion points from all the banks this quarter on the betas going higher, just like you guys discussed. And you pointed out that you\u2019re still expecting to see margin expansion going forward, and hopefully, higher net interest income. Can you share with us, what can you do? Because I think people are getting quite alarmed that the betas are going to be negative, rising betas. What can you do to offset that to drive that margin higher or net interest revenue growth higher?","Don Kimble","We\u2019ve got a couple of levers that others might not have available to them. One is that we\u2019ve got about $1.2 billion in cash flow right now off our investment portfolio. And the yield of the cash flows coming out of 2.15%, and we\u2019re getting about 125 basis points to 130 basis points additional yield on that rollover. And so that\u2019s helpful for us, and we\u2019re seeing benefit there. We also have, as we\u2019ve talked before, about $18 billion worth of received fixed swaps that we use for our asset liability management. We\u2019ve got about $6 billion of those that mature over the next year, and the received tax rate on those $6 billion is 1.1%. And so if we were to replace those today, we\u2019d have about 170 basis point pickup in the yield. And even if we didn\u2019t replace that, we\u2019d still have a 90 basis point benefit, because right now, we\u2019re paying 2% and receiving 1.1%. And so both of those will be additive.","And I\u2019d say lastly, we\u2019re seeing our loan yield for new originations being in line with what is the average yield for our portfolio today. And so we\u2019re not seeing the pressure there as much as what we would have seen historically. And so each one of those, I think, are helpful to help offset some of the impact from the higher betas going forward.","Gerard Cassidy","And speaking of the betas, Don, has regulation \u2013 the repeated regulation queue, I think it was finalized in 2011. Has that impacted the betas yet in your guidance business?","Don Kimble","I think it just shows a little bit more flexibility for some of our commercial customers. And what I think you\u2019re seeing for the industry right now is that many of those commercial customers are going past their earnings credit rate they have on the deposits, and so they\u2019re starting to move some of those excess funds into either interest-bearing deposits are taking them off balance sheet. And thank goodness for us, what we\u2019re seeing is our non-interest-bearing deposits are relatively stable over the last several quarters. and so we\u2019re able to retain those commercial customers and also maintain strength in that commercial loan servicing business, which help support those balances also.","Gerard Cassidy","And then just a final quick follow-up. On the capital return, obviously, you guys got a strong number. In terms of the buyback, is it equally weighted in terms if you take the total amount and divide that by four for each quarter? Or is it front-end loaded? How do you guys get approval \u2013 how did you get the approval?","Don Kimble","Well, I would say that it\u2019s biased to being a little front-end loaded, and I\u2019ll leave it at that.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay, that\u2019s fair. Thanks. Appreciate it.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Peter Winter","Good morning.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Peter Winter","The C&I loan growth has been really much stronger than peers for the past two quarters, which is kind of a change from the past. And I\u2019m just wondering, are you guys doing something different than you had in the past that\u2019s driving this growth?","Chris Gorman","Peter, it\u2019s Chris. No, our strategy is unchanged. In fact, as we think about it, we \u2013 our credit box is unchanged, our strategy is unchanged. We\u2019ve always been very targeted, and we\u2019re out there growing new customers in the areas that we\u2019re good at, and C&I is one of those. We also, of course, have a business model where, from time to time, there\u2019s a lot of velocity of our balance sheet. So you get certain ebbs and flows. But as we \u2013 our leading indicators are, we look at how many new clients we bring on, and we look at how many enhanced relationships. And the progress has been pretty steady.","Don Kimble","Peter, this is Don. I just had a couple of other snippets there as well. In the second half of last year, we were really burdened by some fairly large increases in the paydowns. And I\u2019d say, in the first half of this year, while they\u2019re still elevated compared to historic levels, they\u2019re much lower than what we would\u2019ve seen in the second half. And the second piece I would add to that too is that you also have to remember that many of our former First Niagara markets were working through their conversions and customer assimilation. And we start to really see that origination volumes pick up here late last year and early part of this year. And one of the markets we did see some success this \u2013 early this year was in Philadelphia. And so we\u2019re seeing some growth there that wouldn\u2019t have been present in the 2017 results.","Peter Winter","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just the reserve-to-loan ratio down to about 1%. And I realize it\u2019s formula-driven, but just given the strong loan growth, would you expect to add reserves more aggressively? Is there a certain level you wouldn\u2019t want to see that reserve-to-loan ratio fall below?","Don Kimble","Even though you\u2019re right that we\u2019re at a 1.01% allowance of total loans, if you would back out the impact of purchase accounting and just book the reserve as they would be done on a normal basis, our reserves would be 1.16%. So, that\u2019s more in line with peers. And I thought you might be going at it from a different angle. But we\u2019re actually adding to our reserves, whereas many of our peers are showing provision below our charge-offs. And so we will continue to maintain the appropriate reserves and believe that we are with the credit quality, and it continues to remain in a very good position. And so we think that the reserves are appropriate at this point.","Peter Winter","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","John Pancari","I just want to go back to the loan growth question from the other side of the demand. My NIM \u2013 I believe you indicated line utilization is of a little bit. Just want to see where are you seeing any weaker demand. And also, where are the areas that you\u2019re still maybe more cautious on or de-emphasizing?","Chris Gorman","John, a couple of things. First of all, if you think about commercial real estate, that would be an area that we\u2019re accommodating our clients in that we\u2019ve raised 19% more capital this year than last year. But in terms of what we\u2019re putting on our balance sheet, we\u2019re being extremely careful there. So in one of Don\u2019s slides, I think, it shows that our construction piece is about 11%. So if you look at real estate, for example, we\u2019re below the market. We\u2019re actually shrinking by 1.2%, the market is growing by 1.1%, but that is really by strategy. And so that would be an area that I would point out to you where we\u2019re kind of an outlier.","John Pancari","Okay. All right. And then separately, on the core margin, I know you implied that it\u2019ll be moving modestly higher through the year. Can you just give us a little bit more color on how that progression could look like? How should we think about the pace of that improvement? And then separately, do you still see three basis points to four basis points of margin upside for each 25 basis point hike? Or is that changing?","Don Kimble","Well, in the appendix, we have some updated information as far as the interest rate sensitivity. We do show there for a 25 basis point increase, it\u2019s a $4 million to $8 million kind of benefit on each quarter for that rate increase versus with a lower beta, it would\u2019ve been a $12 million. And so that three basis points to four basis points is probably in the two basis points to three basis points range for each rate increase. And so we will continue to benefit from that. But also keep in mind what will continue to help support our margin is the rollover in that investment portfolio on the swap book, and each one of those should be additive as far as the overall margin impact.","John Pancari","Okay. And the progression of the NIM through the year?","Don Kimble","Well, what we\u2019ve said basically is there\u2019s one rate increase for June that\u2019s not reflected in the second quarter results. And the next rate increase is not until November, and so we\u2019ll have very little impact there. And so I would say, margin for the third quarter should step up a little bit, but in the fourth quarter probably relatively stable.","John Pancari","Got it. All right. Thanks.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.","Saul Martinez","Hi. Good morning everybody. Just following up on the deposit beta discussion, the 41% going to mid-50s. I assume your guidance is implying a mid-50% deposit beta both for the June and the November hike. Is that right?","Don Kimble","It\u2019s say that we\u2019re ramping up through the we\u2019ll see some of that drift into the fourth quarter. So I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be all there in the June rate hike in the third quarter, but our expectation would be at that level later in the year.","Saul Martinez","Got it. So, it\u2019s drifting up from the 41%, but it gets to a run rate with likely the November hike, if that comes to fruition, I guess.","Don Kimble","Right.","Saul Martinez","Okay. And then on, I guess related question on NIM. You had a very nice uptick in commercial loan yields, I think it was 19 bps. Commercial mortgages was up, I think, 15, 16 bps. Is that \u2013 should we think of that as being a result of the LIBOR fed fund spread. And if we do see that coming in, what does it mean? How do we think about C&I yields, CRE yields in \u2013 with each incremental hike?","Don Kimble","You\u2019re right. The second quarter, we saw average one month LIBOR up 32 basis points. So that was a little stronger than fed funds. And offsetting that, as far as the commercial loan yields, is a good portion of that $18 billion in received fixed swaps are pecked against that C&I loan yield. And so that minimizes the growth in margin from that perspective. And so third quarter will probably move more in line with what we see for the average one month LIBOR as opposed to fed funds, and you\u2019ll see that trend to continue.","Saul Martinez","Got it. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning.","Don Kimble","Hey, Erika.","Beth Mooney","Hey, good morning.","Erika Najarian","Just wanted to clarify, Don, your response to Saul\u2019s question. As I think about Slide 18 and \u2013 reflecting a deposit pricing beta that ramps up to 55%, does that compare to the 41% deposit beta you mentioned? Or is that compared to the cumulative 25% that you mentioned earlier?","Don Kimble","Compared to the 41%. Thank you for clarifying.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Okay. And the second question is, as we listened to Chris and all your other peers, it seems like the outlook for activity levels, especially for M&A, is quite strong in the second half of the year. As we think about potential upside surprises to investment banking and debt placement fees, what should we think about in terms of the incremental efficiency ratio for every dollar of revenue that we assume comes in through that line? Or am I thinking about it the wrong way and you\u2019ve already sort of accrued for some of the comp in the first half of the year?","Don Kimble","I would say, one, our outlook does assume the normal seasonal trends and some of the market indications as far as what we would expect from the second half of the year for revenues. And two, what we said as far as the expense correlation that \u2013 it is highly incentive-based. And so we said that for each incremental dollar in investment banking debt basement fees, there tends to be about a 30% increase in the corresponding incentive line item. And so you would typically see, for us, fourth quarter incentives as one of the higher levels, because we\u2019re also seeing investment banking debt placement fees at the higher level at that point of time in the year as well.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And we do have the question from the line of Kevin Reevey with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.","Kevin Reevey","Good morning.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","Kevin Reevey","So, it looks like you had very strong growth in your average CD balances of $100,000 and greater. Was that driven more by customers just seeking higher yields or was it that you have any rate specials during the quarter which drove that growth?","Don Kimble","Yeah. That CD category really is the first area of that of our retail customers are accessing to get the benefit from higher rates. And as far as the CD specials, we really don\u2019t broadcast or advertise. We really look at the relationship level as far as how we price the products. And so we do have attractive rate offers for those customers that are seeking that to get a little bit better yield. But I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re out in the market actively campaigning with teaser rates or overstated rates on the time deposit category.","Kevin Reevey","And then your pipeline, can you give us some color on your pipeline for the third quarter for investment banking and debt placement fees? It looks like your second quarter was exceptionally strong. And I know you mentioned that the fourth quarter is usually the strongest of the four quarters. How should we think about the third quarter?","Chris Gorman","Yeah. We always think about this business really on a trailing 12 basis. But having said that, since you asked about the third quarter, the discussions and activities we\u2019re having with our clients and our prospect are strong. I would characterize our third quarter investment banking and debt placement fee pipeline as being strong.","Kevin Reevey","And then lastly, with First Niagara behind you, have you \u2013 what\u2019s your appetite as far as acquisitions of depository institutions?","Beth Mooney","Yes, Kevin. This is Beth. And as we have looked at our capital priorities, we\u2019ve been very clear that while we believe First Niagara was a good use of our capital and has been additive to our franchise, we are focused on our organic growth strategies and preserving capital for that purpose and making sure that we support return of capital to our shareholders. We\u2019ve talked about targeting a dividend payout of some 40% to 50% and made a meaningful move with this year\u2019s CCAR submission as well as continuing to repurchase our shares, which we believe creates good value for our shareholders. And then to the extent we have other nonorganic uses we call the people, product and capabilities, and over the last year, I think you can see examples of where we feel, for example, a year ago, acquiring HelloWallet, bringing on Cain Brothers on to our platform in the fourth quarter, reacquiring and relaunching our merchant servicing businesses. Those are examples of how we see augmenting our franchise is appropriate uses of capital in lieu of not interest or prioritizing bank acquisitions.","Kevin Reevey","Thank you. Congrats on a great quarter.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","And at this time, it does appear there are no further questions in queue. Please continue.","Beth Mooney","Well, thank you, and we thank all of you for taking your time in your schedule to participate in our call today. If you have any follow-up questions, you can direct them to our Investor Relations team at 216-689-4221. That concludes our remarks for the day, and have a great day, everyone.

Davidson","Operator","Good morning and welcome to KeyCorp's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chairman and CEO, Beth Mooney. Please go ahead.","Beth Mooney","Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to KeyCorp fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. In the room with me is Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer; Chris Gorman, President of Banking, and Mark Midkiff, our Chief Risk Officer.","Slide two is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call.","Now, I am moving to slide three. As you have seen with our headlines this morning, Key reported strong results for the fourth quarter. And this finishes what has been a very successful year for our Company as we continued to grow, invest for the future and deliver on our financial commitments.","For the fourth quarter, we reported GAAP earnings per share a $0.45. Our EPS results included $0.03 from a pension settlement charge and costs associated with our efficiency initiative, which we refer to as notable items in our materials. Adjusting for the $0.03 of notable items, it brings our core earnings per share to $0.48 for the quarter. To provide a consistent view of our financial trends and prior period comparisons, my remarks this morning will focus on the adjusted core numbers, which exclude notable items in all periods.","Our strong fourth quarter built on the momentum we continue to see across our Company. Highlights for the quarter included solid revenue growth, well-managed expenses, strong credit quality with a meaningful decline in nonperforming loans and further improvement in criticized and classified loans. Improved efficiency and return measures, was both up almost 400 basis points from the year-ago quarter, and disciplined capital management, which includes returning a significant amount to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Don will spend more time on the fourth quarter detail, so I will focus most of my comments on our full-year performance. 2018 was our sixth consecutive year of positive operating leverage. Our return on average tangible common equity increased the exposure in the year, reaching 17.5% in the fourth quarter. For the year, we reached a record level of revenue of $6.4 billion, reflecting continued growth in loans and deposits, as well as achieving all-time highs in several of our fee-based businesses, including investment banking and debt placement fees. The growth in both spread and fee income reflects the breadth and depth of our business model and our ability to acquire and expand relationships with our targeted clients.","Expenses remained well-controlled as we drove efficiencies across our Company, while continuing to make investments in areas where we have targeted scale and reach. Yesterday, we announced an exciting new opportunity to build out our digital consumer lending platform with the acquisition of Laurel Road, which I will discuss later in my remarks.","Over the past year, we improved our cash efficiency ratio by over 300 basis points and we remain on a path to achieve our $200 million of cost savings target in 2019, which represents approximately 5% of our total expenses. We expect to reach our targeted cash efficiency ratio range of 54% to 56% by the second half of 2019. Our credit quality has remained strong with net charge-offs to average loans remaining below our over-the-cycle range of 40 to 60 basis points throughout the year and 27 basis points for the fourth quarter.","Our non-performing loans declined by over $100 million from the prior quarter and represented 61 basis points of period-end loans. The linked quarter improvement was consistent with our prior comment that the increase in our third quarter NPL level was temporary and was not indicative of a trend. Other credit metrics including criticized and classified loans, which we look to as leading indicators, improved again during the fourth quarter.","As noted in our recent Investor Day, during my time as CEO, we have dramatically enhanced our risk practices and improved our risk profile. We continue to remain consistent and disciplined in our credit underwriting and portfolio management, and we are committed to outperform through the business cycle. We believe that our steadfast commitment to maintaining our moderate risk profile will continue to serve us well. In terms of capital management, we have consistently delivered on our stated priorities of supporting organic growth, growing dividends and prudently using share repurchases. And consistent with our 2018 capital plan, we increased our common stock dividend by 62% in 2018 and our dividend yield now stands at over 4%. We also repurchased over $1.1 billion of common shares throughout the year. Key's common equity Tier 1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.92%.","Again, it was a strong finish to the year, we had broad-based growth across our franchise with record annual revenue and well-managed expenses that drove meaningful improvement in both efficiency and returns, and we maintained our moderate risk profile and continue to return capital to our shareholders.","Now, let me turn to the announcements that we made yesterday, and I am now moving to slide four. From a transaction standpoint, we have acquired the digital lending business from Laurel Road Bank. This business operates under the name Laurel Road and is a leading digital-first consumer lending platform, focused on student lending refinancing, primarily targeted at advanced degree medical professionals.","To be more specific, approximately 70% of the clients are doctors and dentists with another 20% being lawyers and MBAs. And the overall demographics of this target client base is extremely attractive, an average age of 33, average FICOs of 760, and income of approximately $185,000. Strategically, this is a strong complement to Key\u2019s approach of building targeted scale against specific client segments. Moreover, it closely aligns to our enterprise health care focus. And while this distinctive platform is on the path to having scale in the business with student lending, is also a concept we shared at our Investor Day. The Laurel Road team has been proactively expanding its product set to build broad-based relationships with these targeted clients and prospects. In the last year alone, the team has developed and launched personal and secured loans, mortgage and deposits, all delivered digitally on their industry-leading platform. ","In October, we also shared our views on the power of strategic partnerships to execute our strategy. Laurel Road believes this as well and has constructed a network of over 150 affinity partners with whom they are the preferred provider to these targeted client segments. The winning formula for clients, partners in Laurel Road matches our model and our clients, the way we at Key approach this business.","Over the past several years, we have spent significant time, developing a distinctive partner capability. In that process, we have interacted with many different fintech teams and other potential partners. And to-date, we have not yet found a business model or a management team with whom we are this closely aligned, which was a critical factor in our desire to engage in this transaction as well as the alignment with our relationship strategy targeted in an attractive and complementary client segment.","And with that, let me turn the call over to Don.","Don Kimble","Thank you, Beth. And I'm now on slide six. As Beth said, we reported fourth quarter net income from continuing operations of $0.45 per common share. Adjusting for two notable items, a pension settlement charge and cost related to our efficiency initiative, primarily severance, earnings per share was $0.48. Our adjusted results compared to the $0.36 per share in the year ago period and $0.45 in the third quarter. The severance cost this quarter which totaled $24 million was due to early actions taken to achieve or $200 million cost savings target and reach our cash efficiency ratio goal of 54% to 56% by the second half of 2019. I will cover many of the remaining items on this slide in the rest of my presentation. So, I'm now turning to slide seven.","Total average loans of $89 billion were up 4% from the fourth quarter of last year, driven by growth in commercial and industrial loans, which were up 9%. Linked quarter growth in average balances was primarily from commercial industrial loans as well as commercial real estate. Importantly, our growth continues to be driven by building and expanding core middle market relationships in our targeted areas. Our business model positions us to offer our clients a wide range of financing alternatives, both on and off balance sheet. In 2018, approximately 16% of the total capital we raised for our clients went on to Key\u2019s balance sheet.","Our C&I lending continues to be broad-based, done through our footprint as well as our targeted industry verticals. Commercial real estate where we saw some balance sheet growth this quarter is primarily an originate-to-distribute model that drives fee income and strong returns while providing flexibility in managing portfolio risk.","In the fourth quarter, we placed $5 billion of commercial mortgage loans in the market and a total of over $13 billion for the full-year 2018. In 2019, we expect to continue to grow loan balances as we support our relationship clients. The tone and sentiment with our clients remains positive and our pipelines remain solid. That said, we remain committed to our moderate risk profile and we will continue to walk away from business that does meet our risk parameters.","Continuing on the slide eight. Average deposits totaled $108 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018, up $2.3 billion or 2% on annualized compared to the third quarter, and up 4% from the same period one year prior. The cost of our total deposits was up 11 basis points from the third quarter, reflecting higher interest rates as well as the continued migration of our portfolio in the higher yielding products.","Growing deposits and being core funded remains foundational to the way that we run our business. We experienced strong deposit growth this quarter, both consumer and commercial by consciously using market rates in a very-targeted way to retain and deepen existing relationships with our best clients. As important, we are not acquiring new rate sensitive deposits only business.","As expected, our deposit betas continued to move higher. The incremental beta in the fourth quarter was 60%, bringing our cumulative beta to 33%. On a linked quarter basis, deposit growth was primarily driven by the penetration of our existing retail and commercial relationships as well as short-term and seasonal deposit inflows. We continue to have a strong, stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting for 61% of our total deposit mix.","Turning to slide nine. Taxable equivalent net interest income was just over $1 billion for the fourth quarter 2018 and net interest margin was 3.16%. These results compared to taxable equivalent net interest income of $952 million and a net interest margin of 3.09% for the fourth quarter of 2017, and $993 million and 3.18% in the third quarter.","Purchase accounting accretion contributed $23 million or 7 basis points to our fourth quarter results, this compared to $26 million or 9 basis points in the third quarter, and $38 million or 12 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding purchase accounting accretion, net interest income was up $71 million or 8% from the fourth quarter 2017. The increase was largely driven by earning asset growth and our positioning to benefit from higher interest rates. Net interest income excluding purchase accounting accretion increased $18 million or 2% from a prior quarter, benefiting from earning asset growth and higher loan fees, partially offset by higher deposit betas. The net interest margin was negatively impacted by deposit growth exceeding loan growth for the quarter and excess funds were deployed into the investment portfolio.","Moving onto slide 10. Key's non-interest income was $645 million for the fourth quarter 2018, compared to $656 million for the year-ago quarter and $609 million from the prior period. Comparison from a year-ago period reflects record results for investment banking and debt placement fees in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the sale of our insurance business in the second quarter of 2018. We continue to see positive momentum in many of our fee-based businesses with linked-quarter increases and trust and investment services, investment banking and debt placement fees and corporate services. That said, investment banking and debt placement fees achieved a new record level in 2018 as we continue to experience strong growth across our capital markets platform. In the fourth quarter, our results benefited from strength in our commercial mortgage and M&A advisory. Corporate services income increased as well, reflecting higher derivatives and trading income, and trust and investment services income grew, largely due to stronger brokerage commissions.","Turning to slide 11. Fourth quarter non-interest expense was $1.012 billion or $971 million excluding notable items consisting of a $17 million pension settlement charge and $24 million of efficiency-related expenses. This compared with $1.098 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, which included $85 million in notable items and $964 million in the prior quarter.","The table on the bottom left side of the slide breaks out the notable items incurred in both the current and year-ago periods. Compared to the prior quarter, noninterest expense increased $48 million on a reported basis or $7 million excluding notable items. This $7 million increase reflects higher business services and professional fees and higher other expense, partially offset by the elimination of a quarterly FDIC surcharge.","Business services and professional fees reflect a number of corporate initiatives related to CECL, our payments business and technology enhancements. Over half of the increase in other expense related to the pension settlement. Other expense in the fourth quarter also included higher operational losses, insurance reserves, and additional investment in our payments business, along with other seasonally elevated expenses.","As Beth said, we remain committed to our $200 million cost savings target this year, and reducing reported expenses by low single-digit range. We expect to reach our cash efficiency ratio target of 54% to 56% by the second half of the year.","Moving on to slide 12. Our credit quality remains strong, and we continue to be consistent and disciplined in our underwriting. Net charge-offs were $60 million or 27 basis points of average total loans in the fourth quarter, which continues to be below our over-the-cycle range of 40 to 60 basis points. The provision for credit losses was $59 million for the quarter. As expected, nonperforming loans were down this quarter with NPLs declining by $103 million from the prior quarter and now represents 61 basis points of period-end loans. Other leading indicators, such as criticized loans and delinquencies, all showed improvement this quarter.","Turning to slide 13. Capital also remains the strength of our Company with the common equity Tier 1 ratio at the end of the fourth quarter of 9.92%. As Beth mentioned earlier, we have remained true to our capital priorities, including returning a significant amount to our shareholders.","Quarterly common share dividend increased by 62% over the past year from $0.105 to $0.17 per share. And we continue to repurchase common shares, which totaled $278 million this quarter and over $1.1 billion for the full-year 2018.","On slide 14, we've provided our outlook for 2019. This builds on our performance in 2018 and reflects our expectations for another year of strong positive operating leverage and continued momentum across our Company.","Average loan balances were expected to increase to the $90 billion to $91 billion range, once again driven by our commercial businesses. Average deposits should continue to grow, reaching the $108 billion to $109 billion range. Net interest income should be in the $4.0 billion to $4.1 billion range. And our outlook assumes no interest rate increases in 2019. We expect that noninterest income will be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion with growth in most of our core fee-based businesses. We also look for another year of growth in our investment banking and debt placement business.","Additionally, we expect noninterest expense to be down low-single-digits from a reported 2018 level, in the range of $3.85 billion to $3.95 billion. This range includes a realization of the $200 million in runaway cost savings and reaching our targeted cash efficiency ratio of 54% to 56% in the second half of the year. Keep in mind, the outlook includes the impact of our Laurel Road acquisition, which adds approximately $50 million to the range.","We see nothing on the horizon that changes our expectations on credit quality with net charge-off and provision expense remaining below our targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points. Our loss loan provision should slightly exceed our level of net charge-offs to provide for loan growth. And our GAAP tax rate should increased slightly to the range of 18% to 19%.","Our guidance also assumes some variability over the course of the year. First quarter will reflect an expected decline related to seasonality including a lower day count and customary step down in capital markets activity from strong fourth quarter levels. Additionally, first quarter carries an increase to the employee benefits costs, which will elevate personnel expense by about $30 million. Our guidance also includes the impact from Laurel Road acquisition as Beth discussed. Laurel Road, as mentioned earlier, we'll add less than $50 million to both income and expense in 2019 and will be dilutive by approximately $0.02 for the year and accretive thereafter. The near-term dilution reflects a change from their gain-on-sale model to our plans to place these attractive loans on our balance sheet.","With the expected mid-year closing and the gradual build-up of our loan balances in the second half, it will also have a very-modest impact on our full-year loan growth. While adding slightly to our efficiency ratio in the first year, it does not change our commitment to reach our cash efficiency ratio target of the 54% to 56% in the second half of 2019.","Overall, 2019 should be another good year for Key, building on our momentum with strong operating leverage, focused risk management and continuing EPS growth.","On the bottom of the slide are our long-term targets. We are already operating within the range of 3 of the 4 measures and believe we will reach our efficiency ratio during the year. That said, we have significant upside remaining to improve returns and deliver value to our shareholders. We remain confident in our ability to continue to move toward the top tier of our peer group and believe over time, the market will recognize our progress and improved results.","I\u2019ll now turn the presentation back over to Beth.","Beth Mooney","Thanks, Don. And before moving to the Q&A, I'll make a few closing comments. Despite the volatility that was experienced late in the year, I am pleased with our results and the momentum we have and share Don\u2019s confidence in our outlook.","Over the past several years, we have made incredible progress across our Company and we have delivered a step change in our financial performance. And we are now approaching peer leading levels of return while remaining disciplined with risk and capital. In the fourth quarter, we increased our return on tangible common equity target to 16% to 19%. And as Don pointed out, we remain on a path to achieve our long-term targets.","Our stock valuation however does not reflect our stronger performance, competitive positioning and improved risk profile. We continue to believe that Key offers a compelling investment opportunity, given our track record and focus on sound, profitable growth supported by a dividend yield of over 4%.","I remain optimistic about Key's future, and I'm proud of the momentum and accomplishments of our team in 2018. And as we look forward, we are well-positioned to grow revenue, to control and reduce expenses, manage risk, drive further efficiency improvements, and ultimately drive higher returns for our shareholders.","I will now turn the call back over to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of our call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And first from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","Scott Siefers","Good morning, everyone.","Beth Mooney","Good morning. ","Scott Siefers","Hey. Don, quick question just on the cost outlook, a lot of moving parts this year. You guys typically have I guess more seasonality in the quarterly cost base, just to begin with, given the investment banking component. And we're layering in the acquisition, but then you have the cost savings. So, I was just hoping you could maybe give a little more color on how you would expect the quarterly base to kind of traject the flow throughout the year. In other words, is there a quarter like the 2Q that represents high-water mark and then we start to come down or would the fourth quarter be the low water mark for the year and that we get the run rate cost savings, and how do you see that all panning out?","Don Kimble","Great. And like you said, there are number of moving parts. One, we did highlight the first quarter; we do expect to see a pick-up in expenses, reflecting the $30 million of higher benefit cost. Now, that would be offset slightly by the impact that we expect investment banking to have placement fees be lower in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, which tends to be high point. But, those two items will impact the first quarter. Or as our continuous improvement, our efficiency improvements we\u2019re making, we should see some small amounts come through in the first quarter, start to build in the second quarter, and really for the second half of next year majority of those $200 million in run rate should be reflected in our expense levels. And so, we would expect to see the improvements come through there.","Laurel Road, we talked about having an acquisition in mid-year of \u201819, and that really is what drives that roughly $50 million in expenses. And so, you would see that in the second half of the year. So, that would minimize some the bottom line reduction as far as expenses that we will be achieving on expense savings, but still would -- in my mind show probably the low point in expenses being in third quarter and fourth quarter being up a little bit just to reflect the seasonality we typically see in our capital markets related revenues really typically be stronger. But, again, I think those all combined still get us to that 54% to 56% efficiency ratio range in the second half of the year. ","Scott Siefers","Okay. That's perfect. Thank you for that. And then, just a quick question on the margin outlook. So, you had little liquidity build that you discussed. In the slide presentation, you note that some of the deposit inflows were kind of short-term and\/or seasonal. So, one, how does that all play out? I imagine some of that\u2019s securities portfolio that comes down if the deposits are indeed seasonal. But, would that allow the margin, maybe to see a little lift here in the near-term, as an offset?","Don Kimble","We would say that our margin outlook for \u201819 would be relatively stable with what we're seeing for \u201818. And I think \u201818, we're at 3.17 for the full year and 3.16 for the fourth quarter. And so, they're both pretty tight already. But, we do think that there could be a little bit of improvement in the overall liquidity positions. But, right now, our guidance would suggest the deposit growth with about equal loan growth. And so, we don't see a significant change in the overall liquidity position. And we're not also including any assumed rate increases for \u201819. And so, we wouldn't see a lot of lift from that either.","Operator","Next, we go to Peter Winter with Wedbush. Please go ahead. ","Peter Winter","Good morning. ","Beth Mooney","Good morning. ","Peter Winter","I was just wondering, when I look at the loan growth in the fourth quarter, it was more broad-based than what we've seen in the past, which was more reliant on C&I. I\u2019m just wondering if you can give some color behind the change, and do you think that\u2019s sustainable going forward?","Don Kimble","I think if you're looking at average balances, Peter, that you would see a growth in commercial real estate. And what you would have seen is some of the building of the portfolio in the third quarter going into the fourth quarter for some of the loan sales we typically have. And we talked about for the quarter we sold about $5 billion worth of commercial real estate balances. And on slide 21 -- or page 21 of the earnings press release, you can see that for the quarter, our total loan sales were $5.5 billion. And that's quite a statement, given the challenge in the markets and what we're able to accomplish for our customers. And so, it was more of a timing issue for that commercial real estate balance. But, we continue to see some growth in consumer categories, mainly the indirect auto. And our expectation is as we integrate with Laurel Road, we'll start to see some other components of loan growth there as well and later \u201819 also.","Peter Winter","And just a follow-up. Can you talk about maybe some potential flexibility you might have to fund loan growth? The loan to deposit ratio has been steady. I'm just wondering if you would let that kind of trend upward or maybe use securities and excess liquidity to maybe fund some of the loan growth and putting some less pressure on deposit costs.","Don Kimble","Good question. And I would say that we are very-focused on having our balance sheet core funded. And we're doing that through growth in our deposits with our existing customers. And so, we're not out there trying to get wholesale deposits that -- and more of a digital channel base. So, we're growing those with our existing customers and adding to those relationships, deepening those relationships on the deposit side. And we continue to do that. And our outlook, as I mentioned, would suggest that loan growth and deposit growth are about equal for next year, and we like it that way. Now, my preference longer term is to have a little bit higher loan-to-deposit ratio and have less liquidity on the balance sheet to put near term. We're not seeing that in our outlook.","Operator","Our next question is from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. ","John Pancari","Good morning. ","Don Kimble","Good morning.","John Pancari","On the loan growth. Just looking at the commercial trends, end of period versus average, it doesn't appear that you saw a lot of a benefit at all from the capital markets seizing up in December. Some of the other regionals have seen some benefit from that. Did you -- could you just talk about it, if you saw that at all, if that could impact the outlook at all? Thanks.","Chris Gorman","John, it's Chris. We actually did not get the benefit of that impact. As we look across our book, our clients are doing very well. Some of our clients actually at the end of the year paid down part of their loans. And as Don mentioned, we had a really, really strong quarter as we moved $5.5 billion of financings off our balance sheet. So, we did not see a pickup in loan balances, based on what was going on in the capital markets.","John Pancari","That's helpful. And then, just to confirm one thing on the expense side. I'm pretty much sure I know the answer here. But, the midpoint of your expense guidance of about -- for 2019 of about $3.9 billion, that\u2019s up a bit from the midpoint of what you implied of your range that you gave coming out of your Investor Day, about 3.85. And that change is mainly the Laurel Road -- incorporating the Laurel Road. Is that correct?","Don Kimble","100% of the gap, yes. Laurel Road adds about $50 million to our expense base outlook for 2019.","John Pancari","On an annual basis? Okay.","Don Kimble","It\u2019s for the -- the full-year impact of \u201819. If you look at Laurel Road for an entire year, it would be north of that $50 million number.","John Pancari","Got it. But, your cash efficiency ratio range remains intact, because you're also dialing in the revenue impact from Laurel Road, correct?","Don Kimble","That is correct.","John Pancari","And what is that, how much is the revenue?","Don Kimble","Well, what we said is that we expect Laurel Road to be about $0.02 dilutive. And so for that $50 million and revenue -- or excuse me, expenses, it would imply about a $20 million revenue number for the year. And the reason for that gap is we're converting it from a sale model or loan sale model to retain type of model.","John Pancari","Got it. Okay, thank you. Then lastly, on the credit side, you're charge-off guidance still for well below the -- or below the 40 to 60 through cycle basis-point range for charge-offs. Can you give us little more color? I mean, how long you think it'll turn below that when you look at the portfolio? And why not get more specific at this point in the cycle in terms of your charge-off guidance?","Don Kimble","I would say that as we look at our portfolio today that it\u2019s still very, very good, very solid. And in this last quarter, we talked about our non-performing loans being down; our criticized and classified loans were down $300 million to $400 million as well. And so, we're seeing continued improvement in the trends there. And so, we don't see anything that would change significantly from where we're at now. I'd say, as far as down the road, multiple years, I don\u2019t know, Mark, do you have any insights or thoughts you'd add to that?","Mark Midkiff","I only would add that we're obviously at a very low level, and continue to be at a low level as we kind of move into \u201819.","Don Kimble","And we're just not seeing early indicators that would suggest that\u2019s going to change anytime soon. So, I'd be reluctant to put a timeline out there.","Operator","And next, we\u2019ll go to Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ken Zerbe","I guess kind of a follow-up on Laurel Road acquisition. I just want to make sure I fully understand this. So, they no longer do gain on sale. So, everything that they originate, presumably, I'm going to say 100% student lending, that goes onto your balance sheet and that I guess new balance sheet growth drive this $20 million this year of revenues. And then does it just continue to layer on as you grow that? And then kind of what size or target balances would you expect over the next year or two or three?","Don Kimble","Put things in perspective there a little bit that Laurel Road originated about $1.2 billion in total loans this past year. And I would say that the credit quality and the nature of those loans, and more importantly the nature of those relationships we think are consistent with our targeted customer base and we\u2019re very excited about that. And it goes beyond just the student loans as well that they've already implemented a mortgage lending capability and they've looked at other products that could add to that offering as well. And so, it really is more of a relationship strategy for us than just the student loan origination.","So, we do believe that we\u2019ll continue to have the opportunity to put those on balance sheet and we'll see that annuity continue to build as that portfolio continues to mature and develop over the next couple of years.","Ken Zerbe","Got you. Okay. And would you anticipate continuing any part of the gain on sale model or is\u2026","Don Kimble","I think that's an option for us. And I would say that where we see a good quality relationship, we\u2019ll probably retain it. But one of the things we talk about is their ability to originate mortgage loans. And if it's a conforming mortgage loan that we will probably sell that in the secondary market, like we do with our existing portfolio. So, I think that's more of our approach going forward.","Ken Zerbe","And in terms of the yields that you would get on these new originations, like how do they compare versus your current portfolio yields? Where are they at generally?","Don Kimble","I would say, generally, they're a little stronger than some of our consumer loan yields today. And I think it provides a nice upside for us.","Ken Zerbe","And then, just really last question. In terms of the tax rate, it looks like it jumped up about -- sorry, for your guidance, looks like it\u2019s about 2 percentage points higher than where it was this year. Any reason for that?","Don Kimble","I would say that the primary driver there is an outlook for a lower tax credits from some of the business models we've deployed in the past. And so, it's just a slower rate of that. And also with the higher level of earnings, the incremental earnings growth is really taxed at the marginal rate, and that helps drive that tax rate up as well.","Operator","Our next question is from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O\u2019Connor","I guess, I thought -- I would have thought the expense outlook, at least the high-end might have been a little bit lower, because if we look at it versus this year, it implies relatively flat costs. I know you've got the acquisition that adds 50, but you also have about 70 million of one-timers this year that you called out. So, it just seems like, if you kind of adjust all those things, the high-end of your expense outlook is for relatively flat costs. And I can appreciate that some of the initiatives are stated in or phased in kind of throughout the year. But, just from Investor Day, it seemed like there was real effort to shrink the cost base on a full-year basis.","Don Kimble","There clearly is that effort, Matt, looking -- and we'll go back and look at the math on that. But my math would have shown that even on the high end, we've been down about 1%, and at the low-end, we would be down about 3%. So, we think that's right in the ZIP code of what we talked at Investor Day. But, I can confirm that, Matt.","Matt O\u2019Connor","And then, just a swing factor of that $100 million, is it just on depending on what revenues are, or do you have a scenario where at the high-end of your revenue range, and the low-end of the expense range, if you can realize all your cost savings?","Don Kimble","I would say the primary driver of movement within that range is tied to the revenue growth, and what we're seeing from movement in the markets and also from our core business model. So, what we\u2019ve talked about in the past is that we can adjust that expense based on what we're seeing as far as the economic outlook and what we see as the revenue growth. And part of that expense base does assume a reinvestment back in the business. And that's one of the levers that we can pull is to slow that investment if we don't see the kind of upside from -- vantage from those investments.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Steven Alexopoulos","To start on deposits, if we look at the 108 billion to $109 billion guidance for deposits, Don, what's the underlying assumption for non-interest bearing deposits in that guidance?","Don Kimble","The assumption there is we would continue to see some slight reductions in those balances throughout the next year. And that's primarily in the commercial side where we continue to see those customers migrating more of their deposit mix over to the interest-bearing as opposed to non-interest bearing. I think this year, we saw 1% to 2% kind of decline. And I would say, it\u2019s something along those lines and probably consistent with our outlook for next year.","Steven Alexopoulos","And then, when we look at the expense guides, are there any additional efficiency related charges such as severance included in this guidance or is this operating guidance?","Don Kimble","This is operating guidance that we wouldn't expect those efficiencies charges to be significant for next year. We would probably see something continue about the same level of the notable items we have this quarter throughout the first half of next year.","Steven Alexopoulos","And then, finally, so you guys have been cutting expenses obviously for many years. How much longer do you think you can run with expenses in this flat to down pattern? Once we get past the $200 million, is there wood left to chop or do expenses start drifting higher at that point?","Don Kimble","You must have been talking to some of our line managers, try to push back on some of the targets. But, I would say that generally many of these savings are really taking a look at how we can make our existing processes and workflows more efficient, and going from this customer back office and seeing how we can either use technology to help achieve those or just process redesign. And this $200 million will pull out a chunk of those but we still believe there is still ammunition left to use for that.","The other thing is that even though this $200 million does include some acceleration as far as from the branch consolidations, just because of the changes in our consumer behaviors that we still think that they'll be on -- continue to provide some efficiencies from right-sizing that branch distribution as well.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. And that\u2019s sounds like 2020 guidance, but it sounds like even beyond the second half, there's still room for you guys to keep pretty significant downward pressure on expenses. Is that right?","Don Kimble","We can manage those, so we can continue to generate nice positive operating leverage in the future. You're right.","Beth Mooney","And Steve, we talk about it and have talked about it publicly, as journey of continuous improvement. And as you think about how we\u2019re aligned, how we go to market, technology, digitization of the enterprise, process improvement, all these are things that will be continually part of our focus. This is not a one and done.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay, great. Thanks for all the color.","Operator","The next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Hi. Good morning.","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","Erika Najarian","Sorry to reask Matt\u2019s question another way. I\u2019m just trying to figure out why the stock got down when the market opened. So, in terms of your outlook, it seems like consensus is at the lower end of your net interest income range, at the midpoint of your fee income range, and at the low end of your expense range. And I guess, I just wanted to confirm that that's fair. And so, any move up in the range on expenses will have to do with better revenues?","Don Kimble","I would say that as far as our outlook, one thing that consensus would not have reflected was Laurel Road. And we talked about there\u2019d be a slight dilution from that of $0.02 a share. And our expense guidance, again, the range is more tied to what we would see from a revenue perspective. And so, if revenues are up, we would expect to probably at the higher end of the range, given some the cost to support that.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And regarding Laurel Road, I think, if you get the question, is really now the time to layer in consumer risk on your balance sheet given that we're late cycle, Beth, you write-off some the statistics in terms of income and FICO that were quite compelling. I'm wondering sort of what additional layers in terms of underwriting do you plan to -- due to enhanced, the process Laurel Road has today, especially as you're going to go to a retention model rather than originating sale.","Mark Midkiff","I would offer -- this is Mark Midkiff. I would just offer that we do think that what we've seen at the underwriting is very sound and very complementary but obviously will be under our lens and our buy box. And I think that will be very focused around relationship where we get just better overall credit performance than when you're working at a transactional level. So, that will be an enhancement. And of course, we've looked at this on a stress basis and feel very comfortable overall relative to our risk appetite as well. It\u2019s just kind of a normal ongoing outlook for losses in that business.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And just one more question, if I can. Beth, you noted strong dividend growth of 62%. Given where your stock price is trading relative to your return potential, I'm wondering if your CCAR ask for 2018 -- sorry 2019 would perhaps be more focused on buyback than dividend growth.","Beth Mooney","Erika, obviously, we are in the early days of starting to look at CCAR 2019. And we have always been talking over the last couple of years of supporting dividend growth, and this year we were approaching that 40% dividend target payout ratio. But, we will definitely look at the mix and make sure that whatever we choose for this year's capital return that we are really optimizing our use of capital for our shareholders and that would be a consideration.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And one more, if I can. As we think about first quarter trust and investment management income, fees rather, Don, I'm wondering there\u2019s like a 9% step down in AUM. I'm wondering what the stepdown would be in the first quarter to reflect that stepdown in AUM?","Don Kimble","We could see some very modest pressure on that line item for first quarter, but generally in line with what were shown in the fourth quarter levels.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Geoffrey Elliott","Hello. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Could you give us some thoughts on the investment banking and debt placements line? How do you think that could evolve across a range of scenarios, one where we kind of stay in tough markets like we encountered in December, and then, another, where we get something more akin to what was experienced over the last few years?","Chris Gorman","This is Chris Gorman speaking. So, that's a line that we're really proud of fact that we've been able to consistently grow over the last decade. Obviously, it's market-dependent. As we see the markets right now and as the markets are currently functioning, we believe we will continue to grow that business in 2019 as well. That's a business that we grew -- we grew that top-line this year 8% in a down market. If you go back to 2015, we've grown that line 46%. So, it's a business that is based on client relationships; it's based on serving clients; it's based on serving many of the same clients many times. So, we feel good about where we're positioned with respect to our investment banking and debt placement line.","The interesting thing, if the markets seize up a bit, that's when it could get more interesting for us in terms of opportunities to put things on the balance sheet and serve our clients.","Mark Midkiff","As Don mentioned in his comments, we only put about 16% of the capital we raised last year on our balance sheet.","Beth Mooney","And I would just add that part of what I have always felt is a strength of our platform and some piece of how we look at our outlook against investment banking and debt placement fees. While market sensitive fees obviously is the breadth and depth of our platform, again, we have a broad range of capabilities and we are not dependent on a certain area of the markets. And given that it\u2019s relationship based, midmarket, we do have the option to balance sheet but we also can do a variety of things across advisory fees for M&A. We do loan syndication, debt placements, equity raises, sponsors, we do -- in our commercial mortgage business we have such a breadth in that platform that we really do have confidence that can generally produce those kinds of results.","Geoffrey Elliott","Thanks. And then, if I could squeeze in a quick one on Laurel Road. I guess, there is quite a few banks who\u2019ve got similar sorts of businesses, Citizens has got something, First Republic's got something. SoFi isn\u2019t a bank, but I think is active in that space. What is it that makes Laurel Road different from those other platforms out there that at high level it kind of feels like the customer bases is the same 33-year old doctor or dentist with good FICO?","Beth Mooney","We anticipated that we might have an opportunity to speak more holistically about the strategic fit as well as the strength of this platform and why we found it attractive. So, I have asked Clark Khayat, who is in the room and really spearheaded this transaction for us and spoke to this at our Investor Day. I'm going to ask Clark to share. We are very excited and think this is a highly disruptive not only demographic but relationship based and differentiated platform. And with that I'm going to identify that Clark is in the room and ask him to take that question.","Clark Khayat","Thanks, Beth. So, I guess I\u2019d answer it a couple of ways. One, as we talked about in October, we hit on a couple themes, two of which were distinctive platforms, the other was targeted scale. So on the distinctive platform front, this is a very compelling end-to-end digital platform. So, contrary to many others, it's not just the digital entry point, it is legitimately end-to-end, highly efficient, highly customer oriented. And just as a side note, they enjoy NPS scores on a consumer side that are high 60s, low 70s, which are numbers that frankly most banks just do not enjoy. And that is a function of the process and flow and experience they've built on this end-to-end platform. So, we do think that is quite distinctive relative to others.","You noted the customer focus and we've talked to targeted scale by identifying client segments with whom we want to do business. This one we do think is different than most, even though others may reflect those sort of demographics. And I think a fair bit of this is driven by a very extensive partner network they've built that positions them as sort of partners with these trade associations, member entities, other groups to talk directly to those end users in a way that we think is quite distinctive to the way a broad, mass market business might work.","So, there's more to that. But I think to your question, those two points in particular I think were the most compelling to us and give us confidence that that we not only like this customer base but that we have the opportunity to continue to grow it intelligently, leverage the partnership network they\u2019ve built. And then, as Beth noted, they have begun to build an extension of products for these clients based largely on the clients asking for them. So, the opportunity to not only be a compelling single product provider but then to build sustainable, durable and long-term relationships that are more broad-based across product sets with this attractive client basis is another thing that's very consistent with our relationship strategy. So, we just think the complement to the way Key thinks about its businesses and the way Laurel Road has built this platform, we just haven't seen ones that are as consistent and compelling as this for us.","Geoffrey Elliott","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.","Saul Martinez","Hey. Good morning. Look, I hate to beat a dead horse with the expenses. But, I think the communication on the guidance is really important. So, Don, when you say low-single-digit decline, I assume you're basing that off the GAAP reported number of $3,975 million. Is that correct?","Don Kimble","That's correct. Yes.","Saul Martinez","Okay. So, during the course of the year, you called out about $75 million of non-core items. You have next year about $36 million, by my calculation, or $35 million, something like that of FDIC expense charges that are not going to be there. So, those two things alone get you to about $110 million. Obviously, you have the Laurel Road of $50 million. But, net-net, it looks like on an operating basis, the core number is closer to like 3.9, 3.91, [ph] which kind of suggests that your guidance isn\u2019t really -- doesn't imply any reduction in expenses, if you use the midpoint of the range. So, I guess, my question is, what am I missing in terms of the moving parts? Because, like I said, if you kind of make these adjustments, it doesn't seem like there's any real reduction on a nominal dollar basis, on an operating basis?","Don Kimble","Take $3.975 billion for the full year and backup the one-time charges, and then add to that $50 million for Laurel Road, it\u2019s $3.925 billion. I'd say that the midpoint of our range would be about 2% below that. So, I think that we are showing reductions in the non-interest expense. And as we highlighted at the Investor Day that that one -- the low-single-digit decline also reflected the benefits of the FDIC special assessment reduction.","Saul Martinez","It just doesn't seem like it's all that impressive, the midpoint versus kind of the core number, but fine. I guess, just second question, the -- just to change gears a little bit. Obviously, a lot of attention in the market on leverage loans, and can you just remind us how much of your exposures here, how you manage risks? How you manage your exposures either -- both as a lender and any indirect exposures you may have through other CLOs or BDCs or anything like that?","Chris Gorman","Sure. This is Chris. Let me address kind of how we approach the leverage finance business. First of all, we are focused exclusively on the industries in which we play. So, we know exactly who we want to do business with. In terms of that portfolio, it's about 1.8% of our assets and it's a portfolio that has a lot of visibility and a lot of velocity. We feel really good about that portfolio, based on all the metrics and frankly all the time we spend looking at it. So, it's a portfolio that has been flat literally since before we grew our asset base by 40% when we bought First Niagara. Mark, would you add anything?","Beth Mooney","And I would just add, it is client based, it\u2019s our capital markets business, we manage it to be a fixed amount. We do not allow it to grow, we recycle capital within that. Mark will talk about some of the credit attributes, but it is therefore eight client relationships where we are leading activities on behalf of our capital markets, and we manage it very rigorously. And it is a very small portfolio relative to our balance sheet.","Mark Midkiff","Yes. And it\u2019s -- I would only add consisted -- in terms of fundings, it hasn't moved around a lot. We haven't changed market. It is relationship-based, as Chris said. And then, as Beth said, recycle capital, but also very consistent in terms of leverage turns, debt-to-EBITDA, leverage has been very consistent and stable for a long time.","Beth Mooney","And we said that portfolio is $2 billion or less at any given time.","Operator","Next question is from Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Terry McEvoy","Good morning, everyone. A question on Laurel Road, if that business does a $1.2 billion of originations like it did last year and all of it\u2019s held under balance sheet, does it swing from 2% dilutive to something accretive at that point? Or maybe asked another way, what's the breakeven size in terms of balance sheet size for that business to contribute to the bottom line?","Don Kimble","What we've said, I think just was the assumption that we acquired at midyear that we'd only have a half year\u2019s worth of production next year and we would expect it to be accretive in 2020 and beyond. So, it's a fairly short window, as far as the dilution impact to the acquisition.","Terry McEvoy","And then, how does Laurel Road potentially change your tech spending budget, which I think from your Investor Day was $700 million, $800 million? Were you investing in student platform? And is that platform scalable or something with their technology that can be utilized at Key to offset some of the tech spending expected this year?","Don Kimble","Part of the $50 million in expenses that we're assuming as far as the increase is really continuing to have Laurel Road maintain the same kind of pace of investment they've been making from the digital platform. And we'll continue to include that in our assumptions going forward.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to David Long with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","David Long","Good morning, everyone. Maybe my first question for Chris. Just the discussions that you're having with your larger corporate customers related to using Key\u2019s balance sheet versus the capital markets, has there been a change in tone in those conversations over the last few months?","Chris Gorman","David, there really haven't been. I mean, when we are out talking to our clients and our prospects, we're constantly figuring out what is the optimal approach for them to take. And those discussions really haven't changed markedly in the last several months. Obviously, there were periods of time in December where markets were dislocated and people were putting off deals. But, the strategic discussions that we're having with our clients are ongoing and they're constructive.","David Long","Got it. Thanks for that color. And then, Don, not to beat a dead horse again on the expenses, but the guidance that you've given with the efficiency, that cash efficiency ratio target, that's based on an operating or core basis, not on a GAAP basis. Is that accurate?","Don Kimble","We would say that for the second half of the year that we shouldn't have a lot of notable items. So, our expectation is that they should be one and the same for the second half the year as far as the efficiency ratio.","Operator","Next question is from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Mike Mayo","So, help me with my thinking, I almost see a contrast. So, most of the largest banks are expanding digital consumer banking outside of their footprint, right, Citigroup, JPMorgan, Bank of America, PNC, U.S. Bancorp. And just remind us where you are in expanding with digital banking outside your footprint. And on the other hand, now you have Laurel Road, which is leading with consumer lending and looking to go from a single product to multiple product relationships. So, I\u2019m wondering you have gathering deposits out of footprint by a lot of your competitors and now you're going to be trying to leverage lending outside of your footprint, perhaps you get more deposits or just help me with that thinking.","Clark Khayat","Hey, Mike, it\u2019s Clark Khayat. So, as Don said earlier, and I think this is the most critical point to hit, we are really focused on being core funded. So, we are not looking to use this platform or frankly or any other platform at this time to drive out of footprint deposits for the sake of deposit. So, we would, as you noted, sort of use the Laurel Road platform out of footprint to drive consumer relationships and lending and where it make sense, continue to expand that relationship with the deposit but we want the deposit in the case where we have a broader relationship with that client. So, but, we continue to think about supporting client relationships with deposits. We did that we think very effectively in the fourth quarter. And as we move forward, whether it's in footprint or out of footprint, we do have lot of commercial clients outside of the footprint today, the branch footprint. We would continue to look to raise deposits, as long as those clients have broader relationships.","Mike Mayo","And then, I guess, Don or Beth, what is the impact that you're seeing in your markets from the other large banks expanding into your MSAs with digital banking? And I guess, you're not really seeing anything yet, but there is that threat you'll see more competition today over the next five years. Are you worried about that, are you preparing for that, are you looking to strike back with more efforts of your own?","Beth Mooney","Well, clearly, we are developing our own digital banking capabilities for our own clients. So, this is not where we would gap relative to the offerings that we see of other banks coming into the market who come in a digital only platform. And we would certainly have every product and capability for own clients in addition to a branch network in addition to our brand that we have in our markets. So, we feel well positioned. And we will continue to invest in our digital capabilities, this being Laurel Road as an example of where we do believe it accelerates our platform both from lending as well as the potential for deposit taking, and that we do believe in the near-term we see adequate core funding in our markets to support our strategies. And we compete very well because we certainly have the capabilities; we certainly have the ability to more broadly serve those clients. And so, we do not feel gaped in our capabilities.","Operator","And we'll go to Kevin Reevey with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.","Kevin Reevey","Good morning.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Kevin Reevey","So, Beth, the follow-up on the last question related to mobile and digital. What kind of adoption rate do you see with your existing client base? I know you guys have made a lot of investments in that area.","Beth Mooney","Kevin, I don't have those numbers off the top of my head. So, I'll apologize for that. But, I do know that we've had very strong adoption and transactionally, as everyone has reported years ago, what happens in a branch versus what happens mobile and digitally those line crossed. And there is no growing back. It is clearly a customer preference to be able to transact their business. And you may recall, several years ago with First Niagara, in advance of that integration, we deployed all new customer portals across every -- from commercial to consumer to our private banking clients to new digital platform that enables that. And it is a very, very robust platform. Additionally, we have our financial wellness, which is a digital-led experience as well that we have consciously made sure interacts with our branch experience. But that platform was a digital -- and you may recall several years ago, we purchased HelloWallet to really help facilitate that. So, we have looked at this as how do we create not only the ability to transact in a mobile and digital world but also how can you have relationship attributes including advice and planning through our HelloWallet. So, it is an area where we are canting and following and making sure we support our customers\u2019 preferences in that regard.","Don Kimble","We've even expanded it into business banking. So, as we think about digital, as we think about digital origination, as we think about wellness, we've taken the technology and the capabilities and expanded that in obviously into our business banking arena as well.","Kevin Reevey","And then, with that said, how are you thinking about looking at your branch network and rationalizing your brick and mortar footprint?","Chris Gorman","This is Chris. Last year, we took out 38 branches, I think this year 2009, (sic) [2019] you can expect us to really ramp up in that regard. We feel like we're pretty good at it. As we went through First Niagara, we rationalized the fleet. We think with the technology, with the digital capabilities that we have, we have the capability to keep our clients and thin out some of the branches. And you'll see us actually step that up this year over last year.","Kevin Reevey","And then one last question related to the government shutdown. Are you seeing any of the effects of that in your local markets at all?","Beth Mooney","At this point in time, we are not seeing the impacts broadly in our markets, but we have done a variety of measures to be able to make sure that we can both reactively and proactively support customers of ours who are impacted directly by the partial government shutdown. And we have targeted programs or special assistance for those who have various types of loans with us. We're aggressively waving fees and have introduced a loan product with a very low rate to help create liquidity for those who may be impacted by a disruption in their income. So, we are making sure that we too are in the banking landscape to be responsible to help support the employees that are impacted by the partial shutdown. But from a loan perspective from disruptions in markets more broadly, we are not yet seeing that.","Operator","And with no further questions, I'll turn it back to you, Ms. Mooney, for any closing comments.","Beth Mooney","Again, we thank you for taking your time from your schedule to participate in our call today.

It covers our presentation materials and comments, as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call.","Turning now to Slide 3. Our results in the second quarter reflect the clear progress we have made in implementing our growth initiative, improving our cost structure and executing on our capital priorities. Year-over-year, revenue grew for the fifth consecutive quarter with current period results benefiting from our branch and credit card portfolio acquisitions, loan growth and lower funding costs.","Revenue trends compared to the first quarter were relatively stable with flat loan balances, with stronger fee income from commercial clients who are taking advantage of favorable capital market conditions. And because of our distinctive model, we were able to capture the economics from these transactions while doing what was right for our clients.","During the second quarter, we also continued to invest to drive future revenue growth. We acquired a commercial servicing portfolio and added to our special servicing business. This allows us to leverage our existing platform and meaningfully changes the competitive profile of our commercial loan servicing business, positioning us as the third largest servicer of commercial and multi-family loan and the fifth largest special servicer of CMBS in the United States. The first phase of the transaction closed as expected at the end of June.","We've also continued to invest in our online and mobile offerings. In the second quarter, we launched new remote deposit capabilities for both our commercial and consumer clients, which add value and convenience, consistent with changing client preferences. Reducing our cost structure and improving efficiency also remain among our top priorities. From the launch of our expense initiative 1 year ago, we have achieved annual run rate savings of $171 million, a substantial portion of the $200 million target we committed to reach by December of this year. Importantly, reaching our target will be a significant milestone but not an endpoint. We are already identifying new opportunities to both grow revenue and reduce and variabilize our expenses. And as we previously communicated, we expected this quarter to be the high point in terms of charges associated with our efficiency plans. Consistent with our guidance, we incurred charges of $37 million, with a large portion related to the realignment of our Community Bank and the consolidation of 33 branches.","In the second half of the year, we have another 14 branches identified for closure, which will bring our total to approximately 7% of our total branch networks. As a result, noninterest expense was down $45 million from the prior year, excluding the charges for our efficiency initiative, as well as costs related to our recent acquisitions of credit card in the Western New York branches. And as Don will discuss, our cash efficiency ratio adjusted for the efficiency charges was 65.4% this quarter, just above the upper end of our near term goal of 60% to 65%.","And finally, we continue to manage our capital consistent with our stated priority. During the second quarter, our board approved a 10% increase in our common share dividend, and we executed on our share repurchase program by buying back $112 million in common shares. This is consistent with our 2013 CCAR submission, which places us among the highest in our peer group for estimated payout ratio.","And as we look forward, capital management will remain a clear priority. Along with improving our operating leverage, we're both executing on our revenue initiatives and improving our cost structure. Now let me turn the presentation over to Don for some details on our financial results. Don?","Donald R. Kimble","Thank you, Beth. Slide 5 provides highlights from the company's second quarter 2013 results. This morning, we recorded net income from continuing operations of $0.21 per common share for the second quarter, compared to $0.21 for the first quarter of 2013 and $0.23 for the second quarter of 2012. And importantly, as Beth pointed out, we incurred $37 million or $0.03 per share of costs associated with our efficiency initiative this quarter. I'll cover many of these results in my remarks, so I'll now turn to Slide 6.","Average total loans for the second quarter were up $70 million or an annualized 1%, compared with the first quarter of 2013, and up $3.3 billion or 7% compared to a year-ago quarter.","Loan growth continues to be impacted by cautious client behavior, a competitive environment, and as Beth mentioned, the attractiveness of capital markets alternatives, which are well positioned to deliver to our clients. Our outlook for loan growth remains positive and consistent with our prior guidance of mid-single-digit growth for the year driven by CF&A.","Continue with Slide 7. From the liability side of the balance sheet, average deposits, excluding foreign branch balances, were up $1.7 billion for the first quarter and up $4.6 billion from 1 year ago. Deposit growth for the first quarter was primarily due to an increase in demand and interest-bearing commercial deposits, including higher balances from some of Key's larger clients. Compared to the prior year, deposit growth also benefited from Key's acquisition of branches in Western New York.","Over the past year, our mix of deposits has significantly changed, with CDs declining and lower-cost transaction accounts increasing 13%. As a result, year-over-year deposit cost declined from 47 to 26 basis points.","Turning to Slide 8. Our taxable equivalent net interest income was $586 million for the second quarter compared to $589 million for the first quarter and $544 million for the second quarter 1 year ago. Compared to the second quarter of last year, net interest income increased $42 million or 8% due to growth in average earning assets, which included our recent acquisitions, and an improvement in funding cost. I would also point out in the second quarter of 2012, Key's results reflected the impact of the early termination of leverage leases. These transactions reduced net interest income by $10 million but provided a gain of $31 million in noninterest income, resulting in a net pretax gain of $21 million.","For the second quarter, the company's net interest margin was 3.13% compared to 3.24% in the first quarter and 3.06% from the second quarter of last year.","As you can see on this slide, the decline in net interest margin from the prior quarter was primarily due to lower earning asset yields and higher-than-expected levels of liquidity resulting from softer-than-anticipated loan demand and higher levels of deposits.","The higher level of deposits and as resulting impact on liquidity and investment securities was the primary difference from our prior guidance, as it reduced our margin by approximately 5 basis points. The net interest margin also was impacted by the termination and maturity of $4.4 billion of interest rate swaps that were not replaced as we continue to increase our overall asset sensitivity. Importantly, the use of interest rate swaps provides us with the flexibility to manage and quickly adjust our rate risk position. While Key was a little off with other asset-sensitive banks generally benefit from a rise in both short-term and long-term rates. The duration and characteristics of Key's loan portfolio and also investment portfolio position us to realize more benefit from a rise in the shorter end of the curve.","Recognizing that asset yields remain under pressure and given our higher levels of liquidity, we expect net interest margin to experience modest pressure in the range of 1 to 3 basis points per quarter in the second half of the year. We anticipate for the balance of 2013, loan growth will exceed deposit growth, which should result in a relatively stable net interest income.","Slide 9 shows a summary of noninterest income, which accounts for approximately 42% of total revenue. Noninterest income in the second quarter was $429 million, up from $425 million in the first quarter, but below the $457 million in the second quarter of last year. Adjusting for the $31 million gain from the leverage lease terminations in the second quarter of 2012, noninterest income would be slightly higher than in the prior year. Additionally, principal investing gains were down year-over-year.","Many of our core fee income categories have shown strength through the second quarter. Investment banking and debt placement fees continue to grow and are up 46% on a rolling 4-quarter average basis as we continue to do more business with our commercial clients and win market share.","And cards and payment income is up 35% compared to the same period 1 year ago, reflecting our investment in and our focus on payment products, including our reentry into the credit card market during the third quarter of last year.","Turning to Slide 10. Noninterest expense for the second quarter was $711 million. The increase was expected and driven by several factors. Importantly, as I mentioned earlier, expenses for the quarter included $37 million in charges related to our efficiency initiative. Compared with the same period last year, expenses increased $18 million. Included in the current period expense, along with the charges for our efficiency initiative of $37 million, were costs of approximately $26 million associated with our 2 acquisitions completed in the third quarter of last year. Excluding these 2 items, expenses for the quarter were $45 million lower than the prior year.","Overall, we are seeing the benefits from our expense initiative come through to the bottom line. As Beth commented on earlier, we have captured approximately $171 million in annualized savings as of June 30.","During the quarter, we closed 33 more branches and aggressively continued with other efficiency initiative implementation plans. We also incurred additional expense from marketing associated with our spring home equity campaign and for contract programming as we continue to implement new technologies. We continue to expect that expenses will decline to the $680 million to $700 million range by the fourth quarter of this year. Included in this forecast are efficiency initiative charges of approximately $20 million.","Turning to Slide 11. Our net charge-off declined to $45 million or 34 basis points of average total loans in the second quarter. Overall, gross charge-off declined and recoveries remained strong. Total commercial loan charge-offs remained low at 5 basis points of average loans. The breakdown of asset quality by loan portfolio is shown on Slide 18 in the appendix.","We anticipate that net charge-offs will remain at or below the lower end of our targeted range for the balance of the current year and for provision expense to be near the same level.","At June 30, 2013, our reserve for loan losses represented 1.65% of period-end loans and 134% coverage of nonperforming loans.","And turning to Slide 12. Our tangible common equity ratio and our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio both remained strong as of the end of the quarter at 9.96% and 11.2% -- 11.25%, respectively. Earlier this month, regulators approved the final rule for implementing the Basel III regulatory capital standards. The mandatory compliance date for Key begins in January of 2015 with transitional provisions extending to January of 2019. Our current estimate of Tier 1 common equity as calculated under the final rule was 10.8%, which exceeds the fully phased-in minimum requirement.","As Beth mentioned, during the second quarter, we also repurchased $112 million or 10.8 million shares of common stock. And the board increased our common dividend 10% to $0.055 per share. We also expect the Victory divestiture to close during the third quarter. The after-tax realized gain, which was originally estimated to be $145 million to $155 million, is now expected to be in the range of $100 million to $115 million. We anticipate the cash portion of the gain to be between $75 million and $90 million. The difference from the original estimate is due to higher-than-expected client attrition that has taken place during the consent process, which is difficult to predict. Key has received no objection from the Federal Reserve to use the cash portion of the gain for common share repurchases. The remaining amount of the gain is expected to be considered in our 2014 CCAR submission. That concludes our remarks, and now I will turn the call back over to the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A segment of the call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Let's begin with Steve Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'm curious. On the expenses with $171 million of the cost saves already in the run rate at the midpoint of the year, is this a function of getting to the $200 million in targeted cost saves more quickly? Because I thought originally you were saying more of this is going to come in the back half of the year. Or is it a function of the opportunity for cost saves potentially being above $200 million?","Donald R. Kimble","Steve, this is Don. And as far as our cost save projection, you are right. $171 million is probably earlier than what we would have initially expected. We are very focused on delivering against our plan. I think that it's important to note that even once we achieve this, this is more of a milestone as opposed to the endgame. And we do believe that once we implement our initiatives to achieve the $200 million, we'll continue to be looking for additional opportunities to improve the overall efficiency of the company.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Just one separate question, on the sale of Victory, Don, could you review again why is the gain now estimated $40 million to $45 million lower? And then could you just review again the timing of when you expect to buy back the stock related to the cash portion of the gain?","Donald R. Kimble","Sure. The reason for the lower amount of gain is that throughout any sale of an asset manager, there is a consent process that occurs. And during the time period, the customers have the ability to consent to the transfer or not. We have seen greater attrition from that process than what we would have expected, which is resulting in a lower gain for us. Our expectation is the transaction will close here in the third quarter, and then we can initiate share repurchases once the transaction's closed equivalent to the cash portion of the gain.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So the buyback's in 3Q for this?","Donald R. Kimble","That would be our expectation as far as timing, yes.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Bob Ramsey with FBR.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I just -- or maybe I wanted to follow up a little bit on the buyback to be sure I'm thinking about it the right way. If you all have approval for $426 million plus the $75 million to $90 million from Victory less the $112 million you did this quarter, rough math tells me you've got about $390 million left over the next 3 quarters. Should we think about that -- one, is that right? And then two, should we think about that equally distributed over the next 3 quarters? Or will you do the Victory piece sooner since you'll have that gain in the third quarter?","Donald R. Kimble","A couple of minor tweaks. One is that the $112 million did include some share repurchases associated with some employee benefit plans. And so the net number for the current quarter was about $103 million. And so that would be the portion that will be tied up against the $426 million of total purchases. Generally, it is fairly consistent throughout the 4 quarters. The timing of the Victory purchase would probably be more accelerated than spread out throughout the rest of the year.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay, great, that's helpful. And then just a couple of follow-up questions on the guidance you gave. I think you've said provision should be near the same levels on the back half year. I was just curious if that's the same level as this quarter or the same level as the first half of the year.","Donald R. Kimble","Good clarification question, that is our guidance would be more equivalent to the charge-off level so that we will not be anticipating changes and provision being significantly different than charge-offs.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay, I got you. And then also, I think you gave expense guidance, but I missed. It was $670 million to, I think, you said $690 million including efficiency charges, but I couldn't quite catch that number.","Donald R. Kimble","The number was $680 million to $700 million and including about $20 million of onetime charges.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Erika Penala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to ask Steven's question another way on the expense side. As we look out to 2014, do we think of the run rate, quarterly run rate for next year sort of that $680 million to $700 million range minus the $20 million of inefficiency charges? And if so, if that's the right base, are you growing core expenses from there? Or is the message that maybe additional savings will offset any investments back into the business?","Donald R. Kimble","Erika, this is Don. And as far as the outlook into '14, we really haven't provided guidance out into that range yet. But I would suggest that we are going to continue to focus on efficiency improvements beyond achievement of the $200 million. And we would expect to be able to utilize some of those savings for further investments in the business to drive growth. And so as we start to wrap up our outlook for next year, we'll provide more guidance on that.","Beth E. Mooney","Erika, this is Beth Mooney. I would just add that as we have -- are obviously closing in on that $200 million target, which we have done at a quicker pace than I think we would have anticipated a year ago with a lot of focus and energy by our teams. We've been intentional in talking about efficiency ratio because I think that's important that you recognize that we are focused on what we can do to both drive revenue, as well as lower our cost and variabilize our cost base and also focus on including [ph] an operating leverage through these investments, the strategic things we do within our businesses.","Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And just a question on Slide 8, given that this has been a big topic among the investor community. The 2.5% increase in annual NII, I mean the 200 basis point rate simulation, is that a parallel increase across the curve or is that just a short end? And also could you give us a sense of what you're assuming in terms of spread compression and deposit runoff in that scenario?","Donald R. Kimble","As far as the assumption, it's a 200 basis point increase over the 12-month period on a consistent basis across the curve as opposed to one and\/or the other. And as far as deposit compression, we do have assumptions as far as the level of participation in our deposit rates going up in this rate environment. I would suggest that we believe that the market will probably underperform that, meaning that the rates will probably go up on the deposit side slower than what we generally think our models would include.","Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And on the spread side, on the loan side, given your comments on deposits, do you think that spread tightening, that could follow an increase in benchmark rates and also slow?","Donald R. Kimble","Yes. Our model would assume, at this point in time, keeping spreads in a general same range as what we're seeing today, which is probably about 25 basis points lower than what we were seeing a year ago. So we have not anticipated further compression beyond that at this point.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jennifer Demba from SunTrust Robinson.","Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just wondering if you could give us some color on what your customers are -- current customers are acting these days given you only had sort of stable loan growth on a linked quarter basis. What's your feeling -- what are you seeing and what's your feeling on the economic improvement in the pace?","Christopher Marrott Gorman","Sure. Jennifer, this is Chris Gorman speaking. What we're seeing on the part of our clients is they're cautious. Their businesses are performing well, but one of the -- I think one of the real telling points of the cautiousness is we're not seeing really a pickup in utilization, but we continue to see, for example, very strong deposit growth, which I think is kind of one of the things I would point to. The cautiousness, obviously, relates around just some of the uncertainty, the 1-or-so percent GDP growth that we're seeing. So I think they're fairly cautious, but at the same point, I think they're all performing fairly well. So that's what we're seeing from our clients.","William R. Koehler","Okay. Jennifer, this is Bill Koehler. The only thing I would add to that, as you can imagine in the Community Bank where we're focusing on smaller companies, they feel a little more susceptible to potential changes in Affordable Care Act, any lingering effects from sequestration because their businesses just aren't as broad and diversified as some of the larger corporate kinds we have. So you can imagine that they are very careful about how they're choosing to invest right now.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Josh Levin with Citi.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Your shares have run up quite a bit and I was wondering, as you think about your CCAR for the remainder of the year, does the share price appreciation affect how you think about buying back shares?","Donald R. Kimble","We do, on an ongoing basis, evaluate our share repurchase activity based on price and overall return. But I would say at this point that we still believe it's appropriate for us to continue to purchase Key shares and are very excited about the opportunity to deploy capital in that way.","Beth E. Mooney","And Josh, this is Beth Mooney. I would just underscore that I continue to believe even at these prices, our shares are an attractive purchase and return of capital to our shareholders.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And going back to the loan growth, I think when we came into the year, I think Key and your competitors, you all sounded pretty optimistic about loan growth picking up in the second half of the year. But now it sounds like you and your peers are all sort of dialing back expectations for loan growth for the second half of the year. What's changed? I mean, why are your consumer -- your customers less confident now than they might have been, say, 6 months ago?","Christopher Marrott Gorman","Josh, this is Chris Gorman speaking. I think all the things I just mentioned, I think, clearly impact our customers. The other thing about our business model that impacts our loan growth is we, depending on what the market is, we have competition not only from other banks that are very competitive from a perspective of price, structure, tenor, limits, but we also have competition from other capital sources. So for example, in our real estate business in the first half of the year, we raised a total of $18 billion of capital, but very little of that actually hit our balance sheet because we were placing that capital elsewhere acting as agent not as principal. Now the interesting thing that could happen is we get these changes in interest rates when you think about the steepness of the curve and you think about what's going on with interest rates. Some of that, as we go forward, some of our clients may elect the best option may be to put it on our balance sheet going forward. So there's really a lot of puts and takes. There's been a ton of liquidity just across all markets. And when it's right and it fits our moderate risk profile, we clearly are putting it on the books. But other times, we're actually looking for other people to provide other types of securities.","William R. Koehler","Josh, I would only add -- this is Bill. If you look at the economic data, it's been relatively volatile month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter in terms of inventory build or inventory drawdown. If you look at rates, the comments that have come out by the Fed and the impact that has on rates, that only creates uncertainty in the market that our clients are reacting to and trying to figure out how to invest against.","Beth E. Mooney","But, Josh, we do feel good about our mid-single-digit guidance for year-end our loan growth.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Todd Hagerman with Sterne Agee.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just perhaps a question for Chris and Beth. I just want to follow up on the commercial servicing, in part the purchases that you announced. One is basically given what we've seen in terms of commercial loan growth, so to speak over, say, the past 4 quarters, I would have expected to see a little bit more transparency in terms of the growth in that business given your position. And then secondly, based on the purchases at this point in the expected close, how should we think about kind of the potential revenue capture there, as well as the offset in terms of expenses?","Christopher Marrott Gorman","Todd, it's Chris. Let me give you kind of an overview. As Beth mentioned in her initial remarks, this was a very important acquisition for us because it made us the #3 servicer of CMBS, but it also made us the #5 special servicer. And as we think through the cycle and you think to the next real estate cycle, we initially actually thought we would be named special servicer on 47 billion. As it's turned out, because there are a lot of moving pieces, we're actually named special servicer on 52.4 billion. In terms of the conversion, it's right on target. We converted the first 3,900 loans on the 24th of June, and we picked up about $700 million in deposit. So we did give some clarity on that. We also, this weekend, will convert another batch of loans that will represent $300 million in deposits. We've never given a lot of numbers around it. One of the things I will share with you though is you can imagine what the change in interest rates if you look at the MSRs. While we liked the deal initially, kind of the 2 things that have happened to the positive is, a, we're executing on time. And the next, the other thing is we have a little -- we have more in terms of special servicing. And lastly, with the change in interest rates, obviously, that has an impact on the value of the MSRs.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. And then as I combine that with the sale of Victory, for example, which I know the impact is not significantly material. But as I take a step back and think about this purchase and how significant it is, I would suspect that as you look towards the back half of the year that, Beth, you would expect to be able to grow revenue year-over-year at relatively a healthy pace, so to speak.","Beth E. Mooney","Well, Todd, as you've seen, I think we have done a variety of things to both invest in our businesses as well as make sure we're supporting our organic growth to acquire and deepen client relationship. This particular acquisition I do think both brings in stable funding, as Chris outlined, about $1 billion of incremental deposits. It is a market where scale matters. And moving to #3 servicer, we think, puts us in a position to be in good stead for whatever activity is out there in the CMBS market in terms of new issuance, as well as fee income out of special servicing. And as we look at Victory, it did not align with our relationship strategy. We continue to think strategically that it is a good move and that Key was not the best owner for that asset. And they'll look forward to doing a lot of things of the gain proceeds, particularly the cash portion we expect to realize in the quarter to return that capital to our shareholders.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","The commercial servicing platform acquisition, how much did that add in the second quarter for revenues and expenses and earnings?","Donald R. Kimble","Mike, this is Don. They really did not add a whole lot to the closing of that initial phase as late in June. So we'd see more of the benefit from that going into the third quarter.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Can you size that a little bit?","Donald R. Kimble","Now that we've provided much detail there that again, it's going to be both in the form of deposits and also some fee income. And we would not provide any additional clarity there.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Okay. And the margin going down a couple basis points for the rest of the year, what's the impact of the $3 billion of CDs that are maturing for the next 2 quarters? And then you have another $3 billion next year. I guess that's offset by the pressure on the asset yields. Can you elaborate?","Donald R. Kimble","I sure can. No, as we've said, we were down 11 basis points this quarter, but 5 of that came from excess liquidity. And also 2 basis points came from reduction of our swaps. And so we don't believe that either one of those will be negative nearly to the same extent that we experienced this quarter. As far as loan yields, they were down 6 basis points in the current quarter. About 2 basis points of that was related to loan fees, which tend to be a little difficult to predict as far as the timing of those. And so normal core loan yields were down about 4 bps. Then we would expect the deposit repricing to add about 2 basis points back to the margin as we see some of those higher-cost CDs mature. And so the net of those, of the 4 basis point decline in the earning assets and the 2 basis point improvement in the cost of funds is really how we get to that 1 to 3 basis point outlook per quarter going forward.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","And then my main question relates to the growth initiatives. Don, you're -- I guess this is the first call you've been on as CFO. And it'd be great to hear about your philosophy for controlling expenses, improving efficiency. Beth, I know you said this is a milestone, not a stopping point for your efficiency targets. What's the plan ahead? When do you guys meet? I guess you probably have budget planning meetings later this year. Can you give us some sense of the ultimate target? And I'll just note, I mean the expense guidance you gave for yearend, on a core basis, it looks like not a lot of these expenses are hitting the bottom line. So just any color you can give.","Donald R. Kimble","Mike, this is Don. And you're right, this is my first call. It's day 45 today, so still learning as we go here. But I think the approach that we're using here is very appropriate, that we are keenly focused on driving positive operating leverage and driving improved efficiency for the company. As far as how I think that we're going to see that improvement efficiency come through, it's really from 4 levers. One is executing against our existing plan and making sure that we deliver that to the bottom line. And then from that point forward, showing a continued discipline to make sure that we remain focused on additional efficiency improvements, not necessarily having stated targets of $200 million here or $150 million there, but driving this is as a part of the core culture of the organization. Second, we need to get more productivity from our existing resources. And that's both people and also our distribution and technology. And so that will help drive some of the efficiency for us as well. Right now, our third item is our balance sheet efficiency. We're at 84% loan-to-deposit ratio. That is a real drag on us as far as the overall efficiency ratio and margin. And we need to see improvement in that going forward. And some of that improvement will come from the additional productivity I just talked about. And the fourth component is interest rates. Just like every other bank in the country, these low rates are painful as it relates to our margin and also our efficiency ratio. And when we think that returning to more normal rates will drive our efficiency ratio down somewhere between 300 and 400 basis points. And so that will be a big plus for us. So this isn't an endgame as far as our $200 million of cost saves. It's just the start of a foundation, and the team around here is very focused on delivering it. We have weekly meetings, and it doesn't go by without each of those meetings talking about some of the initiatives that we're taking on and the success that we are as far as executing against it. And contrary to what you said, I would believe that we are showing this drop to the bottom line. In the second quarter, what we've demonstrated that we got a $45 million improvement in expenses year-over-year backing up the impact of our acquisitions and these onetime cost. So that, on an annualized basis, was $180 million. And that's real money for us. And we think that we will deliver existing future improvement from that as well.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Bryan Batory - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","This is Bryan Batory from Ken's team. I was wondering if you guys could us a sense of just timing for how the remaining swap portfolio rolls off and what the asset sensitivity profile would look like without the swap portfolio.","Donald R. Kimble","Sure. We had, as of the end of the first quarter, about $20 billion in interest rate swaps. About $15 billion of that was related to our asset liability management. That dropped by $4.4 billion this quarter. And so as far as those that are usually -- are used to hedge our loan book, it's down to about $11 billion. The average life of that is 2.3 years. And for that $11 billion to come off the balance sheet, it would probably take that 2.5% asset sensitivity all the way up to about 8% would be my best guess. So it's a meaningful impact to overall asset sensitivity.","Bryan Batory - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And just one quick one for Chris. Can you just give us a little bit of color on what the investment banking pipeline looks like relative to last quarter and the same quarter last year?","Christopher Marrott Gorman","Yes. Bryan, as we look at it, the investment banking pipeline, as we look year-over-year, is stronger than it was at this time a year ago. So assuming -- what's interesting about our business model is when all the markets are working perfectly, it's not as -- it's harder for us than when you get some volatility as we've had in this market, because our business model enables us to go from one type of financing to the other. So -- and then, of course, we go to market with senior-level people talking to these middle-market companies. So our pipelines are up from a year ago. And actually, some of the turbulence that we've experienced in the market since the beginning of May is actually in many ways helpful to us.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Marty Mosby with Guggenheim.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask about the asset sensitivity and the increase of that sensitivity about 25% from a 2% hit to a 2.5% advantage in the sense of you increasing that asset sensitivity. Was that in line with where rates were back in the second quarter? Do you feel like you're going to continue, like you said, if the swaps run off, that number would explode up to 8%? Are you going to manage that at this level? Or are you going to kind of think about increasing asset sensitivity? Or do you have enough of a yield curve to start using some of that now?","Donald R. Kimble","Yes, Marty, this is Don. And as far as the asset sensitivity on an organic basis, our balance sheet will migrate to much more asset-sensitive over time. We do believe that we're going to be conservative in how we position the balance sheet. That if you would've asked me 3 years ago where rates were going, they were going nowhere but up. And I've been wrong since then. So I don't like taking big bets. But we could see that asset sensitivity drift up a little bit. Our expectation is over the next, say, 18 months, we would start to see some of the short end of the curve maybe move up as well. And so we'd like to be in a position to better benefit from that. I think that the one advantage that we do have is given the relative size of that swap portfolio, we have the ability to shift our asset sensitivity much quicker than many of our peers. And so we think that we have a lever there that we can pull to be much more responsive to that overall effort. Keep in mind too that, that swap book has a fairly short life. And our investment portfolio is fairly short in duration as well, but it's at 3.2 years even with rates going up. And so we intentionally manage the balance sheet so that we can capture the benefit of those rate increases fairly quickly.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then, Beth, just a follow-up question on the efficiency ratio. If you finish out the $200 million, under my estimate, it would add -- improve your efficiency ratio by another 2 percentage points, down to around 63, which puts you right in the middle of your range. So going forward, I know you're still kind of talking or gauging it, but when the momentum, if you can get some revenue growth and start to see some of the other things, loan growth coming back, would you still feel like you would migrate towards the maybe lower end of that range over the next couple years?","Beth E. Mooney","Yes, Marty, this is Beth. As you've correctly noted, part of what we committed when we unveiled this a year ago was that our intent was to be within a near term target of 65% on our efficiency ratio, and that we would achieve that target by the first quarter of 2014. As the time in the intervening quarters has played out, we have realized our expense savings faster than we would have thought a year ago. And I think you're seeing evidence of that as we are now already at the upper end of that 60% to 65%. As we go into next year and we finalize our plans, and as Don said, we are instituting this notion of continuous improvement and the cultural change in terms of how we drive not only our cost structure but our productivity. Those are the sorts of things that will drive further improvement within that range. So I would tell you that with revenue momentum, with productivity, with cost efficiencies, we are very much top of mind that 60% to 65% is a near term target and that we believe clearly, obviously, we're on a path to meet our commitment of being there by the first quarter of 2014.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Beth, when you look at your Tier 1 common ratio, obviously it's very strong under the Basel III interpretation. Now that we have that, and you folks are not obviously in the top 8 banks, what kind of Tier 1 common ratio are you comfortable running at since you're going to be required to hold 7? Maybe there's a small SIFI buffer of 25 basis points that will be assessed to KeyCorp. But what number do you think is a comfortable level as you go forward?","Beth E. Mooney","Well, Gerard, I'm going to also let Don augment my answer here. I will tell you that clearly at 10.8 is our estimate, if you were to phase in the Basel III rules as they've been released, we well exceed the 7% floor, as well as any SIFI buffer that would be appropriate. I think we've always talked about our capital as both currently having an opportunity to continue to return to our shareholders what is more than needed even with a phase-in of the rules. But we would also talk in terms that we would also always want to have our own operating buffer for a variety of reasons as well. So we are well positioned. I think Key is -- continues to be purely [ph] in its capital levels, which includes a lot of flexibility for us in the future as we go through our plans. But I'm going to let Don talk a little more about his thought into the ranges.","Donald R. Kimble","Sure, Gerard. And I think that we do have one piece of the puzzle has been solved for us with the new rules. I would say that, that's only one component. So we really haven't stated what our objectives are as far as long-term capital position publicly. One of the other variables that does impact that is the stress test. And I think the stress test will probably result in larger buffers than what's publicly stated as part of Basel III. And so we just need to make sure that we continue to understand what the impact is there and what level of capital that we feel comfortable operating at beyond that. I will tell you that we all believe that our capital position is very strong and with the position that it's in at this point, that we do have the ability to continue to return levels of earnings to the shareholders that are probably in excess of our peers just because we do believe that we're operating from a position of strength at this point.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Do you guys expect to publicly disclose to us at some point what those levels will be when you take into account CCAR so the market will know that you're very comfortable at an 8.5% number or whatever it is?","Donald R. Kimble","Yes. We will disclose at some point in time more guidance. But I don't know -- I wouldn't want to project the timing of that at this point.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just as a follow-up to all of this, if your buyback -- obviously you received approval from CCAR. Would you guys use a special dividend as a way of accelerating the return of capital to shareholders if you thought your stock price did get too high?","Donald R. Kimble","My understanding, and I haven't reviewed this since I've been here, but my understanding is that the non-objection relates to a cash dividend component and then also to a share buyback and that the share buyback cannot be substituted for a onetime cash dividend.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","No, no, I agree. But going forward for '14 and '15, you sit down and think about what you want to apply for. Philosophically, you guys think about a special dividend because I see your capital is going to be accumulating, if growth remains modest, very rapidly. And would you consider that as an alternative for giving it back to shareholders?","Donald R. Kimble","Yes. With our 80% combined payout, if you look at the total payout compared to the Street consensus at the time that the CCAR was announced, that should translate to us continuing to leverage our capital position. You can see in the last quarter that we did see slight declines in some of our capital ratios. And it would be difficult for me to speculate what might be available to us under CCAR 2014. So I'll go silent at this point.","Beth E. Mooney","And Gerard, I would just add, as you know that [indiscernible] there usually is more insight into what will create acceptable plans. And it's really too soon to have any visibility into that.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Alan Straus with Schroders investment firm.","Alan Straus","I think you did a good job controlling what you can control in this environment. When your customers don't want to borrow money, you don't want to just make bad loans. But could you comment on the mortgage servicing business? Do you see any ability to get some loans out of those customers? Or is this really more just servicing and gaining deposits?","Christopher Marrott Gorman","So, Alan, it's Chris. There's -- we have -- there is an opportunity when you service loans to convert some of those into borrowing customers. Candidly, in the past, we have not been real successful in doing that. Basically, the economics stand on their own in terms of servicing rights. Well, I think the more interesting opportunity is this whole notion of this big pool where we're named special servicer. And as named special servicer, these will be loans that need to be restructured, Alan, where we don't have any capital, but we can be the solution to the problem without having any exposure to it. That, I think, is even a better -- a more interesting opportunity as we look forward.","Beth E. Mooney","Special servicing drives fee income so that you get paid for the various activities. So it is an interesting book to continue to build special servicing rights.","Donald R. Kimble","And for example, you could raise junior capital, et cetera.","Alan Straus","Right. I mean, your investment back should be teed up or are you hiring there in the investment bank on the special servicing side?","Donald R. Kimble","Well, Alan, we haven't hired on the special servicing side per se, but we clearly have ramped up on our real estate investment banking side over the last several years, including hiring people that are experts in raising private capital. In the real estate business, it's often called JVs. But we have a whole team of people that raise noncontrolled junior capital for developers. So the answer is yes.","Beth E. Mooney","And Alan, I would just add, one of the things, as we look at these various things, they create opportunity for us to leverage what we think is a very distinctive platform. So we have the capacity to do a number of these things without necessarily having to increase headcount as it goes back to this notion of how to think about efficiency that Don outlined, that it's not just efficiency in cost, but it's efficiency of your balance sheet and efficiency of your platform that we can put more throughput in it.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brian Foran with Autonomous Research.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP","I guess -- Don, I apologize. I guess I'm probably going to screw up this description. But your old -- in your old role a couple years ago, there was a swap transaction where, if I understand it right, that the benefit was kind of pulled forward. There was a stair step down and the life was shortened and you end up more asset-sensitive at the end. But the benefit of the swap income kind of shortens up. Can you just remind us, when you talk about levers you can pull on swaps, is that something that's always available or was that transaction kind of unique to that point in time?","Donald R. Kimble","That transaction was not unique. It was basically terminating swaps early. And then you can go back in and enter into new swaps over a longer duration. So we did terminate some swaps early this quarter. That of the $4.4 billion, I believe $2.5 billion were early terminations or thereabouts. And we decided not to go back in and enter into new swaps. And so we allow the asset sensitivity to increase as a result of that. And by being more proactive, I think it's much easier for us to reposition our asset sensitivity by managing the overall swap book than it is for any other asset class on the balance sheet. So for instance, you can get more asset-sensitive by selling out of your investment portfolio. But that will result in a gain or loss on the security. And then you have to figure out what to do with those proceeds. On the swaps, you can just go ahead and terminate those, and that automatically switches your balance sheet to being more asset-sensitive. And so that's why I think that we're fortunate here in the way that Key has positioned its overall balance sheet and interest rate position to be able to leverage that swap book a little bit more disproportionately than many of our peers might be able to.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP","And you touched briefly on it, but do you have a strong view right now on when rates are likely to go up? Or is it more just you felt there was no way rates were going down from where they were back in April and May?","Donald R. Kimble","Brian, I hope you have somebody with a better crystal ball than I do at this point because I think that we do believe that rates are going to go up at some point in time. But right now, I wouldn't see that occurring in '13 on the short end of the curve or even the first half of '14. And that will be my personal expectation, but we'll wait and see how things play out here over the next couple quarters.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Terry McEvoy with Oppenheimer & Co.","Terence J. McEvoy - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","A question for Beth. Beyond closing branches, can you talk about the realignment of the Community Bank? Was the decision more than just finding a way to cut costs? And any early data on customer attrition and does it give you more confidence or less confidence on continuing to look at the opportunity to close branches?","Beth E. Mooney","Terry, I'll also let Bill Koehler, the President of our Community Bank, add to some of my comments. But as it relates to branch closures, based on what we have accomplished and will through the balance of the year, it will be about a 7% of our branches. And what we've identified in these branches tend to be low profitability, low traffic count. And as we have closed and\/or consolidated and many of them are near another branch of service, we have experienced very little attrition, well below what we would have expected when we modeled this a year ago. So it does give us confidence that -- and as we rationalize both our ATM natural net ranges that this could be done in a way that is helpful to our cost initiatives, our efficiency, without material client impact. And then with that, I'm going to let Bill Koehler just give a couple headlines about what was done in the broader Community Bank alignment, where both will make us more efficient, more productive and more focused.","William R. Koehler","Terry, this is Bill. The realignment was really focused around 2 things. Obviously efficiency, but more importantly, putting our teams in a better position to drive revenue growth through more focused execution of better defined strategies. So to the -- so part of that related to creating one fully integrated national consumer franchise where we could focus our teams on more consistent sales execution throughout the platform. And we think there's an opportunity to grow revenue there. And the second was around refining our go-to-market strategies and value proposition with respect to little market business banking and private banking. And there, it's very much about identifying those clients who tend to typically be privately owned businesses, their owners, their employees, and finding ways to target our broad capabilities in a more relevant way to those clients to drive better growth.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just one follow-up from a question from earlier. I guess, Beth or Don, when I look at the capital position now, you're at 10.8% Tier 1 common under Basel III. And someone mentioned this morning that they think that we could see a fairly decent pickup in M&A in 2014, as we start to get a lot of the new regulations moving into place. So I guess my question would be given that you've shown in the past the willingness to be acquisitive, do you agree with that view that we could see a pickup across the industry? And what is your appetite given -- to do deals given the strong capital position?","Beth E. Mooney","Ryan, this is Beth. We've always said that I think our capital priority has been fully stated, that our capital is and does create advantage and opportunity for us. It's obviously been able to support our organic growth platform, it has been able to [indiscernible] dividend and share repurchase in order to return capital to our shareholders. And then it also creates and has been able to assist us as we've opportunistically over the last year or so done a variety of acquisitions to augment product capabilities, add to geographies and definitely [ph] create our scale and presence in the commercial servicing markets. But with that, I think this is another crystal ball question as to when M&A will actually and actively pick up. I think as we have gone through the last couple years, it has been a pretty muted market and most transactions have been for very particular reasons. We have said that with our geographic franchise as well as our differentiated platforms that we could be opportunistic and would evaluate if things are additive to our business model, if they are additive to our client relationship philosophy and that they are good for our shareholders. So as this, too, unrolls and unveils, know that we would be opportunistic. But I've also always said very, very disciplined that it has to fit our business model to be good for our shareholders.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And just in case I missed it earlier in the call. In the 1 to 3 basis points of quarterly NIM compression, is there an assumption that you will be redeploying some of the higher liquidity that you talked about earlier in the call?","Donald R. Kimble","The assumption is modest. What we did say in the call was that we expected loan growth to exceed deposit growth. And so there would be some implication there that we would see some of that liquidity being used but that we're not reliant solely on that.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from John Moran with Macquarie Capital.","John V. Moran - Macquarie Research","Really the last thing that I have left on the list here is just kind of circling back on the OpEx guidance. Don, just wanted to make sure that, that guidance is inclusive of any incremental cost on the commercial servicing deal.","Beth E. Mooney","That is. That's correct.","John V. Moran - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then the $20 million in charges on the efficiency program, we would expect to see $20 million in both third quarter and fourth quarter or is that only -- are you only talking about third quarter there?","Donald R. Kimble","That $20 million is really more a reflection of what our fourth quarter forecast would have shown, but it wouldn't be out of line for third quarter as well.","Operator","And I'd like to turn it back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Beth E. Mooney","Thank you, operator. And again, thank you, all, for taking time from your schedule to participate in our call today.

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Beth Mooney, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Beth Elaine Mooney - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to KeyCorp's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Joining me for today's presentation is Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer, and available for our Q&A portion of the call is Bill Hartmann, our Chief Risk Officer.","Slide two is our statement on forward looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments, as well as the question and answer segment of our call.","I'm now turning to slide three. Our second quarter results reflect continued momentum in our core businesses and the progress we have made to complete the acquisition of First Niagara on August 1. Excluding merger-related charges, we generated positive operating leverage and grew pre-provision net revenue relative to the year-ago period. Revenue was stable with the same period last year and up 3% from the last quarter, despite low interest rates and challenging market conditions.","Loan growth was solid again this quarter, driven by a 12% increase in average commercial, financial, and agricultural loans. Our core fee-based businesses continue to perform well with corporate services and cards and payments both posting double-digit year-over-year gains.","Market-sensitive businesses, including investment banking and debt placement fees, improved from last quarter, but are below the record pace of the year-ago period. Commercial mortgage banking continues to generate strong growth, while other areas are being impacted by challenging market conditions. Don will provide more detail and our outlook for our fee-based businesses in his comments.","Expenses have remained well controlled, and our ongoing efficiency efforts have allowed us to continue to invest to drive growth. Credit quality was a good story once again, with our net charge-offs to average loans remaining below our targeted level. And capital management remains an area of focus. We increased our quarterly common dividend to $0.085 per share or 13% during the quarter and we were pleased to receive no objection from the Federal Reserve on our 2016 capital plan. We expect to resume common share repurchases after we complete our acquisition, and subject to board approval we plan to increase our common share dividend to $0.095 per share next year.","Now I'm turning to slide four. We're very excited to be on a path to close our First Niagara acquisition, which is expected on August 1. The merger of KeyBanc and First Niagara Bank is planned for the fourth quarter, subject to the approval by the OCC. We would also expect systems and client conversions to take place during the fourth quarter. Additionally, we recently announced the plans for our combined branch network, including the consolidation of over 100 existing First Niagara and Key branches. We also plan to continue to invest and grow in New York, which will include in-sourcing some functions and our build-out of the First Niagara's residential mortgage and auto lending businesses and support our broader franchise.","I've been extremely pleased with the way our two companies have worked together to position us to be successful in meeting our commitments to clients, communities, employees and shareholders. And I remain confident in, and committed to, achieving our financial targets, and creating value for our shareholders in this slow growth, low rate environment.","The combination of Key and First Niagara accelerates our performance beyond what either company could have otherwise achieved. We continue to expect the acquisition to be accretive to earnings in 2017 and add 5% to EPS, upon the full realization of cost savings.","We also expect to increase our return on tangible common equity by 200 basis points, improve our cash efficiency ratio by 300 basis points and produce a solid return on invested capital. And as I've said before, our internal target for cost savings is higher than our external target of $400 million and developments this quarter have only reinforced our confidence in achieving our commitments.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Don to discuss the details of our second quarter results. Don?","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Beth. I'm on slide six. Second quarter net income from continuing operations was $0.27 per common share, after excluding $0.04 of merger-related expense. This compares to $0.27 per share in the year-ago period and $0.24 in the first quarter, which excluded $0.02 of merger-related expense.","As Beth mentioned, excluding merger expense we grew pre-provision net revenue and generated positive operating leverage relative to the year-ago quarter. Revenue was stable from the same period last year and up 3% from the first quarter, despite the headwinds from low interest rates and the challenging market conditions. Core expenses were well managed. Our efficiency ratio adjusted for merger expense was 64.8%. I'll cover many of these items on this slide in the rest of my presentation, so I'm now turning it to slide seven.","Average loan balances were up $3.2 billion, or 5% compared to the year-ago quarter; and up $1 billion, or 2% from the first quarter. Our year-over-year growth was once again driven primarily by commercial, financial and agricultural loans, and was broad-based across Key's business lending segments. Average CF&A loans were up $3.6 billion, or 12% compared to the prior-year and were up $1 billion, or 3% unannualized from the first quarter.","Continuing to slide eight. Average deposits, excluding deposits in foreign office, totaled $73.9 billion for the second quarter of 2016, an increase of $3.6 billion compared to the year-ago period. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects core deposit growth in our retail banking franchise, higher escrow deposits from our commercial mortgage servicing business and commercial deposit inflows.","Compared to the first quarter of 2016, average deposits increased by $2.3 billion. Higher escrow balances, short-term inflows from our commercial clients and core deposit growth in our retail banking franchise contributed to the linked-quarter increase.","Turning to slide nine, taxable equivalent net interest income was $605 million for the second quarter of 2016, and net interest margin was 2.76%. These results compared to the taxable equivalent net interest income of $591 million and a net interest margin of 2.88% for the second quarter of 2015. The 2% increase in net interest income reflects higher earning asset balances and yields, partially offset by lower re-investment yields in the securities and derivatives portfolio.","Compared to the first quarter of 2016, net interest income was down 1%, and net interest margin decreased 13 basis points. The net interest margin reduction in the second quarter was driven by excess liquidity, which was a function of three things, the first two of which are related to our upcoming First Niagara acquisition.","First, we retained higher cash balances needed for funding the First Niagara purchase price and branch divestiture. Second, liquidity was held to position our balance sheet for LCR compliance following the close of the acquisition. And third, during the quarter, we had elevated levels of short-term escrow deposits, some of which are seasonal.","Higher levels of liquidity translated into a $2.1 billion linked-quarter increase in our account at the Federal Reserve, which resulted in a seven basis point decline in our net interest margin. The average balances for the quarter of $5.6 billion was well-above the historic levels of approximately $1 billion.","Slide 10 shows a summary of non-interest income, which accounted for 44% of total revenue. Non-interest income in the second quarter was $473 million, down $15 million, or 3% from the prior-year; and up $42 million, or 10% from the prior-quarter. The decrease from the prior-year was largely attributed to lower investment banking and debt placement fees. Although we saw growth in commercial mortgage banking fees, it was more than offset by weaker market conditions resulting in lower revenue compared to the prior-year \u2013 excuse me, year-ago record quarter.","In the second half of the year, we expect good overall growth in investment banking and debt placement fees, more in line with our original outlook for the business. We saw continued growth and momentum in a number of our core fee-based businesses, reflecting investments we've made over the last few years.","Corporate services income was up 23%, and cards and payments income was up 11% from the year-ago period. We've also seen a positive trend in service charges on deposit accounts. The growth in other income reflected a number of items, including higher gains from real estate related investments.","Compared to the first quarter, non-interest income was most notably impacted by $27 million in the higher investment banking and debt placement fees. We also saw growth across various other line items including cards and payments, corporate services, service charges on deposit accounts, and net gains from principal investing.","Turning to slide 11, as you can see on the slide, reported non-interest expense of $751 million includes $45 million of expense related to our acquisition of First Niagara. Excluding these costs, non-interest expense was $706 million for the quarter. We've provided a detailed breakout of our merger-related expense in the appendix of our materials.","Compared to the second quarter of last year, and after adjusting for merger-related expense, non-interest expense was down $5 million, or 1%. The decline reflects lower performance-based compensation, occupancy and business services and professional fees, which were partially offset by higher expense related to certain real estate investments and increased non-merger-related marketing.","Excluding the merger-related expense, linked-quarter expenses were up $27 million, or 4%. The increase was primarily in non-personnel, including other expense and non-merger-related marketing. The quarter also reflected an increase in personnel expense related to the higher performance-based compensation.","Turning to slide 12, overall net charge-offs were $43 million, or 28 basis points of average total loans in the second quarter, which continues to be below our targeted range. Second quarter provision for credit losses was $52 million, an increase of $11 million in the year-ago period, and a decrease of $37 million from the linked-quarter. Non-performing loans and non-performing assets both increased relative to the year-ago period, but decreased from the prior-quarter.","At June 30, 2016, our total reserve for loan losses represented 1.38% of period-end loans and 138% coverage of non-performing loans. Our outlook for credit quality remains consistent for the remainder of the year, with provision levels modestly exceeding net charge-offs, which will support our continued loan growth. We continue to anticipate the allowance as a percentage of period-end loans to be relatively stable with our second quarter level.","Turning to slide 13. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio at the end of the second quarter was 11.1%, up from 10.7% in the year-ago period. As Beth highlighted, disciplined capital management remains a priority for us. Last month, we announced a 13% increase in our quarterly common share dividend. We were also pleased to receive no objection from the Federal Reserve on our 2016 capital plan, which included up to $350 million in share repurchases and an additional increase to our common share dividend next year subject to board approval.","Moving on to slide 14. The top portion of the slide provides our 2016 outlook for standalone Key, excluding merger-related expense. We have updated our guidance to reflect the second quarter results; despite continued headwinds from our lower interest rates and more challenging market conditions, we continue to expect to drive positive operating leverage. Consistent with our prior outlook, we expect average loans to grow in the mid-single-digit range, driven by continued strength in our commercial businesses.","Net interest income growth should be in the low to mid single-digit range compared to 2015 without any benefit from higher interest rates. We expect net interest income to be higher in the second half of the year compared to both the first half of this year and a year-ago period. Our guidance now reflects the weaker capital market conditions experienced in the first half of this year. Importantly, our expectations for the second half of this year remain in line with our original outlook. Based on this, we expect non-interest income to be relatively stable to up low single-digits for the year.","Full-year reported expenses, excluding merger-related expense should be relatively stable with 2015. We continue to expect net charge-offs to be below our targeted range of 40 basis points to 60 basis points. We also expect provision levels to modestly exceed net charge-offs, which will support our continued loan growth. The allowance as a percentage of period-end loans is anticipated to be relatively stable with our second quarter level.","We've also included some guidance for the expected impact of First Niagara, which is scheduled to close next week, on August 1. Branch and systems conversions are anticipated for the fourth quarter, after which we expect to begin to see the cost savings. We expect the majority of the benefit to be realized in 2017.","Revenue and expense should be generally consistent with the First Niagara's first quarter operating results, including their 10-Q, adjusted for the five month period they would be part of Key. Expenses will also reflect approximately a $30 million of incremental amortization expense in 2016. Key's share count will also increase by about 240 million shares from the acquisition.","As Beth said, we are excited about the opportunity to bring these two companies together and our confidence in delivering our financial commitments remain strong.","With that, I'll close and turn the call back over to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of our call. John?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll first go to the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR. Please go ahead.","Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hey, good morning. How is everyone?","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, Bob.","Beth Elaine Mooney - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hey, I guess, I was wondering, if you could maybe talk a little bit about the timing of the CCAR share repurchases? Do you think you guys will start that right after the First Niagara deal closes? Or do you think you'll sort of wait until next quarter, really come back into the market? Or how you're thinking about it?","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Our plan anticipated starting the share buybacks here in this quarter. So, it would be shortly after the transaction work was closed on August 1.","Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. And will you likely do, roughly, a quarter of the authorization each quarter through the year? Will it be more market-dependent or how should we think about the pace?","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","The plan would have anticipated a relatively stable level of share buybacks each quarter for the rest of the year.","Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. Great. Last question, maybe you could talk a little bit about net interest margin. I'm just kind of curious, I know some of the liquidity you guys said will reflect to build up into the acquisition. Next quarter, does any of that sort of \u2013 obviously, if someone comes back down for the cash piece of the purchase price, but how are you thinking about the blended margin with the liquidity movements that are anticipated at this point?","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Good. You're absolutely right. Throughout the third quarter, we would be using some of that excess liquidity to take care of the acquisition of First Niagara and also provide for the impact of the divestiture.","Purchase accounting adjustments will be determined throughout this next quarter; so that will impact the consolidated margin. But, we would expect to see our liquidity levels return to more of a normal level, which would be previous quarter as far as the overall impact. And so, we should see a benefit from that prospectively.","Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, everybody.","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Morning.","Beth Elaine Mooney - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I'd like to start \u2013 as you guys continue to work on the First Niagara deal, what are your updated thoughts on: one, the $400 million of cost saves you originally identified; and also, now how are you thinking about the revenue synergies, which, Don, I think you pegged at around $300 million originally?","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Sure. As far as the cost savings, we had shared an original target of $400 million and we've been talking about since that deal was announced that we are expecting and setting an internal target in excess of that $400 million. And over the last several months, we've gained even greater confidence in our ability to achieve that internal target. And so, we are very focused on driving to that level; and again, have greater confidence to be able to achieve that.","We're also even more excited about the revenue synergies; and as we've met with some of the bankers from the First Niagara system and see their excitement about a number of the product capabilities and offerings that we would be able to provide; again gives us additional confidence in our ability to achieve that kind of $300 million incremental revenues from revenue synergies. And as we've said before, that won't be immediate, it will take some time to build that out, but we have greater confidence in our ability to achieve that as well.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's very helpful. Just one other one, Don, in the fee revenue. If we look at the updated guidance, the first half of this year is trailing where you were last year and the comps get a little bit more difficult than the second half. What's giving you the confidence at this stage that you will see that pickup in the second half, which you really need even to get to the low end of the new guidance? Thanks.","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Really, the biggest variable there is our investment banking debt placement fees. And if we look at our current pipeline, we're seeing some strength there that we haven't had in the first two quarters and gives us greater confidence, we'll be able to grow that beyond the first half of this year and get some growth compared to the prior-year as well.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for all of the color.","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And next go to John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","Morning.","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Morning.","Beth Elaine Mooney - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","Just wondering, if I can get some color on the C&I growth in the quarter came in particularly solid and wanted to see where you're seeing the bulk of the growth. Is it larger corporate versus mid-market? And then also what your outlook is there? Should it stay at this relatively robust level? Thanks.","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","As far as our commercial loan growth, it was again led by our corporate bank, but we also had some strong growth in our community bank as far as the commercial lending as well. And so, we're seeing both parts of the franchise contribute. We're not seeing it over-weighted in any industry, and we're not seeing it over-weighted by any geography. So, it's been fairly consistent throughout the overall market. Our guidance is for mid-single-digit loan growth overall and it being \u2013 continue to be led by commercial. And so, we would expect to see ongoing strength in the commercial category.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","And related to that, any areas that are getting overheated or that you're intentionally backing away from, just given the competitive pressures? We're hearing a lot about CRE at some of your competitors. Thanks.","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","John, that's a great question, and we actually started to back off some certain markets in the commercial real estate space almost two years ago, because we were seeing some higher levels of prices and lower cap rates than what we'd feel comfortable with. And so, we've started to change that well back several quarters ago. Bill, anything else you would add to that?","William L. Hartmann - Chief Risk Officer","The only thing I would add is that, consistent with our approach, we've been focusing on owners of real estate and as opposed to pure developers of real estate for a long period of time now. And our customers are being more discrete in where they're investing. And you can even see in our construction numbers those are smaller than they were many years ago.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Got it. Then one last question if I could. Your deposit pricing, it seems to have edged up a little bit over the past couple of quarters. Just wanted to get how you're thinking about that. Is there anything else that's influencing it and could it continue? Thanks.","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Well, the biggest impact there is really some growth we've seen in some of our consumer retail CD growth rates. And so, you're seeing that go from what was a portfolio that was shrinking to a portfolio that's been growing. We do believe that having a strong retail core funded bank is important for us, but we'll continue to reassess programs going forward in that area.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Thanks, Don. Appreciate it.","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning.","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, Matt.","Beth Elaine Mooney - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I was hoping you guys could elaborate a little bit on the dropping in outside of liquidity. And then what gives you the confidence in growing the standalone net-interest income dollars in the back half of the year versus the first half? Obviously, it's \u2013 in some ways a moot point since you'll be combining with First Niagara, but you did mention you expect the dollars to increase on a standalone basis. So, just a little more visibility and clarity on what's driving that after a bigger drop in NIM this quarter.","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Matt, as far as the net interest income and margin, there's a couple of factors that impacted it outside the liquidity. So, as we've talked before, seven basis points is related to the increased liquidity level, which really didn't drive any net interest income from it. And so, that was purely a balance sheet component.","The rest of it, about five basis points. Typically in the second quarter, we would see an increase in loan fees; and this quarter, we actually saw it decline. And so, that swing from what our original expectations would have been to what we actually realized, cost us about three basis points or about $5 million in the quarter compared to what we would have expected going into the quarter.","And then beyond that, we had two other components that impacted it. One was the full quarter impact of the non-accrual loans related to the oil and gas, and then the third piece really was the reinvestment in our investment portfolio, that the securities that we were buying had an average yield of about 1.9% compared to say 20 basis points or 30 basis points higher than that. That would have been our expectation, and that probably cost us an additional basis point during the quarter.","And so, those are the primary factors. As far as the growth going forward, well, we're not counting on recouping the loan fees that we didn't realize in the current quarter. We would expect to see some normal trends as far as seasonal activity and continued strong loan growth that we had been able to produce so far this year.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then just separately, with respect to the timing of the cost saves, you mentioned that most of them or a majority of them was coming in 2017. Well, how should we think about the ramp in terms of throughout the year? I guess, there's a lot of them come after the systems conversions, but what would be the timing of, say, early versus latter part of the year on the cost save recognition?","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I would suggest that we'll see some cost saves occur post the conversion, which we talked about being in the fourth quarter, but the majority of those cost saves would be phased in throughout 2017, so that in the second half of the year, we'd have the majority of those cost saves in place and should be at a full run rate by the end of the year.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Morning, guys.","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Hey, Scott.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Just on the cost savings, obviously one of the higher profile disclosures recently was just the agreement to keep more jobs in New York. Wonder if \u2013 and obviously, you've reiterated the cost savings expectation. You have the higher internal target, but just hoping you could provide a little color on, if there are going to be more jobs than you would have anticipated originally in New York, for example. Where do you make up the negative delta that you would have expected originally and whether it's just sort of the nature of FNFG's cost saves, i.e., just certain switches you can kind of turn off and the cost go away, or how does that work out in your guys' mind?","Beth Elaine Mooney - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Scott. This is Beth. And I will tell you that it is consistent with the way we have been planning for both our internal targets as well as you've heard us discuss our confidence about being able to meet the cost synergies. Some piece of how we have structured bringing these two companies together is around the notion that we can leverage what is an attractive well-skilled low cost work force in Buffalo and in Western New York.","So, we are looking at \u2013 we indicated in-sourcing some functions or work that is done elsewhere, not necessarily just within First Niagara, but within broader KeyCorp. And that that work could be moved to Buffalo and utilized, as I said, that attractive low cost talent base. We've also looked at some of our operations network within Key, and we'll consolidate those into Western New York and bring down costs or jobs elsewhere within Key.","And then the biggest driver over time for the job number is what we talked about was the fact that they have residential mortgage from originations through servicing as well as the indirect auto business, both of which \u2013 one was a business we were trying to stand up within Key, and one that is new to Key. And that we will build on those businesses within Western New York as we scaled them across our broader franchise, which we expect will create opportunities for many folks in Western New York as we support that. And the corresponding revenue that we would expect to gain as we introduce that to the broader Key franchise. And then there will be some leveraging on the call center capabilities.","So, as we look at it, again, it is a portfolio of businesses between Key and First Niagara and there were some opportunities to really leverage Western New York, but consistent with how we thought of our expense synergies, we get there in a very, very solid path through the ability to look at in-sourcing growth. And as we look at the mix of the $400 million, and Don will have some thoughts to add on this as well. Big, big driver of that is vendor savings. There is the outsourced technology environment at First Niagara is a huge driver of the $400 million. And then as we look at additional outsourcing to bring that work back in, we really are being able to get a huge piece of that path through exiting third-party relationships.","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","No, I would agree, Beth. And the only thing I would add is that part of the difference between our external target of $400 million and our internal target, a large portion of that is related to this third-party vendor cost that Beth had talked about. And believe that should be a true savings for us.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. All right. That's perfect. Thank you for the color.","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. Good morning. So, quick question, on page 14, you mentioned right at the bottom, the incremental amortization expense of $30 million related to First Niagara. Easy question, which is, I assume that is annual amortization expense. But the other question is, on a short-term basis, right, so over the next five months of this year, is it possible that the higher amortization expense actually act as sort of just an outright negative on earnings before you have the opportunity to really, meaningfully, start to reduce First Niagara's core expenses? Or are there other expense savings you plan to do very, very short-term that might offset the $30 million of amortization? Thanks.","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Ken, as far as the $30 million of amortization, we're assuming it is on an accelerated basis and that's the first five month impact from that only, and so it will be incremental expense. And to your point that will be a drag on the initial earnings compared to what we would expect after the benefit of the realization of the cost saves. And so, that was one piece that we wanted to make sure we made clear.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Don, I was wondering if I could ask you a little bit more about the expense side. This quarter, the other expense line, at $104 million core, was much higher than kind of historical run rates. Can you help us understand what the real estate side was and what you'd expect that to look like on a more normal basis?","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Again, on that item, you're right. The majority of the increase really related to that. We had a $7 million or $8 million increase in other expense associated with what I would consider to be grossing up the revenue and expenses associated with certain partnerships we have in Lightec (30:44) investments that was highly unusual. And we would expect a normal recurring level to be in the $1 million to $2 million a quarter, as opposed to $7 million to $8 million. And so, that did inflate that expense category and is why we're showing a significant increase there.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then, just as far as the back half of the year, you normally do have \u2013 or you had, the last couple of years, pension charges in the third quarter and fourth quarter. Do you expect that to recur again? Or is that now in the past?","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Well, we do have that risk. Our outlook right now would suggest that there is an exposure for that maybe in the fourth quarter, as opposed to the third quarter right now. But, one of the other benefits we expect is that when we can merge the two pension plans from First Niagara and from Key that would minimize that risk prospectively. And so, we never want to say one and done, but hopefully this would be a period where we might have an expense and see that not recur in the future periods.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And, if I could just one quick one on credit. You'd mentioned in the guidance that you expect the allowance to be stable with the last quarter. The allowance actually built up as a percentage of loans this quarter. It looks like you moved a little from the unfunded into the overprovision. And I'm just wondering, the credit looks great underneath the surface. So, from here, is it more just about reserving a bit for loan growth or is there anything underneath the surface in credit that we should be thinking about?","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Nothing underneath the surface. You're right that we did see some migration out of the reserve for unfunded loans into the allowance. And those two kind of worked hand-in-hand as far as loans would fund up that were previously commitments. You might see a transfer from the unfunded loan commitment over to the overall allowance.","And I would also say that our judgmental portion of the reserve also increased this quarter; and so, we feel very comfortable with the level of reserve we have and do believe that prospectively the provision will slightly exceed the net charge-offs to make sure we continue to provide for loan growth.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot, Don.","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Don, first a question for you. I wanted to follow-up on I guess Bill's earlier commentary about the construction numbers in the CRE portfolio. Overall, CRE numbers were up about 10%, 11% annualized quarter-over-quarter with 30% decline year-over-year in the construction portfolio. Is that kind of reached a bottom as to where you want that to be ex-FNFG? And how should we think about commercial real estate growth going forward?","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","As Bill noted, where we're seeing that growth is more in income-producing properties as opposed to development-type of lending. And so, we did see some increase there and are very comfortable with that type of an exposure and risk profile for the credits we're putting on. And you're right that next quarter we'll see a change here, because of the acquisition of First Niagara. Anything else you'd add, Bill?","William L. Hartmann - Chief Risk Officer","No, I think that covers it, Don.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And just as a follow-up, it looked like your exposure in terms of overall amounts and non-accruals in oil and gas was stable and down a bit respectively. Can you provide any additional color in terms of how you're thinking about that portfolio and the trajectory of non-accruals going forward? I realize it's price dependent, but any additional color you can provide would be helpful.","William L. Hartmann - Chief Risk Officer","Sure, this is Bill Hartmann. So, what we've been seeing happen is as \u2013 a couple of things going on. The borrowing base redetermination was largely complete this quarter, and we saw a little bit of a reduction obviously as a result of adjustments to the borrowing base, as a result of the redetermination.","The second thing that we're seeing is that there have been some bankruptcies in the space. The resolution of those bankruptcies are resulting in some reductions in exposure. We continued to see that as a positive going forward. And then lastly, with prices up a little bit, we are seeing the cash flows improve at some of the borrowers. And as a result of that, they're reducing some of their outstandings?","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And just finally from me, Don, if I can, the merger-related charges in the quarter were a little higher than we were thinking about. I presume, however, that the overall timing of the merger-related charges will be concentrated in the second half of this year with a little bit in 2017 as you previously guided, correct?","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","That's correct. We had talked before about a one-time charge of $550 million for merger-related costs. And we do believe that a significant portion of those will be in the second half of this year.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning, Beth. Good morning, Don.","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Beth Elaine Mooney - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Can you guys remind us of the $400 million in cost savings, how does that break out by personnel, occupancy, outside vendor systems, et cetera? And is it different post the agreement with New York than what it was prior, when you first announced the deal?","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","As far as the $400 million, the largest piece that we did disclose was about 40% of that was related to third-party vendors, or $160 million. What we'd also talked about was that we expected to see significant opportunities from branch consolidations, and as we announced here earlier this month that we expected to consolidate approximately 70 branches of First Niagara and a little over 30 branches of Key. And so that is about 25% incremental consolidation related to that, and so that will also drive a significant portion. But beyond that, we really haven't provided a lot of color as far as how much is personnel related.","I would say that with our discussions here, an announcement as far as the New York staffing plans that I don't know that's changed what our initial plans have been significantly. Again that we're looking for a lot of opportunity from those third-party vendor saves. And it's just an issue as to where the work is being performed as opposed to whether or not it's changed the overall plan.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I see. And I'm sorry the third-party vendor, that did increase now versus the original $400 million when you guys first outlined those cost savings?","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Well, what we had talked about is our internal target is higher than the $400 million, and a big portion of that increase is related to the third-party vendor as opposed to other categories.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I see. And then just to go back, Don, to your comment about liquidity, your margin obviously was impacted as you pointed out in the quarter by the increase in liquidity, but I thought you said that we should expect your liquidity levels to go back to the way they were in the first quarter. If that's true, should the margin then benefit from the lower liquidity levels that you expect going forward?","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Margin should benefit from lower liquidity levels. Now at the same time, we're going to be adding First Niagara on top of our balance sheet and margin impact. There will be some noise that we'll have to walk you through next quarter as to how they all combine and what the impact is, but we should see a benefit to margin, not a huge change from net interest income, but a benefit to margin as those liquidity levels return to more normal levels.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Thanks. Don, I wanted to ask you a little bit about the compression you saw in earning asset yields. When you look at the core portfolios of the loans and securities, they were only down a couple of basis points. When you look at the trading account and you look at the loans held-for-sale, trading account was down over 100 basis points and loans held-for-sale were down 80 basis points. So, was there some noise or activity in those portfolios, because that's what drove a lot of the earning asset yield compression was in those two smaller accounts?","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. One, the loans held-for-sale also were impacted by the fact that it was a lower level of loans held-for-sale during the quarter than what we had in the previous quarter; and so that was a bigger driver.","The trading account dropped by about $1 million as far as the net interest income, and that really wasn't a huge driver to the overall net interest income, but there was a different mix of those assets than in this first quarter than what we have in the second quarter.","But the biggest driver there, Marty, really, is if you look at the next line below that which is our short-term investments, and it's up to $5.6 billion and that's primarily our account at the Fed, and that's up by $2.1 billion from the previous quarter and up by $2.3 billion over the previous year. And that $2 billion-plus equated to a seven basis point reduction in our margin, and so it's just the ballooning up of the balance sheet related to that.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Yeah. No, I was excluding the extra liquidity.","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","But, when you look at the quarter there's a couple of things that you're doing in preparation for bringing First Niagara on, you suspended your share repurchase which you get to start back. You've raised debt, and now you've increased liquidity. On my estimate, it's probably a penny or two in bottom line impact that's just kind of sitting there waiting to get utilized as you kind of move over into the next stage, which is post the closing of the acquisition.","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","A couple of things there. You're right that we did raise some debt, and that will help with the funding of the First Niagara acquisition. That was anticipated as part of the cost of First Niagara, and so we did expect that to be incurred and are positioned for that. And then we're also glad to start our share buyback program again, and that will be helpful to our earnings per share and to continue to support our shareholders from that perspective.","Beth Elaine Mooney - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And consistent with our guidance all year, we have been positioning the company, the balance sheet, our plans for our third quarter close. And so right after (41:40) CCAR results, shortly thereafter was our approval from the Federal Reserve. So, yes, a lot of these were conscious choices about timing to be positioned for First Niagara.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","All I was really getting at is that there's a temporary pressure on earnings the quarter before you actually get the benefits. So, there's kind of a timing here that you have to make all those choices knowing that you're going to get the benefit once the acquisition comes in.","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","You're absolutely right.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Thanks.","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And, we'll go to Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi. Just a question on slide four, pretty straightforward. Your target, I think it's unchanged, right? The ROTCE 200 basis points higher, and the cash efficiency ratio 300 basis points higher. Is that correct, it's unchanged?","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","That's correct.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","And so what is the specific target? Higher than what? Higher than 2015? Higher than the first half of 2016? Higher than the second quarter of 2016. What's the comparison and so what is the actual numerical target?","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, that \u2013 for both those ratios, it's the incremental benefit from the First Niagara transaction compared to Key on a standalone basis. And so, it would be compared to where our projections would show us on a standalone basis versus where we would be with First Niagara.","Now what we had talked about before was that if rates did not improve, Key on a standalone basis for the efficiency ratio would drive down to the low 60%s. And with the impact of First Niagara, it would be in the high 50%s. And so that again is without interest rates, if interest rates did come through, it would again have additional benefit beyond that.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","And the ROTCE?","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","We haven't disclosed what our targeted levels are there. So, our ROTCE is right now on that 9% level. And so, we would hope to continue to build that prospectively and showing an incremental benefit from the First Niagara transaction of that 200 basis point range that we talked about.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","I mean for the investors on the outside, it's nice to have something to hold management accountable to. And so, let's assume there's a debate going on. Some people like the acquisition, some don't. And we'll say, all right in the end, we'll look at the results. And it would be nice to have some sort of bogey that we can all look at together. Is there any more specifics you can give us, let's just say on the ROTCE? I mean, we can't see what Key's likely to do on a standalone basis based on your projections, but it would be helpful. Any other color you could give would be great.","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Let us go ahead and reflect on that and see what kind of additional detail we can provide. I think we did provide more detail as it relates to the efficiency ratio, but part of that return on tangible common equity too will be impacted by some of the mark-to-market on the balance sheet and other purchase accounting adjustments. And we want to make sure we can clarify what component relates to each of those pieces. Let us do that for you, Mike, and then we'll get back to you.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","All right. And then a related question. So, there's no change in your targets. We hear you saying that the cost savings should go good. The revenue synergy's still good. But since October 30 of last year when you announced the deal, the expectation for rate increases really has come down. And that would hurt First Niagara, which was somewhat asset-sensitive. So, why do you still feel okay about your targets \u2013 the same feeling about your targets even though the outlook for First Niagara wouldn't be as good?","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Well, one, First Niagara was asset-sensitive, but as we looked at running their information through our models, their asset sensitivity wasn't much outside of where we are today and where we were back in October.","We also took a look at this transaction for if rate increases did occur and also if rate increases did not occur. And we still saw that kind of incremental lift for what we saw for the combined company compared to Key on a standalone basis. And so, that's why we think there truly is benefit from this, and we're very confident in our ability to achieve those incremental improvements that we talked about. Beth, anything you want to add?","Beth Elaine Mooney - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, Mike. The other thing I would tell you in a lower and slower environment, which is I think is the consensus of the macro environment that we find ourselves in, I do think it's an attractive proposition to be able to extract cost synergies and then the confidence for a million new clients, the resulting revenue opportunities. I believe that it is a \u2013 value proposition of the merger is solid and it creates a lever in an environment where headwinds and levers are hard to come by.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","All right. Thank you.","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, to give all parties an opportunity to ask a question, we ask will you please limit yourself to one question going forward. And we'll go to David Long with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","David J. Long - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","David J. Long - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","You guys mentioned that short-term inflows from commercial clients impacted your deposit growth in the quarter and maybe had an impact on the NIM. So related to that, what are you expecting on the run-off there or the duration? And then maybe more importantly, what are you hearing from clients, your commercial clients, and what drove that short-term inflow in deposits?","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","A big chunk of that really was coming from some of our escrow deposits that we have with our commercial servicing business and also some other escrow-related deposits we'd have for other commercial clients. Some of that is seasonal related, as you would see some of the real estate taxes and other things that would be build up throughout the first half of the year and paid down. And so, we would expect to see some of those go down.","But we also had several situations where there'd be prepayments in the commercial mortgage servicing area that had cash idle for weeks at a time and that resulted in some over \u2013 or outsized increases in those deposit balances.","As far as our commercial customers, we're still seeing and hearing from them that they continue to be fairly cautious. And so, we believe they continue to park liquidity with the expectation that they will be using that at some point in time, but really not in a mode to significantly change their overall position as far as investment. So, we are seeing a little bit of additional build there as well.","David J. Long - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks.","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Next, we'll go to David Eads with UBS. Please go ahead.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","Hello.","Beth Elaine Mooney - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Kind of touching \u2013 following up on some of this commentary about preparing for First Niagara to come over. Has there been any change to strategy for the securities book and also, both the legacy Key book and then the expectations for restructuring the First Niagara book once it comes over, given the lower rates?","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","What we had talked before \u2013 at the time of the acquisition is that First Niagara has about $3.5 billion worth of credit-oriented securities in a different asset classes. And First Niagara has not been required to maintain the LCR compliance.","And so, in order to make sure that they are LCR compliant, as part of Key, our plans are to shift out that $3.5 billion of credit-oriented securities and have their investment portfolio look more like legacy Key. And so, that process would take place throughout the third quarter. And we believe that we'd be in good position at that point in time.","As far as Key, that we have been continuing to reassess our overall strategy as far as the duration of the portfolio, given these low rates and the timing of certain purchases. But the composition and nature of that portfolio really hasn't changed over the last couple of quarters.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","And with the reinvestment of the First Niagara, the credit-oriented one, do you still just look to reinvest that kind of similar durations to the current portfolio?","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","That's correct.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Thanks.","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go to Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Kevin J. Barker - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Thank you. As we transition into 4Q and then into the first half of next year, do you expect loan growth to slow down on a consolidated basis as you let some of the First Niagara portfolios run-off that do not fit the profile that you would like for Key? And would you continue to expect interest-bearing deposits to increase to meet LCR requirements post First Niagara acquisition?","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Maybe first, as far as the LCR and the deposit shifts that, we are in very good position from an LCR perspective for both Key and in combination with First Niagara. And so, we do not believe that we're going to see an ongoing shift as far as the overall deposit categories. We do believe over time and especially as rates start to pick up that we'll see some continued growth in time deposits compared to money market deposits; but, we don't believe that will be meaningful.","As far as the loan growth, we've been very pleased with the portfolio that First Niagara has. And we've been continuing to work with their teams and making sure that we are in position post our conversion time period and do not see any significant change in the overall mix composition or any sizeable change in the overall growth rates related to that. Bill, anything else you want to add to that?","William L. Hartmann - Chief Risk Officer","Yeah, I would just add that as part of our due diligence process, we spend a significant amount of time looking at the portfolios, looking at their underwriting standards and looking at their mix of clients. And that was part of the attractiveness that we found in First Niagara. So, I would not expect to use your phrase of run-off in the portfolio due to a change in strategy.","Kevin J. Barker - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Our final question will be from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Thank you for taking the question. Could you give a bit more color on the change in the outlook on non-interest income? What's behind that?","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","The only change we really have there is that the second quarter's fee income reflected a lower level of capital markets related to revenue than what we would have expected coming into the quarter. And as a result of that and the year-to-date results, we've adjusted the outlook to reflect that. That if you look at the second half of this year's outlook for Key, we would say that it's very consistent with what we initially assumed and this is more just to reflect the impact of the actual results today.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","And why do you think the second quarter was weaker than you'd been expecting given the, I guess, in general markets recovered. If I look at the S&P, it's higher now than it was in April when you gave the last outlook, so what was more difficult?","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","I would say where we saw some weakness compared to normal expected periods would be merger and acquisition advisory revenues and also IPO levels were weaker, especially earlier in the second quarter, and so we did see some reductions in that space compared to what our expectations would have had coming into the quarter.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","And then, if I can just squeeze a very last quick clarification in. You mentioned $7 million to $8 million of real estate expenses, a kind of one-time. Was the gains number that offset that, was that $7 million to $8 million as well or was that slightly different?","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","That's correct. It was in the other income category. And so, we did see other income impacted for that $7 million or $8 million and other expense impacted by the same dollar amount.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Great. Thank you very much.","Donald R. Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And I'll turn it back to the company for any closing comments.","Beth Elaine Mooney - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you operator.

This call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Beth Mooney, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Beth Mooney","Thank you, operator, and good morning, and welcome to KeyCorp's fourth quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Joining me for today's presentation is Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer, and available for the Q&A portion of the call are the leaders of Key Corporate Bank and Key Community Bank, Chris Gorman and Bill Koehler. Also, joining us for the Q&A discussion are our Chief Risk Officer, Bill Hartmann, and our Treasurer, Joe Vayda.","On Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call.","Turning now to Slide 3, I'll start with some comments on the year and then turn it over to Don, who will discuss our quarterly results. 2013 was a good year for our company. We acquired and expanded relationships in our targeted client segments, invested in our businesses, improved efficiency and returned peer leading capital to our shareholders, and all of this was reflected in the performance of our stock last year.","On the left-hand side of the slide are three focus areas that we identified at the beginning of the year, optimizing and growing revenue, improving efficiency, and effectively managing capital. We made meaningful progress in each of these areas.","First, I'll begin with revenue. Despite the continued low interest rate environment and slow economic recovery, core revenue trends remained relatively stable in 2013. Excluding the gain from the redemption of our trust preferred securities in 2012, revenue was up 1% for the year. Importantly, we grew both, consumer and commercial loans. Total average balance is up 5% in 2013. The primary driver was commercial, financial and agricultural loans, which were up 12% for the year and continued to outpace the industry growth rate.","Net interest income was up 3% from the prior year and we had positive momentum in a number of our fee-based businesses. One example is investment banking and debt placement fees, which grew for the fifth consecutive year. We also benefited from the investments we have been making in our businesses. For example, cards and payments income was up 20% from 2012, reflecting the successful acquisition of our [KeyBank] [ph] branded credit card portfolio and mortgage servicing revenue more than doubled from 2012, as we built scale from our acquisition of servicing portfolio and special servicing business.","The second focus area was efficiency. In June of 2012, we committed to reduce annual expenses by $150 million $200 million by the first quarter of 2014. In the third quarter of last year, we reported that we had exceeded the high end of this range one quarter head of our original goal. Through the end of the year, we implemented $241 million in annualized savings. Our actions included reducing and realigning our staff, consolidating branch locations as we optimize our distribution channel. And in total, we consolidated 81 locations, or approximately 8% of our franchise since the launch of our efficiency initiative. And just as important the achievement of our cost savings, is the cultural change that have taken place within our company.","Efficiency and positive operating leverage are becoming part of the fabric of Key. Leaders and employees throughout Key are focused every day on continuing to perform against these important objectives. We are committed to maintaining this type of discipline going forward without the need for named programs in the future.","Finally, capital management. We remain disciplined in managing our peer-leading capital. Adhering to our capital priorities, we continue to invest organically, increase our dividend by 10% and repurchased $474 million in common shares during 2013. The result is a payout ratio 76% for the year which we believe places us among the top companies in our peer group while maintaining some of the strongest capital levels in the industry.","Overall, it was a very meaningful year for Key, including the successful execution of a number of strategic imperatives. We continue to invest in our business to drive organic growth as well as adding commercial mortgage servicing, fully integrating our credit card and payment platform. We continue to sharpen our strategic focus by divesting parts of business that did not fit such as Victory Capital Management and we met the commitments we made through our efficiency initiative to reduce expenses and lower our efficiency ratio. I am proud of our team and I am proud of our performance.","In of 2014, we will sustain our momentum and drive performance by continuing to focus on three priorities. The first is driving positive operating leverage by acquiring and expanding client relationships, investing in our businesses and continuing to improve efficiency and productivity.","The next is maintaining a moderate risk profile and a balanced approach to risk and rewards, and the final priority is remaining disciplined in the way we manage capital and executing on our stated capital priorities.","Now, I'll turn it over to Don who will comment on our fourth quarter results and outlook for 2014. Don?","Don Kimble","Thanks, Beth. Slide 5 provides highlights for the company's fourth quarter 2013 results. This morning, we reported net income from continuing operations of $0.26 per common share for the fourth quarter. This compared to $0.25 for the third quarter of 2013.","Our results include charges related to our previously announced efficiency initiative and pension settlement of $0.02 in the fourth quarter, compared to $0.03 for the third quarter. I'll cover many of these results in my remarks when I'll turn to Slide 6.","Loan growth has remained a very positive story and reflects our distinctive business model and more targeted approach. Average total loans for the fourth quarter were up of $337 million or an annualized 3% compared to third quarter of 2013, and up $1.7 billion or 3% compared to year ago quarter.","Our growth was driven primarily by commercial, financial and agricultural loans across Key's business segments. Much of the activity occurred towards the end of the quarter, resulting in larger increases in period end than average loan balances. In the fourth quarter, period end balances grew 2% from the prior quarter or 6% annualized, which outpaced the industry growth.","In the fourth quarter total commitments were up while utilization was relatively stable. Our outlook for loan growth in 2014 remained consistent with our prior guidance of mid-single-digit, full year growth driven by CF&A. A change in the pace of the economic recovery could impact client demand and loan growth relative to our current expectations.","Continuing to Slide 7, on the liability side of the balance sheet, average deposits excluding foreign branch balances were up $2.4 billion from the third quarter and up $4.7 billion from one year ago. Deposit growth from both, the prior quarter and the year ago quarter, was primarily due to the higher escrow balances, commercial mortgage servicing and continued client inflows, particularly in business and public sector clients.","This growth in deposits resulted in similar increases in our short-term investment portfolio, which increased $2.8 billion in the quarter. This increased liquidity was the reason for the 10-basis point reduction in our net interest margin. Over the past year, our mix of deposits has significantly changed, the CD is declining and low-cost transaction accounts increasing 11%. As a result, year-over-year deposit cost declined from 31 basis points to 20 basis points.","Turning to Slide 8, our taxable equivalent net interest income was $589 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $584 million for the third quarter and $607 million for the fourth quarter one year ago. Results in both, the fourth and third quarters of 2013, reflect the impact of the early termination of leverage leases. These transactions reduced net interest income by $8 million in the third quarter and by $3 million in the fourth quarter.","For the fourth quarter, our net interest margin was 3.01%, which was down 10 basis points from the prior quarter. This was in line with the guidance we provided in December, which reflected higher levels of liquidity from escrow balances primarily related to the acquisition of the mortgage servicing business from Bank of America and Berkadia. The higher level of liquidity was reflected in the $2.8 billion increase in our short-term investments. This increase liquidity level reduced our net interest margin by 11 basis points.","In 2014, we expect the net interest income to be relatively stable with reported level in 2013. We had also expected to maintain modest asset sensitivity. The use of interest rate swaps provides us with the flexibility to manage and quickly adjust our rate risk position. The duration and characteristics of Key's loan and investment portfolios continue to position us to realize more benefit from a rise in the shorter end of the yield curve.","Slide 9 shows a summary of noninterest income accounts for approximately 43% of our total revenue. Noninterest income the fourth quarter was $453 million, down $6 million from the third quarter, but above the $439 million in the fourth quarter of last year.","As I mentioned previously, we had leveraged lease terminations in both, the fourth and third quarters of 2013, which provided a benefit of $4 million in the fourth quarter and $23 million in the third quarter. Excluding the impact of leveraged leases, noninterest income would be up 3% from the prior quarter.","As Beth highlighted, we are also benefiting from investments in many of our core businesses. For example, cards and payments income is up 5% compared with same period one year ago, up 20% full year compared to 2012. This is reflective of our focus on and our commitment to providing clients with the full suite of payment products.","Turning to slide 10, our noninterest expense for the fourth quarter was $712 million, including $24 million in charges related to our efficiency initiative and pension settlement. Adjusted for the efficiency and pension settlement charges, expenses were down 4% from the prior year. This level was above our guidance for the quarter due to the higher than expected charges related to efficiency initiative as well as higher than expected technology cost, operational losses and expenses related the share price performance and our compensation plans. Importantly, we expect expense levels to come down meaningfully in the first quarter, reflecting the full run rate of our expense savings.","During the quarter, we closed 16 more branches, reaching a total of 81 or approximately 8% of our franchise since the launch of our efficiency initiative. As Beth commented earlier, our efficiency initiative reached $241 million in annual expense savings. Going forward, the savings from our continuous improvement efforts will be embedded within our expense run rate and we believe will help drive our efficiency ratio lower. We've made a lot of progress, but there is still a lot more we can do to improve productivity.","Turn to Slide 11, our net charge-offs declined to $37 million or 27 basis points of average total loans in the fourth quarter. This continues to be below our target range and is the lowest level since the first quarter of 2007. Total commercial loan net charge-offs this quarter remained low at 2 basis points of average loans and gross charge-offs improved by $12 million or 15% from the prior quarter.","To breakdown the asset quality by loan portfolio is shown on Slide 17 in the appendix. At December 31, 2013, our reserves for loan losses represented 1.56% period end loans and 167% coverage of our nonperforming loans. We expect charge-offs to remain at or below the target range in 2014, and for loan provision to approximate the level of net charge-offs.","Turning to Slide 12, our tangible common equity ratio and our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio, both remained strong at December 31st at 9.8% and 11.23%, respectively. Our current estimates of Tier 1 common equity as calculated under the final rule was 10.6%, which exceeds the fully phased in minimum requirement.","As Beth mentioned, we repurchased $474 million in common shares in 2013, including $99 million in the fourth quarter. We have approximately $90 million of net share repurchase authorization remaining under our 2013 capital plan, which run through March of this year. We submitted our or 2014 capital plans [reserve] earlier this month and plan on announcing our result in March following that reserve release of their analysis and findings.","Moving onto Slide 13, this is a summary of our outlook and expectations for 2014, consistent with my comments today. As I stated earlier, we expect average loans to continue to grow year-over-year in the mid-single digit range and our net interest income from and remained relatively stable with our reported level in 2013.","Revenue should also benefit from the full year of low single-digit growth in noninterest income compared to the prior year. We anticipate expenses will be down low single-digit on a full year basis. This guidance reflects the impact of implemented expense savings, planned investments as well as future costs associated with implementing additional cost savings initiatives.","Credit quality should remain a good story with net charge-offs at or below the lower end of our targeted range of 40 basis points to 60 basis points. Our GAAP effective tax rate should be in the 26% to 20% range this year, excluding the impact of the additional lease terminations. Finally, capital management will remain a priority, including continuing to execute on our remaining share repurchase authorizations.","With that, I'll close and turn the call back over to the operator for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Let's begin with Erika Najarian at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Good morning.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","My first question is clarity on the expense guidance for 2013. I was wondering whether or not the base under which we should take the single-digit decline would be the GAAP base or the adjusted base, excluding the efficiency charges?","Don Kimble","Guidance should reflect the actual reported expense base of $2.820 billion and we would expect to see a low single-digit kind of reduction from that level for the full year of 2014. Keep in mind though that guidance also does reflect the impact of investments as well as the other costs expenses to be incurred in connection with further expense reductions.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. My follow-up question is on the net interest income guidance. Could you give us a sense on where Key is positioned with the LCR proposals as you understand it? If you do need to continue to build liquidity from here, whether or not that's already fully embedded in your net interest income outlook for the year?","Don Kimble","Great. As far as the LCR as currently drafted, we haven't provided what our estimated calculations would be as there are a couple pieces of that proposal that do cause some challenges for us. One is the treatment of collateralized deposits which we [inaudible] as an unintended consequence of the current draft and also some of the handling associated with agency securities that once the rules are finalized and we believe that there should be some positive, hopefully, changes from those issues. We should be in good standing without any significant changes to the overall balance sheet.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Ryan Nash at Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs","Great. Good morning, guys.","Don Kimble","Hi, Ryan","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs","On the efficiency guidance of the 60 to 65, I used the midpoint of each piece of your guidance and I think it implies an adjusted efficiency ratio around 65%. I know, Beth, you talked about getting to the middle-end of that range without the higher rates. Is it fair to say that this can be achieved over the next four to six quarters or is this more likely to take a multi-year process?","Beth Mooney","I'll start with that answer and then I'll let Don add some color. As we go into 2014, I think everybody is continuing to see [inaudible] effective pressure in [loan] [ph] interest rate. As we look at it, we look to the growth in our balance sheet that we have seen in loan and deposits, we got some of the businesses where you have seen us invest in cards, mortgage servicing, so our goal is to clearly talk about positive operating leverage where our revenues will exceed our expense growth. And embedded in that is continued expense discipline and opportunities for further reductions and the opportunity to pace our investments, make sure that we are pairing them indeed with the revenue that we expect. It supports our strategy. I think the company definitely has the right focus, and I believe you will see progress within the range in 2014.","With that, I let Don add his comments.","Don Kimble","I think you are absolutely right, Beth. We are very focused on driving positive operating leverage, and with that we do believe that will translate to improvements in our efficiency ratio and I wouldn't want to suggest that it could be at the same pace that we saw from the second quarter of '12. We were at 69% to the current quarter we are about 65%, but we do believe that it will be a measured improvement on a year-over-year basis.","Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs","Got it. Then just a follow-up question on your mid-single-digit loan growth guidance, a couple of pieces of the question. I think you highlighted CF&A as an area that you expect to see growth, but given the improvement we have seen in CRE and construction, what are your expectations for those portfolios? Can we see those picking up at an accelerating pace?","Then just also related to overall loan growth you noted that there was an acceleration towards the end of the quarter. Is any of that seasonally you are seeing corporate is paying that down early in the year and just one last piece of the question. You noted that your economic outlook is muted. Can you just give us somewhat of an outlook in terms of what you are actually expecting for a broader macro picture?","Chris Gorman","Ryan, let me start. This is Chris Gorman. Let me start with the CRE question. Then, Beth, I'll ask you then to come back on our view on macro perspective. As it relates to CRE, Ryan, we do think we can continue to grow that portfolio. Our real estate business is an interesting one in that only about 15% of the capital we raised that we put on our balance sheet. Having said that, as we look at our jumping off point for '14, we had a lot of growth in the fourth quarter in CRE, so we have a very good jumping off point and the business has a fair amount of momentum.","With that I would caveat it. We are watching certain multi-family markets very, very carefully and we are tightening our screens. Having said that, we believe we can continue to grow our CRE business and the pipeline looks strong. As it relates to kind of our macro view\u2026","Beth Mooney","Yes. Ryan, I would just tell you that, clearly, our guidance is reflective of the momentum of our view of interest rates, our view of the economy as we go into 2014, but I think as you will see or kind of across the board as you look at the conference calls, banks as well as just the general tone in the market, 2014 is the year that is beginning with more economic strength and optimism than we have seen in past years, so the tone, the market performance of last year, the fact that there was the beginning of tapering in December, but we have a budget deal, we have always talked about our clients as being cautious or cautiously optimistic, but we have also said that our commercial, middle market and corporate clients are well-positioned. They are profitable, they have good balance sheet, and they are carrying high liquidity. We saw signs last year of consumer showing recovery, particularly as housing prices began to firm up, so could this play out to be an opportunity in 2014, I think is a big question that we will all be watching as the year goes on. If these things do indeed translate into greater confidence and business and consumers, will we see increased activity from what we are projecting.","I would tell you that it is too soon to see if that would cause any changes. I think our guidance is solid. I think it reflects what we [inaudible] we can deliver, but I will also tell you that our business model is well-positioned should the economy improve, demand increase as the year unfolds, we feel very good about how we have positioned ourselves in the market.","Don Kimble","Ryan you had one of the sub-question there as far as the year-end growth and I would suggest that it was led by commercial real estate as Chris had alluded to and also equipment finance, so this wasn't some of the typical window-dressing you might see from some commercial borrowers at the end of the year. This was a core business that we believe will start as a good launching point for us in 2014.","Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs","Great, guys. Thank you for taking my questions.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Josh Levin at Citi.","Josh Levin - Citi","Good morning. You have closed some branches over the past year or so, and I was wondering what's the process you are using to evaluate potential future branch closings?","Bill Koehler","Josh, this is Bill Koehler here. It is the same process we used for the 81 others. We take a look at individual branch productivity as well as we call it branch of share, which is looking at the broader impact of the way all our clients, middle-market clients, business banking clients and consumers engage in that branch and the revenue that is derived from it. As we look at the footprint and the productivity of the branches we have, we do see opportunities as we move forward to continue to optimize our branch network.","We do think we are at a position where we can optimize our network in what would be a more normal pace that you would typically see from any retail company and part of it is dependent on the pace at which we can generate more revenue from the investments in our digital channels. We feel good about some of the progress we are making there, but there is more work to be done.","Josh Levin - Citi","Okay. My second question is about capital. We don't yet know what your minimum regulatory capital requirements will be, but it's pretty clear that you have excess capital. How should investors think about that excess capital? Does it ultimately get distributed to shareholders, should we assume at some point not in 2014, but at some point your pet ratio exceeds 100% or is that excess capital now a permanent part of your capitalization?","Beth Mooney","Josh, I'll paint some color on our capital priorities and then I'll let Don add some of his thoughts. I think we have been pretty clear all along on our capital priorities and been consistent that - that to have a strong capital base that supports our ability to invest and grow our company organically that we are committed to our dividend, we are committed to share repurchase, and with that strong capital we feel like we have a competitive advantage to opportunistically grow our company, but that does indeed create future opportunities for us to continue to invest and grow.","In terms of, as you said, there will some capital ratios left. We continue to participate obviously in the annual CCAR process, we believe we are well positioned as a company, strong foundation which to go into the CCAR process and are looking to build a very consistent track record with our shareholders for how we manage, invest and deploy our capital. At this point, I'll let Don talk about relative level of capital, but I think it's premature to indicate a capital level, because of our final investment.","Don Kimble","I agree. I think, Josh, as far as our capital levels, I think used to be dictated based on the results of stress test, prospectively than it will be on any type of reasonable buffer, but then even with that, we do believe that we have very strong levels of capital and more than what our business model would suggest we would need to have to maintain a very profitable strong balance sheet and we do have the current constraints as far as the capital planning process and I would not want to project when those rules or guidelines might change.","I will tell you as I stated that our priorities are to support organic growth to continue to have a strong common dividend to return shareholders in a form of share buyback and to make it available for any other strategic opportunities, but we that we are going to be very prudent in how we manage our capital prospective.","Josh Levin - Citi","Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll go next to Steven Alexopoulos at JPMorgan.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","Good morning, everyone.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","On the expenses, on last quarter's earnings call you guys guided to, I think expenses were $680 million to $700 million, including one-time items in the quarter. One-timers came out at, it was $2 million above the upper end of the $15 million to $20 million range, but total expenses are $12 million above the upper end of the range and that was only a few months ago. Can you walk us through what drove expenses coming in so much higher than the upper end of guidance?","Don Kimble","Sure, and I think you started some of the walk-forward there, Steven. Essentially, the one-time costs were $24 million which was the expense initiative and the pension settlement cost is $24 million, so that was roughly $4 million higher than our guidance.","We also had expenses associated with operating loss, we also had some higher technology costs than were expected and we also had some increased costs associated with compensation plans that have a component tied to our share price and three of those areas cost us around $12 million, so if you would adjust for those areas that I think the core expense base for the current quarter is just shy of the $680 million range which would put us within that guidance range that we would have projected at the end of the third quarter. ","We acknowledge that it was higher, we would suggest that the nature of those expenses that caused us to be higher would be more one-time in nature or non-recurring, which gives us some confidence in our expense guidance going into 2014.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","Don, maybe I could follow-up on that guidance. I mean, the way I am looking at it basing it off of a base that includes one-time items doesn't give us really much transparency at all and Don how are you planning on managing expenses in the New Year, so you are looking at core expense levels, right? Which I think was $2.7 billion for the year or so. We know you need to make investments next year. Can you offset those and at least hold core expenses flat for the year?","Don Kimble","Well, our expense guidance was down low single-digits and we have defined low-single-digits as less than 5%, so if you take that $2.8 billion reported expense base and reduce it more in that range I think it would imply a fairly flat to maybe slightly down expenses from that core level you had cited, so we have committed to the $241 million in expense savings. That has been implemented.","We would expect to see and realize the full benefit of that in the first quarter of 2014, prospectively. Our guidance does include the additional investments we are planning on making along with an estimate of what we think will be one-time costs associated with further expense reductions that we have planned going into 2014.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","Great. I appreciate the follow-up color. Thanks.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Matt O'Connor at Deutsche Bank.","Ron Placid - Deutsche Bank","Good morning. This is Ron Placid from Matt's team. How are you guys doing?","Don Kimble","Good.","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","Ron Placid - Deutsche Bank","First question. As it relates to your fee income guidance of low single-digit growth versus 2013, I guess first what categories you expect to drive growth in 2014 and will it be a continuation of what you've seen in 2013?","Then secondly if we look at the implied full year 2014 fee income number, just comparing that to the 4Q annualized level. How should we think about kind of growth versus the 4Q, annualized level in fee income\u2026","Don Kimble","Yes. As far as the guidance for 2014, a couple of areas that we think will be strong contributors to us in the 2014 results for fee income growth. One is, investment banking and debt placement fee. We are expecting that to outpace the rest of the fee income categories.","The second would be in cards and payments-related income. We have made some investments there and we really launched our proprietary card here in late third, early fourth quarter and so we are expecting to see lots of benefit from those two areas.","If you take a look at the fourth quarter of $453 million, there are some items in there that are more seasonal in nature, including our corporate-owned life insurance income. We tend to have a pick up in the fourth quarter there and some of the other categories will show some normal seasonal trends too. For instance, in the first quarter with the day count being two days smaller or less, but it does create some pressure on some of the fee income categories in the first quarter compared to the full year run rate.","Ron Placid - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Great. Then, just as it relates to your net interest income guidance for 2014, of flat year-over-year, I guess, what does this imply for the net interest margin and can you just talk about kind of the trajectory of the NIM as we go through 2014? Then may be your ability to deploy some of the liquidity build you have seen in..","Don Kimble","Good question. I would have suggested that we would have seen more utilization of our excess liquidity earlier in the year throughout 2013, and we continue to see it build, but our guidance is on net interest income and not necessarily on the margin because of that. Because, we would expect to see higher levels of liquidity continuing into the first part of 2013, which would imply initially maintaining a margin that's really close to the current level, because those excess liquidity levels would continue.","On a normal basis throughout 2014, we would expect to see the lower rate environment still have a one to two-basis point negative impact on a linked quarter basis and that will put pressure on the margin that will be offset by some of the benefit from utilization of that excess liquidity throughout the year.","Ron Placid - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse","Thanks. Good morning.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse","First, I just want to hit on expenses one more time here and I am wondering, Don, may be if you could provide some additional detail behind what specifically drove the operating loss and also the IT trend in the fourth quarter results?","Don Kimble","Yes. As far as the operating loss, it was an individual issue that would be non-recurring. It was less than $4 million, so it wasn't a large dollar amount. It did result in a negative variance and we did recognize that later in the quarter.","As far as the IT costs, but we had a lot less capitalized IT and more expensed IT in the current quarter based on the nature of some of the projects and that worked out to be about a $4 million negative variance there as well and so those are the two primary areas associated with that variance.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse","Okay. Then just on our commercial real estate. You had really nice momentum here in the fourth quarter on both, the loan generation and also the fee income side. Can you update us in terms of what you have seen over the last few months and also how the joint venture with Berkadia has played into it and also what are you seeing on the construction front and also the permanent financing segment, because it seems like some banks have talked about competition easing little bit on that back part?","Chris Gorman","Craig, this is Chris. What we are seeing from a competitive landscape is, really not a big change. Compete really in all the segments between on balance sheet, CMBS, Fannie and Freddie, FHA with the institutional market which is primarily insurance companies, so we don't see a huge change in the competitive landscape.","What we do see, and I think I alluded to it earlier is, we see some markets where there has been a lot of buildings, specifically in multi-family, specifically in certain markets. Having said that, there are plenty of opportunities outside of those markets and even in those markets we see opportunities with our really great customers and people that we require them to put in more equity, so we feel good about the real estate market but probably the bright spot has been multifamily. As you look at the cap rates, it manifest itself in that. Multi-family cap rates right now are somewhere between 5.5 and 7.5 and they didn't really change after the tenure went up 110 basis points.","As it relates to our third-party commercial loan servicing business, we continue to have a lot of momentum in that business. The CMBS market this year was about an $80 billion market, up from around $60 billion, but what's really interesting for that business is we are now at a point where a lot of the CMBS that we service are maturing and so that gives us an opportunity to garner more servicing. It also gives us a unique opportunity to look into those and see what pieces and parts we might want to finance.","Then the last piece, and that actually impacted us positively in the fourth quarter, is the special servicing business that we have really grown and then picked up in two additional pieces. We are named special servicer now on about 50 billion, up from kind of mid-teens just a couple of years ago and that's a countercyclical business. You are basically the workout agent and by definition you are not a lender into that deal. That's an area that really hasn't kicked in yet, but when the market gets softer, as it inevitably will, there will be an opportunity for us.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse","Just one follow-up, as those loans mature within the servicing portfolio, when do you think your servicing portfolio will actually start to drive stronger commercial real estate loan growth? Will it be in 2014 or is it more a 2015 and later event?","Chris Gorman","As you look at the refinancing cliff, I would say that there will be some in '14, but it should accelerate in '15.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse","All right. Great, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We'll go next to Mike Mayo at CLSA.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Hi. Can you reassure more on efficiency? I guess there's three parts to my question. I guess it's been about five or six questions on efficiency. Your stock is down 4% in the opening minutes and with all the questions on expenses and efficiency, I'm guessing it has to do with that, but first the 2014 guidance for a positive operating leverage, but having the efficiency charges included in the base for 2013, I think that's probably the biggest concern.","On Slide 10, you showed the efficiency ratio without those charges. Then when you guide forward, you include those back in, so just any more comfort on 2014? I guess you said flat-to-down, but I'm not sure what else you can do but it would be helpful.","The second part of that would be the efficiency target. At the annual meeting Beth, you said 60% to 65% is not an ending point and the target range of 60% to 65% is still worse than where the company was 20 years ago and I guess the third point what this is leading to is just more details.","Don, I appreciate you saying a lot more to improve efficiency, but we don't have any numbers, so anything else you give us. I guess, are you going to start reporting the $241 million annualized savings? Do you have a new number? Branch closings? FTE, which business areas because 65% is still a really lousy efficiency ratio.","Beth you've made tremendous progress over the past couple of years not to take anything away from that, but just as stocks go up they can go back down if that progress is stalled as it looks like it stalled in the fourth quarter. Thanks.","Beth Mooney","All right, Mike, there were many parts to that question. If I could, I will address the target and then I do think we have some very specific questions on certain slides and certain numbers that I am going to ask Don to fill in, and I would reiterate that 60% to 65% is not the end of where we see the path for Key as we've become a more efficient company and as we looked at 2014, we are reaffirming 60% to 65% as the range for 2014. That's driven by a couple of factors. I alluded to one of them earlier, which is the continued low interest rate environment, the pressure everyone is seeing on their net interest income as a result.","Strong balance sheet growth isn't necessarily translating into top line revenue growth in this particular environment, so I think our goal this year and what you should watch and what was accountable to is our ability to move within the range both, by every single day our ability as we talk about positive operating leverage is to grow our businesses, to grow our revenue, to become more efficient, continue our journey of reducing our cost base, but at the same time as you've heard us talk about some of the investments we have made are bearing fruit, specifically in the commercial mortgage servicing business, in our cards and our payments, so we are going to continue to invest, because we believe it is benefitting our business mix, the vitality of our company and fits within our profile from a risk point of view, so 60% to 65% is not an end but it is the right rage for 2014, and as I said earlier our goal is to move within that range during the year. Then I think you had some more detailed questions that I am going to turn over to Don.","Don Kimble","Sure, Mike, and as far as the expense guidance that we always want to baseline that with our reported numbers and so the $2.820 billion is our total expenses for 2013. The low-single-digit kind of decline year-over-year is translating to something that would be flattish with the core expense levels in 2013. Absent the $117 million, the one-time charges, keep in mind that our guidance for 2014 does include roughly $30 million or so of one-time cost estimates for 2014 and also it does include investments that we are making in a number of our strategic areas, so we believe that the guidance is appropriate.","We do believe that it does reflect ongoing expense initiatives and we are very focused on driving positive operating leverage and we think that this guidance does accomplish that and we think it's been consistent with our overall operating plan outlook.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Just as one follow-up, Don, if you could just give some insight with your limited time in the position some areas where you see additional efficiency benefits and I keep harping on this issue as someone who has covered the company 20 years, I know its new management and everything else, but 65% efficiency versus a peer group average closer to 60%, yes there should be a lot of room to improve efficiency. Just in which areas? Point us in some direction, which business lines? Anything else that we can sink our teeth into? Thanks.","Don Kimble","Well, as far as areas, what we need to continue to improve is our overall productivity across all of our segments and each of our businesses are keenly focused on that, we needed to enhance that over time. Just a more specific area is, if you look at our occupancy cost compared to revenue and size the organization, it is outsized and we have taken a number of initiatives and steps to address that.","We have talked about the reduction in the commitment to space here in our corporate center and we are going to free up about 200,000 square feet and have a net savings of $4 million to $5 million a year coming from that and much of that doesn't kick off until '15 as these leases expire, but we have got similar efforts throughout our franchise that have addressed other regional headquarter space and trying to gain additional efficiency improvements there as well, so we are making a lot of progress, we do have a number of areas to continue to focus on and we are addressing it just like we have with some of the branch consolidation efforts as well.","There are long list of initiatives and areas of focus and more of that will be driven prospectively by some of the change in the culture and focus on continuous improvements throughout the company.","Beth Mooney","One area, Mike, that we have invested in and that I have talked about recently at one of our conferences is Lean Six Sigma. I think, our end-to-end processes in this company are right opportunities to improve not only the efficiency of the process, but the ultimate end client experience and we have a list of those that we have prioritized as a team where we are really going to look at some of our underlying processes, because I think there will be opportunities and targets would be put around that that we are expecting from that group.","That is something that many other companies may have already done, but that's the journey where I think this is the year where we are really well organized to do that work. There continue to be opportunities within vendors and sourcing as well, so as you look at the underlying infrastructure, what cost deliver at Key, there are still continuing opportunities.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Bob Ramsey at FBR Capital Markets.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets","Thank you. My question has already been asked.","Beth Mooney","All right. Thanks, Bob.","Operator","We'll move next to Steve Scinicariello at UBS.","Steve Scinicariello - UBS","Good morning, everyone.","Beth Mooney","Morning.","Steve Scinicariello - UBS","Just wanted to focus on the other driver of the efficiency ratio, the revenue side of the equation, I know you mentioned a couple of drivers on the fee income side whether it's the mortgage servicing, the cards and also on the investment banking side, but just kind of curious where you might see kind of the greatest revenue opportunities as you look out to 2014 and just kind of give us a little color on some of the key drivers there?","Chris Gorman","Sure, Steve. It's Chris Gorman here. Our biggest key driver is to continue to be able to take our unique business model that connects with these middle market customers and convert them into customers, so if you look last year, we literally brought on hundreds of new customers, we enhanced hundreds more. We have this broad product offering.","As you look at our ability to bring new people on to our platform, we had a lot of success in doing that, so really as we think about revenue, we don't necessarily think about any particular product; loans, deposits, fees, we have been fortunate enough to grow all those. What we really focused on is in a very targeted way growing the clients that we have.","Empirically, last year we brought on 648 new clients, we also brought on some new senior bankers. We've talked about the fact we are going to continue to go out and hire people and leverage the platform, so that is what we see is our biggest driver of revenue in the past year and frankly going forward as we looked to '14.","Bill Koehler","This is Bill Koehler. In the Community Bank, in particular, as it relates to the consumer, I think most people would say the consumer is getting steadily stronger and we have seen that materialize in our home equity book and we have also seen some growth in our credit card portfolio from the levels when we originally bought it.","We think there's more opportunity there. As the consumer gets stronger, you can envision more investment. Revenue you can certainly envision more net interest income from improving our consumer loan book, so there are plenty of opportunities there as we go forward too.","Steve Scinicariello - UBS","Perfect, so that's the other part of the equation. When you are talking about increasing productivity, it sounds like you have a lot of targeted opportunities both, on the middle market side and on the consumer side as well then?","Bill Koehler","This is Bill again. I would say two things. It's not just productivity, but we see an opportunity to leverage our model to take share in both, the Corporate Bank and the Community Bank. We intend to hire some bankers in very targeted ways where we see opportunity to enhance our presence in either industry groups or any specific geography.","Beth Mooney","Steve, I would just underscore, because Don mentioned it that it is indeed a focus of our management team that productivity is an opportunity as well and it's something concerning metrics and we will be reviewing regularly with our team to capture opportunities for more productive sales force, as well as adding to our sales force with high quality people who can help generate business.","Steve Scinicariello - UBS","Perfect. Thank you so much.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We'll go next to Alan Strauss at Schroders.","Alan Strauss - Schroders","Yes. Could you maybe give us a little insight into the one-time or the repositioning charges that you expect in 2014? At the same time what the incremental cost saves you expect? I guess, we would see in 2015 from those charges?","Don Kimble","As far as the estimated one-time cost that's for programs similar to what we have implemented this year, and I would say generally it's about a year-and-a-half to maybe a two-year payback on some of the costs that generally has a fairly quick turnaround.","Alan Strauss - Schroders","Could you refresh me what was it this past year, the one-times that you put through?","Don Kimble","The one-time\u2026","Alan Strauss - Schroders","Well, not really one-time, but for the year the repositioning costs?","Don Kimble","The total costs associated with the expense initiative were in the $90 million range for the current year. On top of that, we had roughly $27 million on the pension settlement, so total of $117 million and we are expecting to have about $30 million of one-time costs in 2014.","Alan Strauss - Schroders","Then in 2015, the run rate should go down by at least maybe another $90 million, with these cost saves?","Don Kimble","I would suggest that the $30 million has a one-and-a-half year type of payback period that would imply somewhere around $20 million type of annual expense reduction for those initiatives.","Alan Strauss - Schroders","Okay. Thanks.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","We will move next to Gerard Cassidy at RBC.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Thank you. Good morning. Don, can you come back to the capital questions that you heard today? I think you pointed out that the stress test maybe the driver of what kind of capital you and your peers will have to keep on your balance sheet.","Everyone recognizes as you did that your Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III is very, very high. If I recall correctly the stress test is calling that all the banks have to exceed a Tier 1 common ratio of 5%., so if 5% is the bogie in the stress test, what does that equate into a regular Basel III Tier 1 common ratio based on your balance sheet today?","Don Kimble","I think that what you would see typically is the stress of about 300 basis points in most banks compared to what the capital levels would be on a starting basis versus what goes through the stress test, so I think that gives you one benchmark for that.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll move next to Jennifer Demba at SunTrust.","Jennifer Demba - SunTrust","Thank you. I think that all the questions have been asked, but I'll call it on the multi-family caution, just curious which markets you are relatively more cautious on right now Chris?","Chris Gorman","Jennifer, we're constantly screening these markets. I think some of the markets that we really, have our eye on are markets like Washington D.C. like Raleigh, like Denver, like Seattle. Those are some of the markets we are watching cautiously.","Jennifer Demba - SunTrust","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll go next to Nancy Bush at NAB Research.","Nancy Bush - NAB Research","Good morning. Beth, if I could ask you is there some part of this sort of chronically high efficiency ratio that's structural? I mean, is there something about the configuration of the company that leads to this and part of that being markets where you don't have as much scale as you'd like to have and how do you address this over the long-term?","Beth Mooney","Yes, Nancy. I'd be glad to talk about that, because I do think it is a question that does come up from time-to-time, and I would tell you it is, my belief, and I think it's something we have evaluated pretty thoroughly. It is not a structural cost related to our footprint, particularly in era of image enabled technology, digital. There is no particular cost burden to our geographic footprint that I think is burdensome to the company","I think as we look at it, I think it is a matter of a couple of things. When you look at kind of our expense ratios and then our revenue for FTE a piece of it is embedded in the productivity and the revenue side of this company, so you've heard us I think continued and purposely talk about this as positive operating leverage as an efficiency ratio initiative. I think we should get more productivity out of our franchise. I think we have benefited from our geographic dispersion with our particular business model, because it plays into our vertical; it plays into our ability to be a strong middle-market lender, a private banking presence.","We were talking many times what we are in a market is so much more than just whatever our branch density is, so I do think it is a journey for Key that does every single day have us thinking about what can we do to enhance revenue, add to our capabilities, add to our sales professionals, add to our productivity, and constantly reduce our expenses, and I think the broader structural opportunity is the one I mentioned, which is in some of our processes that we've really never gone on an end-to-end look. And I think that is a bigger opportunity for us this year and something I'm really going to focus on.","Nancy Bush - NAB Research","","If I might just ask as an add on to that? I mean what part will acquisitions play and your thought process?","Beth Mooney","I would tell you that for a lot of reasons the acquisition market has not been simply robust for the last couple of years. As you have seen more has happened and we have participated in one of those in terms of acquisition of branches as opposed to whole franchises. We did the Western New York transaction from HSBC in 2012, and I will tell you, that has gone very well for us.","I think I think as we look at it, and look at where we would invest opportunistically, I think we would always look at something that could complement a market where we already have presence and by building density or brining in the right customer base that that would be additive.","I think we are looking at how can we use investments in technology, mobile and digital to augment our franchise. I view that as something where we have a unique opportunity, I think, to leverage that against our footprint, because I think that's going to broaden our ability to create a consumer and client experience.","Then frankly, we have shown where we will look at specialty businesses that are very much on point and within strategies that yet add to our business platform or our product platform, so that's how I'm thinking as. Acquisitions, I look at them more broadly in terms of what can they do for our business models to grow revenue and increase our capability.","Nancy Bush - NAB Research","Thank you.","Operator","We'll move next to Terry McEvoy of Oppenheimer.","Terry McEvoy - Oppenheimer","Thanks. Don, you said the first quarter expenses would come down meaningfully. Should we look at $680 million as a good starting point for the first quarter and how should we think about the $39 million of one-time expenses in '14? Will that be relatively spread out or are there any quarters that you see those costs being a little bit elevated?","Don Kimble","As far as the first quarter, I think our baseline for the fourth quarter is a good start point to make adjustments from. Keep in mind that there are certain seasonal type of expense trends that do occur in the first quarter, so you will see some variance in a few line items like employer taxes and marketing tends to be a little lower for us, so you will see some positives and negatives there.","As far as the $30 million of expected onetime cost, right now, we are not showing any significant volatility throughout the year, but that can change based on the timing of different announcements and plans.","Terry McEvoy - Oppenheimer","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Marty Mosby at Guggenheim.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim","Hi. I wanted to follow-up or kind of talk about net interest margin and asset sensitivity. Just curious about how asset sensitive you think you are when rates eventually do climb and you have been kind of letting swaps roll off, so how much would you like to increase that, let's say, over the next year, year-and-a-half before short-term rates begin to increase?","Don Kimble","Marty, this is Don. Right now our estimated asset sensitivity is around a 3% position for a 200 rate environment. We have accomplished that from as you've suggested, the runoff of some of the swaps that have been matured, that did have a negative impact in the current quarter about 2 basis points to our margins as far as linked quarter change in our swap benefit.","We would probably continue to manage in a relative similar range to where we are now. I wouldn't want to suggest that we would see a lot of variability in that over the next year. We have about $1 billion of swaps that mature throughout 2014, which will allow us the opportunity to adjust that position over time.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim","At this point, no further plans on the 2 basis points loss this quarter deterioration because of the swaps rolling off and not getting the benefit?","Don Kimble","No plans to make any adjustments there. Again, I think just beyond the swaps that the nature of our balance sheet allows us benefit from rates we think pretty quickly. If you look our investment portfolio, it tend to be a shorter duration. It was 3.6 as of the end of the fourth quarter and that would allow us to benefit from increasing rates fairly quickly.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andrew Marquardt at Evercore.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore","I just wanted to drill down a little bit onto fees. Then just to be clear, I guess first off on the guidance. Just to be clear, it's off of a reported number. It sounds like across the board. Is that correct?","Don Kimble","That's correct.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners","Then for this quarter, it looks like other had and hedging benefit in it from certain sale gains in the Real Estate Capital group, and also appreciate the breaking out rather the mortgage servicing fees this quarter. How should we think about those two line items on kind of a go-forward basis? Thanks.","Don Kimble","As far as the other, you are right that we did have about $4 billion linked-quarter improvement coming from some of the gains as you referenced and the mortgage servicing fee income did benefit this quarter a little bit from some specialty servicing fees, and those may be a little more episodic as far as their occurrence and so you might see a little fluctuation there, but those types of changes were considered as part of our overall guidance for the growth year-over-year.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners","When I look at, I guess, the Corporate Bank business line segment, it looked like the other- other kind of gains were maybe greater than that, or are there other things in there? Maybe I'm getting too lost into each year in terms of $15 million gain this quarter, fees this quarter versus last quarter versus last quarter $8 million drag and the year ago $6 million drag?","Don Kimble","In the fourth quarter of '12, we really benefited from a very strong commercial real estate market, both in the volume and also rates on some of the sales that we had, so that's some of the drag that you referenced compared to the fourth quarter of '12. As far as other unusual items in the Corporate Bank for the fourth quarter, there really weren't other items of any size, and so that $4 million change that we talked about before really was the largest individual change within those categories.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Ken Usdin at Jefferies.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes. Hi. This is Tom from Ken's team. I just had a quick question on taxes. The 4Q rate looked a little light, how should we be thinking about that for 2014?","Don Kimble","Sure. The fourth quarter rate did reflect the impact of the leverage lease transaction that was referenced as well. What we've provided for our guidance for 2014 will be an effective rate of somewhere between 26% and 28% and that assumes no further leverage lease transactions.","Unidentified Analyst","","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","We have time for one more question. We'll go next to Brian Foran of Autonomous.","Brian Foran - Autonomous","Hi. I have a seven-part question.","Don Kimble","Hi, Brian.","Brian Foran - Autonomous","Just on the fees. Two numbers you mentioned 15%, I think, 15% of total CRE capital raised going off the balance sheet securitization debt and equity placements et cetera, and 648 early subscribers down. New middle market customers who you are attempting to further penetrate and cross-sell, can you just remind us on both of those metrics? How does that compare versus history and any expectation for how that will look going forward?","Chris Gorman","Brian, its Chris Gorman. As it relates to the question you asked specifically on real estate, so it's actually the inverse of what you described. We raised in the real estate business a total of $44.3 billion in '13. Of that in terms of commitments 6.4 billion or slightly less than 15% went on our balance sheet and the other 85% was placed elsewhere. As you look at those metrics, it would compare to a total of $34.7 billion raised in '12, and as you look at what's on balance sheet in terms of commitments, it would be $6.4 billion, up from $5.5 in '12.","As it relates to our new clients, we spend a lot of time really focusing on new clients and expanded relationships and the reason we do that is, we think this platform we built is unique for the middle market, but we think there is an opportunity to leverage it, so the 648 new clients, really, was across the entire Corporate Bank. They generated about $108 million worth of revenue, and what's even more interesting is our expanded relationships, those which were doing significantly more business than we did last year, 428 of those generated another $259 million in revenue. As you can see, it's a pretty dynamic client base as we continue to get more and more focused and really go deep into these six verticals that we are focused on. That answers your question?","Brian Foran - Autonomous","That's very helpful. Thank you for the detail.","Chris Gorman","You are welcome.","Operator","That does conclude today's question-and-answer session.

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Beth Mooney, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Beth Elaine Mooney - KeyCorp","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to KeyCorp's third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Joining me for today's presentation is Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer, and available for our Q&A portion of the call, is Bill Hartmann, our Chief Risk Officer.","Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question and answer segment of our call.","I'm now turning to slide 3. Third quarter was pivotal for our company in terms of both financial results and executing our strategy. We successfully closed our acquisition of First Niagara adding over $35 billion in assets, 300 new branches, and 1 million new customers to Key. And while a lot of time and resources have been devoted to making sure our acquisition and conversion went smoothly, we've also stayed focused on maintaining the momentum in our core businesses. Importantly, both our Community Bank and Corporate Bank delivered strong results this quarter and Don will cover our outlook in his remarks. But let me just say, we remain confident in meeting our commitments, including the achieving the financial targets for our acquisition.","I am now moving to slide 4. Before I provide highlights of our quarter, I do want to share that throughout our presentation we've provided important details and transparency for Key's standalone operations and the impact of our acquisition. As we move forward, we will be reporting consolidated results with Key and First Niagara combined, but this quarter, we thought it would be useful to provide additional detail.","Slide 4 provides some highlights for standalone Key and the strong performance we saw this quarter. Our Community Bank and Corporate Bank are performing well and we're realizing benefits from the investments we have made in recent years. As shown in our recent earnings release, we reported EPS of $0.16, and it is $0.30 excluding the impact of merger-related charges.","First Niagara operations were relatively neutral to our EPS this quarter. Compared to the year-ago period, standalone Key delivered positive operating leverage and we are well positioned as we move forward as a combined company having generated positive operating leverage for 9 of the past 11 quarters on a standalone basis.","Revenue grew 6% from the prior year, as we benefited from another quarter of solid loan and deposit growth and an 8% increase in non-interest income. Standouts for the quarter include a record level of investment banking and debt placement fees along with double-digit growth in cards and payments income. Expenses continue to be well managed and reflected higher performance-based compensation this quarter along with an increased FDIC assessment. Not on the slide, but worth noting, we had another solid quarter in terms of credit quality with our net charge-off ratio remaining below our targeted range. And although this slide focuses on Key's standalone results, the performance of First Niagara since our acquisition announcement has exceeded our initial projections and we remain very excited about the opportunity to grow this new part of our company.","Moving now to slide 5. As I said, this has been a pivotal time for our company and I'm extremely proud of the dedication and hard work of our teams from both Key and First Niagara. During the last three months we completed our regulatory approval process and closed our acquisition. We also completed the divestiture of 18 branches on September 9 and we executed our client outreach plan which were comprehensive in scale and scope. We mailed out 4 million pieces of mail to our new customers and our bankers have personally touched tens of thousands of clients in every business to welcome them to the new KeyBank.","I am now on slide 6. Over Columbus Day weekend, we completed the branch and client conversion, which included moving data and account information for over 1 million new clients on to the Key platform. We converted over 300 branches, which re-opened as Key and consolidated 70 former First Niagara branches. An additional 36 Key branches are targeted for consolidation in the fourth quarter. The conversion went well. Our detailed plans were well executed and we were open for business across our franchise as planned on Tuesday morning. Our 3 million customers, including the 1 million from First Niagara, could bank with Key throughout our 1300 branches, 1500 ATMs and across our digital channels, from consumer online banking to our sophisticated treasury management portal. For our new customers, the systems converted as planned. Their account information was transferred, and products and services like credit cards, debit cards and bill pay capabilities all remained fully functional.","During the conversion, as issues surfaced that impacted a very small percentage of our client base, our teams worked hard to quickly resolve them and make it right for our customers. Our planning and hard work over the past 12 months paid off and execution was solid. Although we are still in early stages, the overall feedback from legacy First Niagara customers has been positive.","Turning to slide 7. As I said, we continue to be confident in our ability to deliver on our financial targets. More specifically, I want to affirm our prior commitments that we have a high degree of confidence in achieving our cost savings target of $400 million. As I've said before, our internal target is higher and has remained consistent. We expect to achieve our full run rate savings by the back half of 2017, which means it will be fully reflected in our 2018 results. Most of the outsource technology and operations, which are a significant part of the overall cost savings, should be terminated by early next year, with associated savings realized by that time. Benefits from occupancy, the remaining 36 branch consolidations, and corporate functions will be realized throughout 2017.","As we look forward, we continue to believe that Key and First Niagara are a powerful combination that accelerates our performance beyond what either company could have otherwise achieved, improving our cash efficiency ratio by 300 basis points and our return on tangible common equity by 200 basis points. And not included in our targets, but something that continues to provide real opportunity, is the $300 million in revenue synergies that we have identified. By leveraging our products and capabilities in areas like payments, treasury management, and commercial mortgage banking, we have the opportunity to better serve First Niagara's client base, and we've already seen some early wins and our confidence continues to grow in achieving our revenue plans.","Let me conclude my remarks by recognizing the hard work and dedication of our teams over the past year. I'm incredibly proud that we were able to successfully close and integrate our acquisition while at the same time, accelerate our momentum that's been reflected in our Community Bank and Corporate Bank performance. And as we move forward as one company, I'm even more excited for the opportunities we have to accelerate our performance, drive growth, and create long-term value for our clients, communities, employees, and most importantly, our shareholders.","Now I turn the call over to Don to provide more detail on our quarterly results. Don?","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Thanks, Beth, and I'm on slide 9. Third quarter net income from continuing operations was $0.30 per common share, after excluding $0.14 of merger-related charges. This compares to $0.26 per share in the year-ago period and $0.27 in the second quarter, which excluded $0.04 of merger-related charges. As Beth mentioned, after adjusting for the impact of First Niagara and merger charges, we generated positive operating leverage relative to the year-ago quarter. On a standalone basis, Key's revenues were up 6% from the prior year, and up 5% from the second quarter.","The EPS impact of First Niagara was relatively neutral to our third quarter results. Results not only reflect the impact of First Niagara's operations for two months, but also the estimated purchase accounting adjustments and the impact from our divestiture of 18 branches on September 9. I'll cover many of these items on this slide in the rest of my presentation, so I'm now turning to slide 10.","Average loan balances were up $18 billion, or 31% compared to the year ago quarter, and up $17 billion or 27% from the second quarter. First Niagara contributed $15 billion alone to the third quarter results on an average basis, or $23 billion on a period-end basis. Excluding the impact of First Niagara, average loans grew 5% year-over-year driven by commercial, financial, and agricultural loans up 11%. We've seen double digit year-over-year growth in 18 of the past 20 quarters for CF&A loans, reflecting our investments in senior bankers, and we've also maintained our moderate risk profile.","Average loans were up $1 billion, or 2% unannualized from the second quarter, excluding the impact of First Niagara, driven primarily by growth in commercial loans. Our estimated fair value adjustment on acquired First Niagara loans was 2.8%, or $686 million. Importantly, this adjustment is an estimate and we expect to see additional refinement in the fourth quarter of this year as we work to finalize our purchase accounting. Also during the quarter, our branch divestiture resulted in a reduction of $439 million in loans.","Continuing on the slide 11. Average deposits, excluding deposits in foreign office, totaled $95 billion for the third quarter of 2016, an increase of $25 billion compared to the year-ago period and $21 billion compared to the second quarter. First Niagara contributed $19 billion of deposits to the third quarter results on an average basis, or $27 billion on a period-end basis. In our Appendix materials, you will see that we recorded an estimated $356 million of core deposit intangible asset associated with the acquisition.","Excluding First Niagara, the 9% year-over-year increase in deposit balances primarily reflects core growth in our retail banking franchise, and higher escrow deposits from our commercial mortgage servicing business. Compared to the second quarter of 2016, our average deposit growth of 3% excluding First Niagara reflects higher escrow balances from our commercial mortgage servicing business, core deposit growth in retail banking franchise, and inflows from our commercial clients. During the quarter, the branch divestiture resulted in a reduction of $1.6 billion in deposits.","Slide 12 shows our investment portfolio and highlights changes that occurred over the quarter. Average total investment securities were $24 billion for the third quarter, which was up $5 billion from both the third quarter of last year and the second quarter of this year. Growth compared to the prior year and the prior quarter reflects the acquisition of First Niagara's portfolio, which added $4.7 billion on an average balance basis, and $9 billion on a period-end basis.","During the quarter, we completed planned sales and the repositioning of First Niagara's portfolio to more closely align with Key's portfolio and investment philosophy. Proceeds from the portfolio sales were primarily used to pay down FHLB advances. The average yield on investment portfolio decreased 13 basis points from the prior year and 12 basis points from the prior quarter, which reflects the impact of First Niagara portfolio and the continued pressure from lower reinvestment yields.","Turning to slide 13, taxable equivalent net interest income was $788 million for the third quarter 2016. The net interest margin was 2.85%. These results compared to taxable equivalent net interest income of $598 million and a net interest margin of 2.87% for the third quarter of 2015. First Niagara contributed $175 million to third quarter net interest income. Included in this figure is $19 million from purchase accounting accretion. The purchase accounting accretion on the loans for the third quarter was estimated, which did not reflect any loan prepayments. In the fourth quarter, we will finalize the purchase accounting marks, which we expect will result in an increase in net interest income.","Reported results for the quarter also include $6 million of merger-related charges. Excluding First Niagara, and the merger-related charges, net interest income increased 4% from the prior year and 2% from the prior quarter, with both increases driven primarily by higher earning asset balances. The third quarter net interest margin of 2.85% was 9 basis points higher than the prior quarter. Purchase accounting contributed 6 basis points of the growth, with all other items providing a benefit of 3 basis points on a combined basis.","Slide 14 shows a summary of non-interest income, which accounted for 41% of our total revenue. Non-interest income in the third quarter was $549 million, up $79 million or 17% from the prior year and up $76 million or 16% from the prior quarter. Our results this quarter included $53 million from First Niagara, which reflected two months worth of impact. Additionally, within non-interest income, we incurred $12 million of merger-related charges, including losses realized from the repositioning of the investment portfolio.","Excluding the impact of the acquisition and the merger-related charges, non-interest income was up 8% from the prior year and up 7% from the prior quarter. We saw continued growth and momentum in a number of our core fee-based businesses, reflecting investments we have made over the past few years.","As Beth mentioned, investment banking and debt placement fees had a record quarter. We saw strength across our platform, including commercial mortgage banking, equity capital markets and M&A advisory fees, reflecting the strength of the Key relationship model. And while not a material growth driver, trading income did increase, but it is included elsewhere on the income statement.","Cards and payments income also contributed to our strong results with double-digit growth, excluding the impact of the acquisition, compared to both the year ago and prior quarters and service charges on deposit accounts continue to move higher, as our number of customers and related activities grow. During the third quarter, operating lease income and other leasing gains reflected $12 million of lease residual losses.","Turning to slide 15. As you can see on this is slide, reported non-interest expense of $1.1 billion includes $189 million of merger charges and $140 million of expense related to two months of First Niagara operations. Excluding these costs, non-interest expense was $753 million for the quarter. We provided a detailed breakout of our merger-related charges in the Appendix of our materials.","Compared to the third quarter of last year, and after adjusting for the impact of First Niagara and merger related charges, non-interest expense was up $29 million or 4%. Linked quarter expenses, also adjusted for the acquisition, were up $47 million or 7%. Those comparisons reflect higher performance-based compensation and an increased FDIC assessment. Expenses related to the First Niagara operations were lower than previous guidance provided. This improvement reflects some acceleration of merger cost savings and lower than expected core deposit intangible amortization.","Turning to slide 16. Overall net charge-offs were $44 million or 23 basis points of the average total loans in the third quarter, which continues to be below our targeted range. Third quarter provision for credit losses was $59 million, an increase of $14 million from the year-ago period and $7 million from the linked quarter. Impact from First Niagara resulted in $18 million of provision expense for the third quarter, $12 million of which related to the purchase credit card portfolio, which was initially recorded at a premium.","Non-performing loans and non-performing assets both increased relative to year-ago period in the prior quarter, reflecting $150 million in non-performing loans and $167 million of non-performing assets from the First Niagara acquisition.","At September 30, 2016 our total reserves for loan losses represented 1.01% of period-end loans and 120% coverage of our non-performing loans, and reflects the acquisition of First Niagara portfolios at fair value.","And turning to slide 17, our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio at the end of the third quarter was 9.55%, which reflects the impact of First Niagara. With the completion of the acquisition, we did resume our common share repurchase program and repurchased $65 million in common shares during the quarter. Disciplined capital management will remain a priority for us.","Moving on to slide 18, this quarter, we have provided you with our outlook and expectations for the fourth quarter on a combined company basis. Importantly, our 2016 full year outlook for standalone Key remains consistent with what we had provided earlier in the year. We expect average loans to benefit from a full quarter impact of First Niagara and continued core portfolio loan growth driven by strength in our commercial businesses.","Net interest income is also expected to benefit from one additional month of the impact of First Niagara, along with normal growth in NII. Further, as we noted earlier, we anticipate having an adjustment to purchase account accretion in the fourth quarter resulting in an increase to net interest income.","Non-interest income will also reflect one additional month benefit from the acquisition and we expect investment banking and debt placement fees for the full year of 2016 to be equal to or slightly higher than our full year 2015 results. In addition to a full quarter impact of non-interest expense from First Niagara, we're also anticipating elevated merger-related charges to continue in the fourth quarter. To-date, we've recognized about half of our expected $550 million in merger charges.","We continue to expect net charge-offs to be relatively stable with our third quarter reported results and below our targeted range of 40 basis points to 60 basis points. Provision is expected to slightly exceed our level of net charge-offs. As Beth said, we remain committed to meeting or exceeding the financial targets we have laid out for the acquisition. We continue to expect to exceed our $400 million of cost savings targets by the back of half of 2017, which would then be reflected in our full-year 2018 run rate. With the conversion complete, we expect to show meaningful progress toward our cost savings target as we realized savings from the consolidated branches, third party and technology cost, and redundancies across the franchise.","With that, I'll close and turn the call back over to the operator for the instructions on the Q&A portion of our call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore. Please go ahead.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Good morning.","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Good morning, John.","Beth Elaine Mooney - KeyCorp","Good morning.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Just wanted to see if you can elaborate a little bit on the timing of the cost saves. I know you indicated that you expect it to be fully realized by the year-end 2017, and Beth, I know you also alluded to where the bulk of the realization would be. Just trying to get an idea of the timings through the year. Is it fair to assume that over half of the cost saves could be in the run rate before mid-year because that does impact where we're coming out for full-year 2017 and 2018 projections? Thanks.","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","This is Don, and I would start off by saying that if you take a look at the run rate of expenses for First Niagara that's included in our third quarter results, it shows an average monthly run rate of about $70 million a month. That compares with the run rate before acquisition of over $80 million. And so, I would say that in the current run rate, we were already reflecting about a $100 million of that $400 million targeted level.","As we've said before that fourth quarter won't show a meaningful increase as far as the level of cost saves. We would expect to see many of those occur in the first half of next year with the realization of the systems conversions, the branch consolidations that many of which will occur here in the fourth quarter, and some of the other steps that will start to be realized in the first half of next year. And so, I would say by the end of the first half, we would be well past the 50% of attainment of that value from the cost savings.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Okay. All right, thanks. And then separately, I know you had indicated that in your prepared comments that the First Niagara deal is performing better than expected since the close of the transaction. Can you elaborate on what you're referring to in that? Is it mainly around the timing or the account attrition or cost saves? Could you just give us some more detail?","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","I'll take another crack at that as well. If you look at the growth of the experience from the time of the acquisition to the time of closing, it was in excess of what we would have expected. They showed growth in customers and households, they showed growth in deposit balances and loan balances and so they were able to continue to grow that franchise, despite the fact that this merger was going on. And then you combine that with the expense saves that we realized here in the third quarter that would have been earlier than what we would have expected as well. And so it feels like and it shows that they're exceeding on all fronts.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thanks, Don.","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, thanks for the color on the cost saves. Maybe just following up a little bit on John's question, Beth, you talked about your internal targets being higher than your external targets and you sound like you're getting increased confidence now that you've had a few more months to look at it. Can you give us a sense of what you think the incremental cost savings could be and will those be beyond the 2017 period or do you expect those to be phased in concurrently with the rest of the cost savings?","Beth Elaine Mooney - KeyCorp","Yes, Ryan. This is Beth, and then if appropriate, Don may have some more color. Yes, we do have confidence that, as we said, our internal targets have exceeded the $400 million in the path of (24:04) those. However, at this time, I would say since we're still early days of making sure we realized the $400 million that we outlined in the amount and the timing that we have suggested, we will defer until we get into 2017 and before we outline what those additional possibilities of the timing will be. But I will tell you that we do see a path for outperforming what would have been our initial projections of $400 million that we committed to a year ago.","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","I would agree, Beth. And we've talked about the realization of that $400 million coming primarily in the first half of next year and as we wrap up 2017 we would expect to see the full benefit of that run rate in our 2018 outlook.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Maybe I could just ask one other question. The 200 basis points ROTCE uplift, is that a fully phased in run rate in 2018? And how do we think about the base for that? Is that current tangible book value, is that pro forma for 2018? Can you just remind us what you were using for legacy Key as part of your expectations?","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Yeah. We were operating around a 10% return on tangible common equity before the transaction. I would say in the third quarter, adjusted for the merger related charges, our return on tangible common would have been about 11%. And if you would just add on top of that, the additional benefit from the expense savings, we would be in that 12% to 13%. So it would be equal to or exceeding that 200 basis point improvement we talked about.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks for taking my question.","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning.","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Steven, you changed your name there?","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, on every call it appears. Don, thanks for all the transparency related to the First Niagara impacts, really helpful this quarter. I just want to make sure I understand, did you say that there are a $100 million of cost saves now in the run rate this quarter?","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","What I've shown to calculate that was basically the run rate of expenses for First Niagara was a $70 million a month. So if you take the 140 divided by the two months that are reported and compare that with the $80 million a month they were running at before the acquisition. So that gives us about $100 million of cost savings realized on a run rate basis.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And Don, I know you're running parallel on the systems with First Niagara. What's the target date right now where you are expecting to turn off their systems and get the $160 million of cost saves from the vendor contracts?","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Many of those should be shut off after the end of this calendar year. There will be a few that still linger over into 2017, but the vast majority of the benefit there should be in early half of 2017 benefit for those contract terminations.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, got it. And could I ask you on the margin, obviously, a lot of moving pieces for this quarter. Can you help us think through the trajectory for NIM in the fourth quarter?","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Take a look at our NIM in the third quarter. For the month of September, we had a margin of right around 2.90% and I would use that as a baseline for the fourth quarter. But keep in mind, we talked about the fourth quarter will include some additional net interest income related to our purchase accounting accretion. And so, it should be a little stronger than that 2.90%.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. If I could squeeze one more in, Don. would you be able to (27:30) think about a tax rate going forward? Thanks.","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Sure. We've had some early comments about the low tax rate for the quarter and if you take a look at our reported earnings and back out the related merger charges and assume a 35% tax rate on those merger charges, the effective tax rate for the current quarter was 22.4% for core operations. On a year-to-date basis, that's 24.4%, and so we benefited in the third quarter from some higher credits associated with some equipment leasing activities. We also had a slight charge in the second quarter. And so we would expect those credits to continue and so we would expect our tax rate for the full year to be in that 24% to 25% range, so it would be very consistent with our year-to-date effective tax rate.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, perfect. Thanks for all of the color.","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Thank you.","Operator","Next, we have from the line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning. I echo Steve's sentiments on the clarity of the First Niagara impact. My question is as we look forward to 2017, how should we think about the $753 million legacy KeyCorp expense base. The year-over-year growth rate is about 4%. Is that the kind of growth rate we should think about for 2017 or should we really think about it in context of the 65% efficiency ratio legacy?","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","I would say first, Erika that the $753 million reflects the performance based compensation associated with a record high quarter for investment banking debt placement fees of $156 million. So we did have higher levels of expenses than what we would expect to be our normal run rate. And so we would expect the core to come down based on not being able to sustain that level of investment banking debt placement fees.","Core Key is currently operating on a 65% efficiency ratio. And so I think that is a good benchmark for legacy Key. But, again, as we start to realize the cost savings from the combined organization that we should see that efficiency ratio drop meaningfully.","Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And also, as we think about next year, how should we think about average balance sheet growth in context of some of the assets that may be rolling off from First Niagara that you don't think is as core to you today? And if I could just slip one more here in, in terms of your comments on purchase accounting, are you expecting just a refinement in that will have one more month of purchase accounting accretion or is that $686 million potentially going higher? Thanks.","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Yeah, a couple of things there, Erika. As far as the growth rate, we'll provide more guidance when we get in the January earnings call to provide guidance for 2017.","I would say right now, our pipelines remain strong and the core franchise is growing, and we saw growth across the Key footprint, as we said, 5% growth on a year-over-year basis. We're also seeing growth in the First Niagara so we'll continue to work through that. We're not seeing material portfolios where we would consider them to be in exit mode as far as a First Niagara franchise. So we don't think that will dilute the growth from that perspective. But, again, we'll provide more guidance there later.","As far as the purchase accounting adjustments that \u2013 you're right, the accretion for this quarter was $19 million. We would expect to see another month of accretion in the fourth quarter. And so, on top of that, we would also have some additional accretion impacting our earnings because we did not assume any prepayments in the third quarter and as those loans would prepay it would also accelerate recognition of some additional purchase accounting discounts. And so, we think the benefit from the purchase accounting will exceed just a core realization of the $19 million number that we experienced in the third quarter.","Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, just to be clear, the $686 million over a shorter duration then when I calculate to be about a six-year duration that you assumed for this quarter?","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Yeah, and essentially what we're required to do is assume that accretion would occur over the contractual life of the loans. And so we would assume a faster than contractual life type of assumption as far as the realization of those reflecting the impact of prepayments.","Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it, thank you.","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thanks. Good morning.","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I guess, first question is a little more of a broader question. You guys have frequently referred to potentially saving more than the $400 million. If you did achieve, and pick your number, say, another $100 million of expense savings, how much of that would actually fall to the bottom line?","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Well, Ken, I don't really want to set your sight for another $100 million. That would be a meaningful step up.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hypothetical number, of course.","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","That would assume that we would be reducing over half of the legacy First Niagara franchise expense base. But that being said, we do believe that the cost saves will drop to bottom line. Now offsetting that, we've also talked about revenue synergies and we're starting to see some activities that are reinforcing our confidence in achieving those. We've talked about $300 million run rate of revenue synergies and with that we would have incremental costs associated with achieving that. And so, it would realize about another $100 million or so of additional expense for that. And so, again, we do believe that those cost saves will drop to bottom line. They won't be offset by other add-ons, but that we will have some additional costs to achieve those revenue synergies.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right, perfect. And then just the other question I had, in terms of provision expense, can you just explain the $18 million of First Niagara and obviously the $12 million related to the credit card higher provision? I just want to make sure I understand that, I guess. I would have thought all of the loans were mark-to-market. What am I missing in terms of why there's now a provision expense on the First Niagara loans?","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Ken, what you're missing is you're trying to apply logic to accounting rules, and that doesn't always follow case (34:00). But, essentially, what's happened here is that, as we look at the non-PCI, non-purchased credit impaired portfolios, those loans that are recorded at a discount, you would be accreting that discount back into income over time, but you would always look at the remaining discount to see if it's adequate to cover the required reserve associated with those loans.","What's unique about those credit card portfolios is that we recorded that at a premium, and so the value of that portfolio was higher than par, and so we had no discount to compare to for the recognition of allowance associated with that credit card portfolio. So, effectively, on day one after the acquisition, we had to record the entire allowance, or $12 million, associated with that $300 million portfolio. And so that's what triggered that, and that's why we had a higher level of provision associated with the First Niagara transaction.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right, great. And then, really quick one, the preferred dividend on a go-forward basis?","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","The preferred dividends will increase next quarter that the First Niagara preferred declared their dividend in July, and so it didn't have an impact on the current quarter results. So, you'll see almost a doubling of the preferred dividends compared to what the current quarter was.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Doubling versus this quarter. Okay, all right, thank you.","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Eads with UBS. Please go ahead.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Good morning.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","Obviously there's been a lot of commentary about the outlook for C&I demand across the industry, and I'm just kind of curious what you guys are seeing, if you're seeing anything kind of unique related to the merger closing?","William L. Hartmann - KeyCorp","This is Bill Hartmann, David. One of the things that Don mentioned earlier was the continued momentum that was going on at First Niagara during the time between the announcement and the merger closing. And I think that that, from a growth standpoint, could be viewed as something that's a bit unique because in many cases, people would expect to see a business momentum drop-off. We have experienced continued growth across our portfolio as a result of the investments that we made in bankers over time, and we continue to see benefits from that investment, certainly in the current quarter.","Beth Elaine Mooney - KeyCorp","And, David, this is Beth. I would just add that this is an area where I believe Key has outperformed the industry. One of the statistics we quoted early was, 18 of the last 20 quarters, we have seen double digit C&I growth in our portfolio, and I think it's important to underline that it does reflect investments in senior bankers, so growth being driven by our client-facing personnel being increased, our bankers.","Second, we have also been investing in capabilities to differentiate Key, both on our KeyBanc Capital Markets platform but also in products such as payments and treasury. So, as I look at it, this has enabled us to compete differently and post a higher level of C&I growth than the industry has been seeing, yet maintain our risk profile and loss content. So I think this is that strategy coming through for core Key.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","All right. And obviously, you guys will give formal guidance at the end of the year, but it sounds like no real change to the near-term outlook there?","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","No changes to the near term outlook, that's correct.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. And then, on the IB business, obviously a great quarter there. Can you talk a little bit about the pipeline out of the quarter, and kind of the implied level for 4Q is potentially maybe down a little bit, but still at a pretty attractive level. Is that the narrative we should be thinking about?","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Our pipelines remain strong. And in order for us to hit our guidance, we have to have something in $120 million plus as far as the quarter for investment banking debt placement fees. So, down from the record level but still strong compared to a year ago, and reflective of what we see as new business coming on.","One other indicator there really is taking a look at our loans held for sale, and you can see a nice pop-up in the commercial mortgage loans held for sale ,to about $1 billion level. And so that's just one indicator, as far as the strength of the pipeline.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","Great, thanks for the color.","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Thank you.","Operator","Next we have from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, Beth. Hi, Don.","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Good morning.","Beth Elaine Mooney - KeyCorp","Good morning.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Don, can you share with us, talking about the accounting for the provision on the loans that came over, could you also talk about the non-performing assets or non-performing loans, I should say, that came over from First Niagara, because once again, normally those are mark-to-market? What caused those loans to come over as non-performing loans?","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Sure. And as far as the accounting treatment, we took a look at the $23 billion portfolio and divided it into two primary pieces. One is purchased credit impaired, which was just shy of $1 billion, and the other piece is the non-purchase credit impaired. For the purchased credit impaired $1 billion portfolio, they're primarily commercial loans, and those are loans where we don't think they are going to be able to live up to the commitments required in the loan agreements and they're included in that category, and they're marked net of reserves and net of interest rate mark. And so they don't bring over any allowance associated with that, and that interest rate mark will be accretive back into income over time. Because they are recognized as purchase credit impaired, they're excluded from the non-performing assets and non-performing loans.","Now, the rest of the $22 billion in loan portfolio, we did also record a mark on that portfolio, and it includes both credit and interest rate. We did not have any additional allowance related to that. But since it's not purchase credit impaired, we did carry over the status as far as the non-performing loans and non-performing assets. And so that's why we show $150 million coming over in NPLs from the First Niagara acquisition, because many of those loans included in that non-purchase credit impaired are reviewed on a portfolio basis, as opposed to an individual loan basis. And so, on a portfolio basis, we believe that the portfolio will be able to perform in line with expectations.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Would that imply they are mostly consumer loans then in the non-impaired, versus the other portfolio being the commercial loans?","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Well, there are commercial loans that are not PCI impaired, and so \u2013 also in the commercial portfolios, some business banking loans that are looked at on a portfolio basis as opposed to an individual loan basis. And so, it's a mixture of both, Gerard, but I would say that most of the consumer loans are in the non-purchase credit impaired category.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, good. Thank you. And then second question, obviously, you guys had a blockbuster investment banking quarter. Traditionally, or historically, if I recall, you typically sell most of the production that you produce in a quarter. Was that the case this quarter or did you retain more than normal? How did that work?","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","I would say our sales levels would be consistent with what we had experienced in the past. And I think we've talked about for the capital raise that we would retain somewhere in the realm of 20% level and I don't know that's changed dramatically for the current quarter.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. I appreciate it.","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Thank you.","Operator","And next, we go to the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR. Please go ahead.","Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hey, good afternoon or good morning, I should say. The 5 million shares issued under the employee comp plan, can you just remind me sort of what the triggers are around that issue that's related to share price or business line performance, sort of what drove that this quarter?","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","The bulk of those shares issued related to the First Niagara acquisition and so as we issued new unrestricted shares or others in connection with employee change of control contracts as we structured some of those agreements is how those shares were issued for the most part. And so they would have been granted as of or around the August 1st time line when the acquisition was finalized.","Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay, perfect, thanks. And then just last question on the card provision, which you explained. Is that entirely a one-time sort of catch-up, true up, or are there any lingering sort of impacts to be aware of in future periods?","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","As it relates to the card, that's a one-time impact. And so, going forward, we just have normal provision to cover charge-offs and loan growth in that portfolio. Keep in mind that down the road we will have to make sure that we're adding provision for new loan growth, and so we will have provision to cover that loan growth. And also, as the accretion of that discount occurs for the non-purchased credit card impaired, we will start to replenish the reserves associated with some of those portfolios over time as well.","Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Got it. Thank you.","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Thank you.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Good morning, guys.","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Hey, Scott.","Beth Elaine Mooney - KeyCorp","Good morning.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","I think most of my questions have been answered, but maybe just one on sort of the margin and rate sensitivity. I think, if I heard correctly, you're pretty much done with restructuring the FNFG securities portfolio. Just curious if you can give little color on how the combined company's rate sensitivity compares to what Key looked like standalone before the deal?","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Yeah. No, you're absolutely right that the restructuring of the First Niagara portfolio is done. It was done really quickly in the quarter and so we really experienced the impact in those two months from having the change in that mix of the investment portfolio. As far as the \u2013 and I'm sorry the second part of the question?","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Combined sensitivity?","Beth Elaine Mooney - KeyCorp","Combined...","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Combined sensitivity. I'm sorry. If you look at combined sensitivity, we're about 2% asset sensitive. And so as we redid the portfolio from First Niagara and combined that with our overall balance sheet, it kept it fairly consistent with where we were before so we didn't see a real change there. And so, we're pleased with our position overall. We'll continue to reassess that but right now we're about 2% asset sensitive.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","That's perfect. Thank you very much.","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a little housekeeping here. The buyback was about $65 million. That's a little bit less than 20% of what you mentioned in June you were planning to repurchase over the four-quarter capital planning cycle. How should we think about buybacks over the next three quarters? Would they be \u2013 should we consider that instead of a pro-rated level or is there any sense of doing it sooner rather than later?","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","One. We didn't start buying back any shares until after the merger was completed. So, whether there was some timing to that. But, more importantly, our employee stock issuance typically occurs, for the most part, in the first quarter of each calendar year. And so we would typically see acceleration as far as some of the share buybacks during that quarter. And so you would see a skewing or heavier weighting of the share buyback for that quarter but that's consistent with what we've done in the prior years as well.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And if I can ask \u2013 just a follow up on the capital markets. You didn't mention capital markets as a potential revenue synergy within the FNFG franchise. Can you give us a little more color as to where you think the opportunities in capital markets in the future, beyond the fourth quarter, may lie within the FNFG franchise?","Beth Elaine Mooney - KeyCorp","Matt, this is Beth. I would tell you that we do see opportunities within our Corporate Bank platforms, particularly in commercial mortgage banking as an area where we see real opportunity, particularly given the book of business in First Niagara that they have within real estate, both on their balance sheet as well as more broadly some of what those clients own. And we cited that there have already been a handful of early wins. Many of them are related to the capability that we have in commercial mortgage banking.","We also see obviously very, very good opportunities against some of our core payments, treasury management, FX and derivative products. And then, obviously within that client base, our advisory capabilities will probably also over time create opportunities. But near term and early wins, I think, will be in commercial mortgage banking.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you for the color.","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Thank you.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Bill Carcache from Nomura. Please go ahead.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, Beth and Don.","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Good morning.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Beth, actually, I remember you mentioning early on that at times you need to take some criticism upfront before ultimately being congratulated and kind of referenced to this transaction. And certainly it seems as though the execution is coming through. Along those lines, a number of your peers are engaged in programs aimed at driving returns higher, but you guys seem to have what looks to us like a more tangible opportunity before you to the extent that you continue to execute on First Niagara on the integration. It sounded from your earlier comments, Don, that your pro forma return on tangible would go from 11% this quarter, ex-merger related charges to 12% to 13% once you run rate the $400 million in anticipated cost savings. Did I get that right?","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","You are right, yes. That's correct.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. So then there's upside to the 12% to 13% number to the extent that there's further cost savings above the $400 million baseline that you mentioned and then, as well, if you layer in the revenue synergies?","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","That's correct. And we're always looking to continue to improve our returns on an organic basis and don't believe that this transaction just stops it. So that will be something we're continuing to be focused on.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","And so what could that return number look like, if you start to factor in some of the revenue synergies as well?","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","We'll provide some more guidance later as far as what our targets are for return on tangible common. But I would say going from a 10% to 12% to 13% range is a meaningful step up. And so we'll again provide more color on that later.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay.","Beth Elaine Mooney - KeyCorp","Bill, I would underscore that the core momentum that you're seeing in Key is what I think has been the rigor that we have given to our expenses to also create capacity to invest in banker's products capabilities that have created some of the revenue momentum that we're showing. And, again, importantly as we kind of look at it, 8 out of the last 11 quarters Key has generated positive operating leverage. So the investments show in our revenue but the discipline in our expenses to create those investments have been part of the momentum and performance that we're experiencing.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","That's very helpful. Thank you. And lastly, if I may, going forward, is it reasonable to expect that you'll adjust your CCAR ask such that CET1 stays in the 9.5% range?","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","We're very comfortable with our capital ratio being in that level and so we will consider that as we look forward to the future CCARs and also we take into consideration any changes in the guidance of the NPR is finalized and additional comments we've heard are put in the rule.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you.","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Thank you.","Operator","As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question in the interest of time. And your next question is from the line of Geoffrey Elliott, Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Hi. I better keep it to one. Last quarter, you talked about $30 million of incremental intangible amortization coming from the transaction and it looks like the step up in intangible amortization this time was a lot smaller than that. It was about $6 million. So realizing you only had two quarters and two months of FNFG in there, just wonder whether that steps up further in 4Q or whether the $30 million shakes out to \u2013 the number shakes out to be lower than the $30 million?","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Yeah, you're right. The current run rate in the third quarter was below that $30 million target. We are finalizing some of the purchase accounting adjustments and could see some adjustments to the core deposit intangible in the fourth quarter but still believe that it should be a slight opportunity from what we initially estimated.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Great, thank you.","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Thank you.","Operator","Next we go to the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi. Well, it sounds like your Columbus Day weekend conversion went well, but that was the fourth quarter. so, how is it that you got 1\/4 of your targeted expense savings in only two months? And if you could just give an update on how many branch closings you have versus the ultimate total and head count reductions versus the ultimate total?","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Sure. As far as that $100 million that I had cited that there was a number of expenses associated with some of the system development work that First Niagara was doing before the announcement. And we also had some executives, former executives of First Niagara leave and some staffing leave as well, post legal day 1. And so those were really the sources of much of that $100 million of cost savings. We would expect to continue to see some ramping up later this year. And as we said earlier, we would expect to realize majority of those cost saves in the first half of 2017 and be at a full run rate and finishing up throughout 2017.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","So, I mean, in terms of head count reduction already versus your target and branch reduction that you've achieved versus a target?","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","One, on the head count reduction, I would say that we haven't seen any meaningful head count reduction yet that has been helpful, but not a meaningful source of total savings. As far as the branches, we consolidated 70 branches of First Niagara over the conversion day weekend and we would expect to have 36 branches of Key consolidate here in the fourth quarter. And so, we should be there for our targeted branch consolidations, which would represent about 25%.","The other piece that occurred here in the third quarter is in the middle of September, we did close on the divestiture of the branches required for the acquisition and that reduced our branch count by about 18.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. So you just shut those 70 branches. They're gone? I mean, so they...","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","In the fourth quarter, they are no longer operational. That's correct. So they have shutdown and we'll be realizing the expense savings associated with those branch consolidations in the fourth quarter and then we'll have another 36 from legacy Key that will be consolidated later in the quarter as well.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","All right, thank you.","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, good morning. Don, just have a question on the balance sheet, you did the securities portfolio repositioning, as you mentioned, and you mentioned that the outlook for the book to stay relatively stable. Can you just help us understand the mix of earnings assets going forward, and would you expect to see earning assets move forward just in line with loan growth, or would you expect also to see portfolio builds as you move forward as well, on the security side?","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","The biggest driver will be the loan growth. I would say that investment portfolio should be relatively stable overall. We'll continue to make sure we're meeting our expectations and requirements for LCR, but you could see a remixing as well because we still had, in the third quarter, a very high level of short-term earning assets, mainly the Fed account, and we would expect that to come down over time.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then, as far as your reinvestments at this point, you mentioned the cash flows in the slide deck, and so can you give us an update now on a pro forma basis, where are you relative to LCR? And how much \u2013 like what your go-to investment rates are versus the 1.94% I guess is what we saw on the book for the quarter?","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Yeah. As far as the LCR, on a combined basis, we're north of 120% on the LCR and so we're in good position from that perspective.","On the go-to investment rates, the current quarter, we bought about $4 billion in securities, about $1 billion of that were in floaters, so agency floaters. And so it only had about a 94 basis point yield. The remaining securities that we were purchasing during the quarter had an average yield of somewhere in the 1.8% to 1.9% range, and we're seeing that come up a little bit as rates have moved up here late in the quarter.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Okay, thanks, Don.","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Thank you.","Operator","And next we go to the line of Terry McEvoy from Stephens. Please go ahead.","Terry J. McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.","Hi, thanks. Good morning.","Beth Elaine Mooney - KeyCorp","Good morning, Terry.","Terry J. McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.","Could you just talk about the rollout of the residential mortgage product that came over from First Niagara? Is that out in all of the markets now? I know it's a relatively small revenue number this quarter, but going forward, do you see that growing?","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Yeah. We are now all operating on the same origination platform, and so that is a positive event. I would say that that didn't occur with legacy Key until late in the third quarter, early fourth quarter, as far as the rollout. And so, you wouldn't have seen much lift from that, but that we would expect to start to see some of the benefits as we go into later 2016 and into 2017. And so, we've been pleased with the rollout on the First Niagara, mortgage loan officers converted over to our new origination platform as well, and feel that was a success. Beth, anything else?","Beth Elaine Mooney - KeyCorp","And, Terry, I would add that, as we now have \u2013 as we talked about some of the benefits of First Niagara, one was the acceleration of standing up a mortgage platform for Key from origination through servicing. And our plans in 2017 and forward do include us adding to our mortgage origination staff and more robustly offering mortgage across our entire Key footprint. So, that is one of the sources of the revenue synergy that we see in the transaction.","Terry J. McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.","Great, thank you both.","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Thank you.","Operator","Next we go to the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning.","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Hi, Matt.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just following up on the net interest margin percent, the 3 basis points expansion versus last quarter, ex the purchase accounting accretion, what drove that?","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Well, the purchase accounting accretion was clearly related to First Niagara. Also, First Niagara had a stronger margin than Key going into the transaction, and so that was also a benefit. I would say legacy Key was relatively stable linked quarter as far as the overall margin.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just separately, the tax rate expected for this year of 24% to 25%, is that a good range to use for 2017 as well?","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","It depends on the tax credits that we have available. I would say that a more appropriate range would probably be in the 25% to 27% range, as opposed to 24% to 25%.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And is there a related decline in expenses associated with the higher tax rate?","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","I would say the decline in expenses is, the merger-related charges will be lower, which will have an impact on the overall tax rate, and that's why you're seeing a step up there.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Okay, thank you.","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Thank you.","Operator","And next we'll go to the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Peter J. Winter - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Good morning.","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Hey, Peter.","Beth Elaine Mooney - KeyCorp","Hey, good morning.","Peter J. Winter - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Just on the revenue enhancements. Can you talk a little bit about maybe the timing that you see some of that coming through in 2017? And then, in addition to residential mortgage, what some of the big contributors will be?","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Sure. When we talk about the $300 million of incremental revenue synergies, we said that that would typically be in a three to five year type of time period. And so, we'll have to continue to monitor that, but that's our initial assumption going in.","In addition to the residential mortgage, one of the big areas for us is our cash management services, treasury management services for the commercial side. And as we take a look at the activity levels that we're seeing right now, we're seeing a nice increase as far as potential referrals and pipeline associated with that. I think we've got over 200 First Niagara customers that are at least talking to us about adding additional treasury management services, and so that would be another category that we also have potential growth and a number of other products and services, some of which came from First Niagara, and some of which are for legacy Key. Beth, anything else you'd want to add there?","Beth Elaine Mooney - KeyCorp","In the product capabilities, again, a robust offering for the commercial customers would also include what we put in our Corporate services income of FX and derivatives and a broad suite there. We also look at wealth management and private banking. And within that, we have investment management and other services that I think will be a good fit again for their consumer, as well as business customers within Key.","Peter J. Winter - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. And just quickly, anything you'd want to comment on 2017 with regards to some of that revenue enhancement that you see?","Donald R. Kimble - KeyCorp","Really, again, I think it falls back to \u2013 we think it's a three to five year time period. So you can think about that ramping up over that time period. So I would say that we'll provide a little bit more guidance as we get into the fourth quarter call in January, and provide more clarity as far as the timing and a level of recognition associated with those revenue synergies.","Peter J.

Loan growth continues to be driven by commercial and industrial loans with average balances of 5% from the year ago period and 3% from the first quarter. Our growth is broad based and focused on high quality credits. Our outlook remains positive as client sentiment remains constructive and our pipelines continue to be strong. ","We also benefited from growth on the consumer side, including our residential mortgage business, which generated $1 billion of loan originations in the second quarter, 60% of which we held on our balance sheet. This has doubled the volume from the prior quarter and last year and resulted in a 6% year-over-year increase in residential mortgage loans. Also adding to our consumer loan growth was Laurel Road, with over $400 million in loan originations in the second quarter. We remain very excited about our Laurel Road acquisition, which bolsters our digital capabilities and the production from Laurel Road has exceeded our initial expectations. In total, our direct consumer loans were up 33% year-over-year.","Average deposits from both commercial and consumer clients grew 5% from the year ago period. Our growth reflects the success of our business model and focus on relationship clients. Noninterest income this quarter adjusted for notable items reflected broad based momentum. In our first quarter call we guided to a linked quarter double digit increase in fees driven by stronger investment banking in debt placement and adjusting for notable items noninterest income was up $86 million or 16% compared with the first quarter. And we reached a record second quarter level of investment banking and debt placement fees, which were up $53 million or 48% from the prior quarter. ","Our pipelines remain strong and client engagement is high, which should position as well for the remainder of the year. We also saw linked quarter double digit increases in areas where we have been investing, including cards and payments and our residential mortgage business. Expenses were also a positive story this quarter, reflecting our success in achieving our cost saving targets and positioning the company to reach its targeted cash efficiency ratio of 54% to 56% in the second half of the year, and strong expense management will continue to be a priority. ","Moving to credit quality, we had another very strong quarter with stable credit metrics, and a net charge off ratio of 29 basis points well below our over the cycle range. We remain committed to disciplined underwriting and maintaining our moderate risk profile. The final item on the slide is capital where we have remained focused on maintaining our strong position while returning a large portion of our earnings to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And just last week, our board of directors approved a 9% increase in our common share dividends to $0.185 beginning in the third quarter of this year. ","Before I turn the call over to Don, let me comment on the disclosure that we made last week concerning fraudulent activity by one of our long standing business clients. Since this is part of an ongoing investigation, we're limited in what we can say, but we are pursuing all available sources to mitigate the potential loss that could be up to $90 million net of taxes. The potential loss will be recognized as a third quarter event. Importantly, I want to underscore that we believe this is an isolated occurrence. This was a fraud perpetrated by a single long standing business customer and we will provide appropriate updates in our public filings. ","Now, I will shift back to today's news and conclude my remarks by restating that it was a good quarter with broad based growth across our franchise. We added and grew relationships, driving growth in both our consumer and commercial businesses. We grew loans including 5% year-over-year growth in C&I and experienced growth in consumer loans from residential mortgage and Laurel Road. We grew fees with a record second quarter for investment banking and debt placement fees. ","We managed expenses, reaching our $200 million cost savings target, which keeps us on a path to reach our targeted cash efficiency ratio in the second half of this year. We maintain credit quality underpinned by our disciplined loan underwriting. And we continue to return capital to our shareholders, including a 9% increase in our common shared dividend approved last week by our board of directors. And finally, we remain committed to achieving our long-term targets and to continue delivering value for our shareholders. ","With that, I will close and turn the call over to Don. ","Don Kimble","Thanks, Beth. I'm now on Slide 5. As mentioned earlier, we reported second quarter net income from continuing operations of $0.40 per common share. Adjusting for notable items earnings per share was $0.44. Our adjusted results compared to $0.44 per share in the year ago period and $0.40 in the first quarter of 2019. ","Notable items for the quarter totaled $52 million, including 32 million of personnel largely severance, as well 17 million of real estate expenses, both related to our efficiency initiatives. Notable items also included 2 million of onetime charges related to the closing of our Laurel Road acquisition in April.","As Beth mentioned, we achieved our $200 million cost savings target, with the full amount expected to be in the run rate next quarter. Importantly, we also remain committed to reaching our 54% to 56% cash efficiency ratio target in the second half of this year. I will cover many of the remaining items on this slide in the rest of my presentation. ","So now I'm turning to Slide 6. Our business model continues to position us well to grow relationships and loan balances. Total average loans were $91 billion, up 2% from the second quarter of last year, driven by growth in commercial and industrial loans, which were up 5%. ","Linked quarter growth and average balances was also driven primarily by commercial and industrial loans up 3%. Our growth continues to be broad based across our footprint, as well as through our targeted industry verticals. C&I growth was partially offset by a decline in commercial real estate balances due to elevated pay downs. ","Importantly, this quarter, we saw strong growth on our consumer side as well. Laurel Road and investments in our residential mortgage business contributed to our growth this quarter, and we expect to continue to benefit from both moving forward. For Laurel Road, we originated over $400 million of loans this quarter. ","For the residential mortgage production, we originated over a $1 billion of loans in the second quarter, double the volume from a year ago and from last quarter. Of this production approximately 60% was retained on balance sheet. We expect to continue to grow loan balances consistent with the top end of our 2019 full year guidance as we support our relationship clients. ","The tone and sentiment with our clients remain positive and our pipelines are solid. That said we remain committed to our moderate risk profile; we will continue to walk away from business that does not meet our risk parameters. ","Continued on Slide 7, average deposits totaled $110 billion for the second quarter of 2019 up $5.6 billion or 5% compared to the year ago period and up 2% from the prior quarter. Growth from the prior year was driven by both consumer and commercial clients. On a linked quarter basis, the increase in deposit balances is also driven by both consumer and commercial clients, as well as elevated levels of short-term deposits from certain commercial customers. ","The cost of our total deposits was up to six basis points from the first quarter, reflecting the continued migration of our portfolio into higher yielding products. As expected, our deposit data increased from the first quarter bringing our cumulative data to 38%. We continue to have a strong stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting for 66% of our total deposit mix.","Turning to Slide 8, taxable equivalent net interest income was $989 million for the second quarter of 2019 and net interest margin was 3.06%. These results compared to a taxable equivalent net interest income of 987 million and a net interest margin 3.19% for the second quarter of 2018 and $985 million and 3.13% in the first quarter. ","The increase in net interest income from the second quarter of 2018 and was driven by earning asset growth and the benefit from higher interest rates, partially offsetting this with a lower net interest margin driven by higher interest bearing deposit costs, lower loan fees and $11 million decline in purchase accounting accretion. ","Net interest income increased $4 million or 0.4% from the prior quarter driven by higher earning asset balances and one additional day in the quarter. These benefits were partially offset by a decline in net interest margin given by higher interest bearing deposit cost, elevated levels of liquidity as well as the decline in purchase accounting accretion. ","Going forward, we expect our net interest margin to remain relatively stable and net interest income to grow consistent with the guidance we have provided. In the appendix of our slide deck you can find additional information on our asset liability positioning, with continue to actively reduce our exposure to declining rates executing approximately $3 billion in interest rate swaps and floors in the second quarter. ","This was a move that we began back in the third quarter of last year entering to a total swaps and fours of $15 billion during this time. Today our net interest income impact for 100 basis points parallel increase or decrease from current levels is less than 1%. ","Moving on to Slide 9, Key's noninterest income was $622 million from the second quarter 2019 compared to 660 million for the year ago quarter. The year ago, quarter included notable items with a net impact of $36 million, including a gain from a sale of Key insurance and benefits services and a least residual loss. Excluding these items total fee income was down $2 million year-over-year. ","The change from the year ago period reflects continued momentum in core fee based businesses resulting from ongoing investments including growth in our investment banking, debt placement fees, as well as positive trends in our mortgage business. Offsetting this growth was a year-over-year reduction in trust and investment services income related to the sale of Key insurance and benefits services and a $6 million impact from the revenue classification changes mid 2018 on deposit service charges. ","Compared to the prior quarter, noninterest income was up $86 million or 16%. This change was largely related to a rebound in investment banking debt placement fees, which increased $53 million to a record second quarter level. We continue to see momentum in other fee based businesses as well as including a $7 million increase in both cards and payments related income and trust and investment services income from the first quarter. ","Turning to Slide 10, expense management has remained an area focus for us. As we mentioned, at the end of the second quarter, we have implemented substantially all of our expense initiatives tied to our $200 million continuous improvement target, which we expect to be fully reflected in our run rate next quarter. ","Second quarter noninterest expense was just over $1 billion or 967 million excluding the $52 million of efficiency related expenses. This compares the $966 million in the second quarter of 2018 and 937 million in the prior quarter, both excluding notable items. The table on the bottom left side of the slide breaks out our detail of the notable items. ","Expenses are relatively flat compared to the year ago period, again excluding notable items. The year-over-year comparison reflects our Laurel Road acquisition in April 2019, as well as the successful implementation of the company's expense initiatives. ","Compared to the prior quarter noninterest expense increased $30 million excluding notable items, the increase reflects the impact of the Laurel Road acquisition as well as our higher variable costs related to increase in the capital markets activity. Marketing expenses were also seasonally higher in the second quarter while employee benefits costs were seasonally lower. ","Moving to Slide 11, our credit quality remains strong and we continue to be consistent and disciplined in our underwriting. Net charge offs were $65 million or 29 basis points of average total loans in the second quarter, which continues to be below our over the cycle range of 40 to 60 basis points. ","The provision for credit losses was $74 million for the quarter, reflecting ongoing loan growth. Nonperforming loans were 561 million this quarter and represent 61 basis points of period-end loans consistent with the prior quarter.","Turning to Slide 12, capital also remains a strength of our company, with an estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio at the end of the second quarter of 9.6%. As Beth mentioned earlier, we have remained true to our capital priorities, including returning a significant amount to our shareholders. In the second quarter, we declared a common dividend of $0.17 per share. We also continue to repurchase common shares with $180 million repurchase this quarter. ","We also announced our 2019 capital plan in April. This was for the third quarter of 2019 through the second quarter 2020. The plan includes a 9% increase in our common stock dividend to $0.185 per share in the third quarter, which was approved last week by our board of directors. We also plan to repurchase up to $1 billion in common shares over the four quarter period. ","Our strong capital position supports our organic growth along with our planned capital action. ","On Slide13, we provided our outlook for 2019. Our guidance excludes the impact of the fraud loss that was disclosed in Form 8-K filing on July 16. Excluding this singular occurrence our outlook has not changed from what we provided earlier this year. This reflects our performance through the first six months and expectations for the remainder of the year. We continue to expect another year of strong positive operating leverage with improved efficiency. ","Average loans should be in the range of $90 billion to $91 billion, once again driven by our commercial businesses, but also benefiting from growth and our consumer lines including Laurel Road and residential mortgage. With the contribution from mortgage origination and Laurel Road, we would expect to be toward the higher end of our guidance range. ","Average deposits should remain relatively stable as our continued to account growth will offset by declines in temporary deposit balances reaching the $108 billion to $109 billion range. Despite a more challenging interest rate environment and assuming one more 25 basis point rate cut, we still expect net interest income to be in the range of $4 billion to $4.1 billion.","As a result of the projected rate decrease and the shape of the yield curve, we would expect to be at the lower end of this range. The leverage for this quarter and noninterest income keeps us on a path to reach our full year range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. We expect growth in most of our fee based businesses including investment banking and debt placement fees. Our current outlook would place us toward the lower side of our guidance range. ","Although we may operate at the lower end of a revenue range, we also believe that we're likely to outperform on expenses. We have achieved our $200 million cost savings target and we continue to identify opportunities for further expense reductions. At this point, we have not changed our expense outlook of $3.85 billion to $3.95 billion, but based on the first half results, the completion of our expense initiatives and our focus on continuous improvement, we believe that we can come in at or slightly below the lower end of the range. ","And we also expect to reach our targeted cash efficiency ratio of 54% to 56% in the second half of the year. On credit quality, we see nothing on the horizon that changes our outlook with net charge offs and provision expense remaining below our over the cycle range of 40 to 60 basis points. Our loan loss provision should slightly exceed net charge offs to provide for loan growth. ","And our guidance for our GAAP tax rate remains in the range of 18% and 19% with some opportunity to come in at or slightly below our range. Overall, we expect 2019 to be another good year for Key, building on the momentum across our businesses with discipline expense management, a clear focus on risk and strong returns. ","On the bottom of the slide are our long-term targets, and remain confident in our ability to achieve these targets. Continue to move toward the top tier of our peer group. And over time, I believe our market valuation will reflect our progress and improved results. ","I'll now turn the call back over to the operator with instructions for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator? ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers from Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","Scott Siefers","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question.","Beth Mooney","Good Morning.","Scott Siefers","Don, I was hoping you could walk through and with a little finer points the thought on the margin. I think you said in your prepared remarks that the margin overall should hold stable, I know you had those little liquidity build in the 2Q and I think that tends to be a seasonal issue that comes out in the 3Q, so presumably that helps. But guess I'm just curious regarding the puts and takes as you see them and then when you made those comments are you talking the core margin or the reported. Maybe if you can sort of bisect that as well, please. ","Don Kimble","Sure, and Scott as your highlight, we did have some seasonal trends in the deposits, especially the cost, some of the pressure on liquidity. And so, in the second quarter, our margin came down by three basis points from liquidity not any impact on net interest income, but that did have an impact on the overall margin. We also saw a reduction that wasn't expected as far as our purchase accounting accretion. Last quarter \u2013 first quarter, we're at $22 million, second quarter, we came in at $17 million, we would expect that to be relatively stable with maybe a slight decline from here, but not having the kind of pressure that we saw this past quarter. Going forward, we would expect margin on a reported basis to be relatively stable. And so, to your point, we should see some of that liquidity come back in over time. And that could help offset some of the pressure associated with the most recent our expected and 25 basis point rate decline. And so, we think that positions us to have more stability in that margin prospectively. ","Scott Siefers","Okay, that's perfect. I appreciate that. And then just one sort of \u2013 to keep that question just on the accounting for the fraud. Just what is the reason that that becomes a 3Q event? Is that just because of the difficulty in estimating the potential loss now or were the books from an accounting standpoint closed at the time of disclosure, just curious about that dynamic? ","Don Kimble","On that point, the events that resulted in the fraud actually took place here in the third quarter. And that's why the timing of the loss is recognized in the third quarter as opposed to the second quarter. ","Scott Siefers","Yeah. Okay. So, I guess nothing more than that. All right, that's perfect. Thank you, guys, very much. I appreciate it. ","Don Kimble","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Ken Zerbe","Great, thanks. Good morning. ","Don Kimble","Good morning. ","Ken Zerbe","I guess first is I have a silly or simple question. You're building at one rate cut into your guidance, how does your NII guidance change if we actually get a cut both in July and in September? ","Don Kimble","If we would get an additional rate decrease of additional 25 basis points, we think near term that would have a negative impact of about two to three basis points. And essentially what causes that is, is that our deposit pricing lags a little bit as far as the current market and so we would see a little bit of a near term negative impact from that. ","Ken Zerbe","Got you and are you building in the July cut or September cut?","Don Kimble","We are building in the July cut.","Ken Zerbe","Got you, okay. Understood and then just as a follow up question, in terms of Laurel Road, obviously good growth from them this quarter. I guess, when you think about the longer term growth maybe the next year or two years, like what kind of pace of growth are you comfortable putting on to your balance sheet from Laurel Road? ","Don Kimble","Well, we're very pleased with the credit quality of the originations. We love the customer base that we're approaching with Laurel Road. And as far as just this product, I don't know that we're going to see tremendous growth from that, but we think there's a lot of additional opportunities for expanding the relationships with these customers, whether it's residential mortgage or savings products or other potential relationship building services that we can provide for that customer base. So, we do expect to see nice growth there, but maybe not at the same pace on the student loan consolidation product.","Ken Zerbe","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. ","Steven Alexopoulos","Hey, good morning, everybody. ","Don Kimble","Good morning, Steven.","Beth Mooney","Good morning. ","Steven Alexopoulos","It's like I'll start on the fee income. So year-to-date you reported 1.2 billion. And if we just look to get to the low end of the guided range, I think you need to do somewhere around 670 million per quarter. And I don't think you've ever done that a single quarter. Can you walk us through what gives you confidence to \u2013 I know you said to be the low end, low end of the range, but even to maintain the range? ","Don Kimble","Sure, that I think your math is right there, Steve. So, what I would offer up is that, first of all, we take a look at our investment banking, debt placement fees, and we compare what we reported in the second quarter of last year to the run rate for the second half of last year. It's an increase of $42 million. And we believe that our pipelines are strong and activity levels support, seeing that same type of continued growth from here. In addition to that $42 million increase we would see seasonal increases in a number of key categories, including COLI, which we believe adds about $20 million to the second half of the year compared to what we saw in the second quarter. And then we also have about $30 million of other growth. And I would say that growth is coming from areas we might not have seen as much in the past. But we talked about our mortgage production this quarter. And that's the first time we really see that come through. And we were originated over $1 billion in the second quarter, our application volumes, and our pipelines are even stronger going into the third quarter than they were the second quarter. And so, we think we're positioned there. We also think there's other categories where we're seeing a lot of growth. And so, if you would assume about $30 million for additional growth, the $20 million for seasonal increases and roughly the $40 million plus for the IBND revenues, we believe that we'll be at that 95 kind of million range that you're talking about to further needed to achieve that kind of growth for the second half. ","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay, that's helpful Don. And then the follow up in your response to Ken's question about the NIM going down two to three basis points, if you get that additional cut, is that about the math of what you would expect per 25 basis point cut two to three? ","Don Kimble","Well, initially, we would and so for example, on our average rates paid on deposits, the first quarter after that rate decrease, we think that deposit rates will go down by about five basis points in that second quarter. That cumulative reduction would be about 10 basis points. And so that's how that two to three basis points initial hit will go away over time. ","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay, thank you. Then just finally, for Beth, once we get into the 54% to 56% cash efficiency ratio, where do you go from there? Still stay in the range, do we improve further, how do you think about that? ","Beth Mooney","Obviously, with our fourth quarter call in January, we will update our thoughts for the coming year. And so, I think some piece of that will be predicated on the expectation for the macro environment. But I do know that you hear us talk with a degree of relative confidence about our targeted business strategies and our commitment to continuous improvement. And we have a diversified business model. So, we continue to see the ability to drive our performance in the future. But what that looks like is the southern substance of our fourth quarter call. ","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay, fair enough. Thanks for taking my questions. ","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore. Please go ahead. ","John Pancari","Good morning. ","Don Kimble","Good morning. ","Beth Mooney","Good morning. ","John Pancari","Related to Steve's question there on efficiency, I guess the other way I'd like to ask is just is \u2013 if you could talk about the leverage you would have on the expense side if the revenue outlook gets more challenging if we are looking at for example, another cut in addition to the one cut that you modeled. If we get another cut this year, could you talk about the impact on your efficiency ratio expectation and then what the levers are to dig deeper on expenses. Thanks. ","Don Kimble","Great and in our comments, we did allude to that we've already achieved the $200 million, but we still have other efforts and steps and identified and we're executing against for further continuous improvement. And so, we are very committed to delivering that 54% to 56% range. And so, we believe that that will help provide some support for that. So, it's critical that we continue to manage that we're always going to be focused on further continuous improvement efforts to manage that efficiency ratio down and generate positive operating leverage. I think one thing else that's unique for us compared to many of our peers too is the steps we did take as far as managing our overall asset liability position. And as we noted in our comments that we've added a $15 billion worth of swaps and floors to help protect against that downward rate pressure and that did cost us some margin over the last few quarters, but we think that it was prudent for us to be able to manage to that level, especially given the current outlook that we see for interest rates. ","John Pancari","Okay, got it. All right and then separately, I know you can't speak much about the fraud specifically. But as the investigation continues and even though it's an isolated thing, is there any risk that there is an increased focus around your risk controls and the expenses related to that as a result of this? Thanks. ","Don Kimble","Well, sure. And maybe I'll take up more of a comprehensive look at this issue, because I'm sure people have lots of questions about this. But as we did note in our Form 8-K that we are limited as what we can disclose given our current investigation and litigation that's in process. So just let me share a few things that we are able to say at this point. So earlier this month, we discovered fraudulent activity by a long standing business client. We believe that this was an isolated incident involving a single business relationship. We are pursuing all available sources of recovery and means of mitigating the potential loss, which could be as high as $90 million net of taxes. We're conducting a comprehensive assessment of all procedures and related controls and we've reported the incident to law enforcement. The potential loss will be recognized as a third quarter event. And importantly this is not a cyber event or a data breach and we do not believe this to impact our capital plans, which would include both dividends and share repurchases. We also do not believe that this will materially impact core expenses going forward and we remain on track to achieve our cash efficiency ratio target in the second half of this year. And due to the ongoing nature of the investigation and litigation we'll not be able to further comment at this point and we'll provide appropriate updates in public firing filings in the future.","John Pancari","Got it. Alright, thanks Don.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. ","Peter Winter","Good morning. ","Don Kimble","Good morning. ","Peter Winter","You guys had very good momentum on the loan side. And I'm just wondering if that continues, it does seem like you could come in above the high end of your range for average loan growth.","Don Kimble","Yeah, Peter, we were very pleased with our production, especially on the consumer side this quarter. Our commercial has always been a core strength for us and we're seeing that momentum maintained, but that we've been talking for the last couple of years about what we're doing from a residential mortgage perspective and this was the first quarter I can really say that we're starting to achieve that and that $1 billion of production and 60% of that going on balance sheet will clearly help our long growth from that side. Laurel Road over $400 million for this quarter as far as originations and that's also another strength for us. And so, if we just continue to grow loans, like we did in the second quarter, and I think that our ending balance in our pipelines would suggest that we'd be growing average loans each quarter by about $1 billion, which will put us slightly above that $91 billion top end of our guidance range. And so, I think that you're on track there as far as what we're seeing for potential dynamics in that that category. ","Peter Winter","Okay. And if I could just ask one, just housekeeping item, within the fee income, operating lease income and gains was a little bit elevated relative to the run rate, I think the last four quarters. Just wondering if there was anything unusual or this is a new run rate for you guys. ","Don Kimble","Yeah, we had a small gain in the quarter and interesting enough that we actually had some losses on residual value. The declines will actually go through provision expense in the current quarter and so the two of those, essentially net each other out, and that could be just a little high for the operating lease income.","Peter Winter","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. ","Matt O\u2019Connor","Good morning. ","Don Kimble","Good morning. ","Beth Mooney","Hi.","Matt O\u2019Connor","How much of the 200 million of savings was in the second quarter run rate? ","Don Kimble","What we've said is we were there at the end of the quarter, I would say that a number of the expense programs really had a launch date of around June 30. And so, we still have upwards of about $20 million in run right going into the third quarter for future savings. ","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay, and then I guess what else is driving the cost down as we think about, going from 2Q to 3Q that's 20. There are some other things like I know, seasonality tends to be kind of some puts and takes there. ","Don Kimble","The biggest variable Matt for expenses beyond that really is the capital markets related revenue. And then as we've shown before, there is a direct connection between the incentive associated with that and the revenues. But we also highlighted that we have other efforts in slide as far as continuous improvement. So even though we've achieved our 200, we're not done yet. ","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay, and then any additional repositioning or efficiency charges do you expect in the second half and beyond? ","Don Kimble","Our guidance would incorporate those charges. We don't think there was the material going forward.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. Alright, perfect. Thank you. ","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez from UBS. Please go ahead. ","Saul Martinez","Hey, good morning. Just I don't know if you mentioned this, maybe I missed it. But how much did Laurel Road contribute to your expense base and not the one off items, which is the overall level of expenses this quarter? ","Don Kimble","Yeah, this quarter, we had reported the Laurel Road expenses of $22 million. And as we noted, there is some in that notable items as far as the deal related expenses. ","Saul Martinez","Right, but in terms of the core expenses, it was \u2013 I think the one time item was to 2 million if I'm not mistaken. ","Don Kimble","That's correct. So, the core was a little less than 20, but in that range. ","Saul Martinez","Okay, any material revenue contribution yet from Laurel Road? ","Don Kimble","The revenue contribution really so far has been in that loan growth and so we originated over $400 million. So, it will be building over time. And so that's \u2013 really didn't have a dramatic impact of the second quarter, but that will be building that annuity stream over time. ","Saul Martinez","Got it and in that 400 million, I think you mentioned that you retained 60%, if I'm not mistaken of that plus some residential mortgages, but how much of the 400 million did you retain? ","Don Kimble","We've retained 100% of the Laurel Road originations. That 60% was for the residential real estate originations we had. Now, what we do have in the second quarter though is we have transferred about $250 million of the Laurel Road production into a held for sale and then we're in the process of working through a securitization transaction on those assets, just to make sure that we stay current on the markets and see potential equity avenues for us going forward. ","Saul Martinez","Right, but your intention going forward is to retain the vast majority of that. ","Don Kimble","That's correct. ","Saul Martinez","And what are the terms on those? Can you just give us a sense of what kind of yield \u2013 just to get a sense of what kind of interest income pick up we could expect if you maintain something close to this level of origination? ","Don Kimble","Yeah, as we ended up the second quarter, we were talking about yields of around 5% that the long end of the curve has moved down by about 50 basis points. So, we're probably in the 450 to 460 range as far as current yields and so it's more that spread. Average life on those loans tend to be around for years and again very strong FICO scores and very low loss content based on the consumers that we're working with.","Saul Martinez","Got it that's helpful. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby from Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. ","Marty Mosby","Thanks. ","Don Kimble","Good morning. ","Beth Mooney","Good morning, ","Marty Mosby","Hey, good morning. I want to drill into this NII because if you look at your margin, the core margin actually peaked out around 310 if we exclude PAA. It started at around 285. And now we're down to almost 3%. So how much \u2013 because you mentioned earlier the cost of the hedges that actually limit your downside, how much of the cost is related to what's going on from the 310 to the 3% to lock in as close to 3% as you can as you move forward. So, in this particular quarter is there close to 10 basis points of costs related to these hedges? ","Don Kimble","No, a couple things on there, Marty. One is that the loan fees are down significantly. In this quarter we're expecting to see a slight recovery there and we actually saw loan fees come down. And so, compared to that peak period, our loan fees are costing us about three basis points on the margin. If you look at the net cost from our swaps in the second quarter, it was around eight or nine basis points that's down from 11 basis points in the first quarter, but there clearly has been a cost there and that's about five or six basis points of additional costs compared to that peak period that you would have talked about as well. And so those both have had a negative impact on margin and we're continuing to hopefully see the benefits from positioning for more of a neutral asset position prospectively. But there was a cost for us to initially establish that. On the loan fee front, what we're seeing there is that just refinance activity has been much slower. And especially in some of the syndicated loan products, we're seeing that across the board as far as being down year-over-year and we would expect to see that start to pick up again once we see the refinancing start to pick up again on that category. ","Marty Mosby","So, what I wanted to emphasize, folks are seeing some of this compression in margin this quarter. A significant amount of that is also just related to putting on insurance that then limits the downside. So, if we're looking at the 3% and then the lower, the cycle last time was 285. That restructuring gives you how much confidence in a sense of where do you land in the worst case scenario, we get back to zero interest rates, like we did before, somewhere between three and 285. But are we to the upper end of that range or lower end of that range once it's all said and done? ","Don Kimble","I wish I could predict that accurately. I think one of the things that we've continued to be surprised is that as we position our asset liability in a way that we think is neutral, but the yield curve can take plenty changes and movement. If you look at the longer end of the curve, we're probably done 75 to 80 basis points over last 90 days, whereas the short end of the curve is now just coming down 25 basis points we expect later this month. But we think that we are better positioned than our peers, and we've been very deliberate in that approach and looking to make sure that we can maintain as much stability in that margin prospectively as we can. ","Marty Mosby","And then just lastly, what's the timing of the share repurchase activities that even over the next four quarters or any front loading to get more into this year? ","Don Kimble","I would say that there's a couple of quarters where that might be a little outside, but I would generally assume fairly consistent throughout the time period that there are some quarters where we have employee issuance for different compensation programs were, we're able to buy back more, but generally pretty consistent throughout the four quarters.","Marty Mosby","Thanks. ","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Please go ahead. ","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Don, couple just for yield follow ups, can you talk about this quarter, you mentioned in the deck that you had 50 basis points still positive roll over on the securities portfolio? Where do you see that heading given the right environment going forward? ","Don Kimble","Yeah, you're right in the first quarter, we had 105 basis points, so this last quarter it was 50 and it went \u2013 we're probably closer to the 20 to 30 basis point range today. So, we still have a fairly low yield on our investment portfolio. So there still is pick up there. But it's a less than today's markets than what we would have seen last quarter. ","Ken Usdin","Okay. And then what are the yields that you're putting on Laurel Road loans at? And how does that compare to the average yield of the loan book? ","Don Kimble","Yeah, when we started this \u2013 the end of the first quarter, we were seeing a yield of about 5% I would say. Today we're down closer to the 450 to 460 range, because the yield curve has moved down by that much. And so really, it's focused on that kind of spread. And so, compared to that category, I think it's fairly neutral. But compared to the overall loan yields, I think it should be out of the two going forward. ","Ken Usdin","Okay. And lastly, one of the things I think you mentioned last quarter was that part of \u2013 you had lower burden from the terminated swaps in the first half of the year, how much of a helper does that continue to be incrementally from here? ","Don Kimble","It was about $7 million of hit in the second quarter. It's about 5 million in the third quarter and about 2 million in the fourth quarter. So, there is some slight hiccup on an incremental basis each quarter. ","Ken Usdin","Okay, got it. And one last one, just on the deposit costs. You mentioned the pace of which the deposit costs should roll over. Is that mostly due to the index part? And if so, then what do you see happening with the non-index part, just the customer behavior? ","Don Kimble","As far as the rate coming down, the index parts move very quickly with the overall rate changes. And so, it's more of the administered rates that take some time to phase in. And so that's why we only see about five basis points of benefit in our deposit rates in the first quarter. And then would expect that to be up to 10 basis points in the second quarter. And so, it really is more managing through those administered grades.","Ken Usdin","Thanks a lot Don. ","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran [ph] from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst ","Hi, good morning.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Unidentified Analyst ","Maybe one just housekeeping, the fraud, do we put it through the expense or charge offline? And can I just confirm that it's excluded from the full year guide? ","Don Kimble","Yeah, it is excluded from the full year guidance. And we do believe that we going through as an expense as a fraud loss as opposed to through charge offs. ","Unidentified Analyst ","Okay. And then on the core expenses or the full year guide on expenses when you were talking about being at the low end or maybe even below the range. Is that linked with the revenue outlook or independent? Or maybe said another way is, is there a scenario in your mind where you hit the low end of the revenue guide, but beat on expenses or would it more be like you'd only beat on expenses if the revenue came up a little short? ","Don Kimble","I would say that our expenses being at or slightly below was consistent with our revenue outlook. What would cause that expenses number to be higher is if the revenues coming stronger and the corresponding expenses associated with that would come through. And if for \u2013 going forward, if we would miss our revenue guidance, I think there's even further opportunity on the expense side to come down. ","Unidentified Analyst ","Got it and then very quickly, and I apologize if I missed this, the hedges are obviously proven to be a big differentiator. So well done, we have put them in. Did you say what the term or the duration and how long they'll last is? ","Don Kimble","Yeah, on average, they're a little over two years, as far as the interest rate swaps, the floors would have an average life of about two and a half years. And we've entered into some longer data swaps here recently and going into the full year for some of the new ones, we've been putting in place to more match with some of the more recent balance sheet improvements that we've had, and making sure that we keep that consistent. So, it's something that we watch very closely and we try to be fairly conservative as far as how we manage that overall position.","Unidentified Analyst ","Great, thank you. ","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy ","Good morning, Beth. Good morning Don. ","Beth Mooney","Good Morning.","Don Kimble","Good morning. ","Gerard Cassidy ","Can you guys share with us what your customers are saying from the standpoint that the forward curve is expecting three 600 cuts this year? And it seems rather dramatic, considering our macroeconomic environment doesn't appear to be that week. Is there a disconnect you think between the forward curve and what your customers, commercial customers in particular are seeing on the ground? ","Chris Gorman","Gerard, it's Chris, I would say to some degree there is. There's kind of what we're hearing from our clients. The tone and sentiment with our clients continue to remain positive. We're having a lot of strategic discussions with them. I would say it's been about flat, kind of quarter-over-quarter, if I could give you a read of the sentiment, some of the areas of concerned continue to be labor very hard to staff up their operations, both knowledge workers and also non-skilled workers and also there's a real just bid to hire employees away. I'd say the trade tension certainly doesn't help because it's uncertainty. But on balance, it doesn't feel out talking to our clients, which we're doing very regularly. It doesn't feel the same as you would think it would feel as you look at the forward curve. ","Gerard Cassidy ","Very good and then your credit, obviously is quite strong this quarter. But some of your smaller regional peers have had so called one off credit announcements and they seem to be concentrated in their private equity area leverage loans and also some restaurant credits. Can you guys give any color on your leverage loan portfolio? I know it's been stable for a number of years. It's not as a percentage of total loans a giant number, but curious to see what your \u2013 if you're seeing any trends in there that show some weakening or no, it's fairly stable? ","Chris Gorman","Gerard, its Chris, that's obviously a portfolio that we look at very, very closely at this point in the cycle. There is nothing in our portfolio that we believe is a sign of deterioration in that portfolio. It's a $2 billion portfolio, which by the way is what it was before we even acquired First Niagara. So, we have been very, very consistent at staying at that $2 billion level. It has a lot of velocity as you can well imagine and these are middle market companies that are in our areas of focus. So, we feel good about the portfolio, but it is a portfolio we watch very closely. ","Gerard Cassidy ","Very good and then just finally maybe for Don, you mentioned about \u2013 if I heard it correctly selling off some of the Laurel Road mortgage loans I assume. I assume you keeping the servicing so that you could cross sell into their customer base and speaking of that cross selling, when do you folks think you can actually start to gain some traction, where you're able to get other business from these customers? ","Don Kimble","Yeah, Gerard, we're actually securitizing off some of the consolidation student loans. And this is something that Laurel Road had done before and we just want to make sure we kept those avenues open and so we're doing a small securitization transaction. And to your point as far as additional products, Laurel Road has already launched a mortgage product. We're continuing to refine some those capabilities they've offered and hopefully be in a position to offer that to our existing retail customers as well. And so, we'll start to see some traction there. And we're continuing to work on plans to further increase the types of products and services we can offer to that customer base. So, we're real excited about the digital capabilities that they bring and I think it has a bright future for us.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. ","I'd now like to turn the conference over to the Chairman and CEO, Beth Mooney. Please go ahead.","Beth Mooney","Thank you, Operator. Good morning, and welcome to KeyCorp's Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. In the room with me is Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer; Chris Gorman, President of Banking; and Bill Hartmann, our Chief Risk Officer. ","As announced in December, Bill will be retiring, and Mark Midkiff will be joining Key next week as our new Chief Risk Officer, so we want to thank Bill for his years of service to Key and all that he has done for our company. ","Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call. ","I'm now moving to Slide 3. Before I discuss the details of the quarter, I want to make a few observations. First, 2017 was a strong year for Key with continued momentum in our core businesses and the successful integration of our First Niagara acquisition, and I believe our business fundamentals and competitive positioning are more favorable than any point in my tenure with the company.","Whether it's the quality of our people at all levels of the organization, the depth and breadth of our client relationships from our retail business up through our large corporate franchise, the quality of our customer offering, including product capabilities, expertise, and our commitment to financial wellness, the strength of our balance sheet and our overall risk profile, our strategic focus across every business unit and our reputation within our communities from Maine to Alaska, the fact is we have never been better as a company. ","Based on this positioning, as well as our positive outlook for general economic conditions that we expect to benefit our consumer and commercial clients, we are pleased this morning to announce increased long-term performance targets for Key.","Specifically, we are revising our cash efficiency ratio target to 54% to 56% and increasing our return on tangible common equity target to a range of 15% to 18%. These reflect our confidence in Key's competitive positioning and our ability to continue to deliver positive operating leverage and stronger returns. ","With that, let me move to our fourth quarter results, which at the outset, I would acknowledge are somewhat noisy. Some of the moving pieces were environmental and industry-wide, including the impact of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, while others were related to our business model or recent actions we have taken, but importantly, it was a solid finish to a strong year for Key with positive underlying trends. ","We reported fourth quarter earnings of $0.17 per common share or $0.36 after adjusting for notable items, including merger-related charges and the impact from the new tax law, along with other related actions. Details on the notable items can be found in our earnings materials, and our remarks today will focus on our adjusted numbers, which are comparable to prior periods.","Don will discuss the impact of the new tax law on our results. We view this as a very positive change that should benefit both Key and its clients by strengthening the competitive position of U.S. businesses, increasing take home pay for American workers and promoting stronger economic growth. ","This was our eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year positive operating leverage and our return on average common tangible common equity was over 13% for the quarter. Revenue grew 3.5% from the prior quarter, driven by continued growth in our fee-based businesses. The primary driver of the growth in noninterest income was investment banking and debt placement fees, which reached new record levels for both the quarter and the year. ","In 2017, investment banking and debt placement fees were over $600 million with organic growth of almost 20%. Other fee-based businesses also contributed to our growth this quarter, including cards and payments which increased 12% from the prior year.","Expenses this quarter were elevated and included merger-related charges and tax-related items. The quarter also reflects higher expenses related to acquisitions completed in 2017, as well as higher incentives that are tied to our strong capital markets production.","On our balance sheet, we continue to grow stable, low-cost deposits. Average loans declined this quarter, which was not consistent with our expectation, driven primarily by our commercial real estate business, where we saw higher debt placements which contributed to our record Investment banking fees as well as elevated loan paydowns.","In the fourth quarter alone, our commercial real estate team placed $4 billion of commercial mortgage loans in the capital markets. C&I loans grew late in the quarter, which is reflected in our period-end balances, but did not benefit the quarterly averages.","Overall, I am pleased with how our business model with our broad product offering continues to meet the financing needs of our clients through both on- and off- balance sheet alternatives. Key is distinctive among regional banks in the breadth of solutions we can provide to our clients, and, in this environment, the capital markets have been very attractive. ","Capital markets execution enables Key to meet our client\u2019s needs, drive fee income, manage portfolio risk and generate attractive returns on capital. Importantly, we continue to see strong business activity and pipelines and our teams remained focused on finding the best solutions for our clients.","Turning to our full year results, we made a meaningful step forward in 2017. Most noteworthy was the achievement of a number of significant milestones that we committed to for both Key and our First Niagara acquisition. In 2017, we reached $400 million in annual run-rate cost savings from the merger, with another $50 million expected to be realized early this year. ","Our cash efficiency ratio for the year was 60.2%, an improvement of 410 basis points compared to the prior year. We generated revenue synergies which continue to provide significant upside over the next several years, and we increased our return on tangible common equity to 13.1% for the year, an improvement of over 280 basis points versus last year. This drove the fifth consecutive year of positive operating leverage and a meaningful step change in our performance.","One of the standouts for the year was the double-digit growth in noninterest income, driven by record results in our capital markets businesses as well as our 23% increase in cards and payments income. Additionally, we made a number of strategic investments during the year, including the fourth-quarter acquisition of Cain Brothers.","The addition of Cain, along with HelloWallet, merchant services and the build-out of our residential mortgage platform makes us a stronger franchise and will provide significant growth opportunities in the years ahead.","Credit quality remained an area of focus for us in 2017, which resulted in strong credit metrics in the current year and, equally important, should position us well as we move through the next cycle. We\u2019ve also remained disciplined in managing our strong capital position, including returning a significant portion to our shareholders.","Over the past five years, we have repurchased over $2.2 billion in common shares and our compounded annual growth rate for the dividend has been 14%. And in the fourth quarter, we increased our common share dividend for the second time in 2017 to $0.105 per common share.","I am now turning to Slide 4. I will close my remarks where I began with our new long-term financial targets. These include a cash efficiency ratio in the mid 50% range and a return on average to tangible common equity of 15% to 18%. Achievement of these targets will be another meaningful step forward on our journey to becoming one of the top performing banks. 2017 was a significant and pivotal year for Key.","We made a meaningful step change in performance and delivered on our First Niagara commitment. We grew our businesses and made investments to strengthen our franchise and product offering which positions us well for the future.","We also continue to have significant upside across our company including the opportunity to create incremental value from our First Niagara acquisition. In early 2018, we expect to deliver the remaining cost savings of $50 million bringing the total cost takeout to $450 million and we plan to reach our target of $300 million in run rate revenue synergies by the end of 2019.","As we look ahead, we are encouraged by the improving business climate. I expect 2018 to be another good year for our customers and our community, and with our talented and dedicated team, I believe that Key is well-positioned to continue to grow and deliver returns to our shareholders.","I will now turn the call over to Don to provide some additional color on the quarter. Don?","Don Kimble","Thanks, Beth. I\u2019m on Slide 6. We reported fourth quarter net income from continuing operations of $0.17 per common share. Adjusting for notable items including merger-related charges and the one-time impact of tax reform and related items, adjusted earnings per common share was $0.36. Our adjusted results compare to $0.31 per share in the year-ago period and $0.35 in the third quarter.","The most significant item in the fourth quarter was the impact from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December which resulted in Key taking a number of actions including the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as certain tax-advantaged assets. The revaluation resulted in additional tax expense of $147 million recognized in the fourth quarter.","Noninterest expense increased by $29 million in the quarter related to the impairment of certain tax-advantaged assets and additional contributions to the employee retirement accounts. Importantly, the tax reform provisions will result in a lower federal income tax rate for Key going forward. As part of our outlook for 2018, we expect the effective tax rate between 18% and 19%.","I will cover many of the remaining items on this slide in the rest of my presentation so I\u2019m now turning to Slide 7. Total average loans of $86 billion were up 646 million compared to a year-ago quarter and down $808 million from the third quarter. The decline reflects higher loan paydowns and clients taking advantage of attractive capital markets alternatives.","Importantly, Key\u2019s business model positions us to be able to offer our clients a wide range of alternatives both on and off balance sheet and capture the capital markets fee income that is generated. The decline in average balances this quarter was primarily driven by our commercial real estate business which saw $870 million higher debt placements and loan paydowns compared to the average of the first three-quarters of this year. This is an area that we continue to leverage our business model to drive fee income, manage portfolio risk and generate higher returns.","This year we had a record level of $11.5 billion of commercial mortgage loans placed in the market including $4 billion in the fourth quarter. In addition, average commercial loans declined slightly during the quarter due to lower line utilization. This decline in utilization reduced our commercial balances by $540 million during the quarter. On a period-end basis, commercial industrial loans increased $712 million much of the growth occurring late in December. Year-over-year loan growth was driven by commercial and industrial loans which were up 4.5%.","Continuing on to Slide 8. Average deposits totaled $104 billion for the fourth quarter 2017, a decrease of $893 million or 0.9% compared to the year-ago period and up $693 million or 0.7% on annualized compared to the third quarter. The cost of our total deposits was up three basis points from the third quarter driven by a change in the overall deposit mix.","Our cumulative beta continues to remain below historical levels as we are maintaining pricing discipline in all our markets. On a link quarter basis, the change in deposit balances was primarily driven by growth in noninterest-bearing deposits from seasonal inflows and growth in CDs offset by declines in NOW, money-market accounts and savings deposits. We continue to have a strong core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting for 60% of our deposit mix.","Turning to Slide 9. Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $952 million for the fourth quarter 2017 and the net interest margin was 3.09%. These results compared to a taxable-equivalent net interest income of 948 million and a net interest margin of 3.12% in the fourth quarter 2016 and $962 million and 3.15% in the third quarter.","Purchase accounting accretion contributed $38 million or 12 basis points to our fourth quarter results. This compares with $48 million or 16 basis points in the third quarter. From the fourth quarter level, we expect purchase accounting accretion to decline by approximately 10% per quarter in 2018.","Excluding purchase accounting accretion, net interest income was up $58 million from the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was largely driven by higher interest rates and well-managed deposit betas. This would imply asset sensitivity in excess of 5% over the past year.","Assuming deposit betas in the 25% to 50% range and some continued benefit from swaps and securities cash flows, we believe our asset sensitivity will remain in the range of 3% to 5% over a 200 basis point increase in the short term interest rates.","This is higher than our previous asset sensitivity range, reflecting lower deposit betas for an extended period of time. We have included a new slide in our appendix with additional detail on our interest rate risk management. On this slide, we point out that each 25 basis point increase in rates translates to approximately $12 million in higher net interest income per quarter.","Excluding purchase accounting accretion, net interest income was stable compared to the prior quarter, as the benefit from higher rates and relatively low betas was offset by lower loan balances and increased liquidity reflected in the $1.5 billion increase in short term earning assets during the quarter.","We expect our core net interest margin, excluding purchase accounting accretion, to move modestly higher in 2018 compared to the full year 2017 which assumes continued growth in our balance sheet and one rate increase in the middle of the year.","Moving to Slide 10, Key\u2019s noninterest income was $656 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $618 million for the year-ago quarter. Growth was largely driven by another record quarter of investment banking debt placement fees which were $200 million, up $43 million from the year-ago period.","We benefited from strong growth across all capital markets areas, but the largest drivers of this quarter was a commercial mortgage banking, reflecting the $4 billion in placements, along with our acquisition of Cain Brothers.","Momentum continued in many fee-based businesses as Cards and Payments income and Trust and Investment Services income each grew $8 million from the year-ago period from higher credit card and merchant fees and the strengthening equity markets. These increases were partially offset by a decline in other income which reflected an impairment of $7 million related to tax-advantaged assets. This charge was offset by lower income tax expense.","Compared to the third quarter of 2017, noninterest income increased by $64 million. The increase is largely driven by broad based growth in investment banking and debt placement fees which grew $59 million from prior quarter. Operating lease income and other leasing gains increased $9 million related to the lease residual losses in the prior quarter, and slightly offsetting these increases were a decline in other income.","Turning to Slide 11, Key\u2019s noninterest expense was $1.098 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017 and reflected a number of notable items including merger-related charges and the impact of tax reform and related actions.","Merger-related charges included $26 million of personnel expense and $30 million of nonpersonnel expense mostly reflected in net occupancy, marketing and other expense. The impact of tax reform and other related actions had an impact of $29 million on expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 including the impairment of certain tax-advantaged assets as well as a one-time additional contribution to employee retirement accounts.","Excluding the notable items, noninterest expense was unchanged from the prior-year ago period at $1.013 billion. Expenses related to our acquisitions including Cain Brothers totaled $45 million for the quarter. We also had higher operating lease expense and other temporary costs that were elevated. Offsetting these increases was the realization of First Niagara cost savings.","Excluding notable items, noninterest expense increased $57 million from the third quarter of 2017. The increases in personnel expense was largely the result of the acquisition of Cain Brothers early in the fourth quarter which added $36 million of total noninterest expense as well as increased incentive compensation related to a strong capital markets performance.","The increase in nonpersonnel expense was primarily related to higher other expense as well as increase in net occupancy and operating lease expense. The increase in operating lease expense was primarily related to net charge-offs of certain accounts.","Turning to Slide 12, our credit quality remains strong. Net charge-offs were $52 million or 24 basis points on average total loans in the fourth quarter, which continues to be below our targeted range. The provision for credit losses was $49 million for the quarter.","Nonperforming loans were down $14 million or 3% from the prior quarter and represented 58 basis points of period-end loans. At December 31, 2017, our total reserve for loan losses represented 1.01% of period-end loans and 174% coverage of our nonperforming loans.","Turning to Slide 13, capital also remains a strength of our company, with common equity Tier 1 ratio at the end of the fourth quarter of 10.08%. The impact of the tax reform reduced our common equity Tier 1 ratio by 14 basis points in the quarter and there will be no change in our previously announced capital actions.","Consistent with our 2017 capital plan, we declared a dividend of $0.105 per common share in the fourth quarter which was an 11% increase. This was our second common share dividend increase in 2017. We also completed common share repurchases of $199 million during the fourth quarter.","Slide 14 is our outlook for 2018 along with the long-term goals that Beth had covered earlier in her remarks. We expect average loan balances to increase to the $88.5 billion to $89.5 billion range with the pace of loan growth increasing during the year. Deposits are expected to grow slightly less than loans.","Net interest income is expected to be in the range of $3.9 billion to $4.0 billion with our outlook assuming one additional rate increase in the middle of the year. In our appendix we\u2019ve provided a new slide that can be used to adjust for different interest rate and balance sheet assumptions. For a reference, again, each 25 basis point increase in rates translates to an approximately $12 million higher net interest income per quarter.","I would like to point out that our first quarter results will also reflect a lower day count, and we expect to see normal seasonality in areas such as loan fees and corporate owned life insurance. We anticipated noninterest income will be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion as we continue to drive growth from our core business and deliver First Niagara revenue synergies with substantial progress on these synergies made in 2018.","We would expect first quarter results to be below our fourth quarter run rate due to the normal seasonality and a return to more normal levels of investment banking and debt placement fees from a record performance in the fourth quarter.","Noninterest expense is expected to be in the range of $3.85 billion to $3.95 billion. There should be no First Niagara merger-related charges going forward. We expect to see normal seasonal trends and expenses which should result in a decline in the first quarter from the fourth quarter current levels. ","We also expect to realize the remaining $50 million in First Niagara cost saves in early 2018 with a majority in the first quarter, and we will continue to identify additional efficiencies to generate positive operating leverage and continue to make progress on our efficiency ratio targets.","Net charge offs are expected to remain below our targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points. Our loan loss provision should slightly exceed our level of net charge offs provided for loan growth, and we\u2019ve adjusted our GAAP tax rate down to 18% to 19%.","I will close with a message consistent to that that I talked about earlier. It was a good year for Key with a step change in performance that moved us to a level consistent with our previous long-term targets. Importantly, we have revised our guidance to reflect our improved results and stronger outlook. With our improvement in our efficiency ratio of over 400 points, we have moved our new target to a range of 54% to 56%.","And with our return on tangible common equity improving by 280 basis points to over 13%, we set a new target of 15% to 18%. Coming off a strong year, we believe we are very well positioned as we head into what is shaping up to be a much more positive operating environment.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of our call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First, we have the line of Scott Siefers of Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners. Your line is open.","Scott Siefers","Let\u2019s see. Don or Beth, I was just hoping you could provide a little more color on the loan growth outlook for next year. Appreciate the commentary about the year ending strong, particularly in C&I, but I guess as I\u2019m looking at things there\u2019s been a couple quarters of sluggish growth and just to get to the $88.5 billion to $89.5 billion range would require a pretty substantial ramp in growth throughout 2018. So just curious in your view what would generate that kind of acceleration to give you comfort that that\u2019s the appropriate range?","Don Kimble","Sure, Scott. I\u2019ll start with that and then ask Beth or Chris to jump in with the additional color. But I think you hit some of the key points. One is that we are starting off from a point from C&I where the end-of-period balances were stronger. And what\u2019s important to note there was that those were core business relationships that wasn\u2019t being influenced by bridge loans or other things that might be more temporary in nature, and so we\u2019re feeling positive about that. ","Our pipelines are strong going into the year. And the other thing to keep in mind too is that throughout 2017, we had a very good year as far as originations and what really changed was a trend in the market, which translated to much stronger capital market fees for us by our company\u2019s accessing the capital markets and higher pay downs.","And so, we would expect those to continue, but probably not at the same pace and, as we\u2019ve said in our notes, that we expect loan growth to build throughout the year.","Scott Siefers","Okay. That\u2019s perfect. Thank you very much. And then, if I could jump to the deposit side for just a second. I\u2019m just curious if you can provide a little color on sort of the nuance in there. You\u2019ve been holding the line really well on pricing for most of the individual categories, but CDs have been your biggest grower and the area that. as you would imagine, have seen the highest rate increases. So just curious what the overall philosophy is. I guess my first inclination was you might have been trying to moderate your rate sensitivity a bit, but based on your comments, Don, it does not sound like that\u2019s the case. So just curious your thoughts there.","Don Kimble","We\u2019re seeing stronger customer preference for time deposits now that rates have come up a little bit. And you\u2019re right, what we\u2019re seeing is the impact of the new rates coming through with growth in that product and it\u2019s translating to an increase in that overall rate on deposits paid for time deposits.","Even with that, though, our cumulative beta is only 21% since the first rates started to come through, and I would say that mix shift into that time deposit category is really the only category where we\u2019re seeing increased deposit costs for us and we would expect that trend to continue.","Scott Siefers","Okay. Perfect. Thank you, guys, very much. ","Operator","Next we have the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Erika Najarian","Hi. Good morning. My first question is on some of the long-term targets that you\u2019ve reset today. So as we think about the cash efficiency ratio target of 54 to 56 and compare that with 2017, where you range from 59 to 61, could you walk us through how you would get there in terms of what you would need to see environmentally versus key, specific goals that you could execute upon to get to that range and noting that you mentioned that we\u2019re entering the year with a very positive view in the operating environment.","Don Kimble","Great. And a couple things there. One, Erica, is that we expect to get there without much benefit from rate increases, that our longer-term forecast does not show the rate increases that we might be seeing from some other economic forecasts and so that\u2019s not a big contributor to this. It really is continuing to operate on our business model and continuing to generate positive operating leverage. It does require us to achieve the remaining $50 million in expense saves from First Niagara.","It does require us to achieve the $300 million in revenue synergies, and we\u2019re only assuming basically a third of that goes through in the form of additional cost, and it does continue to assume that on a core basis we can generate revenue growth at a faster rate than expense growth. And that will help drive our efficiency ratio down, and we believe that we can achieve that over the next two to three-year time period.","Erika Najarian","And to follow up on the ROTC target, what kind of CET1 is embedded in the 15% to 18% target? And also, Beth, if you don\u2019t mind chiming in, as we think about a different \u201csheriff\u201d in charge at the Fed, how are you thinking about what the near-term outlook would be for capital return both on an overall payout basis? And when would be an appropriate time to get closer to the longer-term targets on dividend payout?","Beth Mooney","Thank you, Erika. I will give you some observations and then turn it over to Don to talk a little bit more about the underlying assumptions on our movement in the return on tangible common equity target. And I would tell you that it is early days for the new heads of both the OCC and the Federal Reserve, but I do think you\u2019ve heard a tone that has been consistent over the last year of a move towards a more quantitative view of capital return as they extend the CCAR results. ","So while we have not yet received implicit guidance or otherwise about what I would call concrete expectations for the 2018 CCAR examination period, it is clearly our belief, and as we have discussed in other forums, our goal is to start moving our dividend payout to more of a 40% to 50% return to our shareholders.","We believe that is consistent with what is a good level of payout of stronger earnings for regional banks and also aligns with the interest and rewarding our shareholders and investors. So I would tell you that as we look at next year, these CCAR results are going to be obviously not subject to a qualitative review \u2013 they will be based on quantitative results \u2013 and that we will be looking to our return of capital to our shareholders with that lens.","Don Kimble","Just to follow up onto that, you had asked, Erika, as far as the longer-term assumption for the CET1, and we\u2019ve talked about guiding that down over time to the 9% to 9.5% range. And that would be incorporated into achieving the kind of return thresholds here. And the other benefit is the impact of taking that effective tax rate down to that 18% to 19% level, and that will add over a point to our return on tangible common. And we closed the fourth quarter at a 13.5% level so I think we\u2019re on a good path to get there.","Erika Najarian","Thank you.","Operator","Next up we have the line of Steven Alexopoulos of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Steven Alexopoulos","Hey. Good morning, everybody.","Don Kimble","Morning.","Beth Mooney","Morning.","Steven Alexopoulos","I wanted to start looking at the new tax rate, the 18% to 19% in 2018. The new guidance implies most of that falls to the bottom line in 2018, but Beth, how are you thinking about using the lower tax rate over time?","Beth Mooney","Thanks, Steve. I would tell you that clearly it is our expectation that the Tax Reform and Jobs Acts of 2017 will be positive for the business environment, our clients, and our industry specifically as well, and I believe over time it will also be something where we\u2019ll be able to reward our shareholders with the increased earnings power in the industry and within Key.","As we look at investing for growth, I think our company has been very consistent over recent years of talking about and demonstrating that we are willing to invest for future growth in both people, products, and capabilities both through our internal investments as well as things that we did in 2017 such as HelloWallet, our Merchant Services business, our residential mortgage platform and then culminating in the fourth quarter with Cain Brothers.","We talk about it in that it needs to be driven by positive operating leverage, and over the years we\u2019ve always said it needs to be bounded by a view of the economic environment as well. So as we look forward, there is indeed no change in our 2018 plans per the level of investment, and I think we\u2019ll invest as opportunities are appropriate that are consistent with our business model and also are consistent with our stated goal of continuing to drive positive operating leverage.","Steven Alexopoulos","Just to follow up on that, as you look at things like the employee benefits you currently offer, tech spend, I\u2019m trying to get a sense how much long term will fall to the bottom line. And will this impact, when we think about 2019 expenses, the level of yearly expenditure from Key?","Beth Mooney","As you saw in our press release, we did do a one-time contribution to our employee retirement accounts. We\u2019re very proud to do that, and it will be beneficial to some 80% of our employees. But as in all things, we consistently benchmark both pay, benefits, and on the technology front are consistently trying to organize our priorities to make sure that it is promoting growth as well as balancing cyber security and our core systems. So again, as I look at it I don\u2019t feel constrained, and I\u2019ll let Don talk about how he thinks it flows through the next couple of years.","Don Kimble","No. I would agree, Beth, and I think the message here is we\u2019re continuing to operate our model. And that model does result in us investing in a number of things both from the technology platform and also our people. And those types of investments are embedded in our guidance, and we\u2019ll make sure that we can continue to achieve cost savings to help fund some of those future investments as well.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. Don, can I ask you one unrelated question? On the investment bank line, how much did Cain Brothers contribute to revenue? You gave the expense number, but what was the revenue number? And how should we think about a new base run rate including Cain? Thank you.","Don Kimble","Sure. The total Cain revenues for the quarter were about equal to the expenses that we talked about as far $36 million. As far as that Investment Banking debt placement fee line item, it was $30 million. Now that was a very strong quarter for Cain. It was a very strong quarter for Key and so we\u2019re very pleased with those results. Cain typically would probably be something in the $15 million to $20 million per quarter as far as total revenues and so you would have to adjust for that.","And then as far as Investment Banking debt placement fees, our objective would be on the core legacy Key footprint. We would be able to grow Investment Banking debt placement fees and with the addition of Cain Brothers, it would be additive on top of that with the additional growth.","Beth Mooney","And in the fourth quarter, it was our first full quarter of Cain being part of Key so the expense run rate or the expenses that we announced for the fourth quarter would not be consistent with the run rate of Cain. It also included some onetime and other expenses related to bringing them on board.","Don Kimble","That\u2019s an important point, Beth, because we did not segregate those merger-related costs into our merger category. Those came through our business as usual for the impact of Cain.","Steven Alexopoulos","And how much were those?","Don Kimble","I would say that they were a portion of $36 million, probably in the 20% range ballpark.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. Thanks for taking all my questions.","Beth Mooney","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Next we have the line of John Pancari of Evercore. Please go ahead.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","John Pancari","On the back to the margin, I know you\u2019d indicated for the trajectory in 2018 to see a modestly higher margin through the year. I just want to see if you can kind of give us a little bit of color in terms of how that could play out in terms of the amount of expansion we could see. Is it fair to assume that we could see a couple basis points per quarter of expansion as you see the benefit of rate hikes continue to exceed the lagging betas? Thanks.","Don Kimble","As far as our comments, we talked about the net interest income excluding purchase accounting accretion showing modest improvement. And so as we would think about it and some of the conversations we had earlier, for each additional rate increase it adds about $12 million of net interest income and then so that\u2019s roughly three to four basis points.","And so our current guidance would have one in the middle of the year that we also have the full year benefit of the December rate increase that hasn\u2019t been reflected in the current numbers. And so between those two items, you would see a pickup in margin throughout the year related to that activity.","In addition, we are expecting some margin pick up just because of the impact of our investment portfolio and swap book maturing and rolling over and current rates for those would be additive to our net interest income as well.","John Pancari","And, Don, what is the monthly cash flows coming off the bond book?","Don Kimble","The quarterly is about a billion four for the bond and then on the swap book it\u2019s about a billion three a quarter.","John Pancari","Okay. Great. And then in terms of your loan growth commentary, just want to get a little bit of your color around your updated thoughts for growth in certain areas, more specifically the C&I. If you could just talk about where you\u2019re seeing some pick up there and then your appetite to grow commercial real estate. And then lastly, if you have any comment around resi mortgage because I know you\u2019d been commenting on the buildout of that capability. Thanks.","Christ Gorman","Sure. This is Chris speaking. With respect to C&I, we sort of, as we look at the pipelines which are stronger on a relative basis and stronger on an absolute basis than they were at this time last year, it\u2019s really across-the-board in C&I so we see strong pipelines there. With respect to real estate, to go back to something that Don mentioned earlier, as we look at 2017, you know the originations and the amount of new clients that we brought on and the amount of financings we did for existing clients were every bit as strong in 2017 as they\u2019ve ever been.","What was differentiated about 2017 versus some of the other years is in so many cases, we went to the markets whether it\u2019s FHA, whether it\u2019s Fannie, Freddie, the CMBS market, the Life companies, et cetera, we have very good pipelines in real estate and we have a very good client base. We\u2019ll continue to serve those clients in whatever is in their best interest and so we have good backlogs there.","One area where you aren\u2019t going to see us really ramp up our exposure is in construction and that\u2019s been by design and as you know, at one point, we had a higher level of construction. Right now we\u2019re running at about 12% construction but real estate very important business for us and what we\u2019re doing for our clients continues to expand.","You brought up residential mortgage which is going to be a really interesting area for us going forward. That\u2019s a business, just to remind people, we weren\u2019t really in. We had outsourced that business. We have a run rate of about $2 billion currently in annual originations. We think over the next, say two or three years, we can increase that by as much as an additional $5 billion. And if you think about kind of our franchise and our 3 million customers, if we just do one additional $250,000 mortgage in each of our branches a month that doubles that business.","It\u2019s also, by the way, very important to financial wellness as we think about how we\u2019re differentiating ourselves in the marketplace because buying a home is obviously not only very important to our clients, but if you think about it from our perspective, with all of the data and the analytics capabilities that we have, it\u2019s just a treasure drove of information. So that\u2019s kind of how we\u2019re looking at each of those three areas you had asked about.","John Pancari","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next we have the line of Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ken Zerbe","Great. Thanks. Is there any way you guys can quantify sort of the net present value of earnings from a client choosing to do a capital markets deal with you guys for like debt placement versus that same client doing a similar amount of taking out a loan with Key? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of like how much better or worse is a loan versus the fee line. Thanks.","Christ Gorman","This is Chris again. You\u2019d have to look at that completely through the cycle because it\u2019s sort of a trade-off, right? And if you think about it, you get a fee upfront which generates, obviously, a high ROE, a high returns, but it\u2019s one time and you don\u2019t have the benefit of the annuity.","Conversely, with a loan you get the benefit of an earning asset, but you also get the benefit of tail risk. It\u2019s a very interesting question that we look at a lot, but until you go through the cycle, it\u2019s hard to really say with certainty.","Don Kimble","Yes, Ken, I would just add that the important thing here is serving the customer and keeping that relationship. And as you look at the full breadth of that relationship, the area that has the lowest return on equity for us is the loan. And so as long as we can continue to support that customer and develop that relationship and expand the relationship, the loan is less critical as far as driving the total return.","Beth Mooney","And I would just add that, because it was implicit in my comments, Ken, that as I talked about the business model, Don hit on it when he said serving the client. I think some piece of the trade-off is if a client opts to a capital markets execution, and we saw particularly favorable market activity in pricing and spreads last year, the alternative is they may seek the market through another intermediary than Key.","And to me, that is where you would then not even capture the revenue with the relationship. And as we\u2019ve mentioned in the fourth quarter with our commercial real estate, it had significant flows into the capital markets, we led 90% of those transactions. So to me it\u2019s about capturing client need and retaining the revenue within Key.","Christ Gorman","Right. And our rule number one is we do what\u2019s in the client\u2019s best interest every time.","Ken Zerbe","Got it. Okay. And then just on the NIM, the $1.5 billion of shorter duration, presumably low yielding securities you guys added, how does that play into your concept or your expectation for modestly higher NIM in 2018? I mean, essentially it seems like you\u2019re assuming no change in those higher, shorter duration balances. Is that right?","Don Kimble","Well, essentially those short-term assets were in cash balances with the Fed, and so it\u2019s short term in nature and that did penalized our margin. We would expect that over time that that would wind down to more normal levels as the loan growth picks up.","Ken Zerbe","Got it. Okay. So you got at least three basis points of higher NIM in 2018 just from that piece going away, so maybe \u2013 I\u2019m going to say the rest of the business is even a smaller-core NIM expansion?","Don Kimble","That\u2019s correct.","Ken Zerbe","Okay. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next we have the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey. Good morning. This is [Rob] from Matt\u2019s team. On fee income outside of investment banking fees, I was just curious if you could talk to your expectations for growth for some of your major line items for the year?","Don Kimble","But if you look at our guidance range for next year compared to the reported 2017 ex-notable items, it\u2019s north of 5%. And so as we mentioned, investment banking debt placement fees will be a strong area of growth for us. Cards and payments revenues will continue to be a strong area of growth for us.","Trust and Investment Services, we expect to continue to see some positive momentum there as well, and so I would say that those are the primary areas of growth and other categories will do fine, but those are the primary areas of investments in the last couple of years for us.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then just separately on your cash efficiency target of 54 to 56. Getting down to that level I guess conceptually, how much of that improvement will come from revenue growth versus additional expense improvement? And then, any sense of timing to get there?","Don Kimble","Our model really is based on generating positive operating leverage, and so we expect it to be able to continue to drive revenues at a faster pace than expenses. What we\u2019ve talked about historically in the slower growth environments where the GDP is between the 2% and the 3% range, that we would be able to grow the revenues at that kind of a general pace and keep expenses relatively stable.","And so that helps drive the efficiency ratio down. And as far as our timeline, the long-term targets are really on a two-to-three-year type of time horizon as far as our ability to operate inside those ranges on a consistent basis.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","And next we have the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Thank you. Good morning. Hey, Don, I just want to make one clarification: 3.9 to 4.0 on NII, is that on an FTE or non-FTE basis?","Don Kimble","It\u2019s on an FTE basis.","Ken Usdin","FTE basis. And then can you talk about how much the FTE will change, given the change in taxes from the 56ish that you had this year?","Don Kimble","I don\u2019t have the number off the top of my head, but it\u2019s a fairly small amount to begin with, but it will come down because of the tax rate. You\u2019re right.","Ken Usdin","Okay. So then when I think about your point about the PAA roll off of about 10% per quarter off of the 38, the core NII growth embedded is still quite strong. And I think you\u2019ve been very clear about where the loans are, about the core NIM moving the right way and so I just wanted to really come around on how you expect the overall balance sheet to traject. Should it follow loan growth this year? Or you\u2019re still expecting loans to grow faster than deposits? But are you expecting to grow the securities portfolio? Or is the benefit from the securities portfolio more from the swaps roll off and the benefit there? Sorry, that\u2019s a jumbled question, but I\u2019m really just trying to understand the final part of average earning asset growth helping the core NII.","Don Kimble","Our outlook would assume that the loan growth would provide the majority of the earning asset growth of the investment portfolio. It would be relatively stable, and the benefit that we mentioned there is really just the roll-off of the current cash flows being re-priced at today\u2019s market rate, so which would be a lift for us.","Ken Usdin","Right. So the core NIM benefit is both rates and the swap benefit and then we\u2019ll see what mix may bring?","Don Kimble","That\u2019s correct.","Ken Usdin","Okay. Thanks a lot, Don.","Operator","Next we have the line of Peter Winter of Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","Peter Winter","Good morning. Of the expenses, if I annualize the fourth quarter expense and look at it relative to the guidance, it would assume that expenses are flat to down relative to 4Q being annualized. So is that assuming that the first quarter there\u2019s going to be a big drop off in expense?","Don Kimble","We would expect to see normal seasonal trends, which would show that the expenses would be down in the first quarter. And, as we highlighted, a good reason for why expenses were up this quarter is because of the success of the capital markets revenues, and we would not expect to see that same $200 million in the first quarter of next year.","We also tend to see some seasonal increases in the fourth quarter, which go back to more normal levels in the first quarter. And so our outlook would assume a decline in the first quarter.","Peter Winter","Could you give a range, by chance?","Don Kimble","We haven\u2019t provided specific quarterly guidance. I would tend to look at how the trajectory occurred throughout this year and see some of the seasonal trends continue at that kind of pace.","Peter Winter","Okay. And then just a follow up on a different note. We\u2019ve heard a couple of banks talk so far about with these borrowers having such high levels of excess liquidity that paydowns or going to the tech capital markets could continue into the beginning of the New Year. But you guys are seeing nice growth end-of-period, but do you worry about that, especially when I look at the loan guidance that you gave?","Beth Mooney","Peter, this is Beth. I will give some commentary on what we\u2019re hearing from clients and then what I think is generally the industry\u2019s view, and Don may have some additional comments or Chris. I think a number, if you listen across the industry and as we\u2019ve all talked about it, everyone believes that the tax reform and what has transpired is constructive for the business environment. I don\u2019t think anyone thinks it\u2019s like a light switch that will alter behavior one way or another as we go into the year.","I think these will be trends that develop, and implicit in that is a belief that there could be more investment in expansion than we have seen over the last several years because as we look at GDP as well as client commentary, that has been somewhat muted for the strength in where we are in this particular economic cycle.","So I think it will layer in over time, and I think the expectation is that we saw strong pipelines, we had good growth as we said in our period-end loans, and that we did see I think a theme of 2017 across the industry was elevated pay downs and more capital market activity than we had seen in prior years. But I think as those roll through in 2018, there\u2019s still a belief that there will be demand for on balance sheet bank loans throughout the year.","Peter Winter","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next the line of Kevin Reevey with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.","Kevin Reevey","Good morning.","Don Kimble","Morning.","Beth Mooney","Morning.","Kevin Reevey","So, Beth or Chris, I was wondering if you could give us kind of what the line utilization number was at the end of the fourth quarter versus where it was at the end of the prior quarter? And I know it\u2019s early in the first quarter here \u2013 if you\u2019re seeing any trends upward in that number?","Don Kimble","This is Don. I\u2019ll take that. As far as the total line utilization for all credit, we were midrange, 50% range, and it was down about 1.5% compared to where it was the previous quarter, and similar trends within the C&I book where we saw most of the decline.","Beth Mooney","And that indeed as we pointed out in our comments was about $500 million in average balances for the quarter, so that 1.5% decline in utilization was meaningful to the balances.","Don Kimble","And I would say that as far as the 2018 impact so far, I think it\u2019s too early to draw any conclusions from that. The numbers I provided were end-of-period 2017.","Christ Gorman","If utilization had been relatively flat over the last couple of years, so it was a tip down, if you can think about sort of business activity in general, some of the increases in the cost of commodities, I would anticipate that utilization would reverse back to where it\u2019s been over the last couple of years.","Kevin Reevey","And then a couple comments we\u2019ve heard from banks that have reported thus far, they\u2019re seeing some irrational price competition. Are you guys seeing any of that at all in any of your markets?","Christ Gorman","This is Chris. We\u2019re really not seeing a change in pricing over the last three months or six months. It\u2019s been actually pretty steady, frankly both on the loan and the deposit side. Go ahead, please.","Kevin Reevey","I was going to say and then my last question is related to any industry clients that you expect to benefit more than others from the recent cut in the corporate tax rate?","Christ Gorman","Well, I think it\u2019s pretty broad, but if you think about it, a big part of our client base are small mid-sized businesses, a lot of pass-through entities. On a relative basis, they were pretty full taxpayers, so they clearly are going to be significant beneficiaries. And the other thing that's interesting about our business model whether it\u2019s Key at work or it\u2019s our private bank, those shareholders of those companies and their employees are also clients of ours as well and they too will benefit.","Kevin Reevey","Excellent. Thank you.","Christ Gorman","Thank you.","Operator","Next we have the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.","Saul Martinez","Hi. Good morning.","Beth Mooney","Morning.","Saul Martinez","I just wanted to drill down on the impact of Cain Brothers again and just make sure I have the numbers straight. Don, did you mention that on a more normalized level, Cain Brothers contributes something in the way of $15 million to $20 million to IB fees per quarter? I suppose that\u2019s the run rate that\u2019s sort of embedded in your guidance?","Don Kimble","Total revenues from Cain would be in that range. That\u2019s correct.","Saul Martinez","And what about expenses? Obviously this quarter you had the merger cost, and I presume abnormally high because of good activity. But how should we think about sort of the more normalized expense contribution?","Don Kimble","I would, as I suggested that the onetime merger-related costs were in the 20% ballpark range and so you\u2019d probably use that 80% as a general rule of thumb initially and that wouldn\u2019t reflect the merger savings or increased business resulting from the combination of the two companies.","Saul Martinez","Does Cain contribute to the bottom line or is it sort of breakeven?","Don Kimble","This current quarter it was a breakeven. Prospectively, it will be a contributor to our bottom line.","Saul Martinez","Okay. Fair enough. And I guess just I guess a broader question, how much in the way of the revenue synergies are embedded in the 2018 numbers so far?","Don Kimble","What we talked about is that we would be at that full $300 million run rate by the end of 2019 and think about that as a kind of a steady progression up to that level so kind of a straight-line move. So we would assume that by the end of the year, we would be close to that 150 kind of run rate.","Saul Martinez","Okay. All right. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Next we have the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Hi, Beth. Hi, Don.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","Gerard Cassidy","I apologize if you\u2019ve addressed these questions. I\u2019ve been jumping on a few calls, but I assume you guys talked about the betas for deposits. Can you give us any color on the breakout between the different types of deposits of where the betas are for consumer deposits versus high net worth versus commercial? And then what you guys think will happen to each one of those betas as we move forward and a Fed funds rate environment that probably will increase two or three times this year?","Don Kimble","As we look at the betas right now on the retail side, the only beta we\u2019re seeing is the impact of mix shift as far as the preference going over to time deposits for our retail customers so we\u2019re really not seeing much in the way of contractual rate changes or any new pricing on the retail deposits.","On the high net worth, they tend to be a little bit more rate sensitive and so we\u2019re seeing a little bit more activity there, probably not at the same pace or level that we see on the commercial deposits, but we have seen more demand for higher rates in that category.","And then on the commercial side, our betas have been a little bit north of 40% and in large part contractually driven but we are continuing to see more customers and more of the competitors offering up higher rates for commercial deposits.","And as we would start to see those betas move up, we don\u2019t see that occurring near-term, but we would expect over the long-term to start to see all of those products migrate to the mid-50s kind of beta and start to see that translate to additional rate competition, but our guidance assumed and our asset sensitivity assumes that for the next couple of rate increases it\u2019s going to remain relatively low compared to what our longer-term targets are.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And the second you guys obviously indicated that the average commercial real estate loans were down primarily because of customers going into the debt capital markets and refinancing their outstanding with you. What percentage of those customers actually have been refinanced in the debt capital markets by KeyCorp Securities and the investment banking side of the house?","Beth Mooney","Gerard, this is Beth. We - I said it a couple answers ago but 90% of the movement from our clients into the market, Key was roughly\u2026","Gerard Cassidy","Great.","Beth Mooney","And we had $4 billion of placements into the commercial mortgage bank from our commercial mortgage banking group in the fourth quarter alone.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And this is kind of I know it was unusually strong year quarter in investment banking, 200 million, which you\u2019ve addressed. Do you ever get to the point, again this is an odd question, where it could get too large and the volatility then increases? Have you guys given any thought to that of where would you want it to kind of top out?","Don Kimble","I don\u2019t know we have any caps per se. I think again, what we\u2019re trying to do is continue to focus on our customer relationships and meet their financial needs, and I would say that this is just a period where we\u2019re seeing increases and their desires to access the capital markets and we\u2019re glad that we have the products and capabilities to support that.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Next we have the line of Bill Carcache of Nomura. Please go ahead.","Bill Carcache","Thanks. Good morning. I had a follow up on your financial targets. Based on the trajectory that you\u2019re on and your other comments during the call this morning, is it reasonable to expect that you can reach your ROTC target of 15% to 18%, at least the lower end of that range by 2019 timeframe? ","Don Kimble","I would say that we're probably going to be in that operating range faster than we would be on the efficiency ratio and we haven't given specific timelines, but I think that generally in the late 2018, 2019 time period would probably be a relative good assumption as far as our ROTCE target. ","Bill Carcache","That's very helpful. Thanks. And then I also wanted to follow up separately, I heard your earlier comments about the residential mortgage build-out and also the trajectory of revenue synergies, but perhaps taking a step back just more broadly, can you discuss your confidence level in being able to use those revenue synergies and the trajectory of revenue synergies that you expect to offset declining purchase accounting accretion benefits? ","Don Kimble","Well, a couple of things that we have going forward, one, is the revenue synergies, which you highlighted and that should be a big help for us, but the other thing is if you look at our guidance, a purchase accounting accretion would come down year-over-year about $80 million. And also taking a look at the impact of the fourth quarter of 2017 rate increase on net interest income at $12 million a quarter would generate $48 million, and then a mid-year rate increase would be $24 million so that the rate increases by themselves are $72 million. And so that essentially offsets the purchase accounting accretion loss we\u2019ll have for the year, and so we think that there clearly is movement there that can be beneficial to help drive the earnings going forward. ","Bill Carcache","Thanks for taking my questions. ","Don Kimble","Thank you. ","Operator","With no further questions here in queue for us, I'll turn it back to Beth for any closing comments. ","Beth Mooney","Again, we thank you for taking time from your schedule to participate in our call today. If you have any follow-up questions, you can direct them to our Investor Relations team at 216-689-4221. And that concludes our remarks. Thank you again. ","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen still connected, that does conclude the conference for today. We thank you very much for your participation in using our Executive Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect."],"12331":["KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) Q2 2015 Earnings Conference Call July 16, 2015  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Beth Mooney - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer","Don Kimble - Chief Financial Officer","Chris Gorman - President, Corporate Banking","E.J.

This call is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Beth Mooney, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Beth Mooney","Thank you, Operator, and good morning and welcome to KeyCorp\u2019s second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me for today\u2019s presentation is Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer, and available for the Q&A portion of the call is Chris Gorman, President of our Corporate Bank; E.J. Burke and Dennis Devine, Co-Presidents of our Community Bank; and Bill Hartmann, our Chief Risk Officer. ","Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question and answer segment of our call.","I\u2019m now turning to Slide 3. We had a good second quarter. Our results show positive operating leverage and momentum across our company. Revenue was up 4% from last year, benefiting from strength in our core fee-based businesses and solid loan growth. On the fee side, investment banking and debt placement had a record quarter of $141 million, which was up 42% from the prior year. Stronger financial advisory fees and loan syndications drove the improvement this quarter.","We also saw good trends in trust and investment services, as well as in cards and payments income. Both businesses benefited from the investments we have made over the past few years in our people, products and capabilities. Average loans increased in both the community bank and the corporate bank, and loan growth continued to be driven by commercial, financial and agricultural loans, which were up 10% higher than the year ago period.","In second quarter, our expense levels reflect higher performance-based compensation from stronger revenue trends in the quarter, as well as the cost from Pacific Crest Securities and seasonal factors. Don will provide more detail on expenses in his remarks. ","We remain focused on generating positive operating leverage by growing revenues while holding expenses relatively stable, which over time will continue to drive further improvement in our efficiency ratio. Credit quality remains strong this quarter with a net charge-off ratio of 25 basis points, well below our targeted range. We continue to be disciplined with structure and staying true to our relationship focus.","Capital remains a strength of our company with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.7%. In the second quarter, our board approved a 15% increase in our common stock dividend and we repurchased $129 million in common shares. Overall, we are pleased with the quarter and believe that we are well positioned for the second half of the year. Our results continue to demonstrate the successful execution of our business model, which has allowed us to continue to add and expand client relationships and grow revenue.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Don to discuss the details of our second quarter results. ","Don Kimble","Thanks, and I\u2019m on Slide 5. As Beth said, we had a good quarter with net income from continuing operations of $0.27 per common share, the same as the year-ago period and up from the $0.26 we reported in the first quarter. This quarter, our results were driven by poor business activity across our company, which resulted in our 4% year-over-year revenue growth. Expenses also reflect our stronger business trends with higher performance-based compensation.","Worthy of note, in the second quarter of last year, we benefited from a leverage lease termination gain, higher principal investing gain, and a lower provision for credit losses. These items contributed $62 million more in pre-tax net income last year relative to the current quarter. I\u2019ll provide more detail on revenue and expense trends throughout the remainder of my presentation.","I\u2019m now turning to Slide 6. Average total loan growth continued in the second quarter with balances up $2.4 billion, or 4% compared to the year-ago quarter, and up $466 million from the first quarter. Our year-over-year growth was once again driven primarily by commercial, financial and agricultural loans, and was broad-based across key business lending segments. Average CF&A loans were up $2.6 billion or 10% compared to the prior year, and were up $696 million or 2% unannualized from the first quarter. ","Continuing on to Slide 7, on the liability side of the balance sheet average deposits were up $3.8 billion from one year ago and up $1.4 billion from the first quarter. Deposit growth of 6% from the prior year and 2% from the prior quarter was driven by strength in our commercial mortgage servicing business and inflows from both our commercial and consumer clients. The cost of our total deposits remained low at 15 basis points compared to 18 basis points one year ago, reflecting our more favorable deposit mix. ","Turning to Slide 8, taxable equivalent net interest income was $591 million for the second quarter compared to $579 million in the second quarter of 2014 and $577 million in the first quarter of this year. Net interest income was up $12 million or 2% from the year-ago quarter as higher earning asset balances were offset by lower earning asset yields. Compared to the first quarter, net interest income was up $14 million or 2% primarily as a result of earning asset growth and more days in the second quarter of this year.","Our net interest margin was 2.88%, which was down 3 basis points from the prior quarter, reflecting higher levels of excess liquidity driven by commercial deposit growth and lower earning asset yields. Our net interest margin also reflects our June debt issuance, which benefited our liquidity coverage ratio and credit ratings profile.","As we move into the third quarter, we\u2019re projecting higher levels of liquidity. While we don\u2019t expect this to impact our net interest income, we could experience some near term pressure on our margin, with our third quarter outlook reflecting a mid-single digit basis point decline. We anticipate our full-year margin will be relatively stable with the reported level of second quarter. Our full-year net interest income guidance has not changed. We also expect to maintain our modest asset sensitivity, and the duration and characteristics of Key\u2019s loan and investment portfolios continue to position us to realize more benefit from a rise in the shorter end of the yield curve. ","Slide 9 shows a summary of non-interest income, which accounts for 45% of total revenue. Non-interest income in the second quarter was $488 million, up $33 million or 7% from the prior year and up $51 million or 12% from the prior quarter. As Beth mentioned, we saw strong growth in several of our fee-based businesses. We had a record quarter for investment banking and debt placement fees with $141 million in fees, an increase of $42 million or 42% from prior year. We continue to expect full-year 2015 investment banking and debt placement fees to exceed full-year 2014. We expect this area to be one of the key drivers of our mid-single digit growth in fee income.","Additionally, trust and investment services was up 18% from the prior year, driven by the acquisition of Pacific Crest Securities and the strength in our retail and private banking businesses. Cards and payments income was up 9% from the prior year, a result of growth in both our credit card and debit card products. Our strong second quarter fee income results reflect the variability in some of our businesses that we\u2019ve previously discussed, like investment banking and debt placement. Importantly, our results this quarter were driven by core business activity, reflecting the success of our business model and the investments we have made. In the second quarter of last year, we had a leverage lease termination gain of $17 million. We also had higher principal investing gains in both the prior quarter and prior year.","Turning to Slide 10, our non-interest expense for the second quarter was $711 million, up $24 million from the year-ago period and up $42 million from the first quarter. Second quarter non-interest expense was 3% higher than the prior year. Expenses continue to be well managed as growth was driven by higher performance-based compensation and the Pacific Crest acquisition. Compared to the first quarter, expenses were up 6%, reflecting higher personnel costs tied to performance-based compensation and normal seasonal trends, including higher salaries from increased day count, higher marketing expense, and lower employee benefit costs. Additionally, professional fees grew as a result of in-flight third party programs and outsourced activities.","In the second quarter, our cash efficiency ratio was 65%. Efficiency ratio remains an important measure for us, and we remain committed to generating cost savings through our continuous improvement efforts, which are enabling us to make investments and offset normal expense growth.","The size and timing of our business investments will impact quarterly expense levels and efficiency. Recent investments include our third quarter 2014 Pacific Crest Securities acquisition, adding bankers in both the community and corporate bank, and the enhancements we have made to our payments capabilities. We believe these investments are additive to our business model and expect to see good return as they position us to continue to drive long-term growth.","Additionally, seasonality and production levels impact expense and efficiency measures from quarter to quarter. Our expense guidance remains unchanged. We continue to anticipate full-year expenses to be relatively stable with reported level in 2014.","Turning to Slide 11, our net charge-offs were $36 million or 25 basis points of average total loans in the second quarter, which continues to be well below our targeted range. In the second quarter, provision for credit losses of $41 million was $29 million higher than the year-ago period. Additionally, this quarter\u2019s provision expense exceeded net charge-offs. Our provision and allowance reflects the most recent syndicated credit review, which did not have a material impact on our overall allowance. At June 30, 2015, our reserve for loan losses represented 1.37% of period end loans and 190% coverage of our non-performing loans. ","Turning to Slide 12, our common equity Tier 1 ratio was strong at June 30 at 10.7%. As Beth mentioned, we repurchased $129 million in common shares in the second quarter as part of our 2015 capital plan. We also increased our quarterly common share dividend by 15% to $0.075 per share. Importantly, our capital plans reflect our commitment to remaining disciplined in managing our strong capital position.","Moving on to Slide 13, as we look ahead for the remainder of 2015, we remain on track and are committed to meeting our full-year outlook. Average loans should grow in the mid-single digit range as we benefit from strength in our commercial businesses. Consistent with prior comments, we anticipate our full-year net interest income growth in the low single digit range compared to 2014. This does not include any benefit from higher interest rates. We expect our full-year net interest margin to be down from 2014 and relatively stable with the second quarter of 2015 reported level. Non-interest income is expected to be up in the mid-single digit percentage range for the year, and full-year reported expenses should be relatively stable with 2014.","Credit quality should remain a good story with net charge-offs below our targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points, and we also expect provision to approximate net charge-offs. Finally, we expect to continue to execute our share repurchase authorization consistent with our capital plan.","With that, I\u2019ll close and turn the call back over to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of our call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question will come from the line of Scott Siefers of Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","Scott Siefers","Morning guys.","Don Kimble","Morning Scott.","Scott Siefers","Don, I was hoping you could just walk through that margin guidance once again. I just want to make sure I interpret it correctly. It sounds like for the third quarter it\u2019s a mid-single digit decline, but is it the full year that you\u2019re expecting to come in around, I guess, 288, in other words stable with the 2Q number? And I guess assuming that\u2019s right, what in your mind changed versus the prior? Is it just the timing of liquidity build, maybe a little more a little sooner than you thought, or what are the dynamics as you see them?","Don Kimble","Yes Scott, you interpret that right. We would expect the full year of 2015 to be relatively stable with the 288 we reported this quarter. That\u2019s down about 3 basis points from last quarter. Our level of liquidity is higher, and we also now expect it to stay with us longer than what we expected before. So net interest income guidance hasn\u2019t changed. We had noted before that we expected net interest income to be up low single digits without the benefit of rates, and our forecast now reflects our assumption that there may be a rate increase later in the year, but we shouldn\u2019t see much benefit from it. So even when rates do go up, or when rates do go up, we should see lift in net interest income and margin as well.","Scott Siefers","Okay, and I think that answers what would have been the second part. I noticed you took out the distinction between NII will be up X without rates and up Y with rates, so maybe you answered the second question there as well. All right, I think that\u2019s good for me. I appreciate the color.","Don Kimble","Thanks Scott.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","John Pancari","Just wanted to get a little bit of color on the business services and professional fee line again. I know you referred to it, Don, in your comment about what drove it. Can you give us a little bit more color on what drove that number higher, and is that likely to stay at that level or is it going to pull back next quarter?","Don Kimble","Yes, we talked about professional fees being up linked quarter - I think they were up about $9 million. About half of that is from outsourcing activities where we\u2019ve seen expense reductions in other categories, and that will continue at that higher level. The other half is what we referred to as in-flight third party programs. It\u2019s both related to revenue initiatives as well as risk management efforts. We do expect to see that continue into the third quarter but should drop down after that, so some of that is temporary in nature but we should see it continue into the third quarter.","John Pancari","Okay, all right. Lastly on the efficiency ratio, I know long term you\u2019d indicated you\u2019d like to target a below 60% efficiency ratio. Can you update us on that? Do you still stand by that number, and how do you get there? Currently, you\u2019re at 65, 66%. How much does rate help you get there, and then timing of when you could see that?","Don Kimble","Yes, what we\u2019ve talked about is without the benefit of rate, so over the next two to three years we expect our efficiency ratio to drop to the low 60\u2019s, so coming from the 65% down into the low 60\u2019s. With the benefit of rates, we would expect that to be in the high 50\u2019s.","Now, where we see that occurring is basically consistent with our guidance, which is that we expect to continue to be able to grow revenues and hold expenses relatively stable, and that\u2019s consistent with what our guidance is for this year. This past quarter, I think sometimes it\u2019s difficult to see the real picture, because if you look at the comparison from second quarter of last year to second quarter of this year, we\u2019ve talked about revenue growth of 4.3%, and if you back out those couple of items that we talked about with the leverage lease termination gain and also bag down the principal investing gains, our revenue growth was close to 7.5% and expense growth at 3.5% provides the operating leverage for us to continue to drive down that efficiency ratio. That\u2019s consistent with how we think that we\u2019ll be able to achieve that, is this continued maturation of the investments we\u2019ve been making and seeing those translate to positive operating leverage for us going forward.","John Pancari","Okay, thank you.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to the line of Steven Alexopoulos of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Steven Alexopoulos","Hey, good morning everyone.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","Steven Alexopoulos","Before I ask my question, Don, I didn\u2019t follow your reasoning behind where you took out on the outlook slide the expected increase in net interest income, including the benefit of rates. It wasn\u2019t clear to me if you no longer expect the benefit from rates, or if you\u2019re just more dovish in your own outlook for rates.","Don Kimble","It\u2019s more the latter, Steve. We really do not expect to see much of a rate increase this year, and our guidance was set at the end of last year and we felt that we would see a pick-up in the second half of the year. We still think that there could be a rate increase, but we think it could be very late in the year and have very little impact on our overall net interest income. We do believe that when rates do go up, we will see an increase in our net interest income and also our margin, so it\u2019s just more of an impact of our outlook would not suggest much of a rate increase this year, and therefore not much of a benefit from rate increases this year.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay, that makes sense. Don, I wanted to ask you - when we look at the investment banking fees, the relatively extreme volatility thus far in 2015, is this a two quarter event or is there something else going on there that we should think about, or do we just get back to a more normal trend line? I know it\u2019s a volatile item, but it\u2019s relatively extreme if you look at the last two quarters. Thanks.","Don Kimble","I\u2019m going to pass that one over to Chris since he\u2019s in the room here with us as well.","Chris Gorman","Good morning, Steve. We always look at that line item on a trailing 12 basis, and while we have great underlying growth if you look on a trailing 12 basis, we don\u2019t get too worried about either the first quarter being down or the second quarter being significantly above where the first quarter was. So over time, we think this is a business that we continue to grow and grow significantly, and we think we can do that; but we really think the right way to look at it is on a trailing 12 basis.","Steven Alexopoulos","So Chris, in your mind nothing has changed?","Chris Gorman","No. It hasn\u2019t changed. We\u2019re out there every day talking to our clients, bringing them ideas. Our discussions with clients have frankly never been better. It\u2019s interesting - these middle market companies, and as you know, we go to market in a very focused way based on industry, is they think about growth and they look around at what the opportunities are for organic growth, and they look around at what the opportunities are for inorganic growth. The discussions that we\u2019ve had with our clients, as I said, have really never been better, and to the extent that we\u2019re involved in M&A-type discussions, we think that has sort of a multiplier effect, because if you can break into these clients with a strategic idea and you\u2019re hired as their advisor, loans, deposits, hedging, a lot of those things come with it.","Steven Alexopoulos","Thanks for the color.","Beth Mooney","Steve, I would just add one thing, that when we talked about this line item in the first quarter, we did acknowledge that it was an outlier relative to what we would consider a normal performance on any quarterly basis, but did emphasize it does have quarterly variability. But I do think we looked at the first quarter as being relatively light relative to what we think this business will generate, but we do think it\u2019s very important to recognize it does have characteristics that will always make it variable, and the trailing 12 really does give you a better trajectory of the growth of the business, which has been really solid.","The other thing that we acknowledged in the first quarter was if you looked at our loans held for sale, there was a significant spike up, which was an indicator that some piece of the activity was positioned to be realized in the second quarter.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay, thanks for the color and thanks for taking my questions.","Don Kimble","Thanks Steve.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to the line of Ken Zerbe at Morgan Stanley. ","Ken Zerbe","Great, thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to dive in a little bit more in the margin compression that you expect because of the liquidity. Can you just give us a little more detail - are you seeing meaningful, or what types of commercial deposit growth that you\u2019re seeing that is driving that lower? Is it temporary? I mean, do you only expect this to be for a few quarters? I\u2019m just trying to get an understanding of the underlying driver of the liquidity and if that\u2019s sustainable or not.","Don Kimble","What we\u2019re seeing is a lot of temporary deposits coming through from our commercial customers, and we\u2019re seeing some additional inflows which will continue to put that under pressure as being higher levels of liquidity. So that\u2019s one of the reasons why we expected it to have some pressure in the near term as far as margin.","Keep in mind that we would have been projecting all along that we expected our loan growth to exceed deposit growth, but because of the growth in these temporary deposit balances, deposit growth has actually exceeded loan growth. Our short term earning assets are up over $800 million linked quarter, which puts pressure on that.","The other thing I\u2019d keep in mind is that we did have $1.7 billion debt issuance at the end of the second quarter, and the full quarter impact of that will also affect the overall margin for the third quarter. So it\u2019s really those two pieces that are driving that temporary mid-single digit reduction in net interest margin.","Ken Zerbe","Got it. Are you actually able to make any meaningful amount of money on those temporary deposits, or is it really just a wash from an NII perspective?","Don Kimble","It really is close to a wash. We put it in our fed account and earn about 25 basis points on it, so far from meaningful but it is additive.","Ken Zerbe","Great. All right, thank you.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Thanks, good morning. Hey Don, on the loan side, you saw pretty good growth on the commercial and, as important, we finally saw those yields go up. I\u2019m wondering if you could give us any color in terms of has there been a change in either the type of production you\u2019re seeing or the competitive and spreads angle, and if this is kind of a good inflection that we\u2019re finally seeing on the yield side.","Don Kimble","On the yield side, we\u2019ve benefited this quarter from a couple of things. One is that loan fees were stronger in the second quarter than they were in the first quarter, and also we had some additional increase in contribution from our swap income. From an accounting perspective, that gets mapped up against commercial loans because we use that to hedge the LIBOR-base loans. So if you back that out, we\u2019re still seeing a little bit of pressure, but it\u2019s muted compared to where it has been as far as the incremental quarter over quarter.","So I\u2019d say we haven\u2019t seen the market change significantly, but to your point, I think we\u2019re getting to a level closer to stability than where we have been in the past couple of years.","Ken Usdin","Okay, got it. Great. Then secondly, just as far as the expenses are concerned, you talked about adding a little bit more of the restructuring-related expenses. Are you still on track for about 30 for the year, or is there any change in the trajectory of how you\u2019re expecting to spend underneath the normal cost base?","Don Kimble","Yes, for the first six months of this year, we\u2019ve incurred about $17 million. I\u2019d say that we\u2019re still on the same general course as to where we had expected coming into the year. Keep in mind that in the first half of this year, we only had five branch consolidations. We\u2019ve talked about a number of 20 to 30%--excuse me, 2 to 3%. Twenty to 30% would be way out of line! But 2 to 3% consolidation for this year, which would imply plus or minus an additional 20 branches of consolidation in the second half of the year. So with that, we still expect to be in that same general range.","Ken Usdin","Okay, and just as a follow-up on expenses then, too, you did have, I\u2019m assuming, some of the personnel step-up was related to the really strong IB line. Do you anticipate there being a reversion of some of that if in fact the IB was a little peak-y, per Beth\u2019s point about some of the lingering stuff from the first quarter that kind of got pushed into the second?","Don Kimble","Great question, and I would say that that is a variable line item in our income statement and it does reflect the production that we do have. If you look at our total compensation expense, it really had three impacts this current quarter. One was our benefit cost did come down, and it\u2019s seasonally consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in the past. Salary dollars were up about $10 million, and if you take a look at that, about half of it is because of day count. We had two more days in the current quarter than what we did in the last quarter from a business perspective, and we also had our merit increase, which was about 2% year-over-year.","The last piece is increase in incentive compensation, which was up $26 million, and between the first quarter and the second quarter we had $3 million to $5 million of impact from accruals adjustments and true-ups from quarter to quarter. So really, the core increase was closer to the $22 million range, so if you look at that as a variable component to the growth that we would have seen in our corporate banking activities, it gives you a ballpark of what kind of variability there might be prospectively.","Keep in mind, it\u2019s not just investment banking income, though. It also includes the other areas of revenues because Chris\u2019 corporate bank is truly focused on relationships, and that includes both balance sheet and fee income as part of the calculation of the value that they\u2019re contributing, and that\u2019s what the incentives are based on as well.","Ken Usdin","Okay, thanks Don.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to the line of Matt O\u2019Connor at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Rob Placet","Hi, good morning. This is Rob Placet on behalf of Matt. On a period end basis, it looks like you added to the securities portfolio this quarter. I was curious if you could just update us on your thinking in terms of deployment of liquidity in the current environment beyond the liquidity builds on the commercial deposits you highlighted earlier, and should we expect continued growth in your securities book from here?","Don Kimble","The billion dollar growth period to period really was driven by the $1.7 billion debt issuance that we had during the quarter, and that occurred in June as far as when it closed. So that\u2019s really what drove it, more so than any planned additions, that we would expect generally going forward the investment securities portfolio would remain relatively stable. We\u2019re comfortable with that assumption, given that our LCR estimate for the second quarter was just north of 100%, so we think that we\u2019re well positioned going into next year where the requirement is at 90%.","Rob Placet","Okay. Secondly, commercial loan yields were up 5 BPs, I think, this quarter. Was curious what drove the increase there.","Don Kimble","The two components that really drove that was that we saw some stronger loan fees in the current quarter compared to the first quarter, and we also saw an increased benefit from our swap book, that some of the swaps rolled off and we had some reinvestment or rebooking of new swaps, and then they came through with a higher yield. So both of those helped benefit the commercial loan yields on a linked quarter basis.","Rob Placet","Okay, thank you.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Bill Carcache","Thanks, good morning. Don, I had a follow up on your comments about the growth in temporary deposits. I was hoping that you could comment on the overall quality of the deposit growth that you\u2019re seeing from an LCR perspective. I was curious - now that we\u2019ve seen some larger banks take on initiatives to focus on operating deposits, whether you\u2019ve seen any kind of change in the quality of the deposits that are coming your way.","Don Kimble","We\u2019re still seeing growth in our core operating accounts. We\u2019ve talked about the overall payments area being a key strategic initiative for us, and that\u2019s helping us drive for deeper relationships and enhancing that management of liquidity for our customers. So we are seeing that growth come through. I\u2019d say that the growth that I was talking about was isolated to a handful of accounts where we\u2019re seeing some funds come into our customers that need to have a temporary home for. It\u2019s not an indication of lack of quality of not picking up additional operating accounts, but we view that as more of a temporary impact. ","Chris, do you have anything else you\u2019d add?","Chris Gorman","Yes. Don, the only thing I would add to that is our third party commercial loan servicing business is really a good engine for us to grow quality deposits. If you look at that business, our deposits total about $6.4 billion, and that\u2019s up 15% on a linked quarter and 63% on a year-over-year basis, so that\u2019s one of the vehicles that we\u2019re focusing on, Bill, under the new construct to really grow quality receivables.","Bill Carcache","Okay, so you haven\u2019t seen any notable increase in the amount of non-operating deposits coming your way post-some of the initiatives that the larger banks have undertaken to de-emphasize those?","Don Kimble","No, we have not.","Bill Carcache","Okay, excellent. Thank you.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to the line of David Eads with UBS.","David Eads","Hello. Thanks for taking the call. A couple of the banks that we\u2019ve reported, we\u2019ve heard some discussion about middle market C&I looking especially competitive, and I\u2019m just curious if you guys have seen any shifting in the competitive environment there on the middle market side.","Chris Gorman","Sure David, this is Chris. Let me start and then I\u2019ll have E.J. Burke address it from the community bank side as well. There is no question that there are a lot of competitors in the middle market, if you think about the very large banks, the regional banks, the smaller banks, the non-banks, the variety of institutional investors, so we are seeing a lot of competition in the area. One of the ways, though, that we compete as a company is the fact that loans are just a piece of what we offer people, so it really gives us the opportunity to really differentiate ourselves. It is competitive. There still are good loans to be had, but one of the advantages that we have, of course, is that working together, both the corporate bank and the community bank, we can tap into various pools of capital as agent as opposed to principal. So as we look back over the first, say, half of the year, we only put about 18% of the capital that we raised onto our balance sheet, so that\u2019s just another way that we have, another that I think is really differentiated from a lot of our competitive set.","E.J.?","E.J. Burke","Yes Chris, I would echo most of what you said, but I would also add to that that in terms of our strategy, because we have a lot of products and we focus on relationship, we don\u2019t get as wound up around pricing as we do around structure and maintaining credit discipline. So if we believe we have a client who wants a broad relationship and the credit metrics look good for us, we know that over time we can generate a profitable relationship even if we are pressured a bit on the loan pricing. ","Just to reinforce a little bit of what Chris said, in our community bank we focus primarily on commercial clients, call it $50 million in sales up to $250 million in sales. When we can bring a good capital markets idea to a client in that size range, it clearly makes Key look a little different than the typical community bank that we\u2019re competing against, and that is a competitive advantage that we drive consistently across the franchise. ","David Eads","Great. Thanks for that. I think last quarter you guys talked about creating an initiative to and some incentives to grow the HELOC business a little bit through the summer. It looks like loan balances were pretty much dead flat sequentially. Just curious if you had any update on how that\u2019s going.","Dennis Devine","This is Dennis Devine in the Community Bank. You\u2019ve seen the earnings release - modest increases in the core consumer loan portfolio offset by some runoff in the exits. The consumer loan book is largely shaped at Key by our home equity portfolio. We\u2019re not in a lot of other consumer loan categories that you might see, indirect auto, for example. So sales and new relationship numbers were solid in the second quarter. You actually see ending balances up slightly versus the first quarter. You also see growth in other consumer categories where we compete - credit card and some other direct lending. Those are just small relative to the HELOC book.","So you see it across the industry - home equity portfolio pay downs are occurring. There\u2019s not as much growth in that category, so at Key we\u2019ve got a stable, high quality book with a bit of growth in the second quarter but--in fact, a bit fast within the industry but very consistent with what you\u2019re seeing across the rest of the industry.","David Eads","All right, thanks.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to the line of Bob Ramsey at FBR. Please go ahead.","Bob Ramsey","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to be sure that I\u2019m thinking about the expense outlook in the right way. I know you guys said that for the full year, you expect something in the same ballpark, and I guess that implies that in the back half this year the quarterly run rate actually should be lower than either of the first two quarters. Obviously, I get there\u2019s some variability around the incentive comp, but otherwise, is that the right way to think about it?","Don Kimble","Yes, what we\u2019ve talked about for the entire year is that we expect expenses to be relatively stable, and in that we say that that could mean plus or minus 2%. So if you use that as a guidance and take a look at the second half of the year, that would imply a quarterly expense run rate of between $665 million and $715 million of expense. Now again, that\u2019s equal to the first quarter and equal to the second quarter as far as the high and the low in that range, so we would expect to be within that overall guidance range, and some of that is variable based on the level of growth that we see throughout the portfolio.","Bob Ramsey","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Then one other question around the net interest income outlook. I know you all have sort of said that you\u2019re pushing out and expecting less of a rate increase this year, just given where we are today. I\u2019m curious if you could tell us how Key is impacted by maybe that first rate increase, whenever it does happen. Is there much lift from a 25 basis point move, or to what extent do floors kind of limit the initial move?","Don Kimble","We don\u2019t have a huge impact from floors, so that really doesn\u2019t limit it a whole lot; but just in a 25 basis point move, that doesn\u2019t drive a lot of incremental net interest income. Our balance sheet is positioned so that we do benefit when we do see that shorter end of the curve move up, but I would think of it more proportionate to what we\u2019ve talked about as far as a 200 basis point increase would have about a 3% lift in net interest income, so the first 25 basis points would drive about an eighth of that. So again, it\u2019s helpful, but just doesn\u2019t move the dial a lot.","Bob Ramsey","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning Don, good morning Beth. Question for you - you guys have had good success in the credit cards, in the revenues generating that fee revenue from payments and such. Don, you talked about there was good growth in the usage of the credit card and debit card products. Can you share with us any more color on how you\u2019re getting that growth; and second, as part of that, though I know your net charge-offs nominally are very small in this area for credit cards, the net charge-off ratio, though, is quite a bit above the trust data that just came out yesterday - it\u2019s less than 2.5%, and you guys are well over 3%. Is there any potential of improvement in that credit card charge-off number as we go forward as well?","Dennis Devine","This is Dennis Devine. I\u2019ll start and hand it to Don. The growth in the card line is coming from the focus and the investments that you\u2019ve seen us speak to around as we brought that product in and as a core part of our relationship strategy, it\u2019s center to how we look to grow with our clients around all aspects of payments. So you see in growth in cards and payments in the community bank - 13% year-over-year that\u2019s driven by credit card, that\u2019s driven by debit card, just a substantial number of additional cards in our clients\u2019 hands. Even as we\u2019ve seen declines in spending in some categories, the volume of activity with our client base is strong and it\u2019s growing.","On the charge-off side, you see the continuing decline in the charge-offs since we brought that portfolio back in. We feel really good about the quality of originations that are occurring, so you see that in the strength of consumer credit line items. No doubt we feel good about the quality of the new originations as they grow and the quality of the credit that you see there.","Don Kimble","Dennis stole my thunder there, but I would just say that those charge-offs really are related to the portfolio that we did acquire. It was a legacy portfolio, and as we add new relationships, we should see the overall credit quality picture continue to improve.","Gerard Cassidy","Have you guys seen any pick-up in competition? Some of the bigger credit card companies - I\u2019m thinking Citigroup in particular, it seemed to have now been reinvigorated to try to grow their portfolios. Have you guys seen any of that impact on what you\u2019re trying to do with your portfolio?","Don Kimble","We have a very different model. It\u2019s not really targeting those national cards, and what we\u2019re really focused on is deepening the relationship with our existing retail customers, so we haven\u2019t seen that have a big impact on us. We do value the relationships and our customers do benefit from that expanded relationship, so we\u2019ll continue to drive that model.","Gerard Cassidy","My final question - maybe Beth, you can handle this one. You\u2019ve talked in the past about looking at the residential mortgage business, possibly changing the way you have it structured today. Where is your thinking on what you guys may want to do with that business as you go forward?","Beth Mooney","Gerard, it is true that we have looked at what has been our traditional model, has been an outsourced model, and we are in the process of--we have hired a new president for a mortgage business at Key, which will be a product that we will offer to our clients. We don\u2019t view it as a standalone business, but yet an important relationship product that our clients value. We are in the process of undertaking the ability to stand up the ability to offer mortgages directly and have them be originated through Key, so that is an important strategic initiative for us and we are already investing in some of those capabilities. We expect to be in a position to underwrite and offer mortgages in 2016 directly.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Geoffrey Elliott","Hello there. Thank you for taking the question. I\u2019d like to ask a couple of things on credit. Could you just explain the uptick in the provisions, especially in the context of most of the credit indicators appearing to look pretty good?","Bill Hartmann","Hi, this is Bill Hartmann. You kind of trailed off at the end, but it sounded like you were asking about the uptick in provision?","Geoffrey Elliott","Yes, most of the credit indicators seemed to show a bit of an improvement, so I guess I was curious on why the provisions were higher this quarter.","Bill Hartmann","Sure. So where we have been operating over the last several quarters is really kind of at a low point in the cycle, if you will, around charge-offs, non-performing loans, et cetera. So small numbers tend to move things around a little bit, so the increase in provision reflects our focus on really having provision kind of equal net charge-offs, and then we\u2019ve had some movement in various sectors of the portfolio, broad-based, that are really reflected in the provision. We continue to see it operating at a very low level, though. ","Geoffrey Elliott","And then the criticized assets were up again this quarter. Can you give a bit of detail on what was behind the increase?","Bill Hartmann","Yes, the increase in the criticized was across primarily our corporate and community bank, so commercial portfolios, and it\u2019s very broad-based. It does reflect the results of the shared national credit exam, but that was a small part of what was actually contained in it. We see no particular concentrations in the additions.","You\u2019ll also notice that we\u2019re not being impacted in our non-performing loans or our delinquencies. Those continue to improve.","Geoffrey Elliott","Great, thank you very much.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Beth Mooney","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. ","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning.","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","Erika Najarian","Beth, my question for you is particularly given your concentration in retail deposits, there\u2019s been a lot of talk so far this earning season on what deposit betas are going to be in a rising rate environment, with some banks saying they\u2019ll be much higher because regulation has essentially made retail deposits more precious, and others saying they might not be as bad because we\u2019re coming from zero. I\u2019m wondering what your thoughts are on this topic.","Don Kimble","Erika, this is Don. I\u2019ll take a first crack at that. I would say near term that we think it would probably play out consistent with what we saw in the last rate increase, which is about a 55% beta. But I think you\u2019re exactly right, that long term those consumer deposits are going to be much more valuable, and I think we\u2019re going to see increased competition for those consumer deposits and therefore we think the beta will be at a little bit higher level than what we had seen historically.","Now, helping to offset that a little bit is that banks\u2019 balance sheets are much better positioned today than they were during the last cycle, so you have a much lower loan to deposit ratio today than when we did back in the early 2000\u2019s. The second thing is that money market mutual funds should not be quite as competitive as what they once were because of the break of the buck type of situation does cause some of the treasurers of our customers to reassess whether or not they want to have a bank deposit or a money market mutual fund deposit.","Beth Mooney","Erika, I would add that it is interesting, because we have been in such an extended low interest rate environment that the competitive dynamics of how the industry will respond is a chapter that is yet to be written. I would echo what Don said, that that is our sentiment, that maybe the first couple rate moves will correlate deposit betas in the past, and then it will be a function of, I think, general liquidity within the industry to see if it intensifies competition.","But one other thing I would tell you, though, is also the mix of our deposit base is far stronger than it has ever been, as over the last several years our strategies have been to drive core retail and commercial deposit accounts and a less rate-sensitive mix of business than we\u2019ve ever had and more core transactional accounts, so we also feel well positioned that our relationship strategy has given us a nice deposit base for the upcoming rate increases, when and if they occur.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thank you so much.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Beth Mooney","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to the line of Mike Mayo of CLSA.","Mike Mayo","Hi. Just a clarification, and then my main question. Your cash efficiency ratio remained at 65.1% in the second quarter, same as the first quarter, worse than the fourth quarter. So with all the guidance that you\u2019ve given on this call or direction, do you expect that 65.1% number to go lower in the second half of the year?","Don Kimble","What we\u2019ve talked about, Mike, is driving that down through the next two to three years in the low 60\u2019s, and I would say that over the second half of this year, while we continue to expect to drive positive operating leverage, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see a material change in the overall efficiency ratio, mainly driven by some of the additional costs we talked about as far as having additional branch consolidations in the third and fourth quarter, which will put some pressure on seeing that further improvement.","Mike Mayo","Okay, so when people call me up this morning and say, wow, that efficiency ratio doesn\u2019t look very good, the mitigating factors would be what?","Beth Mooney","Mike, I would say that I continue and we continue to be confident that we are on the path to reduce our efficiency ratio. It is a very important measure to us, and what I see is the combination of two things, both in terms of revenue as well as expense. I do believe, as Don indicated, that expenses have been well controlled, and we continue to invest in our businesses. So some piece of this is we are driving revenue, we are driving positive operating leverage, and many of those investments are not yet mature, so I continue to see the momentum in our core businesses as being a company that will be able to grow revenue, and Don did a little of the math about the year-over-year, if you back out lease termination gains and some other things, could be at 7% revenue growth, so I think that\u2019s an incredibly important focus for us, always coupled with expense discipline. We had some things in this quarter that we have outlined that created that top line number around $711 million in expenses, but underneath it all we have really reduced the core operating expenses of this company and continue to have levers and discipline to do that.","So I see us on the path to move into the low 60\u2019s without the benefit of rates, and I\u2019m confident that we are doing the right things to drive our business, grow our business, as well as create a more efficient company.","Mike Mayo","Well since you\u2019re investing for growth on the revenue side, then, it seems like capital markets is the biggest delta. If we could just get some more color - a, what does your capital markets backlog look like at the end of the second quarter; and b, can you give us more color, we get one line item, investment banking and debt placement fees, so $141 million in the second quarter, and now that\u2019s 29% of your fee revenues. Can you just give us more of a breakdown, some of the parts that are moving within that line item?","Chris Gorman","Sure Mike, it\u2019s Chris. Good morning. A couple things - with respect to our backlog, our backlogs are strong. Obviously it\u2019s all market dependent, but as I mentioned earlier in the call, we\u2019re out there having quality discussions with clients and prospects, and they have a bias for action right now as they think about how to grow their business. So we feel pretty good about where the business is positioned. A big part of that are the investments that we\u2019ve made, and if you think about it, of our most senior calling people, we\u2019ve grown that universe, that sales force by 36% since mid-2013. We also, as Beth and Don both mentioned earlier, have invested in our payments business, which augments not our investment banking and debt placement lines but it augments our entire business, and it\u2019s kind of the holistic approach to how we go to the market.","Now specifically some areas that were particularly good, we were up across the board, but some areas were in the equity business, both real estate and technology had a good quarter. In the M&A business, both industrial and technology had a good quarter, so when we think about our business, we first go to which of our seven industry verticals is it, and that\u2019s kind of how we look at the business.","Mike Mayo","And just lastly, any more breakdown you can give us on your investment banking and debt placement fees? If we were to break it down between, I don\u2019t know, underwriting equity, underwriting mergers, FIC trading and equity trading, any even rough sizing?","Chris Gorman","We do not in fact break it out, Mike, but it is a fairly balanced approach because our whole strategy is go out to our clients and really figure out what is most advantageous for them at any particular time. As I\u2019m looking at these numbers, there is growth in all categories and it\u2019s pretty well balanced.","Mike Mayo","All right, thank you.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Beth Mooney","Thank you.","Operator","We will go to the line of Kevin Barker at Compass Point.","Kevin Barker","Thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to go over the use of your commercial swap portfolio and some of the comments you made in past quarters. I know you\u2019ve mentioned that you always have some type of swap portfolio in place, but could you talk about if we do see some rise in rates, how much of that do you expect to continue to hold, or do you feel like you\u2019d be more aggressive with letting the swap portfolio mature in a rising rate environment?","Don Kimble","What we\u2019ve talked about before is without the use of our swap book, that we have had about an 8% asset sensitive balance sheet. So we try to use the swap to help minimize that over time, that each time that we meet as a team to assess where we are from a rate sensitivity perspective, we evaluate how we want to be positioned, what we\u2019re seeing from the forward curve, and whether or not we need to make adjustments to that. But I do not want to give the impression that we would ever take that swap book to zero, or that we would double it and take significant rate bets, but that we use that position us to lean in heavier one way or the other as to what our outlook would be. So right now, we continue to be asset sensitive and we\u2019re very comfortable with that, and we\u2019ll continue to reassess that each time we take a look at this, which is at least on a monthly basis.","Kevin Barker","Do you see it as a risk-reward regarding the potential returns on the swaps, or it something along the lines of we\u2019re changing our outlook on the rate environment?","Don Kimble","What we do is we use this as more of a way to position the overall balance sheet to benefit from rate increases or changes, so it truly is a hedge book, because we don\u2019t want to be overly asset sensitive. It allows us to manage on the margin as to whether we want to be slightly asset sensitive or slightly liability sensitive.","Kevin Barker","Thank you for taking my questions.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Speakers, at this time we have no further questions in queue. I will now turn it back over to Ms. Mooney for closing remarks.","Beth Mooney","Thank you, Operator. Again, we thank you for taking time from your schedule to participate in our call today. If you have follow-up questions, you can direct them to our Investor Relations team at 216-689-4221.

This call is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Beth Mooney, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead.","Beth Mooney","","Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to KeyCorp's second-quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Joining me for today's presentation is Don Kimball, our Chief Financial Officer. Available for the Q&A portion of the call are Chris Gorman, President of our Corporate Bank; EJ Burke, Co-President of our Community Bank; and Bill Hartmann, our Chief Risk Officer.","Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call.","Turning now to slide 3. This was a good quarter for Key with solid financial results that reflect the successful execution of our strategy and continued progress on our commitment to one, drive positive operating leverage. Second, to maintain strong risk management practices. Third, to remain disciplined in the way we manage our capital. Our positive operating leverage from the prior year, reflects the work we have done to capitalize on the strength of our business model and improve efficiency by both growing revenue and reducing expenses.","Compared to the year-ago period, pre-provision net revenue was up 13%. Positive revenue trends for both the prior year and previous quarter reflect solid loan growth, driven by our commercial, financial, and agricultural loans. CF&A loans were up $3 billion or 13% from the second quarter of last year. We have been pleased with the quality of our new loan originations, but we continue to see loan yields impacted by the competitive pricing environment.","Non interest income benefited from the strength in our investment banking and debt placement fees, which were up 18% from both the prior year and the prior quarter. Coupled with our solid loan growth, these results reaffirm the strength of our business model and our success in growing market share.","Expenses were down $22 million, or 3% from the prior year, and in line with our guidance. Our second-quarter results reflect normal seasonal trends and the acceleration of charges related to our continuous improvement effort. We remain committed to further improvement on expenses and efficiency, and Don will discuss more on our path forward in his remarks.","Our strong risk management practices resulted in another quarter of very good credit-quality trends. Net charge offs to average loans were 22 basis points, well below our targeted range. Nonperforming assets declined 41% from the year-ago period. Our NPA ratio is down to 74 basis points.","Importantly, we continue to originate new business that has better overall risk rating than our existing portfolio. While the environment remains competitive, we are remaining disciplined with structure and staying true to our relationship strategy.","Capital management also remains one of our top priorities. In the second quarter, we began executing on our 2014 capital plan by repurchasing $108 million in common shares and increasing our quarterly dividend by 18% to $0.065 per common share. These actions put us on a path to remain among the highest in our peer group for total shareholder payout, the second consecutive year.","Over the past few years, we have also used our capital to drive opportunistic growth through acquisitions of commercial mortgage servicing, credit card, and branches. Today, we announced another strategically important investment, which is highlighted on the next slide.","Moving now to slide 4. Pacific Crest Securities is a leading technology-focused investment bank and capital markets firm. This acquisition underscores our commitment to be a leading corporate and investment bank serving middle-market companies. The comprehensive platform aligns with our industry expertise and gives us another important industry vertical.","Adding technology expertise accelerates our momentum and will provide us the opportunity to add and expand client relationships. Clients will benefit from our broad capabilities as well as the expertise we will now bring to the market around technology trend that are intersecting and impacting our other industry verticals.","We anticipate the transaction will close in the third quarter of this year, subject to standard regulatory approvals. I am very excited about this acquisition and pleased with our overall financial results for the quarter. We have good momentum in our core businesses and our strategy and business model continue to provide a competitive advantage in the marketplace.","Now, I will turn it over to Don, who will comment further on our second-quarter results. Don?","Don Kimble","","Thanks, Beth. Slide 5 provides highlights from the Company's second-quarter 2014 results. This morning we reported net income from continuing operations of $0.27 per common share for the second quarter, compared to $0.21 for the second quarter of 2013 and $0.26 from the first quarter of this year. I will cover many of this in my remarks, so I will now turn slide 7.","Average total loan growth remained solid in the second quarter, with balances up $2.9 billion, or 6% compared to a year-ago quarter, and up $0.9 billion, or an un-annualized 2% compared to the first quarter. Our growth was once again driven primarily by commercial, financial and agricultural loans, which was broad-based across Key's business lending segments. Average commercial, financial and agricultural loans were up $3 billion or 13% compared to the prior year and up $1.1 billion or 4% un-annualized from the first quarter.","In the second quarter, total commitments were up with utilization rates relatively stable. As Beth mentioned, the lending environment continues to be competitive. By remaining disciplined with our relationship focus, the quality and structure of our new business has held strong. Our outlook for loan growth for 2014 remains consistent with our prior guidance of mid single-digit, full-year growth driven by CF&A.","Continue on to slide 8. On the liability side of the balance sheet, average deposits were up $1.6 billion from a year ago and up $0.8 billion from the first quarter. Deposit growth of 2% from the prior year and 1% for the prior quarter was largely driven by inflows from commercial clients as well as increases related to our commercial mortgage servicing business. As a result of continued focus on improving deposit mix, year-over-year interest-bearing liability cost declined from 62 basis points to 52 basis points.","Turning to slide 9. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $579 million for the second quarter compared to $586 million in the second quarter of 2013 and $569 million in the first quarter of this year. Our net interest margin was 2.98%, which was down 2 basis points from the prior quarter. Results in second quarter reflect the impact of a leveraged lease early termination, which reduced net interest income by $2 million and our margin by 1 basis point.","The reported decline in net interest income and the net interest margin from the prior year was attributable to the competitive environment, lower asset yields, and loan fees as well as a leveraged lease early termination. These items were partially offset by loan growth, maturity of higher rate CDs and a more favorable mix of our lower-cost deposits. Compared to the first quarter of this year, net interest income was up $10 million, primarily due to the continued loan growth and the benefit of the day count and an improvement in funding costs.","For the full-year 2014, we expect net interest income to be relatively stable with reported level in 2013 with potential for downward pressure do to the competitive environment. We also expect to maintain our modest asset sensitivity position. As we have highlighted before, we have the flexibility to manage and quickly adjust our rate-risk position. The duration and characteristics of Key's loan investment portfolios continue to position us to realize more benefit from a rise in the shorter end of the yield cover.","Slide 10 shows a summary of non interest income, which accounts for approximately 44% of our total revenue. Non interest income in the second quarter was $455 million, up $26 million or 6% from the second quarter of last year and up $20 million or 5% from the first quarter of 2014. The year-over-year increase was due to stronger investment banking and debt placement fees as well as principal investing and a $17 million gain from the leveraged lease termination that I mentioned earlier.","Improvement in the first quarter was primarily related to the stronger investment banking and debt placement fees which were up $15 million as well as the leveraged lease termination gain. We also saw increases in normal seasonal trends in areas like deposit service charges, and cards and payments income.","As Beth mentioned, strength in the investment banking and debt placement fee helps illustrate the benefits of our business model, which allow us to capitalize on revenue opportunities whether they are through execution in the capital markets when conditions are favorable or by offering on-balance fee alternatives.","Turn to slide 11. Non interest expense for the second quarter was $689 million down $22 million from a year-ago period and up $27 million from the first quarter. Second-quarter expenses included $24 million in charges related to the efficiency initiatives, which added 2.3% to our efficiency ratio. Expense levels reflect normal seasonality in the area such as marketing and personnel, as well as elevated efficiency charges due to the acceleration of our continuous improvement efforts.","Specific actions this quarter included closing 18 branches, a 20% reduction in the headcount in our fixed income trading business and the exit of our international leasing business. In the second half of the year, we would expect expense levels to remain relatively stable with the second quarter in the $680 million to $690 million range. Quarterly results may be impacted by the timing of expense savings and efficiency charges and the pace of investments and merger-related charges related to Pacific Crest.","Moving on to slide 12. Our year to date, we have recognized $34 million and efficiency related charges. We would anticipate additional charges in the second half of the year at a level more comparable to what we experienced in the first quarter. This will likely bring efficiency charges for the full year to the upper end of our range of 1% to 2% of 2013 expenses. Importantly, our guidance for the second half of the year is consistent with our previous outlook for 2014 expenses, which is down in the low to mid single-digit percentage range from the prior year.","We remain committed to continuing to generate cost savings through our continuous improvement efforts, which will enable us to make investments and offset normal expense growth.","Slide 13 is our path to achieve the lower end of our cash efficiency ratio target of 60% to 65% over the next two to three year period. We expect the improvement to come from growing our business both organically and through strategic investments as well as from additional expense reductions. Importantly, this assumes no benefit from higher interest rates. If rates move in line with the forward curve, we would expect this to move our efficiency ratio below our targeted range.","Turning to slide 14. Net charge-offs were $30 million, or 22 basis points, on average loans in the second quarter, which continues to be below our targeted range. In the second quarter, net charge-offs benefited from improvement in total gross charge-offs, which were down 24% from the prior year and down 2% from the prior quarter.","Commercial loan charge-offs continued to be a good story with recoveries exceeding charge-offs by $3 million in the second quarter. The breakdown of asset quality by loan portfolio is shown on slide 22 of the appendix.","At June 30, our reserve for loan losses represented 1.46% of period end loans and 206% coverage of our nonperforming loans. Importantly, as Beth mentioned, the quality of the new business volume has consistently been better than that of our existing portfolio. We expect net charge-offs to remain below the target range of 40 to 60 basis points for the remainder of the year and for the loan loss provision to approximate the level of net charge-offs.","Turning the slide 15. Our tangible common equity ratio and estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio both remain strong at June 30 at 10.15% and 11.33% respectively. As Beth mentioned, we repurchased $108 million or 7.8 million common shares in the second quarter. We also increased our quarterly common share dividend by 18% to $0.065 per share. Importantly, our capital plans reflect our commitment to remaining disciplined in managing our strong capital position. Our Tier 1 common ratio remained above 11%, while we have paid out a peer leading amount of capital to our shareholders.","Moving on to slide 16. This summary of our 2014 outlook and expectations is consistent with my comments today. As I stated earlier, we expect average loans to continue to grow year over year in the mid single-digit range and our net interest income to remain relatively stable with our reported level in 2013. Revenue should benefit from the full-year, low signal-digit growth and non interest income compared to the prior year. We continue to anticipate expenses will be down low- to mid-single digits on a full-year basis.","This guidance reflects the impact of implemented expense savings, planned investments, as well as future costs associated with implementing additional cost-saving initiatives. Credit quality should remain a good story with net charge-offs below our targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points for the remainder of year. Finally, capital management will remain a priority including continuing to execute on our share repurchase authorization.","With that, I'll close and turn the call back over to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of our call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) One moment for our first question. And we\u2019ll go to the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. ","Marty Mosby \u2013 Vining Sparks","","Beth, I wanted to first ask you a little bit about the acquisition. Was this able to use some of your excess capital? Can you deploy cash into these types of acquisitions? How do you think about this going forward?","Beth Mooney","","Yes, Marty. This is a cash acquisition for us and it is an opportunity for us to build out a differentiated platform and consistent with our desire to expand our industry verticals, so it will be cash. It is not a material transaction in terms of its size, but we think it's significantly proceeds its size for what it's going to do for us within our Corporate banking platform.","Marty Mosby \u2013 Vining Sparks","Do you see these types of acquisitions \u2013 because through the cash side you can use a little bit of that excess capital that's trapped on the balance sheet. Do you see some other opportunities going forward to be able to look to use some of your excess capital?","Beth Mooney","","Marty, we have always said that one of the opportunities we will have through time is how we can deploy some capital, not only to support organic growth, but you've seen us over the last couple years deploy capital for commercial mortgage servicing, we brought back in our credit card portfolio. So yes, some piece of the advantage, I believe, that we have is the levels of our capital will both support inorganic growth, organic growth, as well as, clearly, a high priority, which is return of capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","Marty Mosby \u2013 Vining Sparks","Thanks. Don, on the efficiency ratio, you broke out this time the adjustment for what you have in charges each quarter. You've kind of showed what was interesting is why it's been a downward trend. There's also been some seasonality with fourth quarter and typically second quarter is a little bit higher. But you broke that trend this quarter with, once you take the charge out, the actual efficiency ratio, operating wise, went down from first to second quarter.","It seems like expenses came in a little better than what I expected. I just was curious if there were a little bit more traction in the efficiency gains this quarter than what we've seen in the past?","Don Kimble","","We continue to move for additional efficiency gains and they could be lumpy at times as far as their benefit. I think you highlighted some key points there that despite the fact that we had some increases in our marketing costs lean quarter and some other items like that that our core efficiency ratio did show improvement. That's something we're striving for over the long haul.","Marty Mosby \u2013 Vining Sparks","Lastly, you mentioned just a statement you have that you said a couple of times that the incremental loan growth is of higher quality than your existing portfolio. I think that foreshadows better asset quality trends as we go forward, but why is it so much better than what you would've had in the past? What makes it different with what you're seeing in the market today than what you've been able to build over time?","Bill Hartmann","","Marty, this is Bill Hartmann. One of the things that we've seen is the focus that we have had in the last couple of years on our relationship strategy has really focused us on who we want to do business with. If you take a look at the portfolio that we had, we continue to see de-risking occurring in that portfolio. Part of that is driven by the improvement in the new business that's going in and part of it by the improvement in the existing portfolio.","Marty Mosby \u2013 Vining Sparks","Bill, would you think that would lower your targeted charge-off rate at some point, if that continues?","Bill Hartmann","","We know that right now it is changing, it is lowering our probability of default.","Marty Mosby \u2013 Vining Sparks","Right. Okay. Thank you","","Operator","","Thank you. We\u2019ll go to the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. ","Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","","Can you guys share with us how long it took when KeyCorp bought McDonald's and Company, how long it took to fully integrate it where you guys were comfortable that it was working very effectively?","Chris Gorman","Sure, Gerard. This is Chris Gorman. Just a little bit of history for the group.","McDonald was acquired by Key in 1998, and the businesses were really run independently until 2003 when we put about 17 businesses together to form our Corporate and Investment bank. Admittedly, Gerard, it took probably two or three years before we really started to get the rhythm of being very targeted, as Bill Hartmann just mentioned, in who we want to do business with. And really getting focused in our industry verticals, which as you know, is how we go to market and how we've been successful.","Clearly, anytime you acquire a group of people, and in this instance where acquiring 170 people that are very very good at what they do in technology, there's obviously integration challenges. I'm really pleased, though, in this instance this was not an auction by any stretch of the imagination. This is a negotiated deal that we've been working on since September of last year.","So A, we've done it before and B, we've been working on this particular transaction and how we\u2019re going to go to market, obviously, for the better part of a year now. That just gives you a little bit of history.","Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","","Thank you. Obviously, in this type of business the people part of it is extremely important, how do you expect to keep the key players at Pacific Crest with you? Second, when you look back to the McDonald deal, are there many people left from the original McDonald transaction that were key people back then that may or may not be here today?","Chris Gorman","","I will start with the first part and then I'll address the second part.","With respect to the first part, Gerard, we had a very specific list of people as we got to know the company that we thought it was imperative that we had their hearts and minds and that they believed in the shared vision going forward. In fact, each of those people, each and every one of those folks, have executed, as a condition of us entering into this agreement, a retention agreement, so that's a good start.","What really will drive this, though, is the notion of a shared vision. One, we know we can plug this industry vertical, i.e. technology, into our business, but the real opportunity, the real long-term opportunity, is what we call convergence. That is the way technology is now infused across all business and particularly the six industry verticals that we operate in. That's what I think people both here and at Pacific Crest are really excited about.","With respect to McDonald investments, as you know, we sold the retail piece and we sold that fairly early. With respect to the people that were on the banking platform, many of those people are still here today. I was obviously part of that, Randy Paine, who is going to be responsible for driving this integration, was on that platform, as was the Chief Operating Officer of the broker dealer, Doug Preiser. So, there are a lot of people, actually, in this building today that came over as part of the McDonald acquisition way back in 1998.","Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","","Great. Lastly, Don, do your results for the current quarter reflect the shared national accredited exam results? I know some of the lead banks out of New York were given their results, so do the reserves or the reclassification of any loans that may have occurred because of the shared national credit exam, are those reflected in your credit quality statistics this quarter?","Bill Hartmann","","This is Bill Hartman again. Yes, it does.","Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","","Thank you.","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) One moment for the next question. ","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. ","Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies","I was wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit more on the commercial lending environment? You'd had a couple of really strong quarters and then just looking at the commercial financial agricultural owning up $100 million this quarter. Understanding that you're being selective and that it's competitive out there, but can you give us a flavor for what you guys are seeing throughout your verticals in customer base? Is this at all really leaving some growth on the table, or is there some slowdown that we've seen recently that wouldn't have shown, necessarily, in the industry data versus what you guys are doing?","Chris Gorman,","","Ken, this is Chris. Let me take a pass at that, if I could. First of all, and I will speak just for the Corporate bank and then I'll turn it over to EJ Burke, who will give you some insight into what's going on in the Community bank.","From a Corporate bank perspective, we continue to see good loan growth. If you look year-over-year, we are up 14.5%. On a linked-quarter basis where up 4.3%. Candidly, we see the momentum continuing.","Now, because of our model, because were able to toggle between being a principal and being an agent, you will see fluctuations because we only put about 15% of the capital we raise on our balance sheet. We think, look, it's a challenging market out there in a variety of ways.","Is there pricing pressure? Yes, there's some. Is there some pressure on structure? There is.","What we're really finding is with our targeted approach, Ken, the deals that we're going after that we want to put on our balance sheet, we're putting on her balance sheet. The clients that we go after, and we don't really chase loans or any other product per se, what we really go after are clients. We're able to capture those clients. While it's always competitive and it's always a challenging environment, we feel pretty good about how the business looks going forward.","EJ Burke","","Ken, this is EJ Burke. I would say that our pipelines have been growing. In the second quarter we did see the same level of competition that we've seen throughout the year.","In our lower-end size client, we're competing against smaller community banks where it appears that there is a lot more competition around structure. Like Chris said, we're being selective. We're being very disciplined around our relationship strategy, and we're very comfortable with the pace of growth that we have in that business.","","Don Kimble","Ken, this is Don. I may have misspoken on the call, but our growth in CF&A lending at one quarter is $1 billion and year-over-year is $3 billion. So, I want to make sure that that growth rate is actually at a faster pace this quarter than what we've seen in the previous couple quarters.","Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies","Okay. I was just looking at the period end up 100% on page 23 on period-end basis.","Second question, Don, can you just also talk a little bit about where you guys stand now on LCR compliance? It didn't look like you really built much more on the security's book. Is that pretty much done, and do you have any anticipation that you'd have to either continue to expand your liquidity base through either sub debt or other non-deposit funding from here?","Don Kimble","","Ken, we're still waiting for the final rules to come through, but if they come through in the line with our expectations, most of our effort is really shifting the mix of that investment portfolio away from agencies to Ginnie Maes. As of the end of the second quarter, we had about 31% of our portfolio in Ginnie Maes. We'll continue to take the cash flows from the portfolio and reinvest it that way, and that will take us north of a third of our portfolio by the end of the year, in that category of which we believe should position us well for LCR compliance.","Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies","Okay. Very good. Thanks, Don.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go to the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian \u2013 Bank of America","","In terms of the actual impact for Pacific Crest for full-year 2015 in the income statement, could you give us a sense of what that could be?","","Don Kimble","Erika, this is Don. As we've mentioned before, it won't be a material acquisition from a pure P&L perspective. We would say that over the last 12 months revenues have been in the $80 million range. Just to give you a perspective of the size.","Erika Najarian \u2013 Bank of America","Got it. I will follow up off-line, thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. We\u2019ll go to the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. ","Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners","Good morning, guys. Yes. I think my first one is following on Ken's The difference between average loan growth at end of period was pretty considerable.","Was there any large payoff or large payoff, Don, that impacted that? Just because the end-of-period balances were much lower here. It certainly doesn't sound like there's anything that impacts your outlook for the full year but just am curious why there's such a big delta between the average and end of period this quarter?","Don Kimble","","Yes, Scott. As far as the impact, we had a couple of things that did impact the period-end balances. If you look at our exit portfolio, it was down $325 million, point to point, and that included the impact of the leveraged lease transaction that we mentioned before, which was over $100 million as far as the balances.","Chris also referenced earlier that we can see some timing differences from point to point as far as deals that would close and the use of our balance sheet versus access of other markets for our customers. That had an impact. As you also articulated that even with that change in the position that we still are reiterating, our outlook as far as mid single-digit growth year-over-year in loan growth.","Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners","Okay, perfect that make sense. I appreciate it. Just one kind of ticky-tack question. The tax rate was a little lower this quarter.","I know in the past when you have leveraged lease transactions they've had an impact on the tax rate. Did that do anything this quarter? Just the basic question is, was there anything in the tax rate and what would be your expectation for the remainder of the year?","Don Kimble","","Yes, the leveraged lease transaction did have an impact on the tax rate. On a normal basis, we would expect that rate to be in the 26% 28% range, so that clearly had a benefit this quarter.","Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners","Okay. That's perfect. Thanks a lot, Don.","Don Kimble","Thanks, Scott.","","Operator","","Thank you. We\u2019ll go to the line of Keith Murray with ISI. Please go ahead. ","Keith Murray \u2013 ISI Group","","Curious, given your exposure on the commercial bank side and how strong you are there, it doesn't make sense the strength that we've seen in C&I lending in what's continued to be a slow GDP backdrop and not a lot of CapEx. What do you see the clients building up the credit usage for? Just curious what you're seeing?","Chris Gorman","","Keith, it's Chris. To your point, we have not seen a lot of plant expansion. What we have seen is a lot of strategic discussions.","Business is a dynamic thing. If you look at \u2013 I think everyone was a little disappointed with the growth rates in the first quarter, in terms of GDP. But like we are doing with our announcement of Pacific Crest, many of our clients are looking to grow strategically.","If you look our M&A business, our fees are up, year over year, about 134%. I just looked at the deals that we had approved through our commitment committee. Those are up 29%.","So, you have a situation where people are sitting on a lot of cash. There's not a lot of growth to be had and so people are looking to grow strategically.","A couple other areas were think we\u2019re seeing a little bit of pickup. Yesterday, in talking to our leader in our leasing business, we're seeing a pickup in terms of medical equipment. During the Affordable Healthcare Act and some of the uncertainty around that, that actually went down a little bit. Now, we are seeing investment by large hospitals.","The other thing that I think we\u2019re seeing a little bit of is, for the first time in a long time, people are starting to see a little bit of inflation in some of the raw material inputs that they need to run their business. Of course, that encourages people, a little bit, to go out and get some inventory.","Beth Mooney","","Keith, one other area, while you asked on the loan side specifically, I know Chris has talked about, with our platform investment banking and debt placement fees being up, they are participating in those strategic discussions, and some of the benefit you see is coming through in that strong growth. Investment banking is in our M&A advisory book as well.","EJ, would you like to give some color on middle market?","EJ Burke","","Yes, Beth. Part of what Chris mentioned around strategic acquisitions, that can be a double-edged sword for us. We've seen some of our private companies be sold, which means that we get paid down.","Then alternatively, some of our other clients have been buying other companies, so that has definitely had an impact on our portfolio. I would say, though, in the second quarter, we did start to see some borrowing for expansion. First time in a while.","Keith Murray \u2013 ISI Group","","Thanks very much. (indiscernible) with the Hassle-Free checking account you guys came out with?","Don Kimble","","I'm sorry, Keith, you cut off there, because we did not hear the entire question. Could you repeat it, please?","Keith Murray \u2013 ISI Group","","I'm sorry. Just asking on the Hassle-Free checking account that you guys came out with, what's the philosophy behind that and the return profile you think about that over the long term?","Beth Mooney","","Keith, I'll go ahead and take that one.","Hassle-Free is a new account offering for us that we put into the market and supported, obviously, with our increased marketing spend, was to promote that launch as well as what is always our spring home equity borrowing season. It is designed for ease. It is designed for convenience. It is designed to help create utilization of lower-cost channels and alternative channels, such as online and mobile.","It has been met with good market receptance. We're only six weeks or so into the launch, but have had a meaningful increase in overall traffic, number of new accounts, and it is both an attractor of new clients. But it is also an opportunity, as we get them in, to profile and cross sell. I would tell you we are very encouraged by early results, and it is, like I said, still early days, but it has been a very positive market positioning and market reaction for us.","Keith Murray \u2013 ISI Group","","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go to the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Just a quick question on the leveraged lease termination, I think you mentioned it had a $2 million impact on NII and a little bit on NIM. Does that have any carryover impact in the third quarter given the timing of the termination?","Don Kimble","","This is Don. It really doesn't have much of an impact in the third quarter. Most of it was really just the gain realized this quarter and some slight impact future quarters, but not significant.","Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Okay. Thanks. Then, just one other question.","In terms of the RISO ratio, I hear what you're saying that charge-offs are going to remain below your normalized guidance, but when you think about the reserves at 1.46% right now, of loans. Where do you see that stabilizing? The questions also stems around some banks may be getting a little more pressure to stabilize the reserves as opposed to continue releasing. Are you at the point where you feel that you're at a stable level, or is there more downside to the reserve side \u2013 ratios?","Bill Hartmann","","Ken, this is Bill Hartmann. We spend a significant amount of time each quarter evaluating the portfolio and what we think the expected losses are out of that portfolio in establishing the appropriate reserve levels. As we close out each quarter, just like we did this quarter, we think that it's set at the appropriate level, but we'll continue to evaluate that going forward.","Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Understood. I understand how it's always at the appropriate level. My question is, when you envision, given the higher-quality loans that you're putting on, where that ends up being? Or more specifically are you seeing or hearing any pressure from the regulators or other sources that may want that not to decline from here?","Bill Hartmann","","The conversations that we have with the regulators are very similar to what I described. They're not telling us that we should increase or decrease. What they are making sure is that were intelligent in the way we go about evaluating the appropriate level of our reserves.","Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Alright. Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. We\u2019ll go to the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR. Please go ahead. ","Bob Ramsey \u2013 FBR & Co.","","Hey. Good morning. Just a couple quick questions on fee income. Obviously, a strong quarter for fee income and investment banking and principal investment income in particular. It sounds, from your commentary around investment banking, as if trends in that business are good. Is this is a good run rate for this quarter, or do you think you pull back a little bit to more like where you've been running?","Chris Gorman","","Bob, it's Chris. As you know well, in this business there'll always be a fair amount of fluctuation quarter-to-quarter. As you go back, historically, typically, we, for example, ramp up in the fourth quarter.","Rather than give any guidance on what should be a run rate, what I will share with you is, across the board, our pipelines are stronger today than they were one year ago. Obviously, when these deals hit, if they hit, obviously, there's a fair amount of variability.","Bob Ramsey \u2013 FBR & Co.","Okay. That's fair. The principal investment income, how should we think about that line?","Don Kimble","","Historically we've said that was a mid-teen type of number, but I'd say over the last four quarter, the average for that line item has been $22 million. Even though it was high this quarter, it was not that much higher than what we've been experienced over recent quarters.","Bob Ramsey \u2013 FBR & Co.","","Great. Then, the operating lease income line, I know you guys highlighted the $17 million termination gain this quarter. Is the right way to think about that line is take out that one-time gain and then that's in the ballpark or in the business is, assuming no further gains? I know you guys have had several recently.","Don Kimble","","Bob, on that line item we also had an additional $5 million negative adjustment to some lease residual values. So I don't think you'd want to pull out the entire $17 million based on that.","Bob Ramsey \u2013 FBR & Co.","Okay. That's good to know. Great. I think those are my questions, thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Please go ahead. ","Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research","","In your call, I've heard the competitive environment referenced more times than I have in some of the others. That's historically consistent with what we've seen in the Midwest in terms of competition. Would you just look back at the competitive environment in past cycles, is it better than, worse than, whatever, this time around?","Chris Gorman","","Nancy, it's Chris. Let me speak from a corporate banking side.","I certainly think that what we're seeing right now is consistent with where we are in the cycle. I don't think from either a structure or a pricing perspective we're seeing a lot of aberrations.","Specifically, as we go to market based on industry verticals, obviously, that spans geography and what we see is healthy competition. But as I mentioned, we find that with our targeted prospects and clients, we are able to garner new clients. We're able to win business, so we don't see it as particularly challenging vis-\u00e0-vis other cycles. The one thing I would say, and EJ Burke can probably comment more and Beth can comment more on this, I think as you get to smaller companies, I think the competitive dynamic is a little bit different.","Beth Mooney","","Nancy, I would just add that I think one thing that we've all talked about over the last year, and I know we've commented on our calls, that the competitive intensity in some way seems to intensify as you go down in size of asset and market company, because the field of competitors broadens out from community banks, regional banks, large banks, non-bank competitors. That is an area where we see, actually, a high competitive intensity.","You mentioned the Midwest. I would tell you it's not geographic per se. I think it is a function of how many competitors are in a market and there's just a broader set for the middle market in small business lending.","Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research","","If I could ask a part B to that question, it would be in the area of deposit competition. We haven't seen so much of that in this cycle, but as rates go up, what you anticipate? Is Hassle-Free checking one of the products that you're preparing for that era, or is there a different reason for that?","Don Kimble","","Nancy, you're right as far as the deposits have not been as much of an issue, that most banks have a lower loan-to-deposit ratio today than what they historically have had. It probably hasn't been that bigger as a pricing.","If you look at the last rate cycle of 2004 to 2006, the change in our deposit rates correlated about 55% of LIBOR. So, we did see a beta of about 55%. We would expect going forward it would probably be somewhere in that range.","And there are probably other components that we would expect to see, including some migration from some of the non-interest-bearing deposits into interest-bearing and probably some deployment of some of the excess funds that are being parked on balance sheets. Generally, we wouldn't think that would be a significant impact to our overall deposit position.","","Beth Mooney","","Nancy, I would just add that our mix of deposits has changed dramatically and to the better over the last couple of years where we have really brought in core relationship deposits of both our commercial and consumer businesses. As Don mentioned, some of those companies are carrying higher levels of liquidity that they may draw down some as the rate cycle changes, but I think they will forever hold more liquidity than they did in the past. Indeed, Hassle-Free is yet another product to bring in core transactional relationship consumer accounts, which further solidifies the quality mix of our deposits.","Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research","","Thank you.","Operator","","And we\u2019ll go to the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous. Please go ahead. ","Geoffrey Elliott \u2013 Autonomous","","On the diluted share count, that's increased over the quarter despite the buyback. Could you explain what was happening there, please?","Don Kimble","Sure. We have a convertible preferred security on our balance sheet. Once we hit an EPS level of $0.27 a share, the accounting rules change from taking your net income less the dividends to average shares to actually reflect that preferred as being converted. So, it actually has about 20 million shares to our base.","Then, you basically don't deduct the preferred dividend in your EPS calculation. No significant impact in overall EPS, but it does show a little bit different geography as far share count.","Geoffrey Elliott \u2013 Autonomous","","And the trigger is using that $0.27 of EPS?","Don Kimble","","That's correct.","Geoffrey Elliott \u2013 Autonomous","","Then just to follow up, there was the discontinued operations, the charge there, and then there was, I think, $6 million negative that dropped out in non controlling interest. On both of those could you explain what was happening in a bit more detail?","Don Kimble","","As far as the discontinued operations that this quarter we reassessed the valuation of the student loan securitization assets that we have on our balance sheet. What we essentially had as of the end of the first quarter was a net asset value of about $86 million.","With more recent information that we have seen as far as valuations on recent transactions, especially in the private student loan category, resulted in us taking an adjustment to that valuation. That's what you've seen come through the discontinued operations line item this quarter. As far as the non-controlling interest that there really wasn't anything of significance in that $6 million adjustment.","Geoffrey Elliott \u2013 Autonomous","","So, not something you've seen in the last few quarters but nothing in particular you can call out?","Don Kimble","","Nothing that would be worthy of calling out or saying that would be an expectation of continuing going forward, just a minor adjustments.","Geoffrey Elliott \u2013 Autonomous","","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll go to the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA Limited","","Hi. You said Pacific Crest had 12 month revenues of $80 million, so that would, base on the second quarter, boost your Investment banking capital market find by about 1\/5th?","Don Kimble","","Well, it would show through in a couple categories. It would be in the Investment banking debt placement. It would also come through the asset management and brokerage services. So it would also come through that trust and investment services income, which includes the brokerage revenue.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA Limited","Okay. Then, just to follow up before my main question, you said that the average credit rating that's coming in in new business is better than what you have on your books. I know you already had a question on that topic, but it just seems a little unusual.","I mean, new loans are that much better? Can you quantify the amount that they're better based on your internal risk categories or some other quantitative factor?","Bill Hartmann","","Mike, this is Bill Hartmann. If you take a look at the fact that we have a portfolio that over the last several years has been improving in quality. And you can see the metrics that flow through from quarter-to-quarter on things like nonperforming loan statistics, criticize classified statistics and the rest, and you've seen the reduction in the net charge-offs, you're seeing that improvement in the base portfolio.","The new business is based on our relationship strategy, and so we are out and bringing new business in that is one, with the better customers on our balance sheet already and we add additional business with those customers, or new customers to Key that are part of the targeted strategies that EJ and Chris have. So, that natural mix has been occurring.","The difference, the delta between those two statistics has been narrowing. Obviously, the portfolio that we have has been improving, and so the impact of the high-quality new business is not as great as it was a year ago.","Chris Gorman","","Mike, just one other thing on the mix. For example, in our real estate book, if you look back three years we would have a whole lot of construction and less REIT exposure, and what we've done is it's been a direct shift away from construction to REITs, for example in real estate. That would be an example of the mix shift part of that strategy.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA Limited","That's helpful and that's good in contrast to one other item I see in the slides. To tell you the truth, I thought it was a typo at first. You'll find that's my sarcastic way of saying, I cannot believe that your efficiency target is 60% to 65% 2 years to 3 years out. So that, if in 2017, you have a 65% expense-to-revenue ratio, that will be within the bounds that the Company is setting?","I know we've talked about this a lot, Beth, but this is the first time I've seen a 2- to 3-year outlook with an efficiency range like that. One question is has the Board approved that efficiency target that high, that far out? This is just \u2013 look, you know I've covered this Company for 20 years, but that is just abnormally complacent. I just can't believe it, as I look at that now.","I will say, I've talked to some people today and they've seen that also, and I just can't believe that target. Can you just help me out this, because you've done a very well for shareholders the past couple of years and as I asked a couple quarters ago, is this it? Have we seen the most aggressive gains? Your thoughts about that efficiency target?","Beth Mooney","","Yes, Mike, I will go ahead address that. We do have a slide in our deck that we have used at investor conferences and in this call trying to help frame the 2 year to 3 year path, which is how do we move within the range of 60% to 65%? It clearly shows that we are projecting that over the next several years we will come down to the low end of that range.","Additionally, as Don has mentioned a couple of times, it does not include the benefit of interest rates. So, that it is merely based on our attempts to grow our Company, appropriately manage expenses, do those investments that we believe are accretive to our platform in our business mix while offsetting normal cost pressures. We see ourselves coming down to the low end, and if you overlaid the forward interest rate curve, not speculating one way or another, but just the forward curve, it would show us going into the high 50%s.","We are very, as you know, we have talked about it, conscious of the things we need to do to both operate our business, grow our Company, as well as continue to become a more efficient and effective Company.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA Limited","Just one follow up. Just remind us maybe the three most important priorities that should improve the efficiency ratio regardless of whether or not we are happy with the target or not?","Don Kimble","","Mike, this is Don. I would say the three biggest areas for us is continue to get more productivity, and so we need to get more from our existing resources including greater sales activity. We've seen some notable improvements in those areas already, and so were on a good path.","I'd say continue to manage our expenses more efficiently. We're doing a lot of reviews of end-to-end type of process management and we think those will continue to have strong payback for us.","As we've talked about before, Mike, I would say some of the categories of expenses that will reflect those benefits would include the personnel line item as well as occupancy. We continue to manage that down as well.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA Limited","Okay. Did the Board approve that target being three years out?","Beth Mooney","","We always, when we do our reviews with the Board, do have a 2- to 3-year view of the business trends, so we have shared this with them in our strategic reviews.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA Limited","Alright. Thank you.","","Operator","","Thank you. We\u2019ll go to the line of Sameer Gokhale with Janney Capital. Please go ahead.","Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","","I had a question about hold sizes on loans. I'm assuming those haven't changed, but if you could just confirm whether or not your hold sizes, particularly in your commercial loans, have increased?","The other thing is, in addition to participating in Shared National Credits and in that program, are there any other type of balance sheet structures that you might contemplate using in order to go after bigger deal sizes and in offloading some of that loan exposure? If you could talk about that a little, that would be helpful? Thank you.","Bill Hartmann","","Sameer, hi, this is Bill Hartman.","On the first topic of the hold sizes on the loans, we have \u2013 if you saw any change in the hold size, it would be related to the quality of the companies. As the credit quality has improved, we have a scale like most banks do that says that for the better rated clients, you can hold more than for the lower or worse rated clients. We've seen improvement in the quality of the borrowers in our portfolio. On average, you probably saw some increase in the hold sizes in the loans that are related to that.","With regards to utilizing structures or trying to go into the market and acquire loans, just to build loans, that is actually inconsistent with the relationship strategy that we've been articulating for the last couple of years. We have a very disciplined approach to how and who we want to do business with. I know there are some banks out there that are looking at growing by just putting structures in place or dealing with other bank syndication desks, but that's not her strategy. That's inconsistent.","What is our strategy, though, it enables us to play bigger than we are, is to have the capability to distribute. We lead 70% of the syndicated finance deals that we're involved with. We can distribute paper to the private markets, to the public markets, in our real estate business. We have a very large agency business Fannie, Freddie, FHA, which is HUD. We can go to the life companies. We can go to the CMBS market. That, Sameer, is how we go to the marketplace, keep our risk profile at a moderate risk profile, but be able to serve our clients.","Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","","Okay. That's helpful detail. Then on a different note, one of the things I was just curious about is as you went through the CCAR process and initially were preparing for the CCAR, I was curious if you used external consultants to build your stress testing models and the like? The reason I asked this question is because it seems like some banks that may have gone through the CCAR for the first time may not have used external consultants.","What I'm getting at is, it seems like, at least from what I understand, that maybe regulators actually favor the use of third parties because then they have more confidence in those stress testing models. I'm curious if you agree with that view? If you actually did use third-party consultants while building your stress testing models and just to give your perspective on this issue?","Bill Hartmann","","This is Bill Hartman. We did not use third parties to the build our models. We have a significant amount of modeling capability in-house, both on the building of the models and the validation of the models.","Again, our history is a bit longer than some of the banks that are just coming into this now, so I think we've been at this between SCAMP and CCAR, now, about five years. Over that period of time we have, when it comes to building models and validating models, we have quite a bit of in-house capability.","Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","","Okay, thank you. I just actually had a last question. You did talk about commercial loan growth and discussed at length, but I was just curious on slide 7, you talked about your commitments growing with the utilization relatively stable. It seems like a lot of banks have been talking about utilization actually increasing.","So is that just the optics of utilization just because your commitments have grown so whether or not that utilization is stable, but on existing commitments are seeing increased draw downs on that. Is that the way to think about it?","Don Kimble","","I would say that, overall, our utilization rates are fairly stable, so it hasn't seen much movement as far as the overall aggregate utilization rate. We did see a slight pick up in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, but relatively stability here in the second quarter.","Operator","","And we\u2019ll now go to the next and final question, Jack Micenko with SIG. Please go ahead. ","Ming Zhao \u2013 SIG","","Hi. This is actually Ming on Jack's team. I just had a quick question.","Going back to the Pac Crest acquisition for a second, some of their officers are in Boston, San Fran, New York, so places where Key doesn't have much of a presence. Does this acquisition actually change your thinking on your footprint? Or, are you thinking about switching that up a little bit?","","Chris Gorman","This is Chris. Actually it doesn't change our thinking with respect to footprint because within these businesses we've always gone to market through industry verticals as opposed to geography. As it so happens, we are in most of the cities that they are in, which gives us an opportunity to work together.","Lastly, which I think is very fortuitous, Portland happens to be a very large base for Key. We like large bases because we think that teams of people learn from each other. And it just so happens they're headquartered in Portland and we think we can leverage that a bit, particularly through our Community bank.","Ming Zhao \u2013 SIG","Okay, great, Thanks.","","Operator","","We have no further questions in queue. I would now like to turn the call over to our speakers for closing remarks.","Beth Mooney","","Thank you, operator.

This call is being recorded.","At this time I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Beth Mooney, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead ma\u2019am.","Beth Mooney","Thank you operator. Good morning and welcome to KeyCorp\u2019s fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Joining me for today\u2019s presentation is Don Kimball, our Chief Financial Officer, and available for the Q&A portion of the call are Chris Gorman, President of our Corporate Bank; EJ Burke and Dennis Devine, Co-Presidents of our Community Bank; and Bill Hartmann, our Chief Risk Officer.","Slide two is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments, as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call.","I\u2019m now turning to slide three. I\u2019ll provide some overview comments on the fourth quarter of the year and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Don to discuss our financial results and our outlook for 2015. Fourth quarter was a strong finish to the year. As the conclusion of our third quarter, we indicated that our fourth quarter performance would better reflect the earnings power of our company. And I\u2019m pleased to report that in the fourth quarter our results improved significantly and we met or exceeded the guidance we provided. And as we communicated our results over the last two quarters were reflective of the variability in our business model especially in some of our fee income categories like investment banking and debt placement where we saw some activity move from the third quarter into the fourth quarter and as a result we finished the year with record performance.","We also generated positive operating leverage relative to both the third quarter and the year ago period. Earnings per share were up 8% from last year as we continue to grow organically by acquiring and expanding targeted relationships which provide the solid growth in both loans and deposits. Core expenses were well controlled as we\u2019re realizing the benefits of our initiatives and our continuous improvement efforts. Our cash efficiency ratio was down 300 basis points from the year ago quarter and it is a continued priority for us to identify additional efficiency and productivity opportunities as we go into 2015. ","Asset quality also improved over the years as we continue to originate good quality relationship business while staying disciplined with structure and consistent with our capital management priorities we repurchased $128 million of common stock from the fourth quarter. ","Slide four is a summary of our full year 2014 results. We delivered on our commitments to our shareholders by generating positive operating leverage and by remaining disciplined with both risk and our strong capital position. Average loans were up 5% from the prior year driven by strong growth in commercial, financial and agricultural loans of 11% which also help to create a record year in investment banking and debt placement fee. Expenses were well controlled down 2% from the prior year or 3% excluding the 2014 acquisition of Pacific Crest Securities and asset quality improved with net charge-offs of 20 basis points for the year which is well below our targeted range. During the year, we continue to invest in our businesses to accelerate growth. In addition to Pacific Crest, we added bankers across our franchise expanded our payment capabilities and enhanced technology in areas such as mobile, online and cyber security.","We also exited non-strategic asset that we\u2019re not consistent with our relationship strategy such as international leasing and we made a number of leadership changes to drive focus in execution including in our community bank. ","In 2014, we were able to reward shareholders by returning a peer-leading 82% of our net income through both dividends and share repurchases. Overall it was the strong finish to what was a good year for our company. We\u2019re well positioned with momentum and confident in our business model and our team and I\u2019m excited about the opportunities we have ahead.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Don to discuss the details of our fourth quarter results and our outlook for 2015. With that let me turn it over to Don. ","Don Kimball ","Thanks Beth. I\u2019m on slide six. This morning we reported net income in continuing operations of $0.28 per common share for the fourth quarter, this compared to $0.26 for the year ago quarter and $0.23 for the third quarter. I\u2019ll cover many of these items of this slide throughout my presentation so let\u2019s now turn to slide seven.","Average total loan growth continued in the fourth quarter with balances up $3 billion or 5% compared to year ago quarter and up $745 million from the third quarter. Our year-over-year growth was once again primarily driven by commercial, financial and agricultural loans and it was broad based across Key\u2019s business lending segments. Average commercial, financial, and agricultural loans were up $3 billion or 12% compared to the prior year and were up $732 million or 3% annualized in the third quarter. Importantly, we\u2019re remaining disciplined with our relationship focus as well as the quality and structure of our new business. ","Continuing on the slide 8, on the liability side of balance sheet average deposits were up $1.3 billion one year ago and up $1.4 billion from third quarter.","Deposit growth of 2% from both the prior year and prior quarter was largely driven by inflows from commercial clients as well as increases related to our commercial mortgage servicing business. And the cost of total deposits decreased to 15 basis points from 20 basis points one year ago reflecting our more favorable deposit mix. ","Turning to slide 9, taxable equivalent net interest income was $588 million for the fourth quarter compared to $589 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 and $581 million in the third quarter of this year.","Our net interest margin was 2.94%, which was down two basis points from prior quarter. The margin was impacted by higher levels of excess liquidity driven by commercial deposit growth and lower earning asset yields. Compared to the third quarter of this year, net interest income was up $7 million primarily due to asset growth, higher loan fees and lower funding cost. We expect to maintain our modest asset sensitivity and the duration and characteristics of key loan and investment portfolios continue to position us to realize more benefit from a rise and the shorter end of the yield curve.","Slide 10, shows the summary of non-interest income which accounts for 45% of our total revenue. Non-interest income in the fourth quarter was $490 million up 8% from the prior year and up 18% from the prior quarter, primarily due to strength in core business activity. We also benefited from recent investments like the acquisition of Pacific Crest in the addition of client facing FTE. As Beth mentioned, this was both a record quarter and a record year for investment banking and debt placement fees, which finishes the year with $126 million in the fourth quarter.","As we indicated on our third quarter call, there is variability in this business from quarter-to-quarter but we had a strong pipeline in September and that carried through to the fourth quarter. We also saw growth in many other fee based businesses including trust investment services and corporate services which had strength and derivatives in non-loan fees. Consistent with our comments last quarter we also saw a normal seasonal lift and corporate owned life insurance and a stronger quarter from principle investing gain.","Turning to slide 11, our non-interest expense for the fourth quarter was $704 million down $8 million from a year ago period and stable with the third quarter. Reported expense included $8 million in efficiency charges and $3 million pension settlement charge, combined these two items added approximately 100 basis points to our efficiency ratio. If you adjust for Pacific Crest, efficiency charges and pension settlement, our core expenses decreased to $676 million from $688 million in the year ago period.","This quarter our cash efficiency ratio was 64%, while this level reflects our hard work and improvement over the last few years, efficiency ratio remains an important measure for us and we expect to continue to make progress in 2015 from our level in 2014. We remain committed to continuing to generate cost savings through our continuous improvement efforts, which will enable us to make investments and offset normal expense growth.","Turning to slide 12, net charge-offs of $32 million or 22 basis points on average total loans in the fourth quarter which continues to be below our targeted range. At December 31, our reserve for loan losses represented 1.38% of period in loans and 190% coverage of our non-performing loans. Importantly, the quality of our new business volume has consistently been better than that of our existing portfolio. Turning to slide 13, our tangible common equity ratio and estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio both remain strong at December 31, at 9.88% and 11.18% respectively.","As Beth mentioned we repurchased $496 million in common shares in 2014 including 128 million or 9.7 million common shares in the fourth quarter. We have approximately 187 million of growth repurchase authorization remaining under our 2014 capital plan, which runs through March of this year. We submitted our 2015 capital plan with Federal Reserve earlier this month and plan on announcing our results in March following the Federal Reserve\u2019s release of their analysis and finding. ","Importantly, our capital plan reflects our commitment to remaining disciplined in managing our strong capital position. Our Tier 1 common ratio has remained above 11% while we\u2019ve paid out a peer-leading amount of capital to shareholders. ","Moving on to slide 14, as Beth mentioned on our third quarter call, we indicated the fourth quarter will be more reflective of our earnings power of the company and that we would meet our full year guidance. With our fourth quarter results we delivered on our commitment and achieved our previously communicated guidance.","In 2015, we expect to drive positive operating leverage and continue to improve our performance. Average loans should grow the mid-single digit range as we benefit from the strength in our commercial businesses. We anticipate net-interest income growth in the low to mid-single digital percentage range compared to 2014, this does include the benefit from higher rates as we are currently modeling short term rates to increase 50 basis points late in the year. Without the benefit of the higher rates, we would anticipate net-interest income to be up in the low single digit range.","Our net-interest margin should remain relatively stable and based on interest rates may increase later in the year. Non interest income is expected to be up in the mid-single digit percentage range for the year which would include the full year impact of Pacific Crest Securities. Keep in mind revenue activity tends to be seasoning lower in the first quarter compare to the fourth quarter and area such as investment banking and debt placement as well as seasoning lower and up corporate-owned life insurance. We also anticipate returning to a more normal run rate for principal investing gains.","Full year reported expenses should be relatively stable in 2014 which includes a full year of expenses related Pacific Crest offset by lower efficiency and pension charges. Credit quality should remain a good story with net charge-offs below our targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points. We also expect provision to approximately next net charge-off. And finally, we expect to continue to execute our share repurchase authorization consistent with our capital plans.","With that, I\u2019ll close and turn the call back over to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And with that we\u2019ll go to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O'Connor","Good to see the expenses come in where you thought, despite better fees. As we think about next year, we're seeing some other banks talk about upward pressure on expenses, and you're holding the line on the expenses while you're still expecting some revenue growth. So I guess the question is, the continuous improvement that you're doing, just elaborate a bit more on where some of the gross savings are coming from? And then, where some of the investment or offsets are?","Don Kimball","Great Matt and this is Don Kimball, and as far as we\u2019re receiving savings and in 2014 for example we consolidated 34 branches throughout our franchise a little bit more than 3% of the total branches which resulted in savings of just less than $9 million a year. Other things we did last year included reducing the headcount levels in our fixed income trading platform that was reduced by over 20%. We exited our international leasing operation. We finished a telecommunications network transformation which we had resolved of $20 million and run rate savings for the year. And more importantly what we\u2019re doing from a cultural perspective is focused on continuous improvement and that\u2019s for using tools like Lean Six Sigma which were kicked off in 2014 and we expect to see ongoing benefits for that in \u201915"," And so going forward, I\u2019d think we some of the things continue that we would expect to see branch consolidation from that 2% to 3% level and we\u2019ve also talked about other occupancy cost that we\u2019re reducing 15% of our non-branch ware footage, so a lot of corporate office space we have been reduced throughout the year. And again just focusing on that end-to-end profit management making sure the people are helping to drive ongoing improvements in our productivity and efficiency. ","As far ass some of the investments this last year we\u2019ve added over 25 new senior bankers within the corporate bank and I think you\u2019re seeing the benefit from that in our year-over-year growth and our investment banking and debt placement fees and so we\u2019re making investments there.","We\u2019re making other investments in products and services like payments. And like many other we\u2019ve been making investments in our risk management compliance and other modeling capabilities, over the last two years staffing for compliance and modeling is up over 50% and we expect to see that increase again going forward and so we\u2019re bearing those kind of cost that we expect to be able to achieve the kind of synergies and efficiencies from that focus on continuous improvement to help fund those cost going forward.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. Great. Thanks for all that color. And then just separately, on page 18 of your appendix, you've got a slide on oil and gas exposure, which is relatively modest to the size of the Company. But just any early signs of pressure there? Or maybe in areas that benefit from energy? And how are you monitoring that differently now, say, versus three months ago?","Beth Mooney","Yes, Matt, this is Beth. Given the attention on this topic, we did add slide 18 in the appendix and hope that will be helpful color and context for folks as they look at the quarter as well as our portfolio. And I would say the headlines are that it is a longstanding area where we have history and expertise and as you said it is a small portfolio for us it\u2019s only 2% of our outstanding. We are mainly in the EMP or upstream end of the market. We would say we have a quality client book. They\u2019re well reserved and well protected with minimal oil field services exposure. So it\u2019s a small portfolio, it is not a big concern to us and we will continue to monitor it. And I think the slide in the appendix has helped giving good understanding of what we see and we also mentioned in that slide that we have reflected it in our reserves and allow at the end of the fourth quarter given current prices and where we\u2019ll benefit is I think we\u2019re saying that, if certainly will be a boom to consumers their capacity to spend we\u2019re confident and on average while there will be some [stutter] steps in the economy I think this will be a net positive to have lower oil prices for our economy in 2015.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Steven Alexopoulos","Don, maybe to start and follow up in on your expense comments, when I look at the 2015 guidance, which is relatively stable versus what you guys promised and then ultimately delivered in 2014, which was a slight reduction in expenses, what's really the difference in 2015? Because it seems that you still have ample room to cut expenses, but you're not guiding that. You're going to follow through with that this year. So what's changed in 2014 versus 2015?","Don Kimball","The biggest impact there Steven is the full year impact of Pacific Crest so we do have increases there, but we\u2019ve also talked about making investments to grow revenues and we\u2019ve done that within the corporate bank this past year and we\u2019re looking for other areas to make those similar investments and we\u2019re focused on as driving positive operating leverage in addition to flat expenses where we\u2019re showing our guidance to reflect and expect the increase in both net interest income and fee income and we think that\u2019s a direct benefit from the investments we\u2019re making. ","Steven Alexopoulos","Don, what would be helpful to us, as we assess the progress you're making on the efficiency front, could you break out for us, what was the expense and revenue contribution from Pacific Crest in the most recent quarter? And what do you expect that incremental build on both of those to be in 2015?","Don Kimball ","What I would say on the slide on expenses we do breakout the Pacific Crest impact which is about $17 million for the quarter it was about a breakeven for us and so going forward we see more and more of the Pacific Crest operation being integrated with our overall capital markets and so it\u2019s going to be tougher to really single that out especially as we look at integrating some of the back office and operations activities. ","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. I know your timing to the same amount of loan growth for 2015 as you did last year, do you see double digit C&I growth sustainable in 2015?","Don Kimball ","What we\u2019re seeing is our commercial growth should still be strength for us, but we\u2019re seeing some growth in our retail bank for consumer lending but that\u2019s being offset by the exit portfolio wind down. So we could see other components of the commercial category also providing some growth for us, but I think in aggregate it all translates to mid-single-digit kind of growth expectation which is consistent with \u201814. ","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. And just a final question, the exposure you outlined in energy relatively small, we shouldn\u2019t expect any impact from that on your capital last for this year, is that correct?","Don Kimball ","That\u2019s correct.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Good morning. Don, I noticed that the period end balance sheet was significantly larger than the average for the fourth quarter. And it looks like there was a really nice surge in non-interest bearing deposits. So just wondering if you can flush out the sources of that deposit growth, if we're onto a meaningfully different trajectory for average earning assets? And what are some of the moving parts there?","Don Kimball ","Chris take care of the loan question and then I\u2019ll go ahead and fill in some background deposits, so Chris?","Chris Gorman","Sure, I\u2019d be happy to. Good morning Ken. Just to remind everybody our business model is one where a relatively small amount in case of 2014 about 19% of the $54.4 billion that we raised actually ended up and state on our balance sheet. So within any period and within any category there is just a lot of variability. So first of all that\u2019s one thing always keep in mind with respect to our business, as we think about our ability to grow the loan side of it we\u2019ve been pretty successful in taking share. We have 599 new clients in 2014 and we actually think that as we think about it Ken our model resonates with our targeted clients in prospect. So while it seems aggressive, we think we can continue to grow our loan portfolio, but we really do so not necessarily going after loans but really seeking clients that we think would fit into our business model.","Don Kimball ","And then as far as the deposit to period end we had some fairly large increases from some of our governmental customers we had at the end of the year which were short term in nature. So we do not expect that to be an indication of the start point for us for deposit growth that we would expect going forward there are long growth will exceed our deposit growth so that will help to drive greater efficiency on overall balance sheet.","Ken Usdin","Okay. And then my follow up, then, Don, also just on securities buildup and long-term debt funding, where you had done a lot of that pre-funding for LCR, and we've seen that in the securities book. Can you talk about where you are there? And how much issuance you might continue to do versus securities build?","Don Kimball ","Good question, and throughout the month of December we\u2019re in the mid-80s as far as our LCR ratio, keep in mind that we have to be at 90% level by the first quarter of \u201816 and we think that we continue to get there through some minor adjustments going for that we\u2019ve shifted our investment portfolio to about 42% being comprised -- securities which is very helpful and you see some cash flow going in that category which will allow us to over the next year continue to push that ratio up, nothing considered as part change going forward.","Ken Usdin","Okay. Just one little follow-up on that point. And do you expect that you'll run with a buffer to the trajectory? Or just once -- or just track to the 90, 100 of -- over time. ","Don Kimball ","Yes, we do believe that we\u2019ll have some buffer because you don\u2019t want to have any exposure for being under that number but I think buffer will be modest.","Operator","And next one is from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Please go ahead. ","Bill Carcache ","Thank you. Good morning. I had a follow-up question on deposits. Don, you mentioned that there was an impact from some governmental clients in the quarter. I believe that you guys had previously said that you were de-emphasizing municipal deposits, because you viewed them as punitive from an LCR perspective. Can you update us on how you're thinking about those deposits currently, in light of the most recent LCR revisions? And then how all that fits in with the growth that you saw from those governmental clients this quarter?","Don Kimball","As far as our focus on the collateralized government deposits, we have seen those balances come down in the fourth quarter and especially in some of the time deposit categories. We will continue to support our strong customers and those that have those relationships that have an expanded type of product relationship with us. But we will expect those collateralized municipal deposits to come down. The growth that we saw really was at the end of the calendar year, for a few days prior to the end of the calendar year and stayed with us for early part of January. And it was very temporary in nature as far as that buildup at the December 31st balance.","Bill Carcache ","Okay. So you're looking across the relationship and it sounds like -- so I guess along those lines, separately, can you elaborate on how you guys. How that Flynn influences your lending decisions and describe how that process has evolved over the last couple of years as we've kind of -- as competition has intensified.","Chris Gorman","Sure, Bill. This is Chris Gorman. First I'll talk about our public sector, public finance. Let me start more broadly. We have a requirement that we get to a 20% rate of return with our clients. Obviously, where a lot of debts is priced right now, it's required that we have a wholesome relationship in order to hit our return hurdles. Every single six months we sit down and we go account by cut on what the game plan is, what the returns are, what we have targeted, what we have achieved and so it's a very, very disciplined approach. Once the clients are actually on our platform. But I think even more importantly is the process that we use in terms of targeting our clients, figuring out who we can be relevant to. In our instance, we're looking for people in certain sectors that are middle market companies that we think need and value what we can provide which we think is differentiated. So as it relates for example to public sector, public finance, we are only focused on certain entities, certain agencies where we have a relationship that as Don mentioned is broader than just a deposit. Just as on the corporate side, we're focused on companies where the relationship is much broader than just a loan. What I'd like to do now is ask EJ to comment from a Community Bank perspective because they take a similar discipline.","EJ Burke","That's right, Chris. We approach our client targeting in a very consistent fashion with the Corporate Bank. I would say that in the Community Bank, we tend to compete against smaller banks and in that type of arena our broad product capability, especially in payments, has helped us to price competitively because we can look over -- we look at a three year time horizon to say what kind of revenue are we going to earn over that period of time and how many products can we add. And where the answer is positive, we can be very competitive. Where a client says I want to just use your balance sheet, but another bank is going to be my provider, we will move on to the next client.","Operator","And we go to Bob Ramsey with FBR, please go ahead.","Bob Ramsey ","A very strong quarter for investment banking fees and great to see the balance and fee income generally. Just wondering if you could talk a little about the investment banking pipeline heading into this next quarter and sort of what is incorporated in growth in 2015 versus 2014 and your total fee income guidance on the banking line.","Chris Gorman","This is Chris. I'll start and talk a little bit about the investment banking piece of it. When I look at it, I really kind of look at what are the fundamentals of the business over a period of time. And as I look at those, I think we've expanded our capabilities. We've expanded our sectors like technology, consumer. We just mentioned public sector. And I think the level of discussions and the strategic nature of the discussions that we're having are better than they've ever been. Having said that, obviously there is a great amount of volatility in when these fees actually come to fruition. I don't really think about it on a quarter to quarter basis but I do look at it over a period of time. And if you go back to 2010, we were at about a $200 million run rate. Now we're at about a $400 million run rate. If you look at our trailing 12 number currently it's about 13% greater than our trailing 12 number was a year ago. And I think we can continue that kind of a trajectory in this business, based on the people that Don mentioned we've been able to bring onto the platform and the clients we've been able to convert. So while I like our trajectory, I think the long-term trajectory will continue. There of course will be variations on a quarter to quarter basis. As it relates specifically to the pipeline, with the exception of one particular area, we are above where we were in our pipelines last year. So I feel good about our pipelines. But as always, first of all we have to execute and secondly we have to have the continued cooperation of these markets.","Bob Ramsey","Okay. Great. That's helpful. I guess also while I'm on fee income, corporate services seemed particularly strong this quarter. Just any commentary around what drove that line item? ","Don Kimball","We had some stronger derivative income along with some non-yield loan fees occur many we also had a slight reclass from other income up into corporate services this past quarter. And so all three of those contributed to the growth. ","Bob Ramsey ","Okay. That's helpful. And then I was just wondering, I know you sort of talked about how much you've got left in your existing CCAR capital plan. I just want to be clear, I guess it's your intent to fully complete that in the first quarter here before you guys reload.","Don Kimball ","That would be our intent to complete it. Because you use it or lose it. That would be our expectation.","Bob Ramsey ","And then sort of high level, I'm sure you don't want to be too precise, but thinking about capital plans for next year, you paid out 82% of earnings this year, your capital ratios are every bit as strong as they were a year ago and you all continue to sort of build capital. Would it be your hope to sort of return a little bit more than that in the coming year?","Beth Mooney","Bob, this is Beth. As we indicated, we have submitted our 2015 capital plan. I think we have always indicated that we believe we are well positioned both in terms of our capital base as well as the inherent risk in our businesses as well as our balance sheet. So we think we're well positioned for this CCAR cycle. We've been successful in the last several years to be a peer leading returner of capital and we look forward to being consistent and an advocate for our shareholders in that regard and being able to announce our results in March.","Operator","Our next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Good morning. I just had one follow-up question. Beth and Don, I really appreciate how you laid out your outlook and expectations for the year and I guess as a follow-up to Steve's question, is the message to us that even if -- even without the benefit of higher rates that key is targeting positive operating leverage for 2015?","Don Kimball","That's absolutely the case, yes, that we would expect revenues to grow not only in aggregate but both net interest income and fee income to grow and expense to be relatively stable, so we would show positive operating leverage in both scenarios.","Operator","And we'll go to Jared Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.","Jared Cassidy ","Question for you. You've given us the targets and you've met -- on slide 16 of the handout and clearly you've reached some of these targets. Can you paint us a scenario where you'll get your net interest margin to over 3.5% from the standpoint of an interest rate environment, what do you think you would need to see for that target to be reached or exceeded? I know higher rates, but if you could be a little more precise.","Don Kimball","A couple things. One is I think we'd have to see rates up at least 300 basis points from where they are today and continue to see our balance sheet become more efficient. We've talked about loan growth exceeding deposit growth and we think that's a component of us being able to achieve that 350 guidance.","Jared Cassidy ","And with the rates being 300, Don, would that also include a steepening or maintenance of the steepness in the current curve or is it more just the front end of the curve that you're focused on.","Don Kimball ","It would require some continuation of the steepness of the curve. We're most impacted from the three to five year end of the curve and shorter. So as long as we see the steepness thigh that, I think that would help drive that kind of an absolute increase in the overall net interest margin. ","Jared Cassidy ","And then coming back on capital, clearly you guys are very well if not over-capitalized by many measures. You've obviously focused on returning that to shareholders. Can you share with us your thoughts on acquisitions or mergers. Obviously there was a big one announced today. Do you guys consider that or is it more just let's return it to shareholders for the time being and not really focus on doing M&A? ","Beth Mooney","Gerard, this is Beth. I think as we've talked about, our capital relative to our business plans and strategies over the last couple of years, we have had a consistent hierarchy of how we see utilizing our capital and returning and deploying it. First and foremost, to support the organic growth of the Company which we feel our capital base clearly adequately supports. Second, includes dividends and share repurchases and then we said it's important to have capital available for strategic opportunities and in recent years we said obviously there's nothing in our business model we don't have that we need to be successful and you've seen us do some puts and takes in terms of adding businesses and exiting things that are nonstrategic. But we clearly have adequate capital to be opportunistic, should something present itself that makes sense for our Company, accretive to our shareholders and is additive to our business plan. It has been a relatively quiet acquisition era with more what I call one-off idiosyncratic type transactions. But in the coming years it's hard to predict what would transpire but I think what's more important is to know that we are committed to having the agility as well as the capital to do the right things by our shareholders.","Jared Cassidy ","And then finally on returning of capital, we recognize the regulators are not very supportive of banks giving back more than 100% of earnings just yet, but should that change possibly in the 2016 CCAR philosophically are you guys comfortable with if there aren't any other opportunities to use that capital of giving back more than you potentially could earn in 2016 especially in your Tier 1 common ratio stays at the levels it's at now","Don Kimball ","I think that would depend on a lot of things as far as what we're seeing from an economic environment, as far as what we're seeing for our organic growth. If we look back throughout 2014 we had an 82% return on earnings as far as our dividends and share buybacks and our capital ratios remained relatively flat. Just because the economy did not allow us to grow the balance sheet at a faster pace, so we were able to maintain our capital ratios. We believe our capital ratios are higher than where they need to be long-term. And so one way to get there might be higher distributions in the future but that's all speculative as far as what kind of a change would we see in the overall regulatory environment going forward.","Operator","Our next question is from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Matt Burnell","Good morning, everyone. Just a question on the level of pension and efficiency charges. I think those totaled on a combined basis about $80 million in 2014. I think in the past you've suggested that maybe a $30 million level for those combined expenses would be reasonable starting point for 2015. Just curious if you've had any changes in your thinking on that.","Don Kimball ","Generally in that range and depending upon -- you look at the pension settlement charges, those occur from two factors. One with rates being very low and also the high level of headcount reductions we've had throughout the year. Our headcount is down almost 1,000 people year-over-year. And so that is a direct impact of that as well. And so if that were to occur again next year, the $30 million to $50 million range wouldn't be bad and that's contemplated as part of our guidance.","Matt Burnell ","Okay. Thank you. And then just finally from me, on page 26 it looks like you saw some higher non-performing loan balances, specifically in commercial, but also in home equity. Is there anything to read into that or is that just given that we're at such low levels, we're going to begin to see volatility in those numbers, not just p consistent declines.","Bill Hartmann","Matt, hi, this is Bill Hartman. You're absolutely right. The numbers are low and any movement is almost expected at this point where things will just bump around, go up a little, down a little. We're sort of into three quarters of fairly stable performance right now with the rate of improvement not as great anymore. Your observation is correct.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Mike Mayo","Hi. Looking at efficiency, it seems like a bad news\/good news store. I'd love some more color. In my bad news list, first, it seems like you might have missed your old efficiency target. On page 14 of the release it says you had a 66% cash efficiency ratio for 2014 and your prior target I thought was 60% to 65%. Second, your long-term target implies by 2017 you'll get to an efficiency ratio that would still be 200 basis points worse than where it was almost a quarter of a century ago when you first had the merger. Third, it seems like you have some of the savings already, like the fixed income headcount reduction's done and you've already exited some businesses. That's my bad news column. My good news column is 64% efficiency over in the fourth quarter. Not clear how sustainable it is. That's an improvement. You do have s some things left. Branches 2% to 3% reduction per year. How many more years and what do you have left in Six Sigma. Third, the investment bank seems to be an extra lever. It's interesting. Seems like your smaller investment bank is having better results than a lot of the large investment or the largest investment banks out there. So Beth and Don can you help reconcile my kind of bad news\/good news thoughts when it comes to efficiency.","Don Kimball ","Mike, you get the prize for the longest question of the day. We'll give it a shot and try to be direct here. So as far as our full year 66% efficiency ratio, you're right, it's higher than our previous near term guidance range of 60% to 65%. I'd say that going into 2014 we saw that revenues were going to be weaker than what we had expected so we took additional steps to accelerate some of the cost savings. That resulted in restructuring\/pension charges of $80 million which were $50 million higher than our plan and so absent those, that increase, we would have been within that range despite the fact that revenues were flat. And so that was clearly an issue for us from that perspective. Good news, you're right, current quarter is 64%. It was benefited by the strength in the revenues and also our continued discipline as far as managing those costs. And we are very focused on driving those. As far as the branch rationalization that we do believe that we have a period of time here where we will have the ability to reduce 2% to 3% of the branches for a few years, just the way that our customers are using those branches, that they have a different definition and becoming more of a sales office than they are just a service center. And so we think that is an opportunity for us and the past year we were able to save run rate a little less than $9 million a year from that type of consolidation effort. We had also talked about the occupancy cost in other areas. Our non-branch related space. And we've been reshuffling a lot of that space. Benefit he especially later in 2015 because that's when we'll see the benefit of those lease terminations come through. And we expect to see a 15% reduction in our non-branch space over the next year and-a-half. And that will translate to about a $12 million a year run rate savings for us. As far as Lean Six Sigma and our continuous improvement focus, I'd say that we're early stages there, that we really have just started to kick off those programs and we're getting more and more traction, that the benefit that we're projecting from that in 2015 is stronger than what we had in 2014. And we think that will continue to gain hold and become more engrained as part of the culture and will help drive that going forward for us.","Mike Mayo","Okay. One follow-up then. The specific follow-up, the 15% reduction in occupancy, you guys said it was 17% when Beth presented in. Was that a lower number or did you receive some of those savings. As it relates to Lean Six Sigma can you quantify any aspect of that or is that kind of culture. My big picture question for Beth. We've been down this road before. Again, just comparing the efficiency ratio of some of your peers, not to mention the 1994 level versus where you are today, and I understand you're changing the culture and you've made strides but is there something a little bit more structural would you consider more business exit. Thanks.","Don Kimball ","As far as the occupancy for the non-branch space, it's reflective of the changes we've already made. We have not reduced our projection as far as the savings there. It's just what we have left out of that 16% or 17% that we would have shared in September. Then as far as Lean Six Sigma, I would say that the economic benefit from those Lean Six Sigma he reviews that we implemented in 2014 was $25 million. Our projection for 2015 is $40 million for those efforts. And that's not all the cost savings. It's just for those specific initiatives that are tied to that use of the Lean Six Sigma tool.","Beth Mooney","Mike, this is Beth. And to the second part of your question, we have made progress in 2014 and we are committed to continuing that progress in our efficiency goals and our productivity in 2015. This was a year and you have seen across the industry a number of people have noted that progress was difficult in this continued low interest rate environment as well as slow economic growth. So we did as Don indicated make some decisions early in the year that brought through some higher restructuring charges to make sure we continue to do the things that keep us on the path to be sub-60, which is our commitment. We are on that path. We are committed to it. And as I look at us relative to peers, each and every institution has their own unique business model and there are attributes of ours that are different from some of our peers and specifically we have talked about being predominantly a commercial bank with a distinctive Corporate Bank model which as you indicated has indicated significantly to our performance in the form of investment banking and debt placement fees and is a lever. Our trailing 12 on that business is right at $400 million now. So as we look at it positive operating leverage is something we've been talking about for well over a year, in addition to efficiency, as something that is driving our performance and as we have the Corporate Bank is a big contributor, it is not a low efficiency business but it has certainly been an outperformer both in absolute performance as well as relative performance this year and as we look into the future. And we do not have as large a payment business or some of the high yielding consumer assets. When I look at the mix of our business, I think what's important is our focus on the operating leverage, focus on our path and our commitments that we're making and continuing to deliver on those.","Operator","And we\u2019ve question from Richard Bove with Rafferty Capital Markets, please go ahead.","Richard Bove","I've been looking at page 19 I guess of your press release and it indicates that funds available for shareholders actually went down by 1% in 2014 versus 2013. And trying to relate that to the stock price, which was up about 3.6% in 2014 or well below the improvement in the market and even with the rally going on in the stock right now, if you take a look at the stock price from let's say January 1st of 2013 to the present, it's down about 4% in a market which has been relatively robust. So I guess the question is have you done any studies at all which indicate what the impact of repurchasing $128 million worth of stock has on the stock price? In other words, do you have any rational which shows that by buying back stock it has a positive impact on the stock price? ","Don Kimball","I'll go ahead and take the first crack. This is Don. As far as the comment as far as the net income available for key, the line that you're looking at that includes our discontinued operations and in 2013 we had a gain on the sale of our victory capital. And in 2014, we had a loss from the sale of our residual interest in our student loan trust. And so if you look at just the net income available from continuing operations, we're up 8% year-over-year and so I think that's showing the strength in the overall performance for that line item. As far as the share buyback program that we do believe that it is additive or beneficial to our existing shareholders. We are constrained as far as what we can do to help manage our capital position based on how the current rules work in this environment and so we believe that it is helpful. Keep in mind that at $128 million in the current quarter, it really doesn't move the dial a lot as far as the market activity and flows for our stock. So it's helpful but I don't think it's a meaningful addition from that perspective.","Beth Mooney","And I would just add that I appreciate the perspective on the stock performance because obviously it is among our goals to deliver top performance to our shareholders in terms of returns, both through our performance as well as our capital actions. And if you look at us on a three year TSR, we are among the highest performers in the index and really driven in 2013 where we led the peer index in the group in that regard. Many times following a record breakout year, you tend to migrate back to more of the middle of the pack, which we did in 2014. But again, when we look and I think shareholder return needs to be viewed kind of in multiyear windows, extremely strong performance both retroactively on a three year basis. We felt like 2014 was solid and as we said as we go into this year, with positive momentum and confidence tore what we will continue to do in terms of our ability to build value for our shareholders.","Richard Bove","I understand that basically there's a massive demand upon all managements in this industry to buy back shares. What I don't understand is in virtually no case where there's been huge buybacks of shares has there been outperformance of the stocks vis-a-vis the market. And I'm guessing that the reason why managements are buying back stock is not because they studied the impact of the buybacks on stock prices, but because their investors are saying we want you to buy back stock. And therefore, I'd really be interested if you have a really have studied, is there a relationship between buying back stock and an increase in the price of the shares? Because clearly with all these banks selling at premiums to book value, buying back stock is not what it used to be.","Unidentified Company Representative","Well, I would just like to add there that we do continuously look at whether or not we should be using the capital and the earnings to buy back shares. We do believe that it still is an attractive price for us to buy back, that we are generating earnings that exceed the need from a capital perspective to support our business organically. And so we feel it's most appropriate for us to return that to our shareholders. And based on how the current rules are structured, that we are limited as to the form that that distribution can occur. And so again, we feel that it's appropriate for us to continue to buy back shares and feel that it's an appropriate price for us to continue to use the earnings to do so.","Operator","And we have a question from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.","Marty Mosby","Thank you. I wanted to focus on we've seen the invest banking kicking in a lot of the super-regional banks. What is the tailwind or competitively how's the landscape shifting to be able to allow for you all to take advantage of what really seems to be a very strong trend?","Beth Mooney","Marty, I will let Chris Gorman augment the answer. I do think it is important to note that we have a very distinctive Corporate Bank model and it's something that we have built over years to be a very sophisticated platform and I think as we look at 2014, had record performance and relative outperformance versus a regional peer group. I'll let Chris talk a little about what some of what the drivers are of what we think is a very distinctive part of our business model.","Chris Gorman","Sure, Beth. Marty, the way we see it is there's -- although there's 7,000 banks in the United States, there's probably 18 or so kind of globally that have the capability to complete sort of integrated corporate and investment banking type work. Most, the pre come fence predominance of those banks are focused on very large companies. We are focused on mid-cap, middle market. You have many boutiques who have very good at what they do. Clearly don't have the capabilities that we do. So the opportunity for us is first and foremost, focus and we focus on certain industries and specifically on the middle market. We think actually focus propels growth. The second thing that we think we have a huge advantage is our size. And when I say size, I mean sizes and small. Our entire Corporate Bank only has 2,000 people in it so it's pretty easy for us to ma maneuver and to get things done on behalf of our clients. The other thing I would say that really as we think about some of these step functions, I think the stability of our platform over a period of time is both attractive to the people that we bring on to the platform and I think it's attractive to our clients and prospects. So that's the sort of the opportunity that we see out there.","Marty Mosby","And Beth, what I also wanted to kind of focus on was your investing in payments or cash management. That's an area where you've been kind of behind the curve. Can you see you replicating the success there as you have developed investment banking platform that we just talked about?","Unidentified Company Representative ","Marty, we do have our commercial payments business embedded within our Corporate Bank to align is very much to the strategies and how our targeted clients, we can matter to them, meet their needs. So we have done a variety of things as we've invested to align our commercial payments capabilities with some of our targeted industry groups. We have developed new product capabilities that we have deployed in purchase and prepaid. And again, that fits well with some of our targeted verticals. So within that, we are making sure we have a core competitive offering and then we're also using the strength of our Corporate Bank model and our Community Bank model to make sure that we find unique niches of growth and opportunity where we can be relevant and have the opportunity to get returns and growth for it.","Marty Mosby","Thanks. Just lastly, principal investing, is that an outgrowth from having more connection with these middle market and investment banking and other types of avenues or is that something else? What are kind of the sources? Does that tie to your core business? ","Don Kimball ","Marty, this is Don. This is a piece of the business that we've had for a number of years. It really isn't linked at the hip with our capital markets activity. It's just an investment strategy that existed years ago and we've been benefiting from that. It's more of a wind down mode for us now and we think over the next 10 years that that will continue to. ","Marty Mosby","Thanks.","Operator","And we have a question from Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Please go ahead.","Nancy Bush ","Good morning. I just got off the BB & T conference call. They were of course touting the Susquehanna acquisition and the fact they will again entry into Cincinnati and I think their plans are to expand further into the Midwest. Can you speak to the competitive conditions there and where we stand in terms of pricing and structure. We're hearing a lot of horror stories earlier in 2014 and if you can just tell us how we ended out the year.","Beth Mooney","Nancy, this is Beth. I will tell you that I think this has been a year where in virtually every conference call, I think every bank has talked about the competitive intensity in the market, particularly in the loan generation area. So I would tell you nationally we see a lot of intensity. It is true that historically the Midwest has been outsized in its competitive intensity, given the number of competitors that are here. We find that we compete well across all those different markets. And as we look into 2014, I think it will be, continue to be highly competitive on pricing, on struck structure, on product offerings and I think we have done over the last couple years, if you hear us talk, trying to sharpen our focus about where we can matter, up our execution and our ability to reach targeted clients and bring the full relationship offerings of our bank and translate those into meaningful gains in acquisition and expansion of client relationships. And we feel like we have several years of performance in that regard and as we said, we have confidence, we look forward that that's a strategy that fits our bank and our markets.","Nancy Bush ","Okay. And another question for you and\/or Don. I mean, liquidity, you only in recent years have you become what I would call a very liquid organization. Obviously hanging onto core deposits is a big goal for you. As we get closer to the interest rate increase time and I'm hoping we are getting closer, how are you -- what kind of conversations are you having with your retail clients and what kind of product planning are you doing to make sure that when liquidity starts to lessen, that you hang onto the deposit base that you've got? And grow it, hopefully.","Beth Mooney","Nancy, this is Beth. I believe this would be a nice opportunity for Dennis Devine of the Co-President of our Community Bank to talk a little about the value proposition and how we are making sure that the core funding, which we also by the way agree that we hope interest rates are very close to going up, but as rates potentially move that our core funding and our deposit mix as well as our client base there has really changed substantially over the last couple years and puts us in a very different position.","Dennis Devine","Thank, Beth. Thanks for the question, Nancy. You see in the balance sheet the continuing decline of time deposits. So the CD book has really begun to roll over the years. But a commensurate offset with the growth in the our core liquid deposits, transactional deposits as well as money market deposits within the. Commercial deposits we talked about earlier. The strategy of the retail organization is organized around client growth. You've seen new products introduced this year to accomplish just that. We have a relationship based strategy. So when you look at the yields that we're currently offering within the non-time book today you see we continue to manage that. Really thoughtfully around those client relationships and certainly as rates begin to -- as interest rates grow they the market, we've got a core relationship book that we'll be working with. As we assess what the yield on those deposits will continue to look like. So you'll see us grow clients. You'll see us really thoughtfully manage the current book. And it will be a sense of what. Holistically across key but certainly very deliberate understanding of what does that look like in the money market book relative to what does that look like against each one of the transactional deposits that we have within our business. We're in a strong position given the decline that you've seen in timed deposits and a strong relationship based liquid book within our Community Bank. ","Nancy Bush ","Do you feel that you'll have to perhaps give more of the rate rises to clients and to customers and more quickly than you have in the past? People have been complaining and I'm sure you're aware of low rates for a very long time and my sense is that they're going to be more sensitive when they begin to hear the news that rates have begun to rise.","Unidentified Company Representative ","It's an unprecedented rate environment. We clearly will manage that closely going forward. We've got some good experience here and we expect that given the relationship nature of our clients, that we'll be able to manage that very well. And we don't have rate shoppers today.","Operator","And with no further question I\u2019ll turn it back to you Ms. Mooney for any closing comments.","Beth Mooney","Again, we thank you for taking time from your schedule to participate in our call today. If you have any follow-up questions, you can direct them to your Investor Relations team at 216-689-4221, and that concludes our remarks. Please have a good rest of the day.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ms. Beth Mooney. Ms. Mooney, please go ahead, ma'am.","Beth E. Mooney","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to KeyCorp's Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me for today's presentation is Jeff Weeden, our Chief Financial Officer; and available for the Q&A portion of the call are the leaders of Key Corporate Bank and Key Community Bank, Chris Gorman and Bill Koehler; and also joining us for the Q&A discussion are our Chief Risk Officer, Bill Hartmann; and our Treasurer, Joe Vayda.","Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments, as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call today.","On Slide 3 are some highlights of our 2012 results. Again, I'd like to make some general comments about the year more broadly. I'm very pleased with the measurable progress we made during the year on our strategic and financial goals. Although the operating environment remains challenging, our results reflect our success in executing on our strategies and further refining our relationship-based model.","Some of our key proof points would include revenue, which was up 4% from the prior year as loans grew, net interest margin improved and fees increased. Our average C&I loans were up 21% over last year and led our year-over-year loan growth. Our net interest margin improved in 2012, including a 24 basis point increase in the fourth quarter from the same period a year ago. And I would point out that our margin improvement and C&I loan growth were among the best in our peer group.","These were also a positive story. Our commercial real estate mortgage banking group had its best year ever, and it was also a record year for KeyBanc Capital Markets, with strong fee growth from loan syndications, investment banking and debt placement.","On the expense side, we achieved $60 million in annualized savings in 2012, a strong start to our expense initiative, which exceeded our original goal we had set for the year. With that momentum, we are on track to realize cost savings of $150 million to $200 million on a run rate basis by year-end 2013. I remain committed, along with the rest of my management team, to achieving our targeted efficiency ratio of 60% to 65% by 2014.","Expense levels for 2012 reflect our acquisitions as well as upfront cost for our efficiency initiative and for technology, including a new trust and risk management system, along with the development of new payment and merchant processing capabilities. We closed 19 underperforming branches last year as part of a plan to rationalize our branch network. Another 40 to 50 branches are targeted for 2013. We also launched programs aimed at streamlining our backroom and support operations so we can achieve a more variable and efficient cost space.","Our capital management remains focused on value creation. To that end, in 2012, we returned approximately 50% of our net income to shareholders through both common share repurchases and dividends. We also used our capital to acquire market share in Western New York and to develop new revenue streams in the credit card and payments businesses.","Turning now to Slide 4. In 2013, our strategic themes remained the same. In the coming year, we are focused on 5 critical areas, consistent with the long-term growth priorities shown on Page 14 of our deck. Specifically, we will continue to leverage our focus and expertise in our targeted client segments to acquire and expand customer relationships. This is most apparent in our middle market and corporate bank, where our mix of distinctive product capabilities with local delivery has us well positioned to take advantage of the business and economic recovery.","Next, we will maintain a moderate risk profile. We have substantially improved our credit quality over the past several years by adhering to a robust set of enterprise-wide risk practices. Jeff will have more on credit quality in his comments.","Third, we will invest in opportunities to accelerate our revenue growth. In practical terms, this means finding ways to leverage our franchise as we did in 2012 when we deepened our retail footprint in Western New York, enhanced our payments capabilities with credit card and merchant services and invested in online and mobile banking. And just a quick comment on that point. We've been asked about the net impact of our efficiency initiative in the amount of reinvestment of those savings we expect. What I can commit to you is that we are rigorous on our investment decisions, being mindful of the size, timing, resources and prioritizations that they will take. And we will make the right trade-offs to ensure we deliver on our efficiency ratio commitments.","However, when we see the opportunity to make an investment that is consistent with or additive to our strategy and it has the right return profile, we will make that investment. There's an old saying that you can't shrink yourself to prosperity, and we must continue to find ways to generate more customers and more revenues. We are committed to doing that and doing that in the way that delivers profitable growth.","Fourth, we will improve our operating leverage by growing revenue and creating a more efficient cost structure that is aligned with the current operating environment. As I just said, this is a two-sided equation. We need to be focused and rigorous in both our revenues and our expenses.","And finally, we will work closely with our board and our regulators to manage capital to support our client's needs and create shareholder value. Our capital remains a competitive advantage for us in both the intermediate and long term.","We continue to imbue the environment for our industry in 2013 as challenging. Nonetheless, I'm encouraged by the fact that our employees have never been more focused on delivering outcomes for clients, and that in turn is giving us real traction in our market. Customers are coming to us and staying with us because we are executing on our strategy and delivering a truly distinctive experience.","We had a strong 2012, and one that I am very proud of. But it's not enough, and we all know that. Along with my team and all of the employees at Key, we are focused on sustaining our positive momentum and continuing to drive our performance in 2013 and beyond. I'm confident that our strategies are working, and that we are on the right path forward.","Now let me turn the call over to Jeff with some further comments on our results. Jeff?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Thank you, Beth. Slide 6 provides a summary of the company's fourth quarter 2012 results from continuing operations. As we reported this morning, the company earned a net profit from continuing operations of $0.21 per common share for the fourth quarter compared to $0.23 for the third quarter of 2012 and $0.21 for the fourth quarter of 2011. There are a couple of items I will touch on before moving to the more detailed discussion surrounding the quarterly results on the following slides that impact the current quarter.","First, the net interest margin expanded to 3.37%, an increase from both the third quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2011. Second, we incurred cost of $16 million or approximately $0.01 per common share associated with our Fit for Growth efficiency initiative. Third, credit costs decreased to $58 million or 44 basis points of average total loans. And fourth, we had strong revenue results from our commercial businesses in both investment banking and mortgage banking.","Now turning to Slide 7. Average total loans for the fourth quarter were up $1,164,000,000 or 2.3% unannualized compared to the third quarter of 2012. And compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, average total loans were up $3.2 billion or 6.6%. We have continued to have success in growing our commercial loan portfolio from both acquiring new clients as well as expanding existing relationships in our focused industries as demonstrated by the approximate $3.8 billion or 21% increase in C&I loans over the past year. On the consumer front, average loans grew by $312 million, aided by the increase in credit card balances, which were up $282 million from the prior quarter, reflecting the full quarterly impact of the acquired balances from the third quarter 2012 acquisitions.","As we look out at 2013, we anticipate average total loans to grow in the mid- to upper single-digit area, continuing to be led by growth in our commercial and industrial loans as we capitalize on our success in our targeted approach to certain industries where we offer a full complement of products, services and advice to clients.","Continuing to Slide 8. On the liability side of the balance sheet, average deposits, excluding foreign branch deposits, grew $1.1 billion from the third quarter. And our trend of improving deposit mix continued with an increase in average balances of non-time deposits of approximately $1.9 billion or 3.6% unannualized. And our finding cost continued to decline, contributing to our stronger net interest margin experienced in the fourth quarter.","Turning to Slide 9. For the fourth quarter of 2012, the company's net interest margin expanded to 3.37% compared to 3.23% for the third quarter of 2012 and 3.13% for the fourth quarter of 2011. Taxable equivalent, net interest income was $607 million for the fourth quarter, up 5% from the $578 million we reported in the third quarter. The improvement was a result of a 10 basis point decline in funding costs for interest-bearing liabilities and a 7 basis point improvement in earning asset yields.","Recall from last quarter, we had 2 leverage leases terminate during the third quarter, which negatively impacted net interest income and the margin by $13 million and 7 basis points. Aiding the fourth quarter margin were stronger fees and an additional dividend on other investments. These 2 items benefited the margin by approximately 4 basis points.","Our current expectation, assuming a policy of low interest rates by the Federal Reserve continues, is for the net interest margin to trend lower from the fourth quarter level throughout 2013. For the first quarter of 2013, we anticipate the margin to be in the range of 3.30% and for continued modest pressure in the 1 basis point to 3 basis point area per quarter throughout the year. With respect to average earning assets, we expect to see growth tracking in line with our overall loan growth and would not anticipate any material change in the size of our investment securities portfolio. We remain approximately 1% asset sensitive at December 31, 2012, to a gradual 200 basis point rise in interest rates, with the forward view that asset sensitivity will increase during the next 12 months given normal funds flows, positioning us to benefit if short-term to intermediate-term rates begin to rise.","On the noninterest income front, we saw continued solid performance from investment banking and net gains on loan sales driven by higher origination volume from commercial mortgage banking in our Real Estate Capital line of business. As Chris Gorman and Bill Koehler can comment on later on, our pipelines remain good headed into the first quarter. In total, noninterest income was down in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter due to gains realized from the early termination of certain leverage leases and from the redemption of trust preferred securities during the third quarter in the amounts of $39 million and $54 million, respectively.","Turning to Slide 10. Noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2012 increased to $756 million, up $22 million from the third quarter. All of these increase was in the personnel area and relates to higher employee benefits, up $11 million; increased severance, up $5 million; and higher contract labor for implementing new technology projects currently underway, up $8 million. In total, these 3 items were up $24 million in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of 2012. The increase in employee benefits was due to higher medical claims and an accrual for the annual employee retirement contribution.","We expect employee benefit cost to decrease in the first quarter from the elevated fourth quarter level, more than offsetting the normal seasonal increase that we typically experience from higher employment taxes. Severance and other costs associated with our Fit for Growth efficiency initiative are expected to remain elevated throughout much of 2013. And technology related costs are expected to remain at the level we experienced in the fourth quarter through the first half of 2013 before starting to decline as we implement new systems for trust accounting, risk management information systems, Treasury management and card services.","Also included in our expense run rate for the fourth quarter was approximately $30 million in cost related to our acquisition of branches in Western New York and our credit card portfolio. These costs were up approximately $4 million from the third quarter and of this increase, approximately $3 million represented additional intangible amortization expense. As Beth commented on earlier, we remain committed to achieving our targeted efficiency ratio of 60% to 65% through planned cost reductions by 2014.","Turning to Slide 11. Our net charge-offs declined to $58 million or 44 basis points during the fourth quarter, down from the elevated level of the third quarter when we implemented new regulatory guidance for consumer loan Chapter 7 bankruptcies. The provision for loan losses in the fourth quarter was $57 million. Both net charge-offs and the provision expense were within our long-term targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points for the fourth quarter. And for the entire year, provision expense represented approximately 45 basis points of average total loans. Our expectation for charge-offs and provision expense during 2013 is to remain within our long-term targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points. Also at December 31, 2012, our reserve for loan losses represented 1.68% of period-end loans and 132% coverage of nonperforming loans.","And turning to Slide 12. Our tangible common equity ratio and estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio remained strong at December 31, 2012, at 10.2% and 11.2%, respectively. We have also updated our estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio based on the Feds NPR on a fully implemented basis at December 31, 2012, to be 10.2%.","During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 10.5 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $8.37 per share, and we have $88 million remaining authority under our current repurchase authorization for the first quarter of 2013. We also filed our updated CCAR capital plan with the regulators on January 7 of this year and expect to hear back on those findings from the submission at the same time as the rest of the industry during the month of March.","That concludes our remarks, and now I'll turn the call back over to the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A segment of our call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Let's begin with Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","My question is on the expenses. X the severance charges, core expenses are running around $740 million. And if I look at your comments, that $60 million of cost saves are now realized out of the $150 million to $200 million. This would imply a run rate, right, of somewhere around $705 million to $718 million for expenses with all the cost saves. Now I know you're saying expenses are going to stay high in the first half of '13. But as we get towards the last quarter 2013, is that how we should be thinking about expenses sort of $705 million, $718 million with some adjustment for growth rate of core expenses?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Steve, this is Jeff. I think as we look at how the year plays out is that expenses will trend down in the second half of the year. We're not giving that specific of a number, but I would say in general terms, you're thinking of it how we're looking at those overall expense trends. And I think we do have to factor in what other investments in terms of business opportunities that may exist. If we see opportunities in the market to add bankers, we will add bankers to grow revenue. So we're really trying to look at it on a net basis, too, in terms of not just the expenses but also focusing on the revenue side of the equation.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So just to follow up on that, in terms of the shift on this one slide to the cash efficiency target, could you give us some color on that shift? And should we read into that, that the timing of getting into the 60%, 65% GAAP efficiency ratio range has maybe been extended a bit?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Steve, I think the cash efficiency ratio of the 60% to 65% just simply excludes the intangible amortization expense that we have. That was an item that also will decrease over time on the purchase credit card receivable amortization. Of course, it's heavier in the first couple of years, and the other core deposit intangible amortization is also heavier in the first couple of years. That will start to decrease over time. So what we wanted to get to is, what's the efficiency ratio x the intangibles. I think that's where we're focused on, and we know we have to -- 65% is the first step. Then we have to figure out how we're going to also continue to step down those overall expenses, as well as grow revenue to get it down closer to the 60% level.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I guess just to kind of follow up on the expense question. How -- when you think about it and kind of in tandem with the revenue outlook, I mean, do you guys think you'll be able to generate positive operating leverage in 2013? Kind of where does that ultimately fit into sort of your priorities? And then I had a second question, unrelated. If you could just provide a little more color on the revaluation of the home equity guidance, just so if you can talk a little bit more about kind of what drove it and sort of where the charge-offs flushed out to?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Okay. So as we look at, again, I think in terms of positive operating leverage, that is our mission is to grow revenues faster than expenses. That is our outlook as we look at 2013 and beyond. And I think that's one of the things that we're very focused on as a management team. And we're getting some of the lift, of course, not only from a better margin in 2013 than what we had in 2012, but also as we look at overall average earning asset growth now is starting to come into play. Last year, we were very stable in that around $72 billion of average earning assets for the year. This year, our expectation is that average earning assets will trend up with the general overall growth in the loan portfolio. So from that perspective, we feel very positive. I think if you look at the -- then your second part of your question was on home equity. In the third quarter, we, like everybody else that was a national bank, had to make some determinations on the level of Chapter 7 bankruptcies and the amount of a charge-off that we would take. And we work through all of those particular charge-offs in the fourth quarter and actually got down to applying on a loan-by-loan basis across the entire portfolio group. That's what led to some of the shifting around. We took a charge to the home equity book in the third quarter. And as we reapplied on where those charge-offs actually came out in the fourth quarter, that resulted in that adjustment that you saw there. So in total, charge-offs related to the home equity book, about $10 million less across all portfolios related to that Chapter 7 in the fourth quarter.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Josh Levin with Citi.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You talked about the cost-cutting program, but you said you're thinking about investments also. So as you think about the trade-off versus cost cuts versus investing, whether it's investing in people or equipment, how do you think about the minimum payback period for such an investment?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Josh, this is Jeff. As we look at payback periods as one item, but as also looking at what's the internal rate of return over time, and we want to strive for something that's in the at least the mid- to upper-teens on IRRs related to our investments. We talk about some of these investments that we're really looking at. We really look at the technology side of the equation, remaining at these elevated levels through the first half of 2013. So if you go back and look, we were up basically from where we were in the second quarter. That investment went up about $10 million. It was up $2 million in the third quarter. It ramped up an additional $8 million in the fourth quarter. We expect it to remain at that level for the next couple of quarters as we deliver now some of our systems. And those systems then will help us also make some moves that we have with outside parties currently to bring those on to our own platforms and reduce cost elsewhere. So those are very positive on the payback time periods. Certain other investments, you have to look at your trust accounting system. It's an older system. We're going to a more modern system. It will give more feature and function to our clients and to our bankers internally, so that's a necessary expenditure that we have to make. And again, that will be implemented here in 2013.","Beth E. Mooney","Josh, this is Beth. One thing I would also add in addition, I mentioned the rigor with which we will make those investments. And I'd like to share that part of what we developed in our operating rhythm in 2012 with the [ph] project management office, that that's the business cases and make sure that we're clear about the resources, the staging, the timing and the prioritization we give. And then rigorously also tracks the business value realization. So as Jeff talked about some of the metrics with which we would evaluate the return profile, that we also clearly track that we're realizing the benefit.","Christopher Marrott Gorman","And Josh, it's Christopher Gorman. The other area where we've invested and invested successfully is in people. We think we have a unique business model focused on these targeted middle market companies. And if you look at the 82 people that we brought on that were kind of senior level calling people from the beginning of 2010 until present, that has been a good investment. We also invested in 2010 in mortgage banking personnel, and we're seeing the fruits of that as well. So that's another element of the investment program.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And you had strong loan growth in the fourth quarter. As you look at the first quarter and into the rest of the year, do you have a sense that your loans can continue to grow at that rate? Or do you think there might have been some pull forward, like other banks mentioned, in the fourth quarter?","Christopher Marrott Gorman","So Josh, a couple of things to keep in mind. One, there was some activity late in the fourth quarter, but we don't think it was driving or overriding our business. Clearly, there were some tax-driven activity. With respect to going forward, I think Jeff mentioned that we're comfortable kind of mid to high single-digit numbers, and as we look at our backlogs, as we look at our ability to penetrate new clients, we're comfortable with that on a going forward basis.","William R. Koehler","And I would say -- Josh, this is Bill. As we look at our pipelines in the Community Bank, especially in our commercial businesses, the pipelines are significantly stronger than they were the same time last year. Our pull-through in the fourth quarter was good and yet our pipelines are still strong and I would say importantly, more balanced regionally.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Erika Penala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Erika  Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My first question -- I'm sorry to continue to focus on expenses, but I just wanted to make sure we're thinking about the first half of the year the correct way. So the GAAP expense number is $756 million, and you mentioned that severance expenses would remain elevated near term. If I back out the amortization expense, the credit for lending-related commitments as well as the $16 million in Fit for Growth-related expenses, I get to a core run rate of $742 million, like Steve said. So in the first half of the year, is it flat to the $756 million GAAP number? Or is it flat to that $742 million GAAP number -- or sorry, $742 million core number?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","I think the way that we are looking at this particular number, Erika, is that it will be within that kind of that fourth quarter range for the first half of the year, and that has the additional technology spend in there as well as severance-related costs and other costs associated with our Fit for Growth initiative. So could -- it will be within a range of that, say, $750 million in that particular range for the next couple of quarters. That's the expectation.","Erika  Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And just my follow-up question is long term in terms of your efficiency goals. So if I strip out all the noise and say that your core run rate right now is $742 million and I think about your expense goals, if I sort of calculate the midpoint of the 60% to 65%, it would imply an additional $460 million of annual revenues or expense cuts to get to the midpoint. And could you give us a sense in terms of where we could get that $460 million from? Is it because the balance sheet is growing much faster than you think? Or are there additional expense cuts beyond '13 that we should look forward to?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Well, Erika, I think we have to manage expenses. After we take these particular expenses out of the organization, we have to effectively manage the expense base of the company. But we have to have more revenue. So I think that's really where we're becoming much more focused all the time in terms of what we are attacking in the marketplace. Our exit portfolios are getting smaller and smaller all the time, so that's less of a drain that we have. And I think in terms of if once we start to look at the overall core growth, and it's not just the loan portfolio because it's really looking at client penetration and getting more of the overall business from those particular clients. So Chris, do you have [ph]...","Christopher Marrott Gorman","No, I think, Jeff, you're exactly right. We've had a fair amount of success in terms of adding relationships. So for example, this year, we added 669 new relationships. So that will set the stage for future growth. They average about $169,000 or so in revenue. But to Jeff's point, because of our model, we're able to really penetrate the relationships that we have. We talk about expanded relationships. Those are relationships that we do $100,000 more than we did in the first measurement period of 12\/31\/11. In that case, we had 425 expanded relationships, but in the aggregate, generated about $263 million. So those will be some of the areas getting deeper with these highly focused clients and bringing new clients on to the platform because as we mentioned, we think we can leverage the platform.","Beth E. Mooney","Erika, this is Beth. I would just add one thing for the Community Bank, that as we go through 2013, as Jeff indicated, we will burn through some of the amortization related to the credit cards of [ph] HSBC and that will be more -- so the operating leverage of that will come through more fully.","Erika  Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. Just wanted to make sure I wrapped up on the revenue side. I mean, I got the message in terms of getting to that revenue growth number of around $450 million, $460 million. I guess that would be sort of, obviously, some NII growth as you have loan growth coming in, but also fee growth as you penetrate more deeply into the relationships.","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Yes, it has to come from both. It's not just balance sheet-driven. Particularly in this particular rate environment, I think you've got to have both. You've got to get paid for your balance sheet not only in some form of spread, but you also have to have ancillary businesses in today's environment.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll now take our next question from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So I guess my first question, or my only question, is for Beth. You mentioned the saying that you can't shrink yourself to prosperity. The question I have though is there's a lot of very highly profitable banks that are much smaller than Key. I would -- could you just walk us through your thought process on why growing is the only viable solution for Key to become more profitable?","Beth E. Mooney","Yes, Ken, this is Beth. I think what we have articulated is we've spent what I would call the last couple of years as we really repositioned and refocused our company around this core value proposition between our Corporate and our Community Bank, where we're clearly built our capabilities distinctively as we've talked about within Corporate Bank with our various vertical strategies, our investment banking, debt and capital market capabilities, mortgage banking capabilities with our local delivery of our Community Bank. Clearly, leverage to a business and economic recovery, and I think we have the proof points in 2012 that shows real momentum in returns from that strategy. I think we have realigned, repositioned and hit what I would call the sweet spot capabilities and clients that will provide growth. So my thinking is that much of the repositioning, shedding that we needed to do, for a lack of a better term, I think has been accomplished. And now it is our time to continue the momentum you saw in 2012, execute that strategy, drive improved performance and valuation.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jennifer Demba with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I think most of my questions have been asked. I'm wondering about what you're looking for in a tax rate in 2013?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Okay. So on the tax rate on a GAAP basis would be somewhere between 26% and 27%, and on a tax equivalent basis would be somewhere about 100 basis points higher than that 27% to 28%.","Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just curious if -- in terms of fee income growth in '13 and probably into '14 as well, what do you see as the major drivers? Is it primarily Treasury management, investment banking, et cetera?","Christopher Marrott Gorman","Yes, I think it will be -- Jennifer, it's Chris Gorman. It'll be across-the-board. But again, our strategy, where we target in these 6 verticals in the Corporate Bank, enables us to sell a wide variety of advice and solution. So payments, our enterprise commercial payments business, that's an important business and it's very, very sticky. We also continue to grow our investment in debt placement fees. That's another real area of focus. We also have been raising a lot of capital for these mid-cap companies. So right now in terms of mix, we're about 57% noninterest income, the balanced interest income, and we don't see that deviating much. We kind of like that mix, 55%, 45%. So it will be across-the-board focused on these very targeted companies.","Jeffrey B. Weeden","That makes us for the Corporate Bank. Overall, we're about 43% on the fee revenue. So I think the Corporate Bank is clearly an important driver of fee revenue for the organization.","William L. Hartmann","And Jennifer, this is Bill. In Community Bank, in addition to some of the fee items that Chris talked about, we have additional opportunity in -- with some of our new payment capabilities; so the card that we've already talked about. But also, we're seeing momentum in our private banking, investment management and trust origination, so that our fees generated from investment continue to improve over time. And we think that is a very interesting opportunity long term and highly complementary to our business model and focus on working with privately-owned companies in the middle market.","Christopher Marrott Gorman","Jennifer, just to give you one kind of proof point on kind of our mix of fee versus interest income. Well, a great case study would be our Real Estate business that we've completely repositioned. The actual balance sheet is about half today what it was in the financial crisis. And as you look at loan origination, this year, loan origination is up 22%, but 57% of that is off balance sheet. So you can see that we continue to look at that mix and how we can use our balance sheet as a lead, 70% or so of the syndicated financed deals we lead, but how we can utilize that to really drive some of the fee income streams you were referencing.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","My main question is, how can you be content with an efficiency ratio target of 60% to 65%? I guess it was 69% in the fourth quarter and I suppose 68% or so for the year. So it's certainly an improvement. But when I look back over time, with all the efficiency initiatives KeyCorp has had, and some of this predates you, Beth, but you have Fit for Growth now. You finished Keyvolution, Resource 2000, PEG. When I look all the way back to 1994, your efficiency ratio was 58%. And after 2 decades of all these programs and all the technological advances and all the hopes for economies of scale, you're now targeting an efficiency ratio that's above what you had 2 decades ago. So should you be content with the ratio of 60% to 65%?","Beth E. Mooney","Yes, Mike. This is Beth, and I'll go ahead and just reiterate, obviously, our commitment with Fit for Growth, which is to reduce our expenses by $150 million to $200 million and also to use those to drive revenue in addition to our efficiency plans that get us to that 60% to 65% by 2014. So in addition to the business mix, which we are driving enhanced performance, I believe, through that mix of business and those differentiated capabilities, we're also incurring costs that include regulatory and compliance. We have some costs related to investments that are still early in the days of their return. The examples in 2012 would be Western New York, credit card. Jeff mentioned and I mentioned technology as an enabler of our business and investments in that regard. But I couple those in the context of the improvement in our business performance that is evident in 2012: loan growth, fees, growth in deposits, but awfully a significantly different mix and cost of those deposits. We've had meaningful improvements in our operating results of our Corporate Bank, and we've got many initiatives aimed at improving the performance of our Community Bank, perhaps most notably kind of the headline would be around rationalizing some of our branch networks. So I think we've been, are and will be diligent in considering every meaningful idea. Nothing is off the table, and we are working a portfolio of ideas that fit our strategy and are designed to improve our performance both in the immediate near term as well as over the long term, and we've got a nice mix of ideas in that regard. So I believe we're executing a very sound plan. It will improve our performance and enhance our valuations.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","If I could just have one follow up, and that was helpful. On the one hand, Beth, you said you're -- or KeyCorp is done shedding assets. And on the other hand, you said nothing is off the table. So given underperformance, again, that predates you and efficiency ratios versus the best-in-class players, 52% versus your target of even 60% to 65%, why not have an independent board committee reassess the strategy to create more shareholder value such as by optimizing the geographic footprint? And the reason I asked that is in my mind, having covered the company for 2 decades, again, obviously predating when you got to the company, Beth, but it seems to be so spread out, from Maine to Washington to Florida to Alaska, that maybe that's the root cause for not being as optimized as, say, a U.S. Bancorp or several other banks, large and small. So would you consider having an independent board committee take a look at how to create more shareholder value such as by optimizing the geographic footprint since you said nothing is off the table?","Beth E. Mooney","Yes, Mike. I think it's clear that Key has a very experienced Board of Independent Directors, and they regularly evaluate our strategies, our position in the industry and our markets. They look at our plans, our performance and balance that we're doing the right things for our constituencies and that our plan will drive value for our shareholders. So we believe there's tremendous value in our company, and our job as a management team is to execute on those plans and strategies that we believe will be successful for us.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brian Foran with Autonomous.","Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I guess loan sales, you mentioned the leverage to the improvement in commercial real estate. Is that a line item you can continue to grow from here? Or how should we think about the near-term outlook for loan sales revenue?","Christopher Marrott Gorman","Sure. It's Chris Gorman, Brian. We have a solid pipeline. Our pipeline is, frankly, every bit as big as it was going into this year. If you look at kind of the line items that go through there, which are basically mortgage banking to Fannie, Freddie, FHA and the life companies, we're up from, say, $1 billion in 2010 to just call it $3.9 billion this year. We think it's -- we don't think we can continue probably on that trajectory. But as we look at our pipelines, our pipelines are actually greater today than they were a year ago.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll now take our next question from Nancy Bush with NAB Research, LLC.","Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division","[Audio Gap] business segment and as we know, that's an increasingly competitive segment. Could you just speak to your results in small business? And whether small business customers are sort of demanding things that are different than what they wanted in the past?","Beth E. Mooney","Nancy, this is Beth. I apologize, but the very early -- probably about half your question did not come through. Can we ask you to repeat your question?","Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division","Yes, I just said that KeyCorp has always been recognized as a good small business bank. And if you could just speak to your results in small business since that segment is becoming increasingly competitive and whether -- what the demands of small business are now that perhaps are different than they have been historically?","William R. Koehler","Nancy, this is Bill Koehler. A couple of comments. In the past year or so, we have seen the tone of small business improve. People are beginning to invest more, and we've been able to serve them in 2 ways through providing loans and deposits and other operating capabilities as you normally would. But also by using our SBA capabilities, and we have leveraged them very effectively to support a wide range of small businesses in our footprint to the point where we're even acknowledged by the SBA in May, I believe, or June for -- as a leading SBA lender to middle-market companies in the country. So we feel very good about where our clients and prospects are in terms of wanting to build their businesses and invest in them. They're still a little cautious, but they're stronger. And we have proven an ability to continue to serve them. We see opportunity ahead. Chris mentioned payments as an opportunity to further penetrate our clients, add more value and generate more revenue over time. But we feel good about the progress we're making.","Beth E. Mooney","And Nancy, this is Beth. I would add that one of the things as we track various levels in business volume and pipeline, this particular market segment has been perhaps the slowest to regain confidence and really start borrowing and lending again. And we noted what I would call the inflection point in the fourth quarter of 2011. But as we close out 2012, there's been a notable increase in pipelines in new business volume and business banking, coupled with some behavior that's similar to middle-market clients while retaining more cash. And we have really also worked to make sure not only we have the business capabilities, that we'd also connect those business owners to our private bank to help them maximize and optimize both their business assets of their personal assets.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Robert Placet - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Rob Placet from Matt's team. I was just curious, how meaningful could fee revenue opportunities be from the recent deals and investments you guys made in credit card and payment areas?","William R. Koehler","I guess -- this is Bill, Rob. We feel very good about the progress we are making in both cases. In credit card, we are growing our accounts at a faster rate than planned. We're seeing improvement in fees -- or I should say dollars transacted per -- dollars per transaction. So we're seeing a lot of evidence that our integration process is working well. We think we can grow that nicely over time. And in the case of HSBC, within that franchise, we're seeing similar positive dynamics. Retention rates of those clients have been better than planned. Employee retention is better than planned. So we see some momentum building, and we think we can continue to grow it.","Beth E. Mooney","And Rob, this is Beth. I would give you kind of a particular metric that I look at when I think about it, specifically about the income opportunity. Not having been a credit card issuer, our platform would have been more debit card-focused: freebies, [indiscernible] and obviously, in a different environment before Durbin. And we have 70% penetration in our checking account of debit cards. Now granted people use debit cards in a variety of ways and a variety of reasons, but bringing back in credit card and becoming a credit card issuer, our penetration on credit card currently is only 12%. So if you think about the opportunity to align that with our relationship rewards and all our core product capabilities and create more choice of how people exercise payment capabilities between debit card and credit card both for transactional needs as well as revolving credit. There is a significant fee opportunity that will come from that, both through growth but also through just penetration with our own client base.","William R. Koehler","And Rob, one other thought. We just spoke about the revenue side here. As part of our integration plans, there are opportunities to improve our infrastructure costs as well, which end up flowing through to the bottom line.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Beth, can you share with us, when you guys look at your capital, clearly it would appear to most of us that you're very well capitalized, especially when you look at the Tier 1 common ratio and the Basel III. I assume you guys will be around the 7.25% to 7.5% requirement. What level above that are you willing to carry the bank at? And second to that, in terms of what the CCAR, in terms of your application, can you share with us if you applied for more of a return of capital than what you did last year?","Beth E. Mooney","Yes, Gerard, I'll go ahead and start with that, and then I'll let Jeff talk about relative capitalization levels. On CCAR, I would tell you that we very much did like the starting point that we went into this year's process. As you noted, we had strong capital, solidly profitable, rebalanced, derisked our balance sheet, and I think we've got very strong process and strong models, which are all important to that process. Our capital remains solid even after the plans we submitted, and what we submitted would be consistent with our capital priorities. And as we've talked about them, if the opportunity to increase our dividends to our shareholders, an opportunity to look at share repurchases, an opportunity to have a return of capital, so everything we submitted would be consistent with that, and we, like the rest of the industry, will share more broadly in March with the expected announcement of the results with the Federal Reserve.","Jeffrey B. Weeden","And Gerard, on Basel III, I think we have to wait until we see the final rules to come out to determine where we're going to operate and where the industry is going to operate. Clearly, at this particular point in time, we start with a very solid position and of course, that will be something that we'll have to manage to whatever those targets are over time. It's not our expectation that anybody is going to be allowed to do a major step change in their overall capital. So I think consistent with what Beth is talking about, the capital plans are filed, we go through the process and we wait to hear back in March on that.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Beth, I don't know if you want to disclose this, some of the other banks have -- that they've applied for more of a return of capital this year than last year. Did you -- would you guys be able to tell us if your number is going to be greater than the 50%, I think, you mentioned earlier in the call?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Gerard, this is Jeff. I think in terms of the 50% that was in 2012, it was really for 3 quarters because we did not have any share repurchase plans in place in the first quarter of 2012. So last year's CCAR covered a period of the second quarter through the first quarter of 2013. And I believe we talked about we have $88 million remaining under that authorization at this point in time. We evaluate share repurchase, dividends and all the rest of the potential needs for capital when we put together our capital plans and submitted it. And I think we will simply wait until the findings come back from the Federal Reserve and disclose that information at that particular point in time.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Alan Straus with Schroders.","Alan Straus","I was just kind of following up on Mike Mayo's question. Why is the target of 60% to 65%, the efficiency ratio, so much lower or actually the ratio is higher than some of the leading banks? And where did that number come from?","Beth E. Mooney","Yes, this is Beth, and I will start with a piece about our business mix and our business model does have differences. And from where we start, we're targeting 60% to 65% by 2014. And I think some of the tenor and the tone of what we try to convey today is that will reflect the demonstrable progress we intend to make in 2013. But we're also committed to being a company that works continuous improvement and has a business model that will also have more opportunities for revenue growth over the intermediate and long term as well.","Alan Straus","Okay. Just one last question. Do you guys give out average -- ending assets, not average assets, at the end of the quarter but ending assets?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","It's there in our balance sheet, so they\u2019re directly in the press release. You can look at ending, average, all different -- they're in the press release.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I just want to come back on the efficiency ratio question. Beth, when you mentioned 2014 and you mentioned 60%, 65%, I just want to make sure we're all super clear. 60% to 65% is you're expecting that to be on a cash basis or on a GAAP basis when you speak about 2014?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","It's on a cash basis. But if you look at the amount of amortization that we have in any given year, what we're currently running at would amount to about $45 million.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Right. So it's not that much. And then the second clarifying question is, are you talking about getting there on a full year basis or by the end of the year?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","We talk about entering 2014 at that level.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Entering, okay. So -- and does that mean in the fourth meaning you're there at the end of the fourth when you report fourth quarter earnings or you mean first quarter? These are the questions that were coming in there. So I just want to make sure everyone is super clear.","Jeffrey B. Weeden","We mean in the first quarter of 2014. So 2013 is our year to show that we are making that step improvement, that we're taking cost out of the organization and we're growing the franchise at the same time. So as we go through the year, the expectation in the second half of the year is you'll see improvement over what we're running at in the first half of the year, and then we will have the full benefit as we enter 2014. We're trying to be as aggressive as possible in addressing our cost in the first half of the year to get as much as we can. And we'll provide, obviously, updates as we go on through this calendar year. That is our current plan. And I think we've been pretty transparent in our previous comments that we've made about other forms of expectations in the past, whether it's been on margin, expense levels, et cetera. So that is what we are targeting in the year, starting next year.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So first quarter '14, cash efficiency ratio get breaks into 60% to 65%.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steve Scinicariello from UBS.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a big picture question for you, Beth. As I kind of look at all the focus areas that you have for 2013 and all the opportunities that you have, whether it's increasing the revenues through the fee income and average earning asset growth, continuing to manage the expenses, optimizing the franchise, deploying capital, all these things. I was just curious, as you look at the year, how do you rank these opportunities and which ones give you the most bang for the buck?","Beth E. Mooney","Yes, Steve. As I look at it, I think several of the priorities, we are well in flight. I mean, it's a matter of continued rigorous focus that would be and maintain our moderate risk profile. I think returning within our targeted range on charge-offs and having realized significant benefit of quality of improvement in our balance sheet is something we just need to stay focused on. Our distinctive business model, I think, is already showing results and has been in our 2012 proof point. So I think continuing to invest smartly and drive our business outcome is a momentum we take into 2013. So I think the 2 areas that are highest on our radar screen would be aligning our cost structure and delivering on our Fit for Growth commitments, in a way where our targeted investments as well as our business strategy creates a trajectory of revenue to meet that 60% to 65% cash efficiency ratio as we start 2014.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Makes total sense. Sounds like 2013 should be one of playing a lot more offense rather than defense, and definitely look forward to that.","Operator","Due to time constraints, that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today.

This call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Beth Mooney, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Beth Mooney","Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to KeyCorp\u2019s fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Joining me for today\u2019s presentation is Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer. And available for our Q&A portion of the call is Bill Hartmann, our Chief Risk Officer.","Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call.","I am now turning to Slide 3. Key\u2019s strong results for the fourth quarter complete what has been a very successful and transformational year for our company. We reported our third consecutive year of positive operating leverage and our pre-provision net revenue was up 23% from 2015, excluding merger-related charges. In the fourth quarter, we reduced our cash efficiency ratio to 63% and our return on tangible common equity was 12.5%, excluding merger charges. We completed our First Niagara acquisition in August, the largest in our company\u2019s history. And in October, we successfully integrated branches, systems and clients. This included moving data and account information for over 1 million new clients, converting over 300 branches and consolidating over 100 First Niagara and Key branches in the quarter. Overall, the conversion was very well executed and we were open for business on Tuesday morning, following the Columbus Day weekend.","Our 3 million total clients had access to our combined set of products and capabilities. Our results this quarter, reflects solid performance across our company with meaningful contributions from both the Community Bank and the Corporate Bank. We continue to grow and expand client relationships, which generated solid loan growth and positive trends in our fee-based businesses. Investment banking and debt placement fees reached a record level for the quarter and the year despite the challenging environment we saw early in 2016. Cards and payments, along with corporate services, also had record years. These have all been areas of targeted investments over the past several years.","We also maintained our moderate risk profile and continued to operate below our targeted range for net charge-off. Capital management remains a clear priority for us. We increased our common stock dividend in May by 13%. And subject to Board approval, we expect an additional increase of 12% in the second quarter of this year. We also resumed our share repurchases in the third quarter after completing our acquisition. And although we did not repurchase shares earlier in the year, we still paid out almost 60% of our net income in 2016.","The final item on this slide is our First Niagara acquisition, which I have already mentioned in my remarks. The acquisition continues to exceed our expectations as we are already realizing some of our targeted cost savings and begin to see traction on revenue opportunities across our organization. As we have seen early signs of momentum, we see First Niagara clients are choosing Key because of our broader capability. Some examples include, we have closed $100 million in First Niagara related commercial mortgage banking transactions, and our commercial payments pipeline is already over 3x higher than First Niagara\u2019s historic level. We have seen early wins in purchase card, foreign exchange and accounts payable automation. And we are also seeing retail deposit growth across all First Niagara markets. This early progress strengthens our confidence and our ability to reach or exceed our financial targets. And in total, our targets include achieving $400 million in cost savings. And as I have said before, we expect to achieve an even higher level of savings generating $300 million in revenue synergies, reducing our cash efficiency by 300 basis points, and improving our return on tangible common equity by 200 basis points.","And as a look back over the past several years, I am very proud of our team and of our accomplishments and pleased with how Key has performed through a period of slower economic growth and lower interest rates. And despite these headwinds, we grew our business, generated positive operating leverage, improved efficiency and invested for the future. Now as I look ahead, I believe that Key was uniquely positioned to take advantage of an improving economy and a more constructive business environment. Our business model and the investments we have made in people and capabilities give us confidence and position us well. We have clear and compelling priorities, which will continue to drive growth in our four businesses and attain the value from our First Niagara acquisition. I have never been more optimistic about our future and confident in our ability to create long-term value for our clients, communities, employees and most importantly, our shareholders.","Now, I will turn the call over to Don for a more detailed look at the quarter and to discuss our outlook for 2017. Don?","Don Kimble","Thanks, Beth. I am on Slide 5. Fourth quarter net income from continuing operations was $0.31 per common share after excluding $0.11 of merger-related charges. This compares to $0.27 per share in the year ago period and $0.30 in the third quarter, which excluded $0.14 of merger-related charges.","We generated positive operating leverage for the quarter excluding merger-related charges with a return on tangible common equity of 12.5%. As a reminder, the fourth quarter reflects the first quarter \u2013 first full quarter impact to First Niagara acquisition. Third quarter results included two months of impact. And as we mentioned in the third quarter call, our results were shown on a combined basis without attribution to either legacy Key or First Niagara. We will cover many of these items on this slide in the rest of my presentation. So now I am turning to Slide 6.","Total average loan balances of $85 billion were up $25 billion or 43% compared to the year ago quarter and up $8 billion or 10% from the third quarter. Average loan growth primarily reflects the full quarter impact of the acquisition as well as core business performance. Sequential quarter growth and average balances was impacted by the divestiture of $439 million in September, and the sale in the fourth quarter of approximately $330 million in acquired loans that did not align with our relationship strategy. CF&A loans, which were up 28% from the year ago quarter and 6% from the prior quarter continued to be a primary driver of our growth. On a period end basis, total loans were up 1%. During the fourth quarter, the fair value mark on our acquired loan portfolio was adjusted from $686 million to $548 million.","Continuing on to Slide 7, average deposits, excluding deposits in foreign office totaled $105 billion for the fourth quarter 2016, an increase of $33 billion compared to the year ago period and $10 billion compared to the third quarter. Compared to the prior year, fourth quarter average deposit growth was driven by First Niagara as well as continued momentum in our retail banking franchise, which now accounts for nearly half of our total balances. As core deposits from our commercial mortgage servicing business also contributed to the growth from the prior year. On a linked-quarter basis, deposit growth reflects 1 additional month impact from First Niagara as well as retail deposit momentum and the inflows from the commercial clients.","Turning to Slide 8, taxable equivalent net interest income was $948 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 and net interest margin was 3.12%. These results compare to taxable equivalent net interest income of $610 million and a net interest margin of 2.87% for the fourth quarter of 2015, and $788 million and a net interest margin of 2.85% in the third quarter of 2016. Included in the fourth quarter figure is $92 million from purchase accounting accretion, $34 million of which is related to the refinement of our third quarter purchase accounting. Excluding purchase accounting accretion and net interest income increased $246 million from the prior year and $87 million from the prior quarter, with increases driven primarily by a full quarter impact of First Niagara acquisition and core business growth. The fourth quarter net interest margin of 3.12% was 27 basis points higher than the prior quarter. The increase was largely due to the purchase accounting accretion which contributed 23 basis points, including 11 basis points related to the refinement of the third quarter results. Lower levels of excess liquidity also benefited our margin compared to the third quarter as funds were redeployed into our investment portfolio.","Slide 9 shows a summary of non-interest income, which once again includes a full quarter impact of First Niagara in the fourth quarter results. Non-interest income in the fourth quarter was $618 million, up $133 million from the prior year and up $69 million from the prior quarter. The fourth quarter benefited from $9 million associated with merger related adjustments compared to merger related charges of $12 million in the prior quarter which were primarily in other income. Excluding the impact of merger related charges, non-interest income was up $124 million from the prior year and up $48 million from the prior quarter. Growth was driven by continued momentum in a number of our core fee-based businesses, reflecting investments we have made over the past few years as well as the acquisition. As Beth mentioned, investment banking and debt placement fees had a record quarter. We saw strength across our platform, including mortgage banking, M&A and loan syndications.","Turning to Slide 10, reported non-interest expense up for the fourth quarter was $1.2 billion, which includes $207 million of merger related charges. A detailed breakout of our merger related charges is included in the appendix of our materials. The quarter also includes a pension settlement charge of $18 million and an increase in intangible amortization, including $5 million related to the refinement of the third quarter purchase accounting. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year and after adjusting for the merger related charges, non-interest expense was up $283 million, both primary reflects the acquisition of First Niagara as well as higher incentive and stock-based compensation. Additionally, the pension settlement charge was $14 million higher compared to last year, and the intangible amortization increased by $18 million. Linked quarter expenses also adjusted for the merger related charges were up $120 million. If you can see on the lower right hand side of this slide, an additional month of the impact of First Niagara was the largest part of the increase, along with an $18 million pension settlement charge. Incentive and stock-based compensation also increased, primarily related to stock-based compensation plans, reflecting the impact of our higher share price. And intangible asset amortization increased $14 million.","Turning to Slide 11, net charge-offs were $72 million or 34 basis points of average total loans in the fourth quarter, which continues to be below our targeted range. During the quarter, net charge-offs increased $8 million to regulatory guidance on consumer loan bankruptcies and confirming First Niagara indirect auto charge-off policies to Key. Additionally, we had a few commercial charge-offs that impacted the overall trends. Fourth quarter provision for credit losses was $66 million, an increase of $21 million over the year ago period and $7 million from the linked quarter. Non-performing loans decreased $98 million from the prior quarter. At December 31, 2016, our total reserves for loan losses represented 1% of period end loans and 137% coverage of our non-performing loans. Keep in mind the acquisition of First Niagara portfolios are recorded at fair value.","And turning on to Slide 12, our common equity Tier 1 ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was 9.59%. Also in accordance with our 2016 Capital Plan, we repurchased $68 million of common shares during the fourth quarter. Slide 13 provides you with our outlook and expectations for 2017. This includes the impact of First Niagara and it\u2019s based on the reported results. The merger related charges however, are excluded. Importantly, we remain committed to generating positive operating leverage. We expect average loans and deposit growth to increase in the mid single-digit percentage range for the full year with 2016 adjusted to account for the full year of First Niagara. Net interest income is expected to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.7 billion with our outlook assuming one additional rate increase in the middle of the year. Benefit from purchase accounting accretion is also included in our outlook. We expect the quarterly impact from purchase accounting accretion to trend down over time from the fourth quarter level, adjusted for the third quarter refinement. We anticipate that non-interest income will be in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion, as we continue to drive growth from our core businesses and the acquisition.","Non-interest expense is expected to be in the range of $3.65 billion to $3.75 million and once again, does not reflect merger related charges. As Beth said, we remain committed to meeting or exceeding the financial targets we have laid out for the acquisition. We continued to expect to achieve our $400 million cost rate \u2013 cost savings run rate target by mid-2017, which would then be reflected in our full year 2018 run rate. In 2017, net charge-offs should continue to be below our targeted range of 40 basis points to 60 basis points and provision should be slightly \u2013 should slightly exceed our level of net charge-offs to provide for loan growth.","Coming off our momentum in 2016, our 2017 outlook would be another year for strong performance. Keep in mind that our first quarter results will reflect a lower day count and we expect to see normal seasonality in areas such as loan fees and colleague. Other fee categories such as investment banking and debt placement fees are also show some variability over the year. We have included our long-term financial targets on the bottom of the slide, including continuing to generate positive operating leverage, reducing our cash efficiency ratio to less than 60% and this would be over 500 basis points of improvement from the time that we announced the acquisition, maintaining our moderate risk profile and producing a return on tangible common equity of 13% to 15%, which would be an improvement of 400 basis points. These results reflect our expectation for continued momentum in our core business and the meaningful lift we expect from our First Niagara acquisition. We expect to achieve these targets in 2018. I will close with a comment consistent with Beth\u2019s remarks that really was a good year for Key and we feel we are very well positioned as we head into what is shaping up to be a more positive operating environment.","I will now turn the call back over to the operator for instructions in the Q&A portion of our call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And first on the line we have John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","John Pancari","I want to start with the margin, I just wanted to see if we can get your thoughts around where the margin could trend going into the first quarter and then maybe through \u201817, if you can give us what you assume right now in terms of the Fed hikes you might have already mentioned that earlier, sorry if I missed it. And then also when it comes to deposit beta as well, what you have seen so far in terms of the December 2016 hike and how that may trend through the year? Thanks.","Don Kimble","As far as margin, we reported 3.12% for the fourth quarter. If you back out the impact of the third quarter refinement, that would be right at 3%. What we said in our guidance is that the purchase accounting accretion would trend down on a quarterly basis going forward. We would expect the outlook for 2017 to be about 20% below what that fourth quarter level is adjusted for the third quarter refinement. And with that, we will be showing a margin for next year in the mid-2.95 range or 2.90 range, so would be in that middle range, reflecting again, the lower accretion coming from purchase accounting. As far as the rate increases, we have assumed one additional rate increase in the middle of 2017 and that\u2019s the only additional rate increase we are seen or projected in our forecasts. And then the last question you had was deposit betas, our assumption longer term is that it would be about a 55% beta. As far as the December rate increase, we haven\u2019t seen a lot of movement on the consumer side, but we have started to see some movement on commercial deposits and so we are well less than half of that, the beta that we had assumed the 55%.","John Pancari","Okay. Thanks. And then separately, I just wanted to get some thoughts on the corporate tax reform impact, we have had some management teams commenting on it, I just wanted to get an idea if you do see \u2013 if we do see some corporate tax cuts getting passed through here, how much of it do you expect ultimately can get, kind of creep to the bottom line and do you expect any of that benefit to ultimately get computed away in the industry and at KeyCorp? Thanks.","Don Kimble","Well, as far as the tax reform, we do believe that would be positive for the industry and the economy overall as far as our outlook. We would say that Key is positioned so that we would not be disadvantaged or advantaged compared to peers. I think that we need to wait and see how the impact comes through before we start to assess how much of that gets retained versus shared. But right now, we do believe it\u2019s going to be positive for the industry.","John Pancari","Alright. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","Scott Siefers","Good morning guys.","Don Kimble","Good morning Scott.","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","Scott Siefers","Don, could you spend just a second talking about what do you think the main drivers of fee income growth will be in \u201817? And I guess specifically, what I am hoping you can speak to is some of the dynamics around the investment banking and debt placement line item, I mean, it\u2019s just been really, really strong. I am just trying to figure out if we are sort of at a new structural level that\u2019s higher than we might have thought or how you are thinking about that line as well?","Don Kimble","Well, Scott, I tried to convince our capital markets team that it was a new level and it should be the baseline going forward, but I would say that we really need to look at this on a trailing 12-month basis. But if you look at the full year, we are $482 million in the investment banking debt placement fees. We do expect to see growth from that level in 2017. We have continued to be investing in our people and also investing in products and capabilities. And so we think that should translate to growth in that category on a year-over-year basis. And so we are optimistic about that. We are also continuing to be optimistic about our cards and payments revenues, both for the core business, but also because of the impact of First Niagara that we do believe that there will be synergies there on the revenue side that we will start to see, realize in 2017. And then beyond that, we think that due to the other core fee categories will continue to show progress up. So we think on a core basis, we are going to continue to drive increases in fee income.","Scott Siefers","Okay, that\u2019s perfect. Thank you very much. And then I have just one separate sort of tick-tack question. The preferred dividends, I think where it came in a little higher than I might have thought. Is that just sort of a timing difference between the recent issue and I think retiring the one that\u2019s the recent one was meant to replace?","Don Kimble","You are right that the third quarter didn\u2019t have the full impact from the First Niagara preferred stock dividend. And so we did have a full quarter this quarter, but we have already called the preferred from First Niagara, so that should be off the books here in the first quarter.","Scott Siefers","Okay. So, we just sort of dropped that down towards that more typical \u2013 for something more like a $13 million, $15 million per quarter range?","Don Kimble","I want to make sure we are including three issues of preferred, one, the original Key, one that we had in the third quarter and then one in the fourth quarter and to incorporate those. So, it would be that adjusted run-rate.","Scott Siefers","Okay, great. Alright, thanks very much.","Operator","Next, we will go to Erika Najarian with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Yes, good morning. My first question, Beth and Don, is on the capital return outlook. Now that you have First Niagara integrated, I am wondering how you are thinking about capital return plans for the 2017 CCAR? And Beth, if the SIFI threshold does get raised to $250 billion, how does that change, if at all, how you think about capital return and also, how you think about the trajectory of your regulatory-related costs from here?","Don Kimble","Good. Erika, this is Don. I will go ahead and take the first crack at that. We are still finalizing what our 2017 expectation would be for capital actions. I would say that this year we have been constrained, because of the impact of the one-time merger-related charges, which impacts our overall capital level. We feel very good about where our capital level is. We do not expect to be seeing increases or significant reductions in that in the near-term. And so the capital returns will be more reflective of what kind of outlook for growth we are seeing and what kind of capital will be required to maintain these levels of capital. Beth, you want to talk about the outlook?","Beth Mooney","Yes, Erika. As it relates to if the SIFI designation did move to $250 billion, I think the one thing that we have talked about and would consider would be the mix of our return of capital, which would be \u2013 higher level than 30% for the dividend payout, be appropriate, a both for Key, and we believe for our regional banking company such as Key. So I think we would lean into more capital returns in the form of dividend. And then secondarily, I would tell you that as it relates to regulatory costs, I would say that at least I would say a trajectory where the level of increases that we have all seen over recent years and our investments in regulatory costs, capital compliance could be slowing. But I think our trajectory at this point against what is yet not clear about any changes would suggest that what level of declines we would expect would be premature, but I do think it could be beneficial as we have all felt pressured or have had those costs rising in recent years. And in any event, we have reached what I think was a relative state of maturity for our staffing and our capabilities in regulatory personnel.","Erika Najarian","Thank you for that. And just as a follow-up question, Don, just to clarify the guidance on average loan growth, the base upon which we are looking at mid single-digit loan growth, we are adjusting as if First Niagara was in KeyCorp for full year 2016? I just want to make sure I am understanding the base correctly?","Don Kimble","That\u2019s correct. Now keep in mind, too, that the First Niagara would be net of the impact of the branch divestitures which was over the $400 million number and also some of the strategic exits we had on the $330 million. And so that would be the adjusted baseline from which we would start.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thank you.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Ramsey with FBR. Please go ahead.","Bob Ramsey","Hey, good morning. I am wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the rate sensitivity around further increases. I know you have provided guidance based on one rate increase, but how would that shifts if there is a second or if there were to be none?","Don Kimble","Yes. In our guidance, we basically talked about \u2013 for the impact to deposit betas on future rate increases, it\u2019s about a 2 percentage point change in overall net interest income sensitivity. And so future rate increases, you can apply that same type of assumption set to it. I would say that the further we get into it though the more likely we are going to see the beta start to materialize and start to show deposit prices move in line with the impact of rate increases.","Bob Ramsey","Okay, fair enough. And then maybe can you talk a little bit about \u2013 is there any benefit to the expenses from the pension settlement charge you all took this quarter?","Don Kimble","A slight run-rate benefit, but I would say that the bigger news here is that with the acquisition of First Niagara, we will be merging those two plans in 2017 and the combination of the two plans would suggest that we probably won\u2019t have those pension settlement charges going forward and so that will be a big benefit for us. But the other thing that helps us there is that the threshold that you look at as far as whether or not to recognize a pension settlement charge is how does the lump-sum distributions compared to the overall interest impact. And since interest rates are moving up, the hurdle has gotten higher as well. And so we think this should not be impacting our earnings, hopefully, for the next several years.","Bob Ramsey","Great. And then I guess final question, you highlighted some of the incentive and stock-based comp expense increase this quarter. How much of that was tied to the capital markets business versus other parts of your business?","Don Kimble","Well, the majority of it really wasn\u2019t our stock-based compensation expense and that was almost $15 million of the increase. And a good portion of that really related to the fact that our stock price went up by $6 a share from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. So, I would love to see our stock price go up another $6 a share, but I don\u2019t think we would see that continue with that kind of pace.","Bob Ramsey","Think optimistically. That\u2019s all I have. Thank you.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ken Zerbe","Great, thank you. I guess first question, just in terms of taxes, your tax rate is pretty low already sort of in that mid-20% range. If we do get, let\u2019s call it, the House bill, right, tax rate goes down to 20%, how do you guys think that would impact you relative to peers?","Don Kimble","Again, I don\u2019t think that we would be either advantaged or disadvantaged compared to peers. But if you look at what drives our tax rate lower, I would say that it\u2019s some of the normal things. Others would be experiencing, one is corporate-owned life insurance. We don\u2019t know how that will be treated in the House bill and how that would play through. The other is some of the tax credits we would have from some of the leasing and other loan activities we have. And with those loans and leases, the way that it shows up through our P&L is we have very little PPNR coming through for those loans and leases. And we have a benefit coming through the tax line. And so as long as we will continue to have loan growth at the projected levels, we would think that we would have a greater net interest income and pre-tax pre-provision earnings coming from that loan growth as opposed to today, it shows up in the bottom line below in the tax rate. So again, I don\u2019t think that we would be either advantaged or disadvantaged, but we will have to wait and see when the final terms come out.","Ken Zerbe","Okay. And then just really quick on the expenses, obviously this $3.65 billion \u2013 $3.75 billion versus this quarter, $1 billion plus, how should we think about sort of the right number going in the first quarter, because I assume there are some FICO expenses, etcetera in the first quarter, but as you get the expense savings over the first half, I mean should we see sort of a steady downward trend in absolute dollar expenses have been steady or how it would be great? Thanks.","Don Kimble","As far as our expenses for the current quarter included a number of things, including the higher revenues for the capital markets and included the pension, settlement charge and included the correction on the intangible amortization from the third quarter. And a number of things that would have created some noise in the numbers. If you adjust for those, you will see expenses come down meaningfully in the first quarter from the fourth quarter level. And as we said, that we would expect to achieve our $400 million in cost saves by mid-2017. And we are going to see a chunk of that come through in the first quarter. And we really shutdown a good portion of the systems and back office operations already related to the First Niagara acquisition and so we should start to see some meaningful progress against that target in Q1.","Ken Zerbe","Got it. So if a lot comes through in the first quarter then the dollar expenses over the course of the year, it sounds like it might be pretty stable-ish, is that fair?","Don Kimble","I would say we will see some continued trend down in the second quarter. And then we would start to see less of the incremental benefits and the cost saves in the second half of the year.","Ken Zerbe","Alright. Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Good morning.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","Matt O\u2019Connor","I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about the outlook for the charge-offs, you indicated last in the kind of long-term average of 40 basis points to 60 basis points for 2017, obviously there was kind of some noise this quarter and more recently, you have been in kind of the low to mid-20s, so maybe tighten up or expand on kind of the low-40 basis points to 60 basis points and we then call it the seasoning aspect as the First Niagara loans stay in the balance sheet?","Don Kimble","I would start off by saying that our current credit outlook is fairly stable and we are not seeing a lot of change from the current levels and so that would imply charge-offs continuing around the same zone as what we have experienced over the last year. As we saw in the current quarter, we had a couple of commercial charge-offs that will be more one-off type of situations. We might see it has some \u2013 a little bit of variability from time-to-time, but generally, fairly consistent with the current picture. Bill, would you add anything to that?","Bill Hartmann","The only thing Matt that I would add to that is we have spent a significant amount of time confirming what the portfolio looks like. So as Don says, what we think the portfolio losses will look like going forward will be along that more normal path.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. Thank you very much.","Don Kimble","Thanks.","Operator","Next question is from Ken Usdin with Jeffries. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Thanks a lot. Hey, Don, I wonder if we could just kind of go back on the NII outlook a little bit more, first of all, can you just clarify the outlook 3.6 to 3.7 NII, that\u2019s on a GAAP basis, excluding FTE adjustment?","Don Kimble","That is correct, yes.","Ken Usdin","And the FTE adjustment of $10 million for this quarter, is that a good run rate?","Don Kimble","That is a good run rate, yes.","Ken Usdin","Okay. And so if I exclude the 11 basis points of the true-up on accretion, then the GAAP NIM 3.01 and the core NIM is 2.89 in the fourth quarter, then you threw out two numbers before, I just want to ask you again to go back over how do you expect the path of both the GAAP NIM and the core NIM to trend and were you talking about a full year NIM outlook or where do you expect to end the fourth quarter and can you just reiterate that number you were talking about as far as the NIM for the year?","Don Kimble","Sure, as far as the NIM for the year, rather the assumption is baked into that as it the purchase accounting accretion that we have in the fourth quarter, which is the $92 million, the total accretion minus the $34 million related to the prior quarter refinement, would be about $58 million a quarter. We would say that, that would trend down so that the full year 2017, would be about 20% less than that current run rate. And with that assumption, that the full year net interest margin would be in the mid-2.90s. And so that 3% adjusted fourth quarter number would be in the mid-2.90s for the full year.","Ken Usdin","Okay. So 58 times 4, 232, take 20% off of that and that\u2019s the full year accretion that you would expect?","Don Kimble","That\u2019s correct.","Ken Usdin","Trending down throughout the year?","Don Kimble","That\u2019s correct.","Ken Usdin","And then just last question on this spend so and does that continue to trend down as you go into \u201818 and would you expect then the NIM to continue to drip on an X rates basis just because of that dynamic or are there other things that could support it further again, with an X rates perspective or however you can help us understand it?","Don Kimble","We would expect to see that and purchase accounting accretion continue to trend down over the next several years, I assume an average life of around 4 years for that. And then the other thing is that NIM will continue to have some pressure because of that purchase accounting reduction, but we are going to start just getting closer to the overall impact adjusted or not adjusted for rates, so that 2.89 number that you had talked about before. The other thing that can impact that is as we look at rate increases, we should see some benefit for NIM from that as well. And so that\u2019s not any meaningful increase in 2017 since we are only assuming one mid-year rate increase.","Ken Usdin","Right, okay. And then just one final one, sorry for the rapid chat there, but just on \u2013 when do you think we would get a true-up on your internal target that you keep suggesting is, on the expense side, is going to be distinctly above the $400 million and we assume also is that extra in the guidance or that will be better than the guidance?","Don Kimble","The guidance reflects achieving $400 million in the middle of 2017 and as we achieve that and starts reporting numbers higher than that, we will keep informed. But we would not be adjusting that target until after we have achieved it.","Ken Usdin","Okay. Thanks a lot. I am sorry for those extra questions.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Next, we will go to Matt Burnell from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead ","Matt Burnell","Thanks for taking my question. Don, may be a couple of questions for you. The short-term investment balance you mentioned was a \u2013 the decline in the short-term investment balance appeared to help the NIM this quarter, just curious if going forward that\u2019s going to continue to go down and provide some support to margin or is that going to remain stable with the fourth quarter level and the \u2013 and also in terms of the available for sale securities, those were average about $20 billion this quarter, what\u2019s the trajectory of that balance over the course of \u201817?","Don Kimble","As far as the short-term earning assets, reducing it from the prior quarter for two things; One is that we did see some of those temporary commercial deposits actually leave, and so that really occurred during the fourth quarter and so that had an impact on utilizing some of that excess liquidity. The second thing is we actually increased our investment portfolio and put some of those short-term dollars to work in the bond market and so that\u2019s why did we saw an increase in the bond portfolio. Our guidance going forward is that loan growth is approximate deposit growth and so we wouldn\u2019t see a huge change in that investment portfolio overall. But what we should see is that our expected cash flow is coming off the investment portfolio, about $6 billion for next year. And so the current purchase rates are much higher than what the existing portfolio yield is and so that should have some added benefit to it.","Matt Burnell","Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then just in terms of your overall outlook, there has been a number of questions on that. But we heard earlier, from a competing bank about, what sounds like a pretty optimistic view of GDP growth from the current level to higher level over 2017, just curious as to what GDP growth environment is embedded in your assumptions, is it basically steady-state or does it incorporate any improvement in the overall GDP growth?","Don Kimble","Our outlook is more steady state and we are seeing some early signs as far as increased activity, calling efforts and things like that. And hopefully, we will see some additional tailwind come through from that economy, but that\u2019s not baked in the current guidance.","Beth Mooney","And Matt, this is Beth. And so as we think about it, there could be areas that would be opportunities for increases or upside to our current outlook if any of this anticipated growth is realized. And we continue to believe between the investment bankers and capabilities and our business model, Key would be well positioned if there were opportunities in that regard.","Matt Burnell","It makes sense. Thank you.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Next we will go to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning Beth, good morning Don.","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Gerard Cassidy","Don you talked a lot about the expense savings coming from the First Niagara deal, can you share with us some color on the revenue synergies, one line items, I guess cards and payments, I think you alluded to that line item seeing some benefit from the First Niagara deal, but what are the line items should we keep an eye on to see these revenue benefits when they show up later this year and into \u201818?","Don Kimble","I think you hit on one of the primary ones, which is the cards and payments and that reflects some of the impact of our treasuries, management services that we would expect to see as far as additional synergies there. The other is that mortgage for us has been very well and I know the mortgage rates going up is negative on the overall industry, but we have such a small share as far as our customer base on the mortgage product. And as we are launching that, we should start to see some real traction there as well. Beyond that, the capital markets, we talked earlier and Beth mentioned that we already had some successes in the first 60 days as far as closing, financing for some of the commercial real estate customers of First Niagara. And so we are starting to see some pickup on that side. And the last piece would just be an ongoing balance sheet growth, whether its deposits from the commercial treasury management services or even certain loan categories, where we could see growth pickup a little bit will be added to the picture as well.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. And I guess, I don\u2019t know Beth if you want to answer this, but now that you are obviously going into 6, 7 months of ownership here of the First Niagara deal and the integration, what were some of these positive surprises and maybe some of the challenges that you have experienced so far with this transaction?","Beth Mooney","Two positives, I would tell you, I am incredibly pleased that the retention we have seen of the talent at First Niagara, of the client base at First Niagara. We were very sensitive to our treatment of customers through the integration and making sure that we have identified who were the high-value customers and making sure that we gave out everybody a good treatment, but the extra treatment that was necessary. Because at the end of the day, those clients that we have acquired and their relationship managers are critical to the success of how we see the opportunity for growth out of First Niagara. And we see building a pipeline and the retention of clients and employees is a very positive sign. Also very proud of the way our teams planned and executed this integration. I would tell you that we at some level said it was going to be one for the record books and as we look at where we stand today and end the year, we go into 2017 in a business as usual mode and for the time horizon as well as the proximity to the conversion date of Columbus Day weekend, I think that\u2019s a very, very strong statement to be able to say. And then I think on the flipside, it\u2019s always a journey to make sure that you really bring these two companies together and build the culture and have a new Key, because I think that will be fundamental to our ability to deliver. I am extremely pleased with the cost savings and our trajectory and progress there. And as an all things, we squared our shoulders the weekend, the Friday before Columbus Day and said little things \u2013 things will go wrong that you don\u2019t expect and how you can be nimble and recover is critical to that and it\u2019s always something as they say.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Steven Alexopoulos","Hi, good morning everybody.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","Steven Alexopoulos","I want to start maybe Don, what percentage of the cost saves were included in the 4Q \u201816 run-rate?","Don Kimble","We had said third quarter we had achieved about $100 million of run-rate cost saves. I would say that the \u2013 we had some modest improvements in that in the fourth quarter, but still in that $100 million plus range. And so again, we would expect to see the majority of those really start to pickup in the first half of next year and be at a run-rate by mid next year with $400 million.","Steven Alexopoulos","So close, still pretty close to the $100 million.","Don Kimble","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. And I want to follow-up on Scott\u2019s earlier question, what is the expectation for IB in debt placement fees that you are including in the 2017 guidance?","Don Kimble","We are assuming growth from the $482 million for the full year this year and we haven\u2019t specifically said what level, but it would be growth from that point.","Steven Alexopoulos","And then maybe, thanks, just one final one, I know the average balances were pretty messy in the quarter given the deal. If I look at C&I loan growth and I use the period end data, is the growth seem to trail off a bit, I don\u2019t know if you read that much into a quarter. But maybe can you give some color on maybe what you saw in the quarter and expectations for C&I loan growth in 2017? Thanks.","Don Kimble","I would say one of the factors that impacted the period end balances on a quarter-over-quarter basis is the exit of the $330 million of non-relationship commercial credits that were within the First Niagara portfolio. And so adjusted for that we do believe that the growth is real, our pipelines remain strong for commercial growth and still believe it will be a driver of balance sheet growth for us next year \u2013 for this year, excuse me.","Steven Alexopoulos","Great. Thanks for all the color.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will go to Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Mike Mayo","Hi, good morning.","Don Kimble","Hi, Mike.","Mike Mayo","So Slide 15, you have taken $474 million in merger charges, how much more merger charges are there to go?","Don Kimble","When we announced the transaction, we talked about a target of $550 million in the aggregate and that was based in the $400 million cost save number. As we achieve numbers that would be in excess of the $400 million, that could go up slightly from that $550 million target but we are substantially through most of the cost saves and that one-time charge, excuse me.","Mike Mayo","Okay. And so is there a reserve like a merger charge reserve that you draw against? And if so, how much of that reserve is less or is this all, you use it as you charge it?","Don Kimble","We hit the one-time merger charges as we realized those expenses. And so this quarter for example, we had about a $29 million hit related to the branch consolidations. We had about $40 million worth of cancellation costs for contracts. And so those are more incurred as they are realized as opposed to set aside against the reserving.","Mike Mayo","And then last just a point of clarification, so your NII guidance for 2017 is 4% less than fourth quarter annualized NII, but I think if I heard you correctly, take out the $34 million, look back purchase accounting accretion attributed to the third quarter and then your guidance would be for flat NII with the fourth quarter. Am I looking at that correctly?","Don Kimble","Generally in line with that and I would say that the organic growth that we would be seeing in NII would be offset by the reduction in the purchase accounting accretion during the year.","Mike Mayo","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we will go to Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Kevin Barker","Previously, you discussed that First Niagara had some limited amount of density in some of the markets that you acquired when the deal was announced. And given that it seems like you have made quite a bit of progress on your goals around the acquisition. At what point you start looking at acquisitions once again and what are some of your goalposts before you actually start going back?","Don Kimble","Good question. I would say that of the new markets we are picking up, whether it\u2019s Connecticut, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, we are seeing market positions there that are usually in the top 5, but at a lower density in some of those markets been than there we would target. I would say that just like we have talked about before, our focus is really growing the franchise organically. We think that with our products and capabilities we can move market share. We are excited about the possibility of doing that and really not looking for acquisition strategies to fill in the gap.","Kevin Barker","Is there any point in time where you would feel that First Niagara is fully integrated and then you can start to look at that given you do have some excess capital post acquisition?","Don Kimble","Yes. Again, when First Niagara came along, we really felt that this was a unique opportunity for Key. And so we hadn\u2019t been actively out there looking for acquisitions. We want to make sure that our first priority continues to be realizing the financial benefits that we have outlined, making sure that our existing shareholders benefit from our ability to achieve those and then drive the organic growth going forward. Beth, anything you would add to that?","Beth Mooney","Yes, Don. I would say, Kevin, I think it\u2019s very clear that our first and clear and compelling priorities are to complete First Niagara, realize the value that we have committed to the street and for our shareholders. And as we went into this transaction a year ago, we have said for a very long time that we had \u2013 we lacked for nothing that we needed to be successful. And we continue to believe that we have a very strong business model that could generate organic growth and returns in long-term performance for our shareholders. So I think we are very clear about what we need to accomplish and on our priorities around long-term performance, capital and growth for our shareholders is our first priority.","Operator","Our next question is from Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.","Saul Martinez","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I want to follow-up on corporate tax reform and you obviously get quite a bit of benefit from tax credits, tax advantage, investment \u2013 you have addressed this in some of your other questions, but as the tax reform progresses, if it goes through Congress, what are some of the key issues, some of the key debates we should be looking at that could ultimately determine what the ultimate impact is and how much of it filters into your effective tax rate, whether it\u2019s BOLI\/COLI, whether it\u2019s low income housing, if you just kind of delineate what some of the major issues themes would be. And then secondly a clarification, I just want to make sure I got the number right, but you indicated that this quarter $100 million of the cost saves were embedded in the cost line similar to what you had last quarter, I just want to make sure that I heard that correctly?","Don Kimble","Let me answer your last question first, yes. But we did see some modest improvement in the cost savings realized, but still in that $100 million-plus type of range. And so I think that still is a good starting point for realization for this quarter. As far as tax reform, I think that this is again an industry wide issue. And I think things that would impact banks and other financial institutions would include the treatment of life insurance, would include tax credits associated with low income housing, energy related credits for lending activities. And then it will also include any type of treatment as far as bank specific items, including deductibility of interest expense. And so, I would be looking for those types of issues as the bills go through and see how that might impact the industry overall. And again, I truly believe that we will be in a position that will benefit along with the industry and really not being an outside position, either positively or negatively as a result of any reforms based on what we know at this point in time.","Saul Martinez","Okay, got it, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And we have a question from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Geoffrey Elliott","Hello, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I wondered if you could talk a bit about the opportunities that the First Niagara acquisition is giving you to expand into new businesses and particularly on indirect also you didn\u2019t have that, you have added a portfolio through that acquisition, which is relatively small in the context of Key overall, but was bigger for them, how do you think about growing that going forward, how does it fit into the strategy?","Beth Mooney","Yes. Geoffrey, this is Beth Mooney. And I would tell you that part of what we saw is a value of bringing our two companies together was there were some complementary products and capabilities that were going to newer to the benefit of Key. There were three principal businesses that they brought to Key that I believe, we will be able to benefit and first, as you indicated is indirect auto. They had about a $3 billion indirect auto portfolio. Key was not in that business line, but we have been a lender to dealerships through floor planning. So the ability to extend indirect auto to what is our book of business of dealers will be beneficial and an area for us to be able to extend that, both to cut the existing customers to deepen relationships and provide some growth for the bank. Second, it was an accelerator to our ability to re-enter the first mortgage business. As we announced in the second quarter of 2015, it was our intention to rebuild and to start back up the residential mortgage business. First Niagara, from originations through servicing had a full fledged mortgage capability that was an accelerator to us. So again, the levels of, Don alluded to it, while mortgage may be down due to rate, it is upside for a combined Key-First Niagara from where we would have been prior to that because those capabilities in that mortgage origination to servicing platform is fully up and running as of the fourth quarter. There was also a small insurance business that came with this and then as we look at our ability to extend specifically our cards payments, corporate treasury and capital markets capabilities into the First Niagara client base, we see many corresponding revenue opportunities as we extend ourselves into that First Niagara client base. From a revenue point of view, that is part of our confidence around that $300 million in synergies, but there really is a complementary opportunity for growth there.","Geoffrey Elliott","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Terry McEvoy","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Before FNFG, Key had an active strategy around the branch network as a way to really manage expenses, how are you thinking about the branch network, now that FNFG is behind you and are there opportunities that we will hear about later this year in terms of reducing the branch count and having some of the associated financial benefits?","Don Kimble","Terry, that\u2019s a good point. We talked before First Niagara of having a strategy of reducing our branch count by 2% to 3% a year. I would say that we still believe that there is opportunity to continue to right size our retail distribution and that might be a little bit slower in the next year because of the consolidations we did last year, but still in that 2% to 3% range overall.","Terry McEvoy","Thanks Don.","Operator","And next we will go to Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Peter Winter","Good morning.","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","Peter Winter","Key has a fairly sizable swamp portfolio, I am just wondering if there is any thoughts to let some of the swaps roll off to make the balance sheet more asset sensitive with thought that rates are going to start rising?","Don Kimble","Good. We look at that at an ongoing basis. And you are right that we do have a decent sized swap portfolio that, it\u2019s used to target our overall asset sensitivity position. We have about $4 billion worth of swaps to mature throughout 2017 and that gives us the opportunity to either replace those or let those expire. The other thing to keep in mind though, as we look at the maturity date of those swaps, if we would put a new swap on the books, it would really be reflecting the forward curve at that point in time. And so as rates are expected to increase, we will be receiving that benefit in the form of a swap throughout the term of that swap\u2019s life. And so that\u2019s one of the things we have to evaluate as we better off letting those swaps expire, or are we better off continuing to maintain the current position, but realize the benefit of those future increases and the new swaps we will be booking in the balance sheet.","Peter Winter","And how much is going to expire in \u201818?","Don Kimble","I don\u2019t have that number off the top of my head. But it\u2019s probably in a similar range, because we have an average life of a little over 2 years.","Peter Winter","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our final question is from Lana Chan with BMO. Please go ahead.","Lana Chan","Hi. Thanks. My question has been answered.

This call is being recorded.","At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Beth Mooney, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Beth Mooney","Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to KeyCorp\u2019s fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me for today\u2019s presentation is Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer; and available for the Q&A portion of the call is Chris Gorman, President of our Corporate Bank; E.J. Burke, and Dennis Devine, Co-Presidents of our Community Bank; and Bill Hartmann, our Chief Risk Officer.","Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call.","I\u2019m now turning to Slide 3. Our fourth quarter closes out what has been a very significant year for our company. We improved our operating performance, continued our credit discipline, maintained our strong capital position and made investments that will drive future growth and profitability.","For the year, Key generated positive operating leverage that we believe was among the strongest in our peer group. Our revenues were up 3%, and our pre-provision net revenue was up 5% both compared to the prior year. These results reflect our success in continuing to grow and expand client relationships in both the Community Bank and the Corporate Bank. And these new clients contributed to our 5% growth in average loans and 12% growth in CF&A balances.","We also increased our core fee-based income, including in investment banking and debt placement fees, which were up 12%, another record year for us. Corporate services and card and payments were both up 10%. And I think it\u2019s worth noting that these are areas where we have made recent investments that are generating growth and positive returns. Expense management also remained an area of focus.","During the year, we continue to execute on opportunities to right size our business, produce occupancy costs and improve operational efficiencies. Expense trends reflect our investment to drive future growth and profitability, as well as merger-related charges and those related to our continuous improvement and efficiency effort. Investments during the year included remixing our headcount to increase client facing roles in both the Corporate Bank and the Community Bank.","We also enhanced our payments capability, which have driven strong growth in purchase and prepaid card as well as a 13% increase year-over-year in credit card sales. And we continue to invest in our digital and mobile offerings as well as ongoing enhancements to our compliance and regulatory processes.","These were good investments that helped drive our revenue growth in 2015 and they will make an even larger contribution in the future as they fully mature. While these investments including the addition of 60 senior bankers and our Corporate and Community Bank, as well as Pacific Crest Securities position us for growth. They offset some of the efficiency improvements made in other areas of our company last year. Importantly, we remain committed to further improvement and the targets that we have established.","Credit quality remained a good story in 2015, but nonperforming loans down for the year and net charge-offs were 24 basis points, which is below our targeted range. We remain committed to strong risk management practices and staying true to our relationship focus.","The final item on the slide is capital. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio remains strong at a 11%, which we believe positioned us well for the 2016 CCAR process. And we expect both share repurchases and a dividend increase to be part of the capital plans we will submit.","I\u2019m now moving to Slide 4, which provides some highlights of our announced acquisition of First Niagara. We continue to make good progress as we move toward our anticipated closing in the third quarter of this year. Under the leadership of Chris Gorman, we have established integration teams with some of the top talent from both Key and First Niagara. And these teams have been focused on developing detailed assessments and moving forward with our integration plans.","As we move through these early stages, I\u2019m even more confident and this being the right opportunity for Key and our ability to realize the cost savings. The combined company will generate attractive financial returns and create value for our shareholders and accelerates our progress towards becoming a high performing regional bank.","And although not included in our financial projections, we will realize additional value from revenue synergies that will also add to the financial performance. We look forward to sharing more developments with you in the coming quarters as we move towards closing.","Before I turn the call over to Don, I would like to close my remarks by saying that it was a good year for Key. We executed against our strategic and financial goals and took steps to accelerate our progress going forward. I\u2019m proud of our team and of our performance. And I\u2019m excited about the opportunities that we have ahead.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Don to discuss the details of our fourth quarter results. Don?","Don Kimble","Thanks, and I\u2019m on Slide 6. As Beth said, we had a good year finishing with fourth quarter net income from continuing operations of $0.27 per common share, this compared to $0.28 on the year-ago period and $0.26 in the third quarter.","In the fourth quarter, Key incurred $10 million of charges related to pension settlement in the acquisition of the First Niagara. The combined impact was $0.01 per common share. Excluding these items, net income from continuing operations was $0.28 per common share, the same as the year-ago quarter.","However, it\u2019s worth noting in comparison with the year-ago period that the current quarter includes $23 million in the higher provision expense, and $18 million in lower principal investing gains, giving us a strong finish to the year. Also that on the slide is our revenue growth. For the quarter, revenue was up 2% from the prior year, and up 3% from the prior quarter. For the full-year, Key had revenue growth of over 3%, reflecting the success we\u2019ve had in growing our business. This revenue growth has allowed us to grow our pre-provision net revenues 5% year-over-year. I will cover the other items on the \u2013 within, rest of my presentations. I\u2019m now turning it over to Slide 7.","Average loan balances were up $3 billion or 5% compared to year-ago quarter, and up $295 million in the third quarter. Our year-over-year growth was once again driven primarily by commercial, financial, and agricultural loans, and it was broad-based across Key\u2019s business lending segments. Average CF&A loans were up $3.7 billion or 14% compared to the prior year, and we\u2019re $510 million or 2% on annualized in the third quarter. During the current quarter, we continue to generate strong customer growth that was muted by pay downs of lines through existing customers.","Continuing on the Slide 8. On the liability side of the balance sheet, average deposits excluding deposits in foreign office totaled $71.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $2.3 billion compared to the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year increase is reflective of our growth in our commercial mortgage servicing business and inflows from commercial and consumer clients.","Compared to the third quarter of 2015, average deposits excluding deposits in foreign office, increased by $1.5 billion. The growth was driven by both seasonal and short-term deposit inflows from commercial clients along with growth in NOW and money market deposit accounts and certificates of deposit.","Turning to Slide 9. Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $610 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. And the net interest margin was 2.87%. These results compared to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $588 million and a net interest margin of 2.94% for the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase in net interest income reflects higher earning asset balances, partially offset by lower earning asset yields, which also drove the decline in the net interest margin.","Compared to the third quarter of 2015, taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $12 million and the net interest margin was unchanged. The increase in net interest income and the stable net interest margin were attributable to higher earning asset yields, and loan fees. And while net interest margin was stable, it was negatively impacted by higher levels of excess liquidity driven by short-term commercial deposit growth.","Slide 10 shows the summary of noninterest income, which accounted for 44% of our total revenues. Noninterest income in the fourth quarter was $485 million, down $5 million or a 1% from the prior year, and up $15 million or 3% from the prior quarter. A slight decrease from the prior year was attributed to lower net gains from principal investing of $18 million and $7 million of lower trust and investment services incomes reflecting market variability. These decreases were partially offset by $12 million increase in other income gains in our Real Estate Capital line of business. Along with growth in some of Key\u2019s other core fee-based business including $4 million of higher cards and payments income and $4 million increase in mortgage servicing fees.","Compared to last quarter, noninterest income improved by $15 million, most notably from higher investment banking and debt placement fees that marking a strong finish to a record year. Additionally, other income went higher once again related to the gains in Real Estate Capital. And corporate-owned life insurance increase reflecting normal seasonality. These items were offset by lower net gains in principal investing.","Turning to Slide 11. As you can see on this slide, expense levels were elevated and reflected a number of moving pieces. I\u2019ll start with the current quarter. Noninterest expense was $736 million, which included $20 million of charges consisting of $10 million of \u2013 excuse me, efficiency charges primarily related to branch closures and severance, $6 million of merger-related costs and $4 million of pension settlement expense.","Next, compared to the fourth quarter of last year, our noninterest expenses up 5%, the increase was primarily attributed to $20 million of higher personnel costs, reflecting a $11 million increase in benefit cost. The investments in client-facing personnel cost across the company and higher severance expense. We also had a $6 million of merger-related cost.","And finally linked quarter expenses were up 2% related $12 million of higher incentive compensation related to strong capital market performance and end of the year accruals, $6 million of merger-related cost incurred in the fourth quarter and $6 million of higher efficiency-related charges. These are partially offset by the lower pension settlement charge.","Once again, the current quarter included elevated levels of expenses reflecting the cost noted above in normal seasonal trends. We would expect first quarter expense levels to be significantly lowered in the fourth quarter. Also we would expect the full-year 2016 expenses to be relatively stable with 2015, adjusted from merger-related costs.","Turning to Slide 12. The net charge-offs were $37 million or 25 basis points of average total loans in the fourth quarter, which continues to be below our targeted range. In the fourth quarter provision for credit losses of $45 million, slightly above the level of charge-offs, reflecting current trends in our portfolio.","Nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets were both down relative to the prior quarter and year-ago period. At December 31, 2015, our reserve for total losses represented 1.33% of period end loans, and 206% coverage of our nonperforming loans. It is also worth noting that our energy exposure is small, representing 2% of our total portfolio and it\u2019s performed in line with our expectations. We\u2019ve built reserves throughout the year, which currently represents 6% of outstanding loans.","Turning to Slide 13. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was strong at December 31 of 2015 at 10.95%. There were no share repurchases in the fourth quarter. For the full-year, we repurchased $460 million of common shares. We expect share repurchases and increase dividend to be included in our upcoming 2016 CCAR submission.","Now moving on to Slide 14. For 2016 outlook, we\u2019re providing guidance on a standalone Key operations. In 2016, we expect continue to drive positive operating leverage. Average loans should grow in the mid single-digit range as we benefit from the strength in our commercial businesses. We anticipate that net interest income growth in the low single-digit percentage range compared to 2015 without any benefit from higher interest rates.","With the benefit of future rate increases, we would anticipate net interest income to be up in the mid single-digit range. It\u2019s also important to note that we have assumed that deposit rates will increase with future rate increases. Noninterest income is expected to be up at mid single-digit percentage range for the year. This assumes continued strong improvement, investment banking and debt placement fees, as well as continued growth in cards and payments income. We\u2019re also assuming very modest levels of principal investing gains for 2016.","Full-year afforded expenses should be relatively stable 2015. We would expect to see normal seasonal trends and expenses where first quarter expense was down significantly from the fourth quarter level. Credit quality should remain a good story with net charge-offs below our targeted range of 40 basis to 60 basis points. We also expect provision levels to maintain a stable level of allowance to total loans.","And finally we expect our dividend to increase in the second quarter to $0.85 per share. And the 2016 CCAR plans include both common share repurchases and an increased dividend. Our guidance excludes the impact of merger-related charges, as well the acquisition of First Niagara. If the acquisition closes in the third quarter as planned, we would expect EPS impact be a slight dilution of 1% to 2% in 2016 and accretive in 2017.","With that I\u2019ll close and turn the call back over to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of our call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we go to the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey guys, this is Josh in for Ken. Can you just talk about what rate assumption do you include with that NII guidance with rates?","Don Kimble","Sure. Our assumptions would be to have two additional rate increases for 2016 both of which in the second half of the year and then the last of which toward the end of the year.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then secondly, can you just talk to the ID pipeline and what you are seeing here in the outlook?","Chris Gorman","Sure, Josh, it\u2019s Chris. As we look at our pipeline kind of across the Corporate Bank, our pipelines are very much in line with where they were a year-ago. And as Don mentioned, we had a record year last year. So we actually feel very good about our pipelines.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thanks a lot guys.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","And next up to Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Erika Najarian","Beth, just wanted to ask a question on something you mentioned during your prepared remarks. You mentioned that you are even more confident about the First Niagara deal after in terms of extracting cost savings. Could you give us a little bit of color in terms of the conversations or the progress that you have made after announcing the deal in terms of seeking about the future impact? And also with the progresses in terms of getting First Niagara ready to be embedded into your CCAR process?","Beth Mooney","Yes, Erika, I\u2019d be glad to discuss that and I\u2019ll let Don address the CCAR portion because he\u2019s closer to that work than I am. And you are correct that I\u2019m even more confident and we feel even stronger about the path and quality of what will be the value of this combined \u2013 of these combined company.","On the cost savings, as you know we had targeted $400 million or approximately 40% of their cost. And while in early days, the integration teams have been identified and are working two-by-two to map out those plans and as we really understand the underlying cost structure particularly in technology, operations, vendor expense, there are significant savings in all of those areas that probably contribute to over 40% of that $400 million.","So out of the gates as we look for the path, well, nothing is ever easy. We also see very real savings that are easy to garner and we\u2019ll also be realized fairly, early within the debt time after our acquisition. We\u2019re also looking at our complimentary business capabilities and revenue synergies that we continue to gain confidence about the value that will be created there. So, in all I do think you hear a continued tone of confidence, as well as a path forward that we feel strongly about.","Don Kimble","And as far as the CCAR process, we will be including First Niagara within assumed acquisition date in the third quarter as we\u2019ve talked about before for the CCAR submission. We will be relying primarily on Key models in the past, and using the First Niagara information where we can to \u2013 run through our existing models as well. And so, we will show within the plan a separate amount for both First Niagara and Key in standalone basis, but the total CCAR plan will include the assumption that First Niagara is a part in the third quarter.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And really appreciate the color, the look forward color on the 2016 CCAR submission. And as we think about \u2013 the amount of common share repurchases, should we assume that \u2013 given that First Niagara is part of your two-year plan, that the 2016 be a buyback as it would be lighter than the up to $725 million that you had approved for 2015?","Don Kimble","I think it\u2019s too early to assume that the absolute dollar amounts. So, what we do believe and do expect to see a significant portion of share buybacks, as well as an increase in our dividend for the 2016 CCAR, but we\u2019ll have to work through that over the next several months and finalize those remaining details.","Erika Najarian","Okay. Thank you.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Next, we will go to Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","Scott Siefers","Good morning, guys.","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Scott Siefers","Just wanted to ask a question on overall loan growth. Now based on the guide for 2016, it looks like there are no hiccups or anything. But it just was a little caught off guard by the slowdown in the few categories and then the overall rate of loan growth in the fourth quarter. So, either Don or Beth, I was just hoping you could update us on your thoughts on overall loan demand trends you\u2019re seeing et cetera.","Don Kimble","Sure. As far as the overall loan growth that if you look at the average balances, I would say on a year-over-year basis, we\u2019re up 5%, we\u2019re saying for next year mid single-digits. Pipelines remained strong. We had a very strong third quarter. And so, if you\u2019re just looking at a period end balances, there clearly was some slowdown in the period end balances because of some temporary flows in and out during that subsequent period. But I would say that we\u2019re continuing to see very strong growth in our commercial business.","You will probably see some slower growth from Key and our commercial real estate area and that\u2019s intentional as far as some of the credit disciplines we\u2019re maintaining and backing off of some of the higher growth areas from a multifamily perspective and also adjusting our outlook as far as due to housing and few areas like that. So you could see a lot less construction loan activity from Key than you might be seeing from some of our peers.","Beth Mooney","And Scott, I would just follow-on with the notion that Don did say, we had an extremely strong third quarter and there are some variability quarter-to-quarter. But I think it was a good quarter and obviously a good year and when you look to our guidance for 2016 was mid-single-digit and continue to strengthen our commercial businesses. I look at that across the spectrum and continue to say this is an area of strength and where we have been investing in our senior bankers in order to drive growth through client acquisition.","Scott Siefers","Perfect. All right, that\u2019s good color. Thank you.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","John Pancari","A couple of questions here, back to First Niagara, just any thing about the updated macro environment or are there mid energy concerns here or just overall U.S. economics developments. Anything influencing your mark that you took that would make you have to revisit that?","Don Kimble","The marks that we\u2019ll be taking will be done as of the close date. And so I would say that as what we\u2019re experiencing, I don\u2019t think there is any outsize risk from the marks on the First Niagara portfolio from a loan broker or others that would suggest any overall concerns there. But again we\u2019ll finalize those toward the acquisition date and make sure that we have the appropriate evaluation within that time.","John Pancari","Okay. And then separately, I wanted to get your \u2013 and sorry if I missed this, but I wanted to get your updated thoughts on the manufacturing sector as it pertains to impacting loan growth as well as credit. I know we\u2019ve seen some \u2013 the industrial space seen some pressure here and some banks have flagged, some incremental concern there, but wanted to get your updated thoughts. Thanks.","Chris Gorman","So, John, it\u2019s Chris. Clearly as we\u2019re out talking to customers everyday, a 2% growth in the economy coupled with the strong dollar, it\u2019s not without challenges. Having said that, our clients are sitting on more cash than ever or having more strategic discussions than we ever have with our clients and a 2% loan growth you to have either \u2013 expand the same challenges we do. You have to either figure out how you can take share or how you can grow externally. And so in a way that\u2019s a bit of a catalyst for our business.","So it certainly isn\u2019t rosy. Growth is as I said probably 2%, but the companies are in good shape. They have a lot of cash and they are looking to do things strategically. Broadly, when you have sales of $17.5 million cars and trucks at retail that has a positive impact on what business banking clients, middle market clients and other clients because a lot of the folks obviously are part of the supply chain.","John Pancari","Okay. And then lastly just going back to the strong 3Q, you said that you saw in loan growth. So is it fair to think \u2013 fair to focus more on the end of period balances here as we model out in terms of the real trends we\u2019re seeing in loan growth?","Don Kimble","I don\u2019t know that I would want to stay on the period end balances, but it happens to work out this quarter that if you look at our average balances in the fourth quarter they are lower than the period end. So if we continue that kind of momentum going forward, it would imply a mid-single-digit kind of year-over-year growth. So I would say that\u2019s a reflect of this quarter but not necessarily every quarter.","John Pancari","Yes, got it. All right, thanks, Don.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to David Eads with UBS. Please go ahead.","David Eads","Hi, good morning.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","David Eads","Curious to get any color you guys might have on what you are seeing in the energy vertical and in your capital market business in terms of where people are going for capital, where the discussions are, whether the people \u2013 whether you guys are involved in restructuring discussions or asset yield discussion, just kind of what the state of play from where you stand is there?","Chris Gorman","So, this is Chris. I think the answer is all the above. I think depending on where in sort of the capital stack companies are clearly the amount of high yield debt that was raised when the cycle first started to turn over, that has dissipated the amount of private equity that has come in, I think that has started to dissipate. And I do think people are looking at asset sales, whole company sales and other forms of restructuring. So I think with oil trading $26 or $27 a barrel, I think people are looking at all options. And we are part of those discussions.","David Eads","Has there been a change to the percentage of capital raised potential, the balance sheet, I think it dipped a little bit in brief. I\u2019m just curious where that shook out in 4Q?","Chris Gorman","The actual capital raised in the oil and gas sector was actually down in the fourth quarter.","David Eads","If you give a number more broadly for sorry little bit unclear on the broader business?","Chris Gorman","I\u2019m sorry, broadly what \u2013 for the year in our capital \u2013 in our entire Corporate Bank platform we\u2019ve raised $57 billion across all the verticals and about $9.3 billion or say 16% actually went on to our balance sheet.","David Eads","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Ramsey with FBR. Please go ahead.","Bob Ramsey","Hey, good morning everyone. Credit trends looked good and all the numbers I see out there, I\u2019m just curious as you guys think about credit, if you are incrementally more or less cautious, maybe a quarter or a year-ago?","Bill Hartmann","Bob, this is Bill Hartmann. I think as we look at credit in our portfolio, we have a very, very granular portfolio which is one of the ways that we like to balance things out. I would pick up on Chris\u2019s comments about the general overall trend in our low growth economy. We\u2019re being diligent to look for any signs of weakness. And what we\u2019re seeing is really reflective in Chris\u2019s comments, which is there are certain sectors where we\u2019re seeing weakness. But overall the trends that we\u2019re showing in our numbers, say that the overall portfolio quality remains high.","Bob Ramsey","Okay. And I guess sectors, where you are seeing weakness, I know you mentioned manufacturing a little bit, but beyond that and maybe energy, where else we\u2019ll be seeing some weakness?","Bill Hartmann","We\u2019re not seeing any weakness per se, but we have been cautious for a while now in talking about multifamily and being conscious about where we invest and how we do that, and then student housing was another area.","Bob Ramsey","Okay. Great, thank you.","Operator","And next we go to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning everyone. Don\u2026","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Gerard Cassidy","You mentioned that \u2013 on the other commercial lending areas, those balances obviously are down and you guys are sticking to your credit disciplines, there\u2019s been some talk about the multifamily and student loan housing markets that you\u2019re seeing some weakness. Can you share with us some of the underwriting criteria that you\u2019re seeing out there, that makes you hesitant to get involved or is it just overbuilding that has you concerned in these markets?","Chris Gorman","Gerard, it\u2019s Chris. We look at a lot of metrics. You can start with some of the cap rates and they range from in large gateway cities 5%, in some instances even 4%. And those were sort of priced to perfection. We spend a lot of time looking at what the rent to wage ratio is, i.e. the affordability of these Class A multifamily apartment buildings. Those are some of the metrics we look out. And then we also spend a lot of time looking at what people are doing out in the market, how far out are they going, are they doing non-recourse loans. What percent of our book for example is non-stabilized? We\u2019re now down to 13% of our total commitments in real estate are non-stabilized. So those are some of the metrics we\u2019re looking at.","Gerard Cassidy","And Chris, when you mentioned the cap rates of 4% to 5% price to perfection, what do you guys more comfortable with even with that specific metric of a cap rate?","Chris Gorman","It\u2019s really \u2013 you\u2019d have to look at market-by-market and really what the opportunity is. But I can tell you when you get to a 4% cap rate that has built into those assumptions that it\u2019ll lease up \u2013 that it will lease up quickly and you will be able to get rent increases going forward. And we just think that \u2013 we just think that those are a lot of variables.","Gerard Cassidy","And just finally on this commercial real estate, have you guys seen any evidence, the regulators came out late last year with concerns about the commercial real estate market underwriting? Is there any evidence yet that\u2019s sinking into banks to kind of be a little more conservative?","Chris Gorman","We are seeing that in the marketplace, I am \u2013 we \u2013 of course we\u2019re familiar with the sort of prudent lending memo that came out I think in the fourth quarter. E.J. is sitting next to me. I think the last time the regulators sent out such a memo in real estate it was when?","E.J. Burke","2005.","Chris Gorman","2005. And so I think \u2013 we actually think the regulators are right. We think the market is a little hot in certain areas and that\u2019s why by strategy we\u2019ve been really toggling more to agent from principal.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. And then my final question is, in the Community Bank, you guys show the assets and the management dropped, I think 13% maybe year-over-year. Can you just give us some color on what\u2019s going on in that part of the business?","E.J. Burke","This is E.J. Burke. Included in that \u2013 in the $39 billion from 2014, is a sub line of business that we call institutional asset services. And in that business there is a securities lending function, which has been \u2013 is not something we\u2019ve been growing. We had a couple clients exit so about $4 billion of that drop were two clients that left, that we\u2019re doing now \u2013 we are doing even securities lending form. Not much. You\u2019ll note that our \u2013 the drop in our \u2013 the difference in our trust and investment services revenue wasn\u2019t nearly that big.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And next we\u2019ll go to Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Terry McEvoy","Hi, good morning.","Don Kimble","Hey, Terry.","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","Terry McEvoy","Hi. Don, you talked about higher deposit rates in your NIM outlook. Could you provide maybe your deposit data assumption? Do they differ at all by region? And how that would compare to past cycles?","Don Kimble","Yes, that \u2013 what our base assumption is we\u2019re about a 55% deposit beta, and there isn\u2019t a whole lot of fluctuation by region, that\u2019s more of a general assumption. It does get more granular at the product level, so we would use that. And essentially what we have included in our guidance is our assumptions here include the outlook that our deposit rates would increase that same deposit beta level for future rate increases. And so there is some potential opportunity there, if that would lag initially.","Terry McEvoy","Okay. And then just a follow-up for Beth. Every time I read my hometown newspaper in Western New York, it seems like a politician or a business leader is saying something against the First Niagara deal. And I guess my question is, is this type or was this expected? Is a little bit more than you expected? And could there be any additional costs or concessions that you have to make to get the deal done in terms of expenses and\/or divestitures of branches and deposits?","Beth Mooney","Yes, Terry. It is clearly an area where it is a large acquisition in an environment where there have not been many significant acquisitions in the last several years. So it has garnered a fair amount of intention \u2013 attention, but we have been very diligent and consistent in our outraged community leaders and public officials and I believe we\u2019re having very, very constructive dialogue. In part, Key is a very good partner for this franchise and as we look at the story, we have to tell in our long-standing track record in community investment, community development, a straight CRA outstanding ratings which no other top banking company has ever received.","I think we\u2019ve gone a long way to setting a very constructive town for the kind of neighbor, the kind of bank and the kind of partner we will be. So we\u2019ve made a lot of commitment, not only about achieving our financial targets, but also about doing the right things for clients, employees, communities and shareholders. And I believe that we\u2019re obviously in the process with the Department of Justice, who will make the determinations on the divestiture numbers. And working through our plans and our progress and I think we will be a good and significant partner and good for those communities and those customers.","Terry McEvoy","Thank you for taking my questions.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Next we will go to Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Good morning.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","Matt O\u2019Connor","As we think about the expense progression throughout the year, should we expect any meaningful lumpiness? Stable for the full-year, but first half on a year-over-year basis, for second half on a year-over-year basis, should be relatively stable I guess for both periods?","Don Kimble","Yes, that, just from a seasonal tend our first quarter trends to be our lowest point as far as expense levels and so we would expect a meaningful or if we said significant reduction from our fourth quarter level. Then you would typically expect the fourth quarter to be one of the higher quarters as far as the expenses. So I think you would see a similar trend overall as far as the expense levels. Keep in mind, that first quarter of last year our investment banking and debt placement fees were low, and so our incentive compensation would have been low last year compared to probably what you would expect in the first quarter of next year, because we would expect to have a nice increase in investment banking and debt placement fees for the first quarter compared to a year-ago.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. Don, that partially answer the question. I guess, what I\u2019m trying to get out is, as we think about keeping expenses flat, do we see some increase on the year-over-year basis in the first half of the year, and then some of the efficiencies kick in, in the back half of the year. You kind of just said 1Q might be up on a year-over-year because of the incentives. But just conceptually kind of first half, second half?","Don Kimble","Yes, I would say that our expense initiatives are continuous throughout the year. So I don\u2019t think there is going to be any lumpiness there. I think, as you just repeated we would expect first quarter expenses in 2016 to be higher than 2015 reflecting the overall performance outlook expectations, higher revenue during that quarter from those business lines.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay, all right thank you.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from David Durst with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","David Durst","Hi, Good morning.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","David Durst","Could you speak to the continuous improvement program and where do you think you are on percentage of completion and month of those expenses could be for the year?","Don Kimble","Continuous improvement I hope we\u2019re never done. So this is something that we believe, this is part of our culture and continue to focus on that. And we\u2019ve just implemented a number of areas which created some of the charges we\u2019ve had in the fourth quarter as it relates to our private banking area and restructuring. And so that\u2019s just one example of where we do deeper dives in the specific areas, looking from everything from the customer interface all the way through to the back office and making sure that we\u2019re designing that in a way that can be more effective with that customer interaction, but also more efficient for us from a cost perspective. So we would expect to see ongoing opportunities at a similar size of what we\u2019ve been experiencing this year.","David Durst","Okay, and then on the private investing gains, what\u2019s your outlook for those this year and then what\u2019s the balance of that portfolio?","Don Kimble","The principal investing gains as we showed was zero for the current quarter that our outlook is, show very modest levels of gains for next year. So it would be a smaller level than clearly what we had throughout this year. And the current balance is around $300 million of investments, and so we would see reductions from that balance just because we are about $450 million starting the year. So we\u2019re down about two-thirds the level we were a year-ago.","David Durst","Got it, okay. Thank you.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Next we go to Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.","Marty Mosby","Thanks. Chris, I want to ask you, you did a really good job with debt placement investment banking this quarter, given all the disruptions in the marketplace. Didn\u2019t really expect you to be able to can just blow through that like it had no impact, are there anything that you see on the horizon or anything that\u2019s been happening that would put any pressure on a sense of being able to pull those deals through?","Chris Gorman","Sure, Marty. Obviously, we like everybody else are subjected to the markets, and to the extent that the markets would continue as they have been in the last two weeks or three weeks. Our ability to pull through our pipeline, the yield to our pipeline would be less. We are really proud of the way we navigated what was a very choppy fourth quarter in the debt markets. So we\u2019re really pleased that we\u2019ve been able to distribute all the paper that we had.","But to your point, if we were to face very, very choppy markets going forward, that would have an impact in the first place as you would see the impact would be in the M&A area, and also you\u2019d see obviously a related impact in the financing areas.","Marty Mosby","Then while the investment banking debt placement was good, trust and your investment was down in what typically be an upturn kind of in the back end of the year. Don, I was just curious was that all market value-related, and would we see further impacts as you move into the first quarter given the first couple of weeks and compression we\u2019ve seen in a market valuations?","Don Kimble","The impact there really was in two areas. One is that, some of that is commission revenue and revenue was down this quarter, reflecting some of the market related activities. And then the other piece was that we did see some pressure on asset value, which created some pressure on the revenues there. First quarter is not off to a great start as far as asset values. And so I think that\u2019s an area that would continue to have some pressure throughout 2016, but our guidance \u2013 that mid single-digit kind of growth reflected seeing some pressure in that area.","Marty Mosby","Thanks.","Operator","And we will go to Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Geoffrey Elliott","Thanks for taking the question. I\u2019m \u2013 I guess that it feels like some companies are starting to get a bit more nervous on the credit outlook. So what are the early indicators that you typically look at to get a sense of what that credit might be turning, a few quarters out, and how they performing?","Bill Hartmann","Geoffrey, this is Bill Hartmann. So, in our portfolio monitoring activities we have a number of different metrics that we look at that we refer to as early warning indicators. Some of them are macro and we take a look at how those macro indicators might impact our portfolios by industry, and by region. And then we also look at the performance of the companies themselves, and in the conversations that our bankers are having about the way that the companies prepare themselves for changes in the economic environment.","As Chris mentioned, one of the things that we\u2019re noticing and have noticed for a while is that many of these companies are being very conservative by carrying larger amounts of cash which show up in the deposits that we have. And there also the growth in loans is not necessarily been with the customers that we have, because they\u2019re not going at it investing in an environment that\u2019s only growing at 2% to 3%.","Marty Mosby","So I understand that you\u2019re saying that you think the higher cash balances give you more protection \u2013 higher cash balances at corporate give you more protection than you would have had in prior corporate cycle, that\u2019s kind of the message you\u2019re trying to get across?","Don Kimble","Yes, I think what we\u2019re saying is that the customers themselves still remember the last cycle. And liquidity became extremely important in the way in which they manage themselves through a cycle. And so by carrying a larger cash balances it gives them more of an ability to manage their companies successfully through the cycle, which benefits us in their ability to survive.","Marty Mosby","Great. Thank you.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Next we go to Peter Winter with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.","Peter Winter","Good morning.","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","Peter Winter","Don, just one has housekeeping item. The FDIC deposit insurance surcharge, just wondering I know it\u2019s proposed but what the impact would be for you guys?","Don Kimble","There would be a slight impact that it wouldn\u2019t be significant to the overall expense base.","Peter Winter","Okay. Is that included in the 4Q?","Don Kimble","It would be in our guidance. Yes.","Peter Winter","Got it. And then just a question for E.J. just on the Community Bank with \u2013 just wondering if you could talk about the loan trends and what you\u2019re seeing in small business loan demand?","E.J. Burke","For small business?","Peter Winter","Yes.","E.J. Burke","I would turn that to my partner Dennis Devine, he has a small business. I can talk to commercial banking, which is kind of our lower end and middle market.","Peter Winter","Okay.","Dennis Devine","I\u2019ll take the rest.","E.J. Burke","Okay. Both, we\u2019ll let \u2013 first of all in the commercial banking segment we had a very good quarter from a loan production standpoint, and then for the year we\u2019ve had good loan growth. We did see some clients pay us down in the quarter. They didn\u2019t pay as off, they just paid us down. And digging beneath those numbers and talking to clients, we found that, as Bill alluded to earlier, they\u2019re carrying higher cash balances paying us down. So we feel pretty good going into the year around our pipelines. And then finally, the last thing I\u2019d say is that we\u2019ve talked for the past couple of quarters about the fact that we\u2019ve hired a number of bankers across the franchise. Those bankers are ramping up and we\u2019re starting to see a good production and new client acquisition from those bankers. Dennis?","Dennis Devine","Small business would be comparable. The sentiment would be about the same. The \u2013 our production has been up a little bit, as much focused around our execution of anything else. The ability to deliver to small business clients is important. And so both the capabilities of our branches, our business banking [indiscernible] and some centralized capabilities we\u2019ve brought to market. So you see some year-over-year production increases against a relatively stable outlook as both E.J. and Chris have spoken to.","Peter Winter","Got it. Thanks, very much.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go to Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Matt Burnell","Good morning. Thank for taking my questions. Again just an administrative question I guess on the oil and gas portfolio, you\u2019ve mentioned what\u2019s your outstanding exposures are. I\u2019m curious what\u2019s your commitments in that sector might be? And whether or not they\u2019ve changed much over the last quarter or last 12 months?","Bill Hartmann","This is Bill Hartmann. So our total commitments to the sector are approximately $3 billion. They have been coming down slightly over the last 12 months or so. I think that\u2019s your question.","Matt Burnell","Yes. Thanks, very much. And then Beth, I know that your commentary about the initial days of the planning for the First Niagara acquisition. And I guess I\u2019m just curious, maybe it\u2019s a matter of just \u2013 a little bit of color. But are you suggesting that there could be, if not just cost savings above the $400 million that you\u2019ve targeted, perhaps a faster ramp up of the cost savings? And are you suggesting that your level of confidence in terms of the potential revenue synergies is better than you guided when you announced the deal?","Beth Mooney","Yes, Matt. I\u2019ll go ahead and talk about that. I do believe that our confidence in the cost savings both the path for some of the timing, as I talked about some of third-party vendor contracts, their technology and operations largely being in an outsourced world gives us a fair amount of certainty around the cost, as well as ability to realize savings in early days of the integration. And as we look at our detailed planning, which again is still early days, but our planning would suggest. We believe that there are more opportunities over and above the $400 million.","So just in general as we firm up path and plans I think we\u2019re feeling stronger and better. And as we look at the revenue synergies, we quoted in our call that we had in late October around $300 million in revenue synergies was the numbers that we had put out there, obviously with some offsetting costs on that numbers something less than that around $200 million. And I think what we\u2019re really seeing is more confidence around the places in the way that we would realize those revenue synergies.","We see the complementary nature of our business models they are accelerating our compliance within the mortgage space. And as we\u2019d look generally around the cultures and the product capabilities and their client base, we see \u2013 are getting more confident about the path on the revenue synergies.","Matt Burnell","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Kevin Barker","Just a follow-up on the energy question. What is the percentage of criticized assets that you have in your energy portfolio at this time?","Don Kimble","We have about 31% of our energy assets are criticized.","Kevin Barker","Great. And then a follow-up on some of your comments regarding commercial real estate and some of the regulatory concerns. Could you help us, just give us a little more color around what sectors and what regions of the country you are seeing particular softness or just froth in general regarding commercial real estate?","Chris Gorman","Sure, this is Chris. Specifically Kevin we\u2019re really focused on multifamily Class A multifamily. And some of the areas that we\u2019ve identified or places like Houston, Raleigh, D.C., Boston, Denver, Seattle, just to name a few.","Kevin Barker","Are you seeing anything in regards to hotel sector or even retail?","Chris Gorman","We don\u2019t participate in the hotel sector, so that\u2019s not something we focus on.","Kevin Barker","And then what about regards to retail?","Chris Gorman","Retail is not a big part of our business either. So we\u2019re not really \u2013 what we\u2019re really most dialed in on in terms of areas of concern is really the froth in the multifamily area.","Kevin Barker","Okay. All right, thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","And with that we have no further questions in queue.","Beth Mooney","All right, thank you, operator. And again to all, we thank you for taking time from your schedule to participate in our call today. If you have any follow-up questions, you can direct them to our Investor Relations team at 216-689-4221 and that concludes our remarks.

Please go ahead.","Beth Mooney","Thank you, operator. Good morning. And welcome to KeyCorp's third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Joining me for the call is Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer; Chris Gorman, our newly appointed President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Midkiff, our Chief Risk Officer.","Slide 2 is our statement and forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments, as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call.","I'm now moving to Slide 3. And before I review our quarterly results, I want to comment on our leadership transition that we announced last month. In keeping with our thorough and robust succession planning process developed by our Board of Directors, I announced my upcoming retirement effective May 1st of next year and Chris Gorman was appointed President and Chief Operating Officer and a member of our Board of Directors.","Chris will succeed me as Chairman and CEO next May. And I will have opportunities to speak with you over the next several quarters. But I just want to say that my time at Key has represented some of my most rewarding years of my 40 years in banking.","I\u2019m proud at what this team has accomplished as we have transformed this company, our culture, our strategy and our performance. And importantly, I will remain fully engaged over the next seven months and I\u2019m committed to working with Chris for a seamless leadership transition. I look forward to Key\u2019s continued success under Chris with our diverse and talented leadership team and I have a very confidence in our future success.","Now moving on to the results we reported this morning. My remarks will adjust for our previously reported fraud loss and notable items in prior periods. So let me start with a few headlines.","Earnings per share grew 7% from the year ago period and 9% from the second quarter. We reached the top end of our targeted cash efficiency ratio range of 54% to 56% with a reported 56% which is our lowest level in over a decade.","We delivered another quarter of positive operating leverage, driven by both revenue growth and a 3% sequential quarter decline in expenses. And we saw solid balance sheet growth and strong fee income with a record third quarter for investment banking and debt placement fees.","On the revenue side, we saw good momentum across our company. We grew both loans and deposits 4% from the prior year, driven by activity in both our commercial and consumer businesses.","We generated another quarter of strong broad based growth in commercial and industrial loans and saw higher consumer loan balances driven by Laurel Road and strength in our consumer mortgage lending.","Non-interest income was up 7% from the year ago period benefiting from strong investment banking and debt placement fees, as well as growth in corporate services and consumer mortgage income.","As I said, non-interest expense was down 3% from the year ago period and reflects the successful execution of our cost initiatives, as well as our ongoing commitment to continuous improvement. And I would remind you that our expense levels relative to the prior year include the addition of our Laurel Road acquisition earlier this year.","Importantly, although we are focused on bringing expenses down, we continue to invest a portion of our cost savings back into the business to drive future growth. And we continue to manage the company with a long-term perspective by taking action to position us to perform through the business cycle. This includes maintaining our disciplined credit writing - underwriting and our risk profile.","We also continue to manage capital, consistent with our stated capital priorities including returning a significant portion of our earnings back to our shareholders. In the third quarter, we increased our quarterly common stock dividend by 9% to $18.50 per share and continue to repurchase shares.","Before I turn the call over to Don, let me just say that this was a good quarter for Key and clearly demonstrates the strength and resiliency of our business model. We saw topline growth in loans, deposits, and fees and paired this with strong expense control. This drove our cash efficiency ratio to 56%, hitting our targeted range this quarter.","Clearly there are some headwinds with lower interest rates and a sign of a slowing economy, and although our clients have turned more cautious, we continue to see good engagement and solid pipelines.","Our business model and the interest rate hedging also positions us well as we move through the different business cycles and rate environments. And expense management also remains a priority as we continue to identify opportunities to further improve efficiency.","We remain committed to reaching our long-term targets, maintaining our moderate risk profile and ultimately delivering results for our shareholders.","With that, I will close and turn the call over to Don.","Don Kimble","Thanks Beth. I'm now on slide 5. This morning we reported third quarter net income from continuing operations of $0.38 per common share. Adjusting for our previously disclosed fraud loss, earnings per share was $0.48. Our adjusted results compared to $0.45 per share in the year ago period and $0.44 in the second quarter of 2019.","As reported in July, we became aware of fraudulent activity conducted by a long standing business customer. Due to ongoing investigation litigation we're limited in the information we can share. The fraud loss was recognized in our provision for credit losses this quarter with a pre-tax impact of $123 million. The after-tax impact was $94 million.","The fraud was realized as an overdraft to two various operating accounts and charged off resulting in a recognition through our provision for credit losses. We\u2019re continuing to pursue all avenues of recovery and we will provide any material updates in our public filings.","I would also point out the impact of interest rates on our return on tangible common equity. Over the last four quarters, our other comprehensive income component of our capital has increased by $1.2 billion primarily due to lower rates.","This increase had 170 basis point negative impact on our ROTCE compared to the third quarter of 2018. Said otherwise, if the OCI remain the same, our ROCTE and notable items would have been 17.1% in the third quarter of this year.","I\u2019ll cover many of the other items on this slide in the rest of my presentation, so I'm now turning to slide 6. Our business model continues to position us well to grow relationships and loan balances. Total average loans were $92 billion, up 4% from the third quarter of last year, driven primarily by the growth in commercial and industrial loans, which were up 8%.","Linked quarter growth and average balances was also driven primarily by commercial and industrial loans, up 2%. Our growth continues to be broad based across our footprint as well as through our targeted industry verticals.","C&I growth was partially offset by decline in commercial real estate balances due to the elevated paydowns and our more cautious stance on certain loan types and markets.","Importantly, our growth continues to be more balanced with continued growth in consumer loans. We have made meaningful investments in our consumer mortgage business and completed the Laurel Road acquisition earlier this year and both are delivering results.","For Laurel Road, we originated over $500 million of loans this quarter, and our consumer mortgage business we originated $1.3 billion of loans in the third quarter more than double our volume from a year ago and up 20% from last quarter. Of this production, approximately 60% was retained on balance sheet.","Importantly, we remain disciplined with our credit underwriting and we walked away from business that does not meet our moderate risk profile. We remain committed to performing well through the business cycle and we managed our credit quality with this longer term perspective.","Continue on to Slide 7. Average deposits totaled $110 billion for the third quarter 2019, up $4.7 billion or 4% compared to the year ago period and up 1% from the prior quarter.","Growth from the prior year was driven by both consumer and commercial clients. On a linked quarter basis, the increase in deposit balances was also driven by both consumer and commercial clients, as well as elevated levels of short-term deposits from certain commercial customers.","Total interest bearing deposit costs were down one basis point from the prior quarter reflecting the lag in deposit pricing. We saw the impact of lower rates coming through late in the quarter and next quarter we would expect to see more of this benefit come through. We continue to have a strong stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting for 66% of our total deposit mix.","Turning to Slide 8. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $980 million for the third quarter of 2019 compared to $993 million in the third quarter 2018 and $989 million in the second quarter of this year. Our net interest margin was 3% for the third quarter 2019 compared to 3.18% for the third quarter 2018 and 3.06% for the second quarter. The decrease in net interest income from the third quarter of 2018 reflects lower interest rates, lower loan fees as well as a decline in purchase accounting accretion. These declines were partially offset by higher earning asset balances.","Net interest income decreased $9 million or 1% from the prior quarter driven by lower interest rates and loan fees. This quarter's net interest margin came in lower than expected.","Our deposit rates were higher than forecasted reflecting a slower response to interest rates and market pressures. We did see our rates move down late in the quarter providing benefit for the fourth quarter. Other factors that impacted our margin included lower loan fees costing one basis point and lower LIBOR rates relative to the change in Fed funds.","In the fourth quarter, we expect net interest income and net interest margin to remain relatively stable. Our outlook includes average interest bearing deposit rates declining by approximately 10 basis points relative to the third quarter. This also assumes an additional 25 basis point cut in rates in late October and continued growth in our loans.","In the appendix of our slide deck you can find additional information on our asset liability positioning. We\u2019ve continued to actively hedge to reduce our exposure to declining rates, executing approximately $2.4 billion in interest rate floors in the third quarter.","Our repositioning to reduce our risk to declining rates began in the third quarter of last year and since that time we\u2019ve entered into a total of swaps and floors of $17 billion.","Moving on to Slide 9. Key's non-interest income was $650 million for the third quarter 2019 compared to $609 million for the year ago quarter. The change from the year ago period reflects growth across most of these categories.","We reached a record third quarter in investment banking debt placement fees up $10 billion from last year. We also saw strong corporate services income, primarily driven by higher fees from derivatives, and we also saw year-over-year growth in both consumer mortgage income and mortgage servicing these.","Compared to the prior quarter, non-interest income increased by $28 million, driven by many of the same categories. Investment banking and debt placement fees increased $13 million from last quarter and we also saw growth in corporate services and consumer mortgage income.","Now, turning to slide 10. Expense management continues to be a very positive story. As we\u2019ve delivered on our expense and efficiency commitments. We completed our $200 million cost savings initiatives at the end of the second quarter and the results are fully in our third quarter run rate. We have also continued to reinforce our culture of continuous improvement throughout the organization.","Third quarter non-interest expense was $939 million. This compares to $964 million in the third quarter of 2018 and $967 million in the prior quarter, excluding notable items in the second quarter. The table on the bottom left side of the slide breaks out the notable items.","Non-interest expense decreased $25 million or 3% compared to the year ago period. The year-over-year comparison reflects the successful implementation of Key's expense initiatives and elimination of the FDIC surcharge. These expenses were partially offset by the addition of Laurel Road early this year.","Compared to the prior quarter, non-interest expense declined $28 million, excluding notable items in the prior period. The decline reflects the successful implementation of Key\u2019s expense initiatives across the franchise, which drove lower personnel expense and positively impacted a number of other line items.","Moving on to slide 11. As I said previously, our provision and net charge-offs included $123 million from our previously disclosed fraud loss. Excluding the fraud loss, net charge-offs were $73 million or 31 basis points of the average total loans in the third quarter, which continues to be below our \u2013 over the cycle range of 40 to 60 basis points. On a similar basis, again, excluding the fraud loss, the provision for credit losses was $77 million for the quarter, which slightly exceeded our net charge-offs reflected continued loan growth.","Non-performing loans were $585 million this quarter, up $24 million from the prior quarter, but down $60 million from a year ago period. Non-performing loans represented 63 basis points of period-in loans compared to 61 basis points last quarter.","Non-performing assets this quarter had a temporary increase with the transfer of several loans that held for sale. We believe these credits are properly marked and are moving through the sales process, which should be completed soon.","Criticized loans and our 90 day past due loans, both declined this quarter. Overall, credit quality remains strong. Our new loan originations in both the commercial and consumer book continue to be high quality relationship business.","Turning on to slide 12. Capital ratios remain relatively stable this quarter with a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.52% at the end of the third quarter. As Beth mentioned earlier, we remain committed to our capital priorities, including returning a significant amount to our shareholders.","In the third quarter, we declared a common share dividend of $0.185 a share, up 9% from the quarterly stock dividend. We also continue to repurchase common shares with $248 million repurchased this quarter.","Turning to slide 13. Similar to our approach a year ago, we have provided fourth quarter guidance relative to our third quarter results. The guidance ranges - guidance range definitions are provided at the bottom of the slide.","Average loans should be up in the low single-digit range driven by C&I and continued growth in the consumer balances from Laurel Road in our consumer mortgage business. Average deposits should be relatively stable.","Net interest income should be relatively stable with the fourth - in the fourth quarter. This assumes a 25 basis point interest rate cut, late in October and a solid balance sheet growth and decreased deposit rates which will help provide more stability in net interest income.","Non-interest income should be up in the low single digit reflecting solid investment banking pipelines, as well as growth in our other fee businesses along with some seasonality in areas such as COLI.","We would expect non-interest expenses to be also up in the low single digit range as a result of the seasonal factors including incentive compensation target lower capital markets business.","Similar to past years, we would also expect to have a penchant settlement charge in the fourth quarter to approximate the amount taken in the same period last year.","On a credit quality we see nothing on the horizon that changes our outlook. Net charge-offs including the fraud loss should remain stable and we expect that our loan loss provision will be - will slightly exceed net charge-offs reflecting continued loan growth.","In our guidance for our GAAP tax rate will be approximately 16% [ph] Overall, we expect a good finish to the year despite some headwinds from rates and signs of potentially slower economic growth.","Our clients have become more cautious that we continue to see good engagement and expect to grow through offering our targeted clients are attractive on an off-balance sheet alternatives.","Overtime, we\u2019ve reduced our net cash interest rate sensitivity and we remain diligent in our underwriting and risk management. And we\u2019ll continue to manage expenses through our continuous improvement efforts, while investing a portion of the savings back into the business.","Finally we expect to achieve our long-term targets and I believe over time our market valuation will reflect our progress and improve results. I will now turn the call back over to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of the call. John? ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First in line we have Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Scott Siefers","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess first well congratulations on the succession to both of you guys. So maybe top - first question is on the tax rate. I think it came in a little lower-than-expected this quarter. It looks like the guide is perhaps for slightly lower one next quarter as well.","Can you maybe talk to the nuance of that and if that's the kind of thing that would sustain itself into 2020 as well? ","Don Kimble","Yes. As far as the third quarter what you're seeing in the reported tax rate is the impact of the fraud loss, and so that really is reported on an incremental basis. So if you would adjust for that our effective tax rate was a little north of 16%.","We would expect the same type of range for the fourth quarter which reflects the benefit of credits that are available to us and also the impact of the updated outlook for pretax earnings as well.","Scott Siefers","Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then just I guess a top level. Now that you\u2019ve hit the top end of the efficiency range, do we think that's a number that you guys will be able to sustain into coming periods or improve upon or how were you thinking about that dynamic as you look into next several quarters?","Don Kimble","Yes. Long term we clearly want to operate within that range. We think that's appropriate given our business mix that we have here at Key. And it\u2019s something that we feel is an indication of us being able to manage our overall cost structure efficiently and effectively.","As far as, next year we\u2019re still expecting to manage for the full year in that range. Now you could see quarters we\u2019re like the first quarter of each year tends to be a little bit higher than through the rest of the year. But that would be our objective as well going forward.","Scott Siefers","Okay. Perfect. Thank you guys very much.","Operator","Next in the line we have Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ken Zerbe","Hey, thanks. Now, if I heard correctly I think you said 10 basis points of deposit house reductions in the fourth quarter including the October cut. I guess presumably let's call that a 20% deposit beta given the 50 basis point reduction.","Can you just talk about like your ability to reduce deposit costs? Just in terms of your competition we hear it\u2019s very slow of other banks bringing down their deposit costs. I'm just kind of wondering at what point does that actually start to accelerate? Thanks.","Don Kimble","Yeah. Sure. We would probably define it as stronger than a 20% beta because that rate decline doesn't occur till late in October, and so the average throughout the quarter would suggest something probably in the 30% beta. Longer term we would to see that in the 40% to 45% range as far as reaction to rates.","You\u2019re absolutely right; we are seeing competitive pressures, especially consumer side that is resulting in some of those deposits rates being a little stickier than what we would've expected initially. We still think there\u2019s plenty of opportunity for us to manage that down and to be in that 40% to 45% beta to allow us to have more stability in the margin prospectively.","Ken Zerbe","All right. Great. And then could you provide an update in terms of the impact to CECL?","Don Kimble","Yeah. Sure. We\u2019ll provide additional disclosure in our Q. But what we have talked about is that for commercial loans, we really don't see an increase from the incurred loss method to CECL. And on the economic outlook you could actually see a slight decline in commercial.","Now offsetting that on the consumer side that we would expect the CECL reserve to probably be about three times the level that we\u2019re seeing on the incurred loss method. And that really reflects more of a life of loan type of loss expectation as opposed to today. You probably have about a year and a half or so of charge-offs included in the consumer categories.","And so luckily for us our reserves are only about 15% consumer and about 85% commercial. So the relative impact us should be fairly modest compared to some of the early indications we\u2019ve seen from some of the other companies.","Ken Zerbe","All right. Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.","John Pancari","Good morning. Just want to get some additional color of what you\u2019re seeing in terms of loan demand. I know that you've indicated that the pipelines are solid, but obviously we\u2019ve seen a little bit of pullback in ISM and a little bit of pullback in CapEx activity. So, I just want to see if we could talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the commercial side?","And then what does that mean in terms of how you're thinking about your broader loan growth when you look at 2020? Could it be near the 4% that you're looking at for \u201819? Thanks. ","Chris Gorman","John. Its Chris. Good morning. Our loan growth this quarter was as a result of our continued focus and strength of our commercial businesses. What is differentiated now for Key vis-\u00e0-vis the past are the new engines that we have on the consumer side and as you\u2019ve heard Don talk about the growth we have in mortgage and also now we have Laurel Road. So those will be opportunities for us to kick-in loan growth as we go forward.","We anticipate on the commercial side, utilization being relatively flat. We have seen - as both Beth and Don mentioned our customers are cautious. But having said that, we\u2019re still out there talking to our customers, serving our customers, the pipelines remains strong, but I think clearly there are some challenges out there.","John Pancari","Okay. Thanks all right. That's helpful. On the - separately on the credit side, I was just wondering we could get a little bit more color on the non-performers. I know that NPLs were up a bit for the quarter despite the higher charge-offs even when you exclude the fraud.","So I just wanted to get a little bit of color on what drove the inflows into non-accruals in the quarter? And what - and also if you have any detail on how criticized assets trended for the quarter? Thanks.","Don Kimble","Sure. As far as the change in the NPLs and the inflows, we did have three commercial credits that moved into non-performing status this quarter. They were criticized loans before and the status was changed from accruing to non-accruing. And those three loans totaled $100 million, and so that was isolated those individual credits.","As we\u2019ve said before you can have episodic type of issues or things that pop up that we believe are temporary. In connection with our nonperforming loans we also - as we mentioned transferred a pool of assets, which included some commercial and some residential real estate to held for sale, which on the process of sale we expect to close quickly and bring that level down.","As far as the charge-offs, they came in at 31 basis point this quarter, I think they were 28 or 29 basis points last quarter. I think you will see some variability in that range but I think in the low 30 basis point range is probably a good outlook going forward and reflects a very stable and a very stable and a very strong credit quality overall.","As far as criticized and classified, I\u2019d say they're relatively stable and maybe even down a little bit linked quarter. But very, very stable as far as the overall credit quality from that perspective.","John Pancari","Okay. Thanks, Don. Appreciate the color.","Operator","And next we'll go to Peter Winter with Wedbush. Please go ahead.","Peter Winter","Good morning.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Peter Winter","You guys had very nice momentum on the expenses, particularly driven I guess by the reduction in headcount. I\u2019m just wondering, do you think you can drive expenses lower further in 2020?","Don Kimble","Yeah. We\u2019re always going to have a continuous improvement mindset. And what we would typically target would be to keep expenses relatively stable and allow us with that to make investments back in the business to grow the top line. We\u2019re very focused on driving positive operating leverage and we continue to expect to deliver that this year and we'll expect to do that again next year as well.","And so these continues improvement opportunities allow us to manage our expenses more efficiently, more effectively and it includes ongoing efforts like workflow redesign, branch consolidations and other things like that that we just think are part of our ongoing business model and it\u2019s going to be critical for us to continue those efforts to make sure that we have the capacity to reinvest back in the business.","Peter Winter","Actually a follow-up on Scott\u2019s question about the tax rate. Looking to 2020, would it go back to that more normal range of 18% to 19%?","Don Kimble","We\u2019ll provide more guidance in January as far as the tax rate outlook. I think that there's a number of factors that influence that one is the level of credits that are available to us that we continue to be a active participant. Some of the alternative energy sources which allows us to realize some tax credits associated with that.","And so part of our outlook will be determined based on what we see as the market for those credits, but also the impact of the overall pre-tax earnings going forward. And so we'll provide more outlook there. But I\u2019d say that you\u2019ll probably see some increase compared to the current year because of some of the noise that are in this year's numbers.","Peter Winter","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Hi, good morning. Hey, Don, just a follow up on that hope that you can still get inside the 54, 56 for next year on the cash efficiency ratio. Obviously, we\u2019re seeing the headcount reductions. You just talked about some of the other efficiency improvements but the Street obviously still modeling way above that?","Perhaps you can help us address just where you see the delta? Is it just that we're not anticipating as much of a reduction in the overall cost base as perhaps you guys are seeing? Any color just in terms of maybe how that cadence of expenses might go would be helpful? Thank you.","Don Kimble","Sure. And I think you've already hit on one of the surprise. I think that our expenses did come in lower than what The street was expecting for us this quarter and it really serves the foundation for us going forward.","And so we would expect to, as I said be in a position so we can continue to manage that expense level to be relatively stable and continue to grow revenues. And so that's the critical part for us. And I think as we do that, we should be able to continue to manage that efficiency ratio into the range for us over time here.","Ken Usdin","Okay. Got it. And then secondly just can you talk about the balance sheet protections and slide 17 is very helpful again. Just the cadence of how the forward starting swaps are going to move on? And any color that you can provide in terms of where the new floors and existing floors are going - are the strike prices are? Thanks, Don.","Don Kimble","Sure. We did add $2.4 billion of primarily floors this past quarter. And so as you highlighted that we\u2019ve seen a lot of investments made there since the third quarter of last year.","We\u2019ve got about $3 billion worth of floors starting swaps that most of which will kick in here for us in the fourth quarter. And just to put that in perspective, we're going to have a received fixed-rate of upper 2% to 90 range as opposed to. Today it would be a much lower resulting, a starting point for that received fixed-rate.","As far as the floors, it really provides this protection within a plus or minus 100 basis points range as far as the current flows. And so we did see some benefit in the third quarter from those floors and it's more provided as far as a additional protection for us in case rates do go down further than what we would expect. And so we\u2019re using that more as a protection as opposed to a revenue source for us.","Ken Usdin","And one final one just - are you done with the program ads like is this where you want to be in terms of that swaps and floors math that you now have ready to start?","Don Kimble","We would like to continue to increase our derivatives offset some of the interest rate risk that we still have in the portfolio. So I think that when we've talked about $2.4 billion of new floors this quarter, we would expect to see that kind of similar pace going forward combination of floors and swaps.","And the determination as to whether we would do the swaps or floors would be based on how does the forward curve compare with our internal assessment as to where rates are going.","And so we think it's important to continue to position us to be even more interest rates neutral and we'll continue down that path.","Ken Usdin","Got it. Okay. Thanks, Don.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Steven Alexopoulos","Hey. Good morning, everybody.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Steven Alexopoulos","I wanted to start first to follow-up on the comments Don, that you could hold expenses flat in 2020. What are your expectations for the headcount? You think on an overall basis you can still manage that lower next year?","Don Kimble","I would say that our efforts continue to be focused on a culture around continuous improvement, and so, we believe that there're ongoing opportunities for us to right size some of the workflows we have to throughout the organization. And as we've talked before in the past, we would expect to continue to see our branch count come down, and we've said it's 2% to 3%.","And each one of those could have some impact on staffing, but the staffing numbers themselves aren't as critical to us as the efficiencies we gain. And we think there's other ways that we can leverage third-party vendors and leverage some of the technology spend that we make that will help drive some of those efficiencies that won't be as FTE dependent as was what we've experienced over the last year","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. That's helpful. And then when we look at the fourth quarter, it's typically your strongest quarter for IB and debt placement fees. Look at loans held for sale, they came down a bit. I know it's typically our leading indicator. Does that imply maybe a bit softer quarter for debt placement fees? I don't know what the pipeline looks for 4Q.","Chris Gorman","So, Steve, its Chris. Our fourth quarter pipeline is, I would characterize as strong. So sometimes there is a correlation as you look at what's held for sale and what's not. That depends a lot on mix. As we look at our pipeline, I would characterize our pipeline is strong going into the fourth quarter from investment banking and debt placement fees.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. Got you. And then, if I could sneak one more in. Don, just looking at the appendix in the slide where you're calling out the year, basically effectively neutral to rates. Now, does this imply even beyond 4Q the NIM should be relatively flat, is that basically the assumption.","Don Kimble","That\u2019s our expectation at this point time. I'd say that, what the slide would basically say as, we're neutral to the forward curve, and so if there are variances to that for curve, it could have an impact on near term rates.","But that's our whole objective, as far as managing to more of an interest rate neutral position as to have as much stability as we can in that net interest margin and help drive the revenue growth from there.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. Thanks, and congratulations Beth. Thanks for taking my questions.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Beth Mooney","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Next we go to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning, everyone.","Don Kimble","Good morning, Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","Don, you mentioned about the deposit rates didn\u2019t start to move down until the end of the quarter following the last rate cut, there was somewhat of a delay. Do you think on future rate cuts, there\u2019ll be the same type of delay or is this momentum that you're seeing on lower deposit costs will carry through into the next rate cut.","Don Kimble","I think, there were some situations this quarter that were unique, that on the consumer front we continue to see rates go up in July and even in the August, the consumer side and some of that was from promos that were in place and other things like that.","I would say, going forward, we wouldn\u2019t expect to see the same type of delay. We were a little surprised to be honest, though, that we thought that the markets would move down quicker than what they did and they didn't.","But as I mentioned, for example, in the promos, we\u2019ve got about $2 billion each quarter of money market deposits that are at a promo rate that will roll off. And so, that will also help accelerate some of the deposit betas on the retail side that we wouldn\u2019t have available to us on a quote.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And then, Chris, on Laurel Road, can you share with us - obviously, it seems to be going well, but what type of expansion, you can take from what you're learning from Laurel Road into other consumer products?","Chris Gorman","Sure. Well, you're right Gerard. We've been very pleased with Laurel Road. First thing we wanted to do is sort of run the place that they had, which was really a complete digital approach to the refinancing of loans principally for doctors and dentists. And as you saw in this quarter we originated about $0.5 billion in loans.","The next phase of that is going to be our ability to similarly provide mortgage. So as you can imagine we have in a digital format all the information we need for sort of Phase II which is to provide a digital mortgage to those customers, and further we can leverage Gerard that technology and that approach across all of Key.","And then lastly what it would give us the opportunity to do at some point would be create an infinite a strategy around a targeted segment which is obviously consistent with how we go to market.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. Thank you.","Chris Gorman","Thank you.","Operator","Next we'll go to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Mike Mayo","Hi. We\u2019re going to be in the transition from Beth to Chris, can you just talk about how that transition works? Beth if you'll be staying around in any capacity once Chris takes the reigns? Why Chris was selected?","And Chris maybe how you might think about things differently? I noticed it's a little unusual, but also it's appreciated to have both of you on the call and a smooth transition?","Beth Mooney","Good morning Mike I\u2019ll start with - as you know Chris has been with our company since the last 1990s. He\u2019s plan our Corporate Bank and very successfully developed that strategy on our behalf to include the what I call a distinctive corporate investment banking capability was the head of our merger and the last couple of years, he\u2019s been our President - Vice Chairman and President of Banking.","We also have at Key what I think it's a great and talented and very diverse team with good momentum. As of May 1 next year, I\u2019ve been with the company 14 years and I will have been our CEO for 9 years.","So I think there is value in knowing when it's an appropriate time to work on an orderly succession. And as we said in our comments, I will be our Chairman and CEO till May 1, at which time I will retire.","And no, I will not have ongoing responsibilities at Key, I will fully retire, and at that time Chris will become our Chairman and CEO. And as I've said, I'm excited and fully confident in the team in the future under Chri\u2019s leadership. And I too have chapters to write and things to do and I think this is an example of what a well orchestrated and appropriate succession looks like.","Chris Gorman","Mike, the only thing I would add to that is, it's obviously an honor and a privilege to lead what I think is just a great team. I think we have a really, really good and defined strategy that we laid out at Investor day, last October.","The whole notion of targeted scale, how a company of our size can be really effective, when we target who we want to be relevant to and how we want to be relevant? As it relates to the transition, Beth and I work very, very closely together. And I am confident it will be an absolutely seamless transition.","And as we go forward, while we have our strategy in place, the reality is our industry is changing and changing quickly. And I think we as a team, that can stay out ahead of it and position us for continued success.","Mike Mayo","And then just one follow-up, maybe looking in the past and in the future as it relates to scale, because you mentioned scale and the scale to compete in an era where the largest banks spend a lot more in technology and marketing and they're expanding into your markets.","So just how do you think about your competitive positioning over the next 5, 7 years? Beth, you\u2019ve obviously held to the current strategy, made one acquisition. Will the acquisition appetite maybe increased or what's your thought process? ","Don Kimble","So, as we look forward, as I mentioned, I think Mike, for a bank our size to try to be all things to all people is not the strategy, the strategy for us has always been to figure out who we can be relevant to and make the appropriate investments, whether it\u2019s people, processes, technologies.","And if you think about the investments we've made, things like HelloWallet, which is digital wellness, things like Laurel Road, things like Bolster, which is in the commercial side. We think with proper focus, we have all the capabilities that we need and bandwidth that we need to make investment continue to grow the business.","Mike Mayo","Thank you.","Operator","Next we'll go to Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.","Saul Martinez","Heym good morning. Congratulations Chris on the new role and Beth on all of your accomplishments. So I wanted to follow-up a little bit on the deposits commentary. Don, you mentioned that you were surprised the market didn't go even lower. Why do you think that is?","And is it the version versus your expectation coming from the consumer side because you mentioned the promo rates and the pressure related to that or is it also occurring on the commercial side?","And if you can just talk a little bit about your expectations for a 40% to 45% beta on the way down, I would think most of that is on the commercial side versus the consumer side, but if you can comment on that?","And whether you think there are risks to being aggressive in commercial pricing? Does it hurt your competitive position at all for some of your commercial clients?","Don Kimble","Very well. I\u2019ll try to hit all those topics and if I've missed some, please help provide some more guidance.","Saul Martinez","There a few questions in that, I\u2026","Don Kimble","That\u2019s great. And on the consumer front, as we were going through rates moving up, consumer portfolio lagged and lagged significantly, and the deposit betas, they were extremely low. And so it may have been false hope or expectations on my part to see a faster reduction as far as the initial reaction on some of the consumer rates. But we do think they will come down over time and we will see the market to move down.","And I think we're seeing that this quarter with a lot of the banks showing pressure as far as deposit rates and very few having deposit betas on the way down that probably would've been expected or anticipated. So we believe we will see that come true.","As we mentioned before, at the end of September, we were seeing some of the rates come down and seeing some of the actions put in place. It probably just curdled a little slower than what we would\u2019ve expected.","On the commercial side, the commercial deposits as a general have more deposits that are indexed to the changes in interest rates. So for us, that tends to be more indexed to Fed funds as opposed to LIBOR. And this quarter, LIBOR impacted the loans and it was a much bigger decline than what the Fed funds rate declines occurred and therefore impacted our cost of funds, and so as those things stabilized, we should see even further reductions on the commercial side.","One of the things we try to manage all as it they were flushed with the liquidity right now. We\u2019ve had an internal target of having an LCR ratio somewhere around 110%. This last quarter, we need up north of 145%, and so we have a lot of excess liquidity, and we would hope to try to manage that and manage some of the rates down more in a leading position that would allow us to recapture some of that deposit beta that we missed out here in the third quarter.","Saul Martinez","Got it. Do you feel pretty good about the 10 basis points then in the coming quarter?","Don Kimble","We feel good about the actions we're taking, and we feel good about achieving that in the fourth quarter. Correct.","Saul Martinez","Just to switch of gears, can you remind us how much Laurel Road contributed to the cost base? I want to say it was $30 million run rate, but is that right? And has there been any impact on revenue thus far?","Don Kimble","What we talked about as far as the acquisition was about a $20 million per quarter run rate as far as expenses. And the current expense levels are just a little bit less than that because of some of the efficiencies we\u2019ve already been able to achieve with the integration there.","We haven\u2019t disclosed revenues per se, but I would say we're off to a very strong start. That third quarter, we had over $400 million of originations and - excuse me, in the second quarter, we had over $400 million and third quarter, we had over $500 million of originations.","And to put that into perspective, we just talked about $1.2 billion would be in our target for a full year's worth of originations. And so in those first two quarters we had over $900 million and so we're off to a very good start there, very pleased with the credit quality of the originations. FICO scores north of 770 and a strong income and very focused on advanced degree medical profession. And so we\u2019re very excited about that and look forward to be a strong growth engine for us.","One of other pieces we talked about for Laurel Road though too is it that some of the tools and capabilities and the ability to understand how to digitally originate new business and relationships is something that we're really just now starting to lever throughout the entire Key franchise. And we think that will be a huge benefit for us that we haven't even started to realize yet at this point.","Saul Martinez","Got it. And just one final one, just a clarification. The pension charge in the fourth quarter that is not built into the guidance that's a non-core item?","Don Kimble","We could characterize that as a notable item each quarter. And so that's correct.","Saul Martinez","Okay. Just wanted to make sure. Thank you.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Marlin Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.","Marlin Mosby","Thanks. Wanted to ask you a little bit about credit in a backward way, you had $123 million charge-off relating to this one loan. Does that represent the lumpiness in the portfolio because that took a charge-off from 30 basis points all the way up to 80? So you go from below your range to above your range with one loan. So is that just a reflection of the exposure you have because of the commercial focus like you were saying earlier in the loan portfolio?","Don Kimble","Marty as far as the $123 million, it was a fraud loss, and as we noted briefly that the fraud loss came through because of the fraud resulted in a net overdraft position of several of the operating accounts from this entity.","And as a result of those being considered overdraft the reporting requirements would say that that should be treated as a charge-off, and so we really consider this to be a true fraud loss and not reflective of a lending relationship. There were no loans outstanding to that entity that resulted in this fraud.","Marlin Mosby","Got you. Thanks. And then, Beth, wanted to congratulate you. I mean you\u2019ve evolved KeyCorp into I think a much better company over your tenure coming out of financial crisis and now - Chris can now take on and continue to build from here.","I wanted just to \u2013 not to be too personal but when you think about your decision in a sense of retiring and not maybe just becoming Chairman and our chairperson and going through that process. How did you think and what's kind of weighing why now for you individually, because I think that was a question I heard a lot from investors because I kind of get caught off guard from here.","And as you think about the strategic decisioning around moving on, it\u2019s hard for a person to a new role to do that. And to think about what's the exit strategy for the overall company long term. So if you can just kind of address those two issues that\u2019d be very helpful I think for folks to just have a better feel for why this is happening right now.","Beth Mooney","So, Marty I\u2019d be delighted to. As I said, I think there is a lot of value and thinking as much about when and how is the right time to build succession and step down from a role like CEO and Chairman, as there is in the energy you put into it when you first get the opportunity.","And I believe that with nine years in Chair, as our CEO, as of May 1st, if you recall I've been a two-term President. And I will be 65 years old next year and I believe that remaining our Chairman and CEO till May 1st is the appropriate thing to do.","Chris and I, as he has indicated and I've said earlier are very much working on a seamless transition and we've obviously worked together for many, many years. The team is solid, mature, well seasoned. The company has a lot of good momentum and this is the appropriate time for the company, the appropriate time for me and there\u2019s always chapters to write. And I look forward to the things that I can do civically in my continued professional commitments as well as having a little more time for family, friends and travel.","And after May 1st, again from a thorough discussions with our board as we went through this succession process planning, believe the appropriate thing to do is that Chris will become our Chairman and CEO and that was done with much consideration with our board about what is the right leadership structure for Key, and yes, I will fully retire as of May 1st.","Marlin Mosby","Well, best of luck and congratulations on a job well done.","Beth Mooney","Well, Marty I appreciate that. As I had said in my opening remarks, this has been a absolute privilege of my career. And I appreciate your comments that I think the ultimate test as you leave it better than perhaps you found it.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Foran with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Brian Foran","Hi, good morning.","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","Brian Foran","Maybe just on CECL I hear you that the overall impact day one it's not that huge. But this is \u2013 just the 3x on consumer and as you\u2019re growing consumer into next year like $1 billion a quarter. Do we have to start thinking about like even though the cash flows haven't changed and the underlying performance hasn't changed just building in like a $20 million reserve for growth type placeholder you know just from the concept of running with a much higher reserve to loan on your consumers and every time you put a loan on the books you got to fully upfront that reserve built day one.","Beth Mooney","You\u2019re absolutely right as far as going forward the new volume coming on the books will clearly have a higher reserve than we did historically under the over incurred loss method. And we\u2019ll provide more clarity on that as we get into the first quarter outlook at the end of our fourth quarter call.","I don't know I'd - can hold a $20 million placeholder yet but that will provide some more color. But you're absolutely right. The initial provision required for a new loan origination is higher under CECL for consumers than it is under the incurred loss method.","Brian Foran","Got it. And then on the efficiency, I mean, I almost hate to ask this but as long as I've been doing this I continuously screw up cash versus GAAP efficiency. Does \u2013 is the so it was 160 basis points difference this quarter is that like a stable relationship and so for those of us who have put a GAAP efficiency in our model, the 54 to 56 plus 160 bps is a good benchmark for what you're thinking on a GAAP basis?","Don Kimble","Well, essentially the difference between the cash efficiency and the GAAP is the impact of intangible amortization. And so, going for the intangible amortization should continue to decline and so that gap should narrow.","Brian Foran","Got it. So maybe more like 100 to 150 next year.","Don Kimble","Yes.","Brian Foran","Perfect. Well, thank you all and congratulations both Beth and Chris.","Beth Mooney","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","Next we'll go to Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette, Woods. Please go ahead.","Brian Klock","Good morning, everyone. ","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Beth Mooney","Good Morning.","Brian Klock","And again, I guess, congratulations to everyone and Beth, best of luck to you on your future endeavors.","Beth Mooney","Thank you very much. I'm looking forward to.","Brian Klock","All right. And just a real quick follow up for you Don. I know you talked about a lot of the active hedging you guys have put in place and you got some more forward starting swaps kicking in here, later this quarter into the first quarter.","So the expectation at the NIM could still compress here in the fourth quarter before being stable? I guess into 2020 or do you think there's more stability here into the fourth quarter from the hedging that you guys have put into place.","Don Kimble","We will see a clear benefit from the hedging occur in the fourth quarter. Our outlook is for a stable net interest margin and so we would expect that to occur that - I think, that a good portion of that is from the deposit repricing and the benefit of the hedging, but we'll also see a little bit of benefit in that.","Our look says that we'll have low single-digit growth in loans and relatively stable deposits. And so, we should see that liquidity level in the fourth quarter come down just a little bit, which will also provide some reinforcement there as well.","Brian Klock","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go to Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","Scott Siefers","Hey, guys. I just wanted to ask on the fees for the third quarter, you had the 15 million in securities gains which is a little unusual for KeyCorp. Is that something - like, are you going to have additional securities gains going forward or as we think about. And, I guess, the genesis of the question is, as we think about the fourth quarter guide, that's off the reported $650 million base, right?","So maybe you could talk a little bit more about sort of the puts and takes on fee momentum into the fourth quarter. Sound like the investment banking pipeline is solid, which should be helpful, of course, but maybe some of the other things that would drive growth off that base as well.","Don Kimble","Scott, we didn\u2019t have any security gains during the quarter. We did have a gain from the sale of some - an investment in a partnership we participated in, but I'm - I apologize, I don\u2019t know where you're picking up the $15 million in security gains with all that.","Scott Siefers","I\u2019m sorry, it's just in the footnote on the slide 17.","Don Kimble","Okay.","Scott Siefers","Three and nine months totaled $15 million. We can talk about that offline.","Don Kimble","Good. We\u2019ll go through that, I apologize. But that probably includes the gain there along with the gain on the securitization transaction we had from the sale of some of the Laurel Road loans but we'll follow up with you on that as well.","Scott Siefers","Okay. PERFECT. Okay. So either way, though, the guide is indeed off that $650 million base, right?","Don Kimble","I would say that the $650 million is core and our guidance would be based or included to that, there from the reference for the $650 million, so we expect to see growth from there going forward.","Scott Siefers","Okay. Good.","Don Kimble","Okay. Thank you.","Scott Siefers","That sounds\u2026","Operator","And with no further questions, I'll turn it back to the company for any closing comments.","Beth Mooney","Again, we thank you for participating in our call today. And if you have any follow up questions you can direct them to our Investor Relations team at 216-689-4221.

This call is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Beth Mooney, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Beth E. Mooney","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to the KeyCorp's first quarter 2014 earnings conference call.","Joining me for today's presentation is Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer. And available for the Q&A portion of the call are Chris Gorman, President of our Corporate Bank; and Bill Hartman, our Chief Risk officer.","Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments, as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call today.","Turning now to Slide 3. This was a good quarter for Key with solid financial results. We delivered on our commitments to generate positive operating leverage, to maintain strong risk management practices and to remain disciplined in the way we manage capital. Our positive operating leverage from the prior year reflects the work we have done to improve efficiency with initiatives targeted for both revenue and expense, and this becomes even more critical given the slow recovery and revenue headwinds that continue to impact our industry.","Key's revenue in the first quarter was relatively stable with the prior year and down modestly from the prior quarter, reflecting normal seasonal trends and lower activity level. Revenue benefited from solid loan growth, which continued to outpace the industry. Loan growth was driven by our commercial, financial and agricultural loans, which were up $1.2 billion or 5% on annualized from the prior quarter. We have been pleased with the quality of our new loan originations, but we continue to see loan yields reflecting the competitive pricing environment.","Noninterest income, benefited from areas where we have been investing, including credit card and payments and commercial mortgage servicing.","We have also made significant progress on expenses, which were down $19 million or 3% from the prior year end -- prior year quarter and down $50 million or 7% from the fourth quarter. Our cash efficiency ratio was 65%, which was within our targeted range. We remain committed to further efficiency improvement, and Don will discuss our path forward in his remarks.","Our strong risk management practices and a more favorable environment resulted in another quarter of positive credit quality trends. Net charge-offs declined to 15 basis points, aided by strong recoveries as well as our improving credit quality and we are well below our targeted range. Additionally, nonperforming assets declined 33% from the year ago period, and capital management remains a priority.","We were pleased to receive a non-objection from the Federal Reserve on our 2014 capital plan. This will allow us to repurchase up to $542 million in common shares and subject to board approval, increase our quarterly common share dividend 18% to $0.065 per share. Using Street estimates, our total shareholder payout would be in the 84% range, among the highest in our peer group for the second consecutive year.","Additionally, we completed our 2013 CCAR capital plan with common share repurchases of $141 million in the first quarter.","I'm now turning to Slide 4. During the first quarter, we made a number of leadership changes to leverage our alignment, accelerate momentum and to drive growth. Last week, we announced that Dennis Devine and E.J. Burke will be co-Presidents of our Community Bank. Dennis will focus on retail banking and small business clients, and E.J. will be responsible for our commercial and business banking, as well as our Private Bank. Based on their experience and proven leadership, we feel they are perfect fit for these new roles.","Since joining Key in 2012, Dennis has made significant progress in sharpening our consumer and small business strategy, while also realigning resources to sustainably improve productivity and performance. His new leadership role in the Community Bank reflects the importance of consumer and small business banking to the overall success of Key and our intent to drive this business forward.","E.J. is a 14-year veteran of Key. His strong leadership, successful transformation of our real estate business and other broad accomplishments in the Corporate Bank will help drive our Commercial Business and Private Banking segments, while further deepening the collaboration of these Community Bank areas with our corporate bank, an important component of our unique business model. Both Dennis and E.J. will join our executive leadership team and report directly to me.","We also made a change in our Commercial Payments business. Moving Clark Khayat, who is our former Head of Strategy in Corporate Development to lead this critical area. Clark and his team will be focused on growing this business and maximizing the return from our recent investment, which includes the launch of purchase and prepaid cards earlier this year.","In addition to the new payment products, we have continued to invest in and build out our online and mobile capability. This past quarter, we expanded our online account opening tool to include more products and services and our user base is growing. Downloads of our mobile application have increased over 70% from the prior year and online penetration continues to increase.","We also made progress on other strategic initiatives, including improving sales productivity and strengthening our business mix through targeted investments, as well as exiting businesses that are not a strategic fit.","In the Community Bank, we are strengthening our sales management process and has seen a lift in our sales productivity, which will remain a major focus for Dennis and E.J. In the corporate bank, we continue to see growth in new and expanded client relationships.","In the first quarter, we also announced that we would be exiting our international leasing operation, which had limited scale and connectivity to our other businesses. This is consistent with our commitment to allocate our capital to businesses that fit our strategy and generate appropriate risk-adjusted returns. I'm very excited about all the changes we made in the quarter. They accelerate our momentum and enhance our efficiency. And overall, it was a good start to the year in terms of both financial results and our strategic initiatives, as well as the leadership changes we announced.","Despite the environmental challenges, we have good momentum, and I'm confident we will continue to improve our performance.","Now, I'll turn it over to Don, who will comment on our first quarter results. Don?","Donald R. Kimble","Thanks, Beth. Slide 6 provides highlights from the company's first quarter 2014 results.","This morning, we reported net income from continuing operations of $0.26 per common share for the first quarter. This compared to $0.26 for the fourth quarter of last year and $0.21 from the prior first quarter. I'll cover many of these results in my remarks, so let's now turn to Slide 7.","Loan growth has remained a positive story for Key, reflecting our distinctive business model and more target approach, growth has, again, exceeded industry averages. Average total loans for the first quarter were up $1.1 billion or an annualized 9% compared to fourth quarter of 2013, and up $2.1 billion or 4% compared to a year ago quarter. Our growth was driven primarily by commercial, financial and agricultural loans across Key's business lending segments. Average commercial, financial and agricultural loans were up $1.2 billion or 5% on annualized and from the fourth quarter of 2013, and up $2.0 billion or 9% compared to the prior year.","Period-end loans grew by 2% from the prior quarter. And in the first quarter, total commitments were up, and we saw a slight uptick in utilization rates. Our outlook for loan growth in 2014 remains consistent with our prior guidance of mid single-digit full year growth driven by CF&A. A change in the pace of the economic recovery could impact client demand and loan growth relative to our current expectations.","Continuing to Slide 8. On the liability side of the balance sheet, average deposits were up $2.7 billion from 1 year ago and down $2.1 billion from the fourth quarter. Deposit growth of $2.7 billion from prior year was largely driven by higher balances from Commercial and Public clients, as well as increases related to the commercial mortgage servicing acquisition. Compared to the prior quarter, deposits were down primarily due to expected reduction in the commercial mortgage servicing escrow balances from elevated levels in the fourth quarter, related to our mortgage servicing acquisition. And as a result of a continued focus on improving deposit mix, year-over-year, interest-bearing liability costs declined from 70 to 54 basis points.","Turning to Slide 9. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $569 million for the first quarter compared to $589 million in both the fourth and first quarters of 2013. Our net interest margin was 3.00%, which was down 1 basis point from the prior quarter. The decline in net interest income and net interest margin was attributable to the impact of lower asset yields and loan fees, which were partially offset by the maturity of higher rate CDs and a more favorable mix of lower cost deposits.","For the full year of 2014, we expect net interest income to be relatively stable with the reported levels in 2013, with the potential for downward pressure due to the competitive environment. We continue to expect to maintain modest asset sensitivity. As we have highlighted before, we have the flexibility to manage and quickly adjust our rate-risk position, and the duration and characteristics of Key's loan and investment portfolio's continued to position us to realize more benefit from a rise in the shorter end of the yield curve.","Slide 10 shows a summary of our noninterest income, which accounts for approximately 43% of our total revenue. Noninterest income in the first quarter was $435 million, up 2% or $10 million from the first quarter of last year and down 4% or $18 million from the fourth quarter. The year-over-year increase was due to higher investment banking and debt placement fees, principal investing gains and the benefit from our recent investments in payments and commercial mortgage servicing. The increase was partially offset by lower fixed income sales and trading income and the impact on deposit service charges from the change in posting order for client transactions, which began in November of last year.","The decline from the fourth quarter was related to lower commercial mortgage service -- special servicing fees, as well as the normal seasonal decline in corporate-owned life insurance. We also had a full quarter impact to the change in the client-transaction posting order combined with normal seasonal trends.","Special servicing fees, which are generated in the commercial real estate workouts are included in our mortgage servicing fees line item. They are episodic and can vary materially from quarter-to-quarter.","Turning to Slide 11. Noninterest expense in the first quarter was $662 million, including $10 million in charges related to our efficiency and improvement efforts. Expenses were down $19 million or 3% from the prior year and $50 million or 7% from the fourth quarter. Expenses this quarter reflect benefits from our efficiency initiative, as well as normal seasonality in areas such as marketing. We also have lower expenses related to incentives and occupancy.","Looking ahead, our typical second quarter includes annual merit increases, an increase in marketing related to our spring home equity advertising campaign and potentially higher incentives tied to production. In total, we would expect expenses to be approximately $20 million higher in the second quarter.","Expense management remains a critical part of our drive to maintain positive operating leverage. As Beth commented earlier, we are at the upper end of our targeted cash efficiency ratio range of 60% to 65%. On the next 2 slides, I'll cover our expense and efficiency ratio outlook.","Moving to Slide 12. We revised our full year outlook to reflect the improvement in our expense levels in the first quarter. Our expectation is the full year 2014 expenses will be down in the low to mid single-digit range from the last year. We expect to continue to generate cost savings through our continuous improvement process, which will enable us to make investments and offset normal expense growth. Should the operating environment become more challenging, we are prepared to take additional action through further reduction in expense, as well as the timing of investments in order to continue to drive positive operating leverage. This brings me to the next slide.","On Slide 13 is our path to achieve the lower end of our cash efficiency ratio target of 60% to 65%. We expect to realize further improvement from business growth, both organic and through strategic investments, as well as additional reductions in our expense levels. We will continue to seek opportunities to both enhance revenue and reduce cost. Importantly, this assumes no benefit from higher interest rates. If rates move in line with the forward curve, we would expect this to move our efficiency ratio below our target range. Longer term, we remain committed to making progress toward our amount lower or below our current targeted range.","For more detail on our action plan by line of business to drive productivity and efficiency improvements, I would point you to Slide 19 in the Appendix in today's presentation.","Turning to Slide 14. Our net charge-offs declined to $20 million or 15 basis points of average total loans in the first quarter, which continues to be below our targeted range. In the first quarter, net charge-offs benefit from total recoveries, which were up 28% or $8 million from the prior quarter. Additionally, gross charge-offs were down 14% or $9 million. Due to a strong recoveries in the quarter, commercial loan recoveries actually exceeded gross charge-offs by $8 million. The breakdown of asset quality by loan portfolio is shown on Slide 22 in the Appendix.","At March 31, 2014, our reserve for loan losses represented 1.50% of period-end loans and 186% coverage of our nonperforming loans. We expect net charge-offs to remain below our targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points for the remainder of the year, and for our loan loss provision to approximate the level of net charge-offs.","Turning to Slide 15. Our tangible common equity ratio, our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio both remains strong at March 31 at 10.14% and 11.22%, respectively. As Beth mentioned, we completed our 2013 capital plan by repurchasing $141 million or 10.6 million common shares in the first quarter. We also received no objection from the Federal Reserve in March for our 2014 capital plan, which included a new common share repurchase program of up to $542 million to be executed over the next 4 quarters. The plan also included an 18% increase in our common share dividend to $0.065, which is subject to board approval.","Importantly, our capital plans reflect our commitment to remaining discipline in managing our strong capital position. Our Tier 1 common ratio has remained above 11%, and we have paid out a peer-leading amount of capital to shareholders. Looking ahead, our 2014 estimated CCAR payout ratio is 84%, and as again, among the highest of our peers.","Moving to Slide 16. This is a summary of our 2014 outlook and expectations and is consistent with my comments today. As I stated earlier, we expect average loans to continue to grow year-over-year in the mid single-digit range, and our net interest income remained relatively stable with our reported level in 2013. Revenue should benefit from the full year low single-digit growth and noninterest income compared to the prior year. Due to the progress made in the first quarter, we now anticipate expenses will be down low to mid single-digits on a full year basis. This guidance reflects the impact of the implemented expense savings, planned investments, as well as future costs associated with implementing additional cost savings initiatives.","Credit quality should remain a good story with net charge-offs below our targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points for the remainder of the year. And finally, capital management will remain a priority, including increasing our dividend, as well as continuing to execute our share repurchase authorization.","With that, I will close and turn call back over to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We have a question from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank.","Robert Placet - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This Rob Placet for Matt's team. First question, as it relates to your net interest income guidance, I take it to imply that there should be growth off the 1Q level, I guess -- versus the 1Q level, how should we think about net interest income and also the net interest margin?","Donald R. Kimble","Great. As far as our guidance, you're right. It would have to include increases from the first quarter. First quarter is low seasonally because of the day count and that cost us about $8 million linked quarter from the previous fourth quarter results, and so we would see a pickup there. We do expect strong loan growth to continue. We've talked about mid single-digit kind of growth going forward. And our guidance would assume with that loan growth and with the same levels of liquidity going forward, that margin would be relatively stable for the rest of the year. So those are all critical parts of the assumptions in order to get the guidance we're providing.","Robert Placet - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then second question, similar question for fee income. The guidance implies some growth off the 1Q level. So I guess, what are your thoughts on which categories will drive growth through the rest of the year?","Donald R. Kimble","Again, we would expect to see seasonal changes for a lot of the areas including the stronger activity levels. The first quarter activity levels were down in many critical areas, including service charge income and credit card and debit card activities. So we would expect to see some pickup there. But we're also seeing some very strong pipelines in our investment banking and debt placement fees. Chris, would you want to add any color to that.","Christopher Marrott Gorman","Sure, Don. This is Chris. So we feel pretty good about our backlogs in investment banking and debt placement fees. The other thing that's interesting about our backlogs is it's more heavily skewed right now to M&A. And with M&A, there tends to be a multiplier effect because often, we're involved in other activities in addition to just providing advisory. So we look for that number to continue to have some forward momentum. The other area that we're very optimistic about and it's very early days, is our payments, our enterprise commercial payments. We launched both our purchase card and our prepaid card just in the first quarter of this year. And with respect to our purchase card, we are ahead of our targets in terms of client capture. And with respect to prepaid, we've been pleasantly surprised at the amount of activity out there for significant pieces of business. Now I would warn you that those significant pieces of business are complex, they take a long time, there's a long sales cycle. But we feel good about both the backlog with respect to investment banking and debt placement fees, and our backlog with respect to enterprise commercial payments.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America.","Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My first question is a follow-up to a comment that you made, Don, during the prepared remarks. You mentioned that if rates moved up as implied by the forward curve, then the efficiency ratio could be below 60% to 65%. And I just wanted to make sure I understood that correctly. So if we saw a steepening in the yield curve but the short end is still anchored at where it is, that's enough to break the 60% level?","Donald R. Kimble","Erika, the forward curve through 2016, which shows some movement up of the lower end of the curve as well. And so that was the baseline for that assumption, that actually our net interest income would increase between a flat rate environment, and the forward curve by about $200 million in 2016 from that type of difference in the rate environment. And that would reduce our efficiency ratio by about 3 percentage points.","Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And just on the guidance to -- on NII flat to 2013. Does that include any movements to continue to build liquidity with regard to the LCR? And I guess a better question to ask is where are you on the LCR, and how should we think about earning asset growth as it relates to the loan growth guidance that you gave?","Donald R. Kimble","Great question. And as far as our LCR that we have already started to take some actions, as you might imagine, given our size of our investment portfolio, that we have a very strong liquidity position. But we have been shifting that a little bit more to Ginnie Mae Security. So as of the end of the first quarter, we had 27% of our portfolio in Ginnie Mae's and that was up significantly from where it has been historically. Through the end of the year, we would see continued payments coming off the investment portfolio being reinvested in Ginnie Mae's, and we should have a little more than 1\/3 of our total portfolio in that Level 1 type of liquidity asset by the end of the year. If we hit that and also if we see some changes as it relates to the municipal deposit rules that are currently in the current draft, we should be in good shape for the LCR and should not have to change our overall balance sheet.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","On the expense guidance line, which was 12, at the low end of the expense savings range of 4% to 6%, then the high end of the operating investment range are just 3% to 5%. Expense levels really wouldn't improve. I'm just curious, is there at least a minimum level of expense reduction you're committed to for 2014?","Donald R. Kimble","Well, what we are committed to is driving positive operating leverage. And with this current environment we have for lower revenue growth, and we're pulling a little harder on the expense side. So I don't know if there is any absolute minimum or maximum there. But I think that the path that we showed in the first quarter is probably consistent with what we'll have to focus on throughout the rest of the year, unless we see things change dramatically.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And maybe just a follow-up, Comerica also had good commercial loan growth in the first quarter. But for them, it was primarily shared national credits. Could you break out for us how much NIX contributed to 1Q loan growth?","Christopher Marrott Gorman","So Steve, it's Chris. Let me kind of start by kind of giving a broad overview. Of all the capital we raised, only 15% actually goes on our balance sheet. And of the deals that we're involved with, in 70% of the instances, we're the lead. I don't have the exact number in front of me, but I think you should assume whether it's leverage, NIX deals or anything else, that the 70% percentage would hold.","Beth E. Mooney","And with that, Steve, I would just underscore that, I think, it is important to note we have talked in the past that we do clients, we are the originator, they are our relationships. And we do not have a desk that buys paper or participates unless it is a relationship of ours.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Beth, you've done a very good job since you've come on board in meeting your targets for a success, especially in the expense side. And the question is your target for the cash efficiency ratio of 60% to 65%, we just heard Don say that in a rising rate environment, you could get down closer to 60%. But when you look at some of your competitors, whether it's BB&T or PNC, these companies are all getting into the 50s. There are some that are already there, like U.S. Bancorp and M&T. Do you -- is there a possibility or probability that you're going to take a look at this ratio and actually lower target as we go forward? Or is it just your infrastructure keeps it, so you can't really get below 60%?","Beth E. Mooney","Gerard, thank you. That is a good question and let me compare and contrast what I think is some of important differences. As we closed out last year of 2013, the average efficiency ratio for our peer group was 65%. So some piece of what Key has successfully done is close the gap to the peer group through the successful completion of our Fit for Growth initiative. So as we start this year, we are now in line with competitors. And in that average, obviously, there are different business models. And I think that's something that's worthy of just a little discussion because some of the competitors there that you would outline have larger payments in credit card businesses or potentially some high-yielding consumer businesses. Our strategy as we have outlined it, is to be largely a commercial bank with distinctive corporate bank capabilities. And as you've watched our growth, it's been a commercial lending, investment banking and debt placement fees. Those are a different business mix in this different business model. They carry a higher efficiency rate. And if you look at our loan mix, again, heavily skewed towards commercial lending, which is highly variable, again, that would have a different revenue component than high-yielding consumer asset. So some piece of as you look across a peer group, I think you have to look at business model, business mix and where the growth is and what the company strategy is. So I think it's important that we did close the GAAP to our peers, our Fit for Growth and the efforts we've undertaken. I think it's important to note, we say it is a journey and we are committed to further progress within our range. And whether, let's just say, that anything we can do to accelerate or enhance our performance, we will do. And then I think it is inherent that a 65% average for the industry, this revenue environment of low interest rate is clearly pressuring the efficiency and productivity of our industry in general. So I would tell you that I think I'm pleased with our progress, but never satisfied. And that we will continue to show progress in the range and interest rates of a modest amount, as Don outlined in his answer, will give us the benefit to get into the '50s.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Speaking of peer groups, you guys are a leader when it comes to credit. Obviously, credit improvement has been very, very good and then your capital levels are very strong. As you identified, you're at the -- one of the top of the list in returning capital to shareholders. The question is, you have so much excess capital, maybe it's debatable on how much, but I think most people would suggest you have excess capital. When do you think you'll be comfortable going to the Fed during the CCAR process asking for more than 100% of earnings to give back to shareholders so that the capital ratios don't continue to grow? Granted, I know the primary goal is to grow the balance sheet, but it -- the growth isn't fast enough yet for the industry. So when do you think -- or what do you need to see that you're comfortable saying, \"Okay, we can go for over 100%?\"","Beth E. Mooney","Gerard, this is Beth, again. One of the things I think is important that we had built a consistent track record with our shareholders about how they can, within the CCAR process, which as you know governs capital that Key has been a consistent as well as a peer leading returner of capital. We have always talked about our capital levels as a strength over time because how we invest, how we return and how we deploy that capital will be important to shareholder-value creation. So we are the highest of our -- in our ability to return capital for the second year in a row with increase in share repurchases and common dividends. But it is, ultimately, a regulatory-driven process. So at the end of the day, we will continue to be thoughtful about how we approach that. And if you gauge us against our bank peers, I think we fared well in this year's process, and it is important to us that we continue to give that track record and consistency of capital management as part of our business plan.","Operator","Next question comes from Jennifer Demba from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just wondering if you could give us some more details about the composition of your C&I growth this quarter is very strong, and how much of it may have been participation versus indication?","Christopher Marrott Gorman","Jennifer, it's Chris. Let me first start by saying, it was broad-based. So really, we have sort of 3 legs to the stool. One is our KeyBanc Capital Markets platform that goes to market based on industry verticals. And some of the industry verticals where we had a lot of growth there would be areas like industrial, areas like energy. We also had nice growth in our real estate business, and our real estate business is really focused on 2 principal areas. One are what we call owners of real estate, which is principally multifamily and also mid-cap reach, both public and private. We had nice growth there. And then our leasing business, which is really a kind of a specialty business in that they focus a lot on technology, a lot on medical equipment. They, too, had nice growth. So again, we've got -- we have these niches where we're very focused, very thoughtful about how we're going to the market, and we enjoyed broad-based growth. With respect to what is purchased paper, what were the lead on, one of the things we really like about our model is -- and I -- as I just mentioned, we lead 70% of the deals that we're involved with. So in those instances, we are syndicating those deals. We are a net seller of those. And of course, our broad model, only 15% of what we raise actually goes on the balance sheet. So these are -- it's a very focused area in terms of figuring out where we can be relevant. Just as an aside, we had our strategic drill down with our real estate team just 48 hours ago. And in our strategic drill downs, the teams come in and the RMs walk through each of their top 5 prospects. And what we're finding is in spite of the fact that there's competition out there, because of our differentiated model in real estate and in our other areas, we're able to continue to capture clients. And in the first quarter, we captured 119 new clients. So that's really how the model is built. It continues to work. We also got a little bit of a benefit. I think Don mentioned that we had a slight uptick, company-wide, in utilization. In the corporate bank, I would say the utilization uptick was even a little bit more than slight. And the other thing we're benefiting from is just we're constantly reallocating capital, and that's a process that began, really, in 2010. But as we sit here in 2014, we have a lot fewer relationships that we're actually exiting. So if you look at the confluence of all those things, that's a pretty good foundation for C&I growth.","Beth E. Mooney","And Jennifer, this is Beth. I would just add another thing that, I think, is interesting as I look at it across the company, that a lot of the growth is concentrated as you go up in size of the company. And as you see the upper end of the middle market perform, they are more likely to be incurring leverage to acquire companies, because we see a trend towards people looking more to growth through strategic acquisition than organic investment. We've seen some sign of borrowings to do share repurchase, that companies think their own currency is a good investment. And at the smaller end of the market, while we see growth, it is not as strong as it is among our upper-end mill market and corporate clients.","Donald R. Kimble","That's exactly right, Beth. And the other thing we're seeing is you wouldn't expect this, but there is -- the competition is more intense with the smaller companies. So what we're doing is, really, focusing, throughout Key, on some of the larger ones.","Operator","Next question is from Bob Ramsey, FBR Capital Markets.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I was just curious. I know you all said that your net interest income guidance incorporates a relatively stable margin from where we are today. And of course, this quarter, without the benefit of the mix shift out of shorter-term liquid assets and the loans, your margin would have contracted, I don't know, 6 or 7 basis points. I'm just curious, what gives you confidence that it will be stable from here, particularly as you do shift a little bit into LCR assets through the year?","Donald R. Kimble","Good question. And the couple of things that happened this past quarter that we wouldn't expect to have continued drag going forward: one, is that we had an adjustment to offset some of that liquidity because of the issuance of our long-term debt, and it's added about $1 billion on an average basis from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, and that reflected the issuances we did, including parent company, to position us for our CCAR plans; second was that in the first quarter, our loan fees were a lot lower than what we would've expected, that -- and it was a little over $5 million weaker than first quarter of last year. And that had additional pressure on the margin and we would expect that while there still may be some challenge there, we wouldn't see the incremental drop-off there that we did this past quarter.","Beth E. Mooney","And Bob, the one thing I would add that we always watch, because I think we saw an example of it in the fourth quarter, is levels of liquidity that cannot necessarily be anticipated, is what I'd call always the wildcard of pressure. And in the fourth quarter, it was specifically some of the flows from our commercial mortgage servicing business, which has been a nice source of income for us, as well as stable deposits. But as some of those CMBS portfolios unwind at different times, you can get liquidity flows that could pressure margins. So liquidity is always something that's hard to predict that we will always identify if that's an issue in any quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Usdin from Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","We saw some pretty big swings, obviously related to escrow accounts. Just how should we think about that going forward? And was there some seasonality in there? Or how should we sort of think about those balances going forward?","Christopher Marrott Gorman","So Ken, it's Chris. That was actually part of the BofA portfolio that we purchased and we completely anticipated that. And what happened is there were some planned payoffs and when they're of large CMBS loans, and what happens is the escrow flows through, both principal and a bunch of other payments. So there were about $18 billion that flowed through in and out in a short period of time in the fourth quarter. That will -- it probably will not be to that extent going forward, but it is a lumpy business and you will have flows, escrow flows through it. As we think about that business, we think about the stable servicing business, having about doubled from pre BofA portfolio acquisition it used to run about $7 million per quarter. Now we think it will run about $15 million per quarter. But there will be, from time to time, large escrow swings. By the way, the core deposit base actually increased both in the quarter and year-over-year.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from line of Keith Murray from ISI.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Speaking about your ROA target, the 1% to 1.25%, you're kind of in the middle of that range now, only about 12 bps from the high end. We think about the efficiency improvements you have out there, the loan growth outlook. I know credit, obviously, is performing better than normal. But do you think, at a certain point in time, the franchise might be able to do above that 1.25%? And is that a target you might want to revisit?","Donald R. Kimble","That will be a target we, hopefully, will be revisiting at some point in time. But to your point that with the efficiency improvements, with expansion of the margin as rates would go up, that, we think, there would be opportunity to reassess. But I think you hit on the right variables now, which is that us offsetting some of those headwinds, really, is coming from our credit cost being so low that with provision expense of $6 million and charge up to $20 million, well, we'd like to say that's our new normal. I don't think that's something that we can count on a long term.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. And then just curious on the tax rate. It came up a little bit this quarter. What should we think about this in going forward?","Donald R. Kimble","It did, and we have stated that we think our tax rate will be between the 26% and 28%. And we were toward the higher end of that this past quarter.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So that range still holds. Okay.","Donald R. Kimble","Yes, please.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And then just finally, Beth, you've talked about improving asset productivity. People in our types of seats, we don't get to see all the internal things. What type of metrics should we be looking at over time? Should we look at things like PPNR per employee? Just give some guidance on what you think is something to note.","Beth E. Mooney","Keith, I'll take some thoughts on that, and then I will ask Don if he has any additional comments. One is, obviously, a high-lying metric that you should watch is the level of growth, because one of the things we've talked about in terms of asset efficiency is the mix between loans and investments on our balance sheet in becoming a more productive balance sheet. And then as we look at it, it should be against our targeted client segments, which we've identified: our strength in commercial lending; corporate banking; as well as we have now entered some consumer products with the successful conversion of credit card, although that also, really, is an attractive fee income base for us with the transactional capabilities in there. And then we are looking at new clients, as well as expanded clients, and making sure that as we do lend into these clients that we are getting good cross-sell and appropriate returns. And Don, what else would you add to that?","Donald R. Kimble","I think you've hit on an important point for us, and that's something that we need to see how we can address to provide a little bit more of a foreshadowing of those improvements in productivity that, I think -- when you mentioned PPNR to headcount and also revenue to headcount, I think those would be good variables. But it's something that we should look internally to see if there's other ways or measures that we can provide that will at least provide a little bit more insight.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Sameer Gokhale from Janney Capital.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I had a couple of questions here. The first one was just looking at your noninterest income, the chart on Page 10, with cards and payments, that at -- of about looks like 9% of the mix. And I think you had mentioned, you have some new management to run the business and to kind of grow it. So could you give me a sense for how much you expect that piece to increase as a percentage of the overall pie, say, over the next 12 to 24 months? It's relatively small now, but certainly, payment seems to be a big focus of interest -- area of interest. So just curious if you could give me a sense for the growth expectations as a mix percentage relative to the overall noninterest income.","Donald R. Kimble","Yes, that -- there's really 3 components that are included in that line item: one is debit card revenues, second is credit card fee revenues and third is more commercial payments revenues. And we are investing in each of those 3 areas and we would expect that growth to outpace the rest of the bank and expect that to be an area of outperformance for us. But keep in mind that these are not programs that we're designing to be national in footprint, especially for the credit card and ATM. It really is -- our debit card, it's more based to serve our retail customer base, and we feel there's a great opportunity to increase the penetration there, but not something that we're going to -- becoming a national player.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Understood. That's helpful. And then also, I think in the commentary, there was some reference to some complexity associated with the prepaid cards. I'm not sure I understood what that was referencing, if you wouldn't mind clarifying that?","Christopher Marrott Gorman","Sure, this is Chris. I just mentioned that the large prepaid opportunities are complex transactions. Sometimes they're with the issuers or government entities, and I mentioned that there's a long lead time.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I see, okay. And then just on a different note, I know you've talked a lot about expenses. One of the things I was curious about, I mean, you clearly laid out your expectations for charge-offs in your guidance. And I was curious about how we should think about the interplay between higher charge-offs or if you will, normalized charge-offs relative to workout-related costs. From an expense standpoint, it seems like the 2 are related, and if charge-offs normalize, then you should see an increase in those type of loan workout costs. How should we think about that? Or do you feel that incrementally as you get -- even if you get to that 40-basis-points number, there's not much of an incremental lift in those types of expenses?","William L. Hartmann","Yes, this is Bill Hartmann. I think, if you take a look at what is actually driving the level of net charge-offs that we have right now, and Don alluded to this when he discussed the level of recoveries and the gross charge-off level, we have benefited from some strong recoveries in the latest quarter. As the -- as those recoveries abate, the cost of actually running your workout organization declines, and we've had a fairly dramatic decline in the cost of our workout organization. So we think that by normalizing, it actually is a reduction in recoveries, as well as continued improvement in the gross charge-off levels.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","So another way of thinking about it is you don't expect any upward pressure from recovery-related expense -- workout-related cost going forward?","William L. Hartmann","No. In fact, probably the opposite continues.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from CLSA.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","My question relates to Slide 13, and I'll ask my question by way of an analogy. If I played golf yesterday and shot 89 and I got a new driver, a new lessons and a new caddie, and then I promised to break 90 in 3 years, you would say that I'm sandbagging a little bit. And so what I see here is you guys shot 64.9% in the first quarter with your efficiency ratio. You're committed to growing revenues faster than expenses. And by 2017, you say you'll shoot under 65%. So is this target rigorous enough? And I wouldn't know -- I have a separate peer group here, we all have our peer groups, but I have peers at 60%. And I'd also point out, as you know I pointed out before, 2 decades ago -- and it's the 2-decade anniversary of KeyCorp as of March 1, the efficiency ratio was 58%. So Beth, under your -- as you as -- at the head, efficiencies improved, caps return improved, the share price has improved. You've outperformed peer, but it just seems like looking out over the next 2 to 3 years, this efficiency target doesn't go far enough.","Beth E. Mooney","Well, Mike, I appreciate it and we will take our golf lessons and invest in new golf clubs and wait for the weather to warm up, one thing that hasn't come up in our call. I would tell you that it is important that we felt it was a good thing for us to do to be responsive to the question to what sorts of things move us within the range. And at this point in time, we are not moving the range from 60% to 65% but we are showing the path to our ability to reduce within the range. It is also important to note that the business growth is net of investment because I think it is important, as you list the things that we have accomplished, it is because we are also investing in our franchise, that it's important that we grow this business in smart and appropriate ways. And then as I look at our revenue mix, we are -- about 60% of our income does come from our loan book, which is a highly variable loan book, not high-yielding consumer assets, as I mentioned earlier on Gerard's question. So some piece of it is embedded in our revenue component, that we will drive growth through our business activity. Interest rates will benefit our particular mix of business when the short end gets a little relief. And it is on us. And part of the reason we identified Fit for Growth to know that near term, in a pressured revenue environment, we must continue to work the expense side of the equation to create that progress without a benefit from interest rate. So what we're trying to show is we are committed to a path to the low end of the range without any external help from the environment, and we will consistently improve. And as I said earlier, we will be disciplined but constructively impatient as well.","Donald R. Kimble","The one thing I'd add there, Mike, as well is that, as Beth highlighted, it's taken us down to the lower end of 60% range, with interest rates we'll be in the 50s. Keep in mind, too, that back in 1994, Key had a margin of over 4%, and we're right at 3% now. And that won't improve without interest rates going up. And so that does impact that efficiency ratio as well, in addition to the additional -- the costs we're incurring associated with regulatory burdens today compared to 1994.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Well, just a follow-up, as you say some of that margin might not come back since you're more commercial-oriented today, I guess what I'm looking for is some recognition that the efficiency is somehow related to structural issues, especially after 2 decades. I mean, it would be nice to see ROE or at least ROA by state. Maybe we have ROA by state somewhere and I couldn't find it, or maybe you could disclose that. It just seems to me, out of all your states, there might be a few that you could consider for divesting. Any thought process about more structural changes at KeyCorp?","Beth E. Mooney","Mike, this is Beth. Some piece of the discussion around our geographic footprint is against the broader business model where we are really also focused heavily on our commercial clients and the ability to integrate our corporate bank. So while our geographic presence and physical branches are across the states, in every market we also have additional business banking, commercial, private banking and corporate banking opportunities. So the mix of our revenue is very fulsome in our various geographies. And in a digital image-enabled world, the cost of maintaining a branch network is not a driver of our structural inefficiency. So I think, as I look at, the priorities I would set against our geographies is to drive more revenue from those physical presence, and they are profitable.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush, NAB Research, LLC.","Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division","I'm going to ask the opposite question from Mike. You've certainly done a great deal with the company, Beth. I think we're happy to see that loan growth is finally starting to ramp up. As one questioner said, you've got plenty of capital. So my question would be, do you finally have the leeway to grow in some of these markets where you don't have as much market share as you would like? And my add-on question will be, if so, what would those markets be?","Beth E. Mooney","Nancy, I think that's a great question because some piece of how we are looking at the future is the interplay of digital and mobile and how that will affect both the consumer business, but our relative positioning within markets. And I think some piece of what might be the paradigm going forward is that I don't think any of us, as you listen to myself and to my peers, who will tell you that we don't believe that market presence and branches are still a core and important part of our value proposition in how we go to market across our various geographies. But potentially, density is less important. Because as you think about it, there is a transformational change. So as part of what we are doing within our strategies is upping our investments in mobile, digital and mobile and digital advertising as well so that as we connect those experiences between the branch, online, mobile, digital that we have a value proposition that we think will also enhance our market growth over and above just investing in more physical stores. So I think that's an exciting opportunity, and that some of the old paradigms are shifting. And then I think the emphasis that we have placed on commercial, our middle market and business continuum of companies with sales of $25 million to $1.5 billion, those squarely sit in our geographies. And as we acquire and expand those relationships, we get private banking opportunities, we get incremental growth. So I think we are growing our markets with our go-to-market business model.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio from KBW.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","A lot of my primary questions have been asked, but Don, the net charge-off ratio guidance, I mean, it's -- of below 0 -- of 40 basis points to 60 basis points, I mean, you're so far below that right now, it's not even funny. So just kind of wondering if I could get your thoughts on the relationship between the provision expense and the net charge-off ratio as you see over the next several quarters?","Donald R. Kimble","Our guidance assumes that the charge-offs will equal provision. So that's our expectation going into it, but it will be adjusted based on changes in overall credit quality and outlook for losses inherent in the portfolio.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","But your provision expense was lower than the charge-offs this quarter, right? So is that something...","Donald R. Kimble","That's correct. You're right. It was. It was $14 million lower this quarter. You're right.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And so going forward, it will start to match?","Donald R. Kimble","That will be our expectation, yes.","Operator","And our last question comes from Steve Scinicariello from UBS.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just wanted to follow up on something that I think is an important distinction that you're making between productivity improvement and efficiency improvement. I just wanted to kind of get a little color about that. Some of the things that you're doing to kind of drive productivity improvement, because a lot of times when you say efficiency, people just assume cost-cutting. But clearly, that with the progress that you guys are making, it's both revenue- and expense-driven. So just curious, just to hear a little bit more of the success that you're having, improving productivity, how you're doing it. And specifically, how are you improving, like the cross-sell in the corporate bank, which seems to be a real big driver of this?","Donald R. Kimble","Great. I'll go ahead and take a first crack at that and then I'll turn it over to Chris as far as the corporate bank. But as far as productivity, if Dennis Devine were here and answering this question as it's related to retail, he'd talk about the process that we put in place over a year ago as far as enhancing our overall sales management process in the retail channel. And we would acknowledge that our sales per person in that branch have been lower than where our peers have been. And we're taking steps to manage it with the expectations laid out on a weekly basis and measured on a daily basis to see how we can change that. And so we're seeing significant improvements in our productivity in our branches. And it's not about any type of rocket science. It's making sure we have very clear expectations and holding people accountable to those expectations. And we're seeing that progress. And so that's one area of productivity. Chris, you want to talk about the corporate bank?","Christopher Marrott Gorman","Sure, I'll be happy to, Don. So there's a few things we're focused on with respect to productivity. The first that we talk about a lot are new clients and expanded relationships, because we think we have a platform that we can leverage but we need to continue to add new clients and expand the relationships that we have, and we have very specific targets around those. We also spend a lot of time talking about the revenue per person. For example, right now on a trailing basis, the revenue per person in the corporate bank is $830,000. We've set some very specific goals around those as well. The other thing that we're thinking about in terms of productivity is to leverage some of the investments that we've already made. We talked earlier today about commercial payments. We really need to leverage that. Healthcare. With -- throughout Key, we have about a $7 billion health care portfolio and we have a company-wide effort to be very focused facilities-based health care on how we can deliver the whole platform. And then we've invested a lot of time. Beth alluded to the coordination and the collaboration between the corporate bank and the community bank, which is very important in how we can be distinctive going to market. So we spend a lot of time looking at that. And then the last 2 pieces are things we've talked about before in terms of generating productivity. One is strategic just kind of tuck-in type acquisitions. And I think the BofA third-party commercial loan servicing portfolio would be a great example of that. And lastly, and most importantly, is -- and it's one of the things that has an impact when you start comparing our efficiency ratio, is continuing to invest in people. Because we think our platform is under leveraged, we're out there hiring people that have -- they're senior people that have existing relationships. And there, admittedly, is a bit of a lag as you bring senior bankers onto the platform. But we've proven to ourselves that they can be extremely productive. So those are really the 4 prongs of the growth strategy.","Operator","And there are no questions in queue. I'll now turn it back over to Beth Mooney for final comments.","Beth E.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chairman and CEO, Beth Mooney. Please go ahead.","Beth Mooney","Thank you, Operator. Good morning and welcome to KeyCorp\u2019s third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. In the room with me is Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer; Chris Gorman, President of Banking, and Mark Midkiff, our Chief Risk Officer.","Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question and answer segment of our call. ","I\u2019m now turning to Slide 3. We reported solid results this quarter with earnings per share of $0.45, up 2% from last quarter and almost 30% from the year-ago period. Our results drove improvement in our cash efficiency ratio, which was 58.7%, and our return on average common tangible equity was 16.8%, both up over 300 basis points from the year-ago period. Revenue was up 3% from last year driven by broad based growth across our company, with positive trends in our community bank and corporate bank. Our growth reflects the success of our business model, competitive positioning in the market, and investments we continue to make across the franchise.","Average loans grew 2% from the prior year and were down slightly from the prior quarter. The decline in average balances were impacted by a lower starting point coming into the quarter. Importantly, we saw stronger commercial loan growth as we moved through the quarter, which is reflected in our period end balances which were up 1% from the prior quarter. We expect to see further growth in the fourth quarter, which Don will cover in his comments.","Underlying trends in our fee-based businesses remain strong. Investment banking and debt placement fees grew compared to the prior quarter and year-ago period, reaching a new record for the trailing 12 months. Driving this quarter\u2019s results were strong advisory and loan syndications as well as continued benefit from our acquisition of Cain Brothers. ","We also continue to be disciplined with our expense management. This quarter, expenses were relatively stable after adjusting for merger-related charges in the year-ago period and from notable items last quarter, and we accomplished this despite the added costs from Cain Brothers acquisition and other investments that we continue to make in our business. We remain committed to further efficiency improvement and reaching our targeted range of 54 to 56%.","The final two sections on this slide highlight our strong position in terms of both risk management and capital. Credit quality remains a strength with net charge-offs to loans of 27 basis points. We believe that maintaining our moderate risk profile will serve us well as we move through different parts of the credit cycle.","Our approach to capital has remained consistent and focused on maintaining a strong capital position while returning a large portion of our earnings to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Consistent with our 2018 capital plan, our board of directors increased our common stock dividend by 42% to $0.17 per share in the third quarter. We also repurchased $542 million of common shares. Key\u2019s common equity Tier 1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.9%.","Overall, it was another good quarter for Key with broad based growth across our franchise. We continue to be disciplined with expenses while investing for growth and maintaining our credit underwriting standards. This resulted in strong bottom line performance which drove further improvement in both efficiency and returns, and we are positioned to build on our momentum as we move through the end of the year. As Don will discuss in his remarks, we expect to continue to deliver positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter driven by linked quarter revenue growth and relatively stable expense, which will result in our sixth consecutive year of positive operating leverage. Despite the recent sell-off in bank stocks, we remain positive about our long-term outlook and the steps we have taken to position the company to perform through the business cycle.","Before I turn the call over to Don, I wanted to mention our upcoming investor day that we are hosting on October 30. The purpose of the event is to expand more on our business model, strategies and positioning, and to showcase our strong leadership team. If you are an analyst or an institutional investor and have not yet received an invitation, please contact our Investor Relations team. We are also making the event available to all of our important stakeholders through a live webcast that can be accessed through the IR webpage.","With that, let me hand the call over to Don.","Don Kimble","Thanks Beth, and I\u2019m on Slide 5. ","As Beth said earlier, we recorded third quarter net income from continuing operations of $0.45 per common share. Our results compare to $0.32 per share in the year-ago period and $0.44 in the second quarter. I will cover many of the remaining items in the rest of my presentation, so I\u2019m now turning to Page 6.","Total average loans of $88.5 billion were up 2% from the prior year and down slightly from the prior quarter. Average balances were impacted by a lower starting point coming into the quarter and a continuation of low utilization levels and elevated pay downs. Importantly, we saw increased new business activity and positive momentum as we moved through the quarter, which was reflected in our period end linked quarter growth of 1% and commercial growth of almost 2%. ","Clients remain optimistic and confident. Their businesses are performing well, increasing profits and generating sufficient cash to fund their business needs, resulting in lower demand than we would have expected earlier in this year. Despite this, our pipelines are strong and activity is up. As a result, we expect loan balances to be up in the fourth quarter on a low single digit percentage basis.","Continuing on to Slide 7, average deposits totaled $106 billion for the third quarter of 2018, up $1.6 billion or 2% unannualized compared to the second quarter. The cost of our total deposits were up 10 basis points from the second quarter, reflecting the recent rate increases as well as the continued migration of our portfolio into higher yielding products. Our deposit beta for the current quarter was 52%, resulting in a cumulative beta of 29% which we expect to migrate higher over time. ","On a linked quarter basis, deposit growth was primarily driven by retail and commercial relationships as well as short term and seasonal deposit inflows. We continue to have a strong, stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting for over 60% of our total deposit mix. ","Turning to Slide 8, taxable equivalent net interest income was $993 million for the third quarter of 2018. The net interest margin was 3.18%. These results compared to taxable equivalent net interest income of $962 million and a net interest margin of 3.15% for the third quarter of 2017, and $987 million and 3.19% in the second quarter of last year. Purchase accounting accretion contributed $26 million or 9 basis points to our third quarter results. This compares with $28 million, also 9 basis points in the second quarter, and $48 million or 16 basis points in the third quarter of 2017. Excluding purchase accounting accretion, net interest was up $53 million or 6% from the third quarter of 2017. The increase was largely driven by higher interest rates and earning asset growth. Net interest income increased $8 million or 1% from the prior quarter, excluding purchase accounting accretion, benefiting from higher interest rates and day count, partially offset by lower loan fees. ","This quarter\u2019s margin was negatively impacted by higher levels of liquidity as our cash position increased almost a billion dollars from last quarter. The higher level of liquidity reduced our margin by two basis points. Also during the quarter, the average one-month LIBOR would only increase 14 basis points compared to the 25 basis point increase in the Fed funds rate. If the one-month LIBOR had increased by 25 basis points, our net interest income would have been $5.5 million higher and the margin would have been 3.20%. ","Moving on to Slide 9, Key\u2019s non-interest income was $609 million for the third quarter of 2018 compared to $592 million for the year-ago quarter and down from $660 million in the prior period. Growth from the year-ago period was primarily driven by a $25 million increase in investment banking and debt placement fees related to strength in advisory fees, including the benefit of the acquisition of Cain Brothers, as well as organic growth. Operating lease and other leasing gains increased as well, related to higher volume and lease residual losses in the year-ago period. Compared to the prior quarter, the decline is largely due to the $78 million net gain on our insurance sale, which was recognized in other income last quarter. Trust and investment services income also declined, primarily reflecting the sale of Key insurance and benefit services. Partially offsetting these declines was a $41 million increase in operating lease income due to a lease residual loss in second quarter 2018. Investment banking and debt placement fees also increased a record trailing 12-month level of $664 million. ","Turning to Slide 10, Key\u2019s non-interest expense was $964 million for the third quarter 2018 compared to $992 million in the third quarter of 2017 and $993 million in the prior quarter, down 3% from both periods. The third quarter of 2017 included $36 million of merger-related charges. Excluding these charges, the slight expense growth from the year-ago period was largely related to acquisitions and investments over the year, including Cain Brothers. This growth offset the realization of cost savings and efficiencies across the entire franchise.","Compared to the second quarter, the decrease in expenses was largely driven by a $33 million decline in personnel expense. This was driven in part by lower severance and incentive compensation expense related to efficiency-related charges last quarter. Importantly as we move toward the end of 2018 and into next year, we\u2019re committed to continuous improvement in our efficiency efforts across the franchise.","Moving onto Slide 11, our credit quality remains strong. Net charge-offs were $60 million or 27 basis points of average total loans in the third quarter, which continues to be below our target range. The provision for credit losses was $62 million for the quarter. Non-performing loans were up this quarter as a result of a few credits with no concentration by industry or type. NPLs represented 72 basis points of period end loans. Other leading indicators such as criticized loans and delinquencies all showed improvement this quarter. At June 30, 2018, our total reserve for loan losses represented 99 basis points of period end loans and 138% coverage of our non-performing loans.","Turning to Slide 12, capital also remains a strength of the company with a common equity Tier 1 ratio at the end of the third quarter of 9.9%. As Beth mentioned earlier, in line with our 2018 capital plan, we increased our common share dividend by 42% this quarter from $0.12 a share to $0.17 a share. We also continued to repurchase shares, which totaled $542 million this quarter. ","Slide 13 includes our outlook for the fourth quarter 2018 relative to the third quarter results as we build our momentum through the end of the year. We expect positive operating leverage driven by revenue growth and relatively stable expenses. We expect average loan balances to increase by a low single digit percentage in the range of 1 to 2% from the third quarter level of $88.5 billion. Deposits are expected to remain relatively stable with the third quarter. Net interest income is expected to be up in the low single digit range from the third quarter, again approximately 1 to 2%, and this reflects the benefits of the September rate increase. We also expect one more rate increase in December, which will have minimal impact in the fourth quarter. We would expect our margin to increase one to two basis points, assuming our liquidity position remains at the relatively same level.","We anticipate that non-interest income will be up in the mid single digit range from the $609 million reported in the third quarter. Growth is expected from many of the fee income areas, especially investment banking and debt placement fees. As I mentioned, we continue to expect non-interest expense to be relatively stable with the third quarter amount of $964 million. ","We had previously assumed a benefit from a reduction in the FDIC assessment during the fourth quarter, which is no longer included in our outlook for next quarter. We had also previously communicated that we would be approaching the high end of our efficiency ratio target by the end of the year. Continue to expect our efficiency ratio to improve in the fourth quarter from the third quarter level, but the absence of the FDIC benefit and the lower loan balances will impact the pace of our progress in the fourth quarter. As Beth communicated, we remain committed to our target efficiency ratio of 54 to 56% and would expect to be within this range in the second half of 2019.","Net charge-offs and provision expense are expected to remain relatively stable with the third quarter, and we expect our GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 16 to 17%, up slightly from the third quarter level. ","As Beth said, this was a solid quarter with continued growth across our franchise. We are benefiting from the results of our efforts to improve the efficiency and returns and look forward to continuing to deliver on the commitments we have made. ","I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to the Operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","First, from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","Scott Siefers","Morning guys. ","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","Scott Siefers","Don, appreciate the color on the margin guidance for next quarter, up one to two basis points. I guess I was a little surprised that the core wasn\u2019t up this quarter. I guess maybe if you could just provide a little more color on the main puts and takes that you see affecting that margin rate, and then how your rate sensitivity plays off from here.","Don Kimble","You\u2019re right - I think the margin was lower than what we would have expected as far as the percentage compared to coming into the quarter. For the third quarter, there were really two items that negatively impacted us this quarter. One was the liquidity levels, and as I mentioned, our cash position was up $900 million to $1 billion for the quarter, which cost us about two basis points in our margin. Didn\u2019t have much of an impact on net interest income but did negatively impact the overall margin.","The second piece was, and I mentioned this earlier, that the one-month LIBOR only went up 14 basis points this quarter, and so normally you would expect to see that move in parallel to the Fed funds rate, and if it would have, that would have added another two basis points to the margin or roughly $5.5 million. So as we look to the fourth quarter, we do expect to see more of a rate increase benefit like we would have expected this quarter, so probably a couple basis points being driven from that and very little pressure coming through the purchase accounting accretion. ","Also keep in mind that our investment portfolio puts out about a $1.2 billion of cash flows each quarter and the reinvestment rate there is about 1.2 to 1.3% higher for those cash flows for the new go-to yields compared to what\u2019s running off the portfolio as well, so that will also be helpful going into the fourth quarter.","Scott Siefers","Okay, that\u2019s perfect, thank you. Maybe just as a quick follow-up on that, LIBOR, I guess we can sort of watch where that has moved so we know what the couple basis point impact would be. I think you had suggested--so liquidity levels, the guidance assumes they sort of stay the same. What would be the main deltas that would change liquidity levels? I imagine the pace of loan growth and demand would be a factor, but what would materially alter those levels?","Don Kimble","The only other impact that you didn\u2019t cite really was deposit flows, and this quarter we did have some growth in some temporary deposits along with core growth, and so if that deposit growth outpaces loan growth, we\u2019d see a build-up in our liquidity position. Not expecting that, but as we said, we expect loan growth up 1 to 2% from third quarter and deposits relatively stable on an average basis.","Scott Siefers","Perfect. Just final one, really ticky-tack here, guiding to 16 to 17% GAAP tax rate in the fourth quarter. Will that sustain into next year or will it revert back up to a more recently typical level?","Don Kimble","The 16 to 17% continues to expect a level of tax credits from some leasing activities, and at this point in time we think that\u2019s a reasonable assumption. We\u2019ll provide more guidance on our outlook in January for \u201919.","Scott Siefers","Okay, perfect. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Peter Winter","Morning. I wanted to ask about loan growth. You talked about the C&I, but if I look at some of the other loan portfolios, we saw a moderation or an improvement from prior quarters, particularly commercial real estate. I\u2019m just wondering, some of these other portfolios beside C&I, are you close to an inflection point and could see growth next year? ","Don Kimble","As far as commercial real estate, I would say that we don\u2019t see that as an area of strong growth for us. We like our business model there and risk profile. We did see some balance lift here in the third quarter from some relationships that we had in progress, but wouldn\u2019t cite that as being a leading area for growth. ","The other area that we did see some growth this past quarter was our indirect auto, and we would expect to see some continued growth there as we\u2019re continuing to originate through our existing midwest franchise that was legacy Key, so that should show some growth for us. But I\u2019d say a good percentage of the growth should continue to come from C&I growth for us, and that\u2019s where we believe we have our strength and that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing good pipelines for us as well.","Peter Winter","On the C&I side, are you starting to see with that growth end of period maybe pay downs slow, and would you expect that to continue going forward?","Don Kimble","Our pay downs really have elevated compared to historic levels. I don\u2019t know that they\u2019ve slowed down much. Utilization rates are still relatively stable for the third quarter for what they were in the second quarter. The good thing is our activity levels picked up as far as new origination volumes late in the quarter, and that\u2019s where we saw the growth and that\u2019s what gives us optimism going into next quarter, is that we\u2019re seeing those activity levels pick up and that\u2019s been helpful.","Peter Winter","Great. Thanks Don.","Operator","Our next question is from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Good morning. I just wanted to ask about several fee categories that were weaker than I would have thought - service charges, corporate service income, cards and payments, and you mentioned a revenue recognition change which I think impacted it on a year-over-year basis. But maybe just discuss a little bit why those three buckets were weaker and then your outlook on those three, which a couple of them are pretty big drivers for you, so. Thanks.","Don Kimble","Service charges you mentioned, there was a couple of items there that were adjustments, including some revenue recognition true-up there as well. We would expect growth in that line item for the fourth quarter to more normalize for us for the quarter, so it was artificially low this quarter for some of the adjustments there. ","Corporate services income really was down mainly because of derivative incomes coming down this quarter, that just saw a little less demand from our customer base for that category. It has been an area of growth for us historically, but there is some variability to that based on customer activity. ","Then as far as the cards and payments related revenues, we did have some items in the second quarter that were more purchases of accounts and equipment that would have had that level be a little be a stronger. It is an area of growth for us, we do expect the fourth quarter to be up, and we expect that to be an area of growth for us going forward into 2019 as well.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Just stepping back, kind of bigger picture, revenue overall, I feel like was soft this quarter. Some of it seems like it\u2019s temporary, and obviously you\u2019ve addressed some of the pieces with loans and fees. But just kind of big picture, do you think this was a quarter where things just kind of went against you from a revenue perspective, or do you think the revenue outlook is going to be a little bit weaker than you would have thought and maybe you should be focused on tightening in the costs a little bit more?","Don Kimble","I would say that loan balances have come in lower than what we would have expected for the third quarter, and that really was the surprise that we had at the end of the second quarter, which continued for us, which was the lower levels of utilization and the impact from some higher pay downs. So as we would have come into this year, we would have expected loan growth to pick up in the second half of the year and we haven\u2019t seen that, and so that is a surprise for us based on what our expectations would have been coming into the year.","As far as the fee income categories, when we look at the activity and the volumes and the customer activity around these areas, we\u2019re seeing positive trends, and so our guidance for the fourth quarter says that fee income should be up mid single digits on a linked quarter basis, so I think we\u2019re going to see some of that momentum come in the fourth quarter and, I think, help set the table for us going forward. ","You know, the follow-on point that you made, Matt, it\u2019s something we always do manage to, and if the revenue growth isn\u2019t there, then we do believe that it\u2019s important that we do manage our expenses more tightly, and that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll continue to look at and make sure that we\u2019re doing what we need to do to make sure that we live up to our commitments. ","Beth Mooney","Matt, this is Beth. We\u2019re obviously in the 2019 planning cycle and it is very much focused as we have, both Don and I, reiterated the commitment to the 54 to 56% efficiency ratio target, and that we plan to be operating within that by the back half of 2019. We are making sure we are constructively balancing both our outlook for revenue as well as appropriate expense levels and investments in order to achieve that.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ken Zerbe","Great, thanks. I was hoping you could elaborate just a little bit more on the higher non-performing loans that you saw in the quarter - I think it was up about $100 million. I know you said there wasn\u2019t any concentration, but was it a couple loans, was it a lot of loans? Just trying to figure it out. Thanks. ","Don Kimble","It really was just a few unrelated loans, and they weren\u2019t concentrated in any industry or geography at all. Don\u2019t view that as a trend for anything from a credit quality perspective. As I mentioned before, criticized and classified were down and delinquencies were down, so other trends would reinforce that credit quality continues to remain strong.","Ken Zerbe","Got it, okay. In terms of loan growth, I guess in fourth quarter--I know you were surprised that we\u2019re not seeing the rebound in second half loan growth more broadly speaking, but what could derail the growth in fourth quarter? I guess we\u2019re all probably a little bit worried that you expect it to go up, but are we going to be surprised again to the negative when fourth quarter ends? Thanks.","Chris Gore","Ken, it\u2019s Chris. Good morning. As we look at it, the reason we have confidence as we go into the fourth quarter is we have a strong backlog and we have a much better starting point. We also have a business that typically in the fourth quarter is particularly strong; for example, we have a significant M&A backlog that often pulls through financing. The other thing that we have is our leasing business can generate about 33% of their annual volume in the fourth quarter, and they\u2019re very focused on technology and healthcare equipment, so those are pretty good flows and we have pretty good visibility on that.","In terms of what could derail it, one, if we have dislocation in the markets and we can\u2019t get transactions complete, that\u2019s always a risk in our business. The other thing is that people continue to not borrow under their lines but use their cash flow to buy inventory out of cash, to invest in PP&E out of cash. The other thing, of course, that is always unique to our business model is we only put about 20% of the capital we raise on the balance sheet, so if by chance there are huge opportunities for us to better serve our clients by taking them to other markets, that too can have an impact on our loans, but the flipside of that would be it improves our fees. ","Ken Zerbe","Got it, okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Hi, good morning guys. Just following up on the NII and outlook and commentary, Don, can you just dig in a little bit more to what you\u2019re seeing in terms of customer behavior on the different sides of the business from a re-pricing perspective? Obviously you guys, like everyone else, are seeing the rate of increase move up on the 13 basis points of deposit costs this quarter, but can you give us a little color on segments in terms of any changes in terms of consumer versus commercial and how the behavior is starting to act, if any different?","Don Kimble","This last quarter, we did see the deposit betas move up for both consumer and commercial - consumer was in the mid-40s and the commercial segment was about 70%, so we did see both of those move up. There continues to be strong demand coming from both sides as far as looking for additional products that have higher rates and yields, and we\u2019re seeing that being offered to the customers across the board, whether it\u2019s the community banks up through the largest banks in the U.S. are providing some rates that are higher for some of the commercial deposits.","As we look forward to our deposit betas, we would think that for the fourth quarter, we\u2019re still going to be in the mid-50s as far as deposit betas, so maybe up just a touch from where we were in the third quarter. But over time, we\u2019ll continue to see that cumulative 29% beta inch up as consumer behaviors continue to seek higher deposit cost products.","Ken Usdin","Got it, okay. Second question, just on the mix of earning assets. You had some average deposit growth this quarter. You mentioned the loans weren\u2019t quite there. What\u2019s your philosophy right now in terms of the securities portfolio? Do you want to be putting incremental cash there, and what are you seeing in terms of front book versus back book yields?","Don Kimble","Sure. On the investment portfolio, we\u2019ve been maintaining that fairly stable - it\u2019s just shy of $30 billion, and it\u2019s been there for a number of quarters. Longer term, we do believe that our loan growth will be outpacing our deposit growth, and so we do believe that there will be an opportunity to continue to maintain that level of investment securities and not have to shift that mix overall.","Now, the good thing is on the investment portfolio, as I mentioned, we\u2019ve got about $1.2 billion of cash flow a quarter off the investment portfolio. The yield on that cash flow is 2.15 to 2.2%, and the new purchase volumes are coming in at 3.4 to 3.5, so we do see a nice lift there which helps offset some of the drift in the deposit base, and also any purchase accounting accretion changes.","Ken Usdin","Okay, thanks Don.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","John Pancari","Good morning. Back to the non-performer discussion, can you give us a little bit more specific detail around that? What was the number of credits, what were the sizes, and also what were the industries? I know you mentioned they\u2019re not concentrated, but what were the exact industries?","Don Kimble","I would say that it\u2019s five or less as far as the total credits, so it is a very few; and I would say that the industry types are very diverse. Mark, if you have just a general sense there?","Mark Midkiff","Yes, just broadly, from equipment to the real estate category. It\u2019s broad.","John Pancari","Okay. Are any of them loans to financial institutions?","Don Kimble","They are not, no.","John Pancari","Or leveraged loans?","Don Kimble","No, they\u2019re not.","John Pancari","Okay, all right. Related to that, the loan loss reserve is around 99 basis points now, although I know it\u2019s higher when you exclude the acquired portfolios. How are you feeling about that longer term here? Where do you think the appropriate longer term loan loss reserve level is, particularly in the context of where we are in this cycle and that we\u2019ve got a little bit of noise that\u2019s now surfacing in the non-accruals? Thanks.","Don Kimble","One, I don\u2019t want to have the non-accruals relate to future potential problems there - I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a trend that we would want to extend from here. Two, you\u2019re right - if you would take a look at the purchase accounting credit mark on the loan portfolio and add that to our total reserve, it\u2019s in the 115 to 116 level, and so I think that would be an appropriate assessment as to where that would trend over time as those purchased loans do mature and are replaced with new originations. ","I think the other thing that we need to keep in mind though, too, is the nature of this portfolio has changed significantly from where it was before the crisis, so it\u2019s a much cleaner portfolio, much less risk profile to it, and so we think that it would be appropriate range as far as the overall allowance being in that 115 to 116 range. Yet to be determined as far as the impact of CECL - we\u2019ll have that come through in 2020, and so that will set a new level, and I think we\u2019ll be well south of that 115 level before CECL is implemented, so we could [indiscernible] at that time.","John Pancari","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning. The first question I wanted to ask if you\u2019ve obviously addressed loan growth in many different ways. I\u2019m wondering, especially from you, Chris, if you could give us a little bit more sense of how competitive the non-banks are with your business and give us a sense of structure versus rate competition. Also, hear you loud and clear on the NPL composition, but I\u2019m wondering what your exposure is on balance sheet to either broadly syndicated leveraged lending or sponsor-back transactions.","Chris Gorman","Sure. Good morning, Erika. Just to give you a flavor on the competitive landscape, clearly there is competition and it manifests itself in structure and it manifests itself in pricing. The way we approach it is we price everything on a relationship basis, and so on the margin, 12.5 basis points does not make a huge difference for us as we go out there and holistically serve our clients. There is pricing pressure, but we don\u2019t find that it really degrades our returns in total.","Now as it relates to structure, there are some people that are taking duration risk, there are some people that are going out on the credit spectrum. That\u2019s not our business as we maintain our moderate risk profile. ","As it relates to the non-banks, most of their activity is around leveraged finance, so that\u2019s where you see the most activity by the non-banks. As it relates to our leveraged finance specifically, we have been flat in terms of our exposure to leveraged finance literally since before we completed the First Niagara transaction, where we grew by 40%. We get a lot of velocity out of that portfolio and so we\u2019re really pleased with where we are, and obviously we have the ability to distribute a lot of that paper, much of which frankly is purchased by some of the non-banks.","Erika Najarian","Okay. I\u2019ll just follow up more with the exposure offline. I wanted to follow up to Matt\u2019s question, and I want to not be difficult and ask this as respectively as possible, but during your prepared remarks you essentially told us that your efficiency target for the year in terms of getting to your range by year-end was pushed out at least three quarters. I understand the dynamic of the FDIC surcharge not going away, but I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ll tell us in two weeks, or how your thought process is about really trying to hit that efficiency ratio target even if revenue falls short. In other words, is there a capacity for expenses to be more meaningfully controlled as the revenue environment potentially doesn\u2019t improve next year, because I do think that that is probably part of why the discount on your stock persists to peers.","Don Kimble","Erika, as far as pushing out our guidance as far as the efficiency ratio, I think one of the things I\u2019d like to clarify is that we\u2019ve been talking about the fourth quarter where we\u2019d be approaching the high end of our targeted range with the benefit of the FDIC assessment, so with our guidance showing revenues up in the fourth quarter and expenses being relatively stable, even without the FDIC assessment, I think that would push our efficiency ratio into the 57 range, and if we would have had the 70 basis point benefit from FDIC, I think that would be pushing us close to that 56% range, which I think would be meeting our commitment as far as approaching the high end of the range.","When we talk about in the second half of next year being in that 54 to 56%, that\u2019s only to reflect in the first half of the year and especially in the first quarter, we have some seasonal items that cause our expenses to be elevated and it tends to be a seasonally weak first quarter. But your more global question, we will provide some more color on that at the investor day, and we will reaffirm that there are times when we have to push heavier on the expense side to make sure that we meet our commitments, so that\u2019s something we will live up to and we\u2019ll talk in more detail about that here on the 30th.","Erika Najarian","Great, thank you.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin Reevey with DA Davidson. Please go ahead.","Kevin Reevey","Good morning. Don, my question is for you, related to your recent share price movement. Can you give us some color as to what your appetite is for M&A, and would M&A be pushed to the backburner, and how aggressive should we expect to see you on the buyback?","Don Kimble","Sure, a couple things. One, on the M&A side, what we talked about as far as our focus going forward is maybe continuing to look at some very small investments and acquisitions that would be aligned in more people, products and capability, but nothing on the banking front at all. We do not believe that that\u2019s something that\u2019s necessary to deliver against our operating model and have not been focused on bank M&A, so that would not be priority. ","As far as our share buybacks, the pacing of those are really controlled by our capital plan that we submitted earlier this year, so as we noted before, we acquired or repurchased $542 million of stock here in this current quarter. Our total capital plan for this year is $1.2 billion, and so think about those share buybacks for the rest of the three quarters being fairly consistent throughout that remaining time period. But that does allow us to accelerate the pace based on the price sensitivity and allows us to navigate within those quarters a little bit, but not much in the way of the absolute level of share buybacks.","Kevin Reevey","Then related to revenue enhancements, can you talk about any revenue enhancements that you\u2019ve seen materialize related to First Niagara that you can pinpoint?","Don Kimble","The areas that we\u2019ve been talking about really are residential mortgage, and we still view that as a top candidate for us. The markets have not been good for us as far as the mortgage market, but we are making investments there and we do expect to see some nice trajectory going forward in residential mortgage.","The second area really has been on the payments side, and we have seen very good traction there. We are seeing the commercial payments and the commercial deposit products being offered throughout the former First Niagara customer base, and we are having a lot of success and traction with that. ","The third area where we have seen good activity is on the capital markets side. We\u2019ve been leveraging the capabilities that we bring to market, especially on the commercial real estate side, to meet the needs of the commercial real estate customers of First Niagara, and that\u2019s had a huge success for us.","The fourth area where we continue to see some growth is in the indirect auto space, and we\u2019ve taken that product and really started to sell that throughout some of the legacy Key footprint where we did have commercial relationships with those auto dealerships, and so we\u2019ve seen nice growth on a year-over-year basis in indirect auto and much of that coming from the new markets that Key has brought in. ","The last piece is more private banking, and we are seeing traction there. It is a longer sales cycle, but we are making progress on that front and believe that there still is opportunity for us to continue to offer up more wealth management and private banking traditional products to high end retail customers of First Niagara, and looking for some strong success there as well.","Kevin Reevey","Then lastly, your investment banking, debt placement fees continue to outperform. My question is how much better can it get? ","Chris Gorman","This is Chris. We feel good about where the business is. We\u2019re out there having great discussions with our clients. Our backlogs are strong. It\u2019s market dependent. This is a business that we\u2019ve grown since 2011 at about a 16% compound annual growth rate. We\u2019re confident that on a linked quarter, we will be up. We\u2019re confident that ultimately year over year, we\u2019ll be up, so we feel good about it.","Kevin Reevey","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Mike Mayo","Hi. I guess I\u2019ll ask a personal question, Beth. When do you have mandatory retirement, if at all, and how many more years do you expect to stay? One reason I ask is maybe we\u2019d get more interest in the October 30 investor day when we see the rest of the management team, that maybe the next CEO is from that group - I\u2019m not sure, but if you could share some insights.","Beth Mooney","Good morning, Mike. I didn\u2019t expect that. KeyCorp does not have a mandatory retirement policy, and I think the goal of our investor day is, as I stated earlier on, we have a really strong leadership team that I think you\u2019ve met many of us over the years, where we\u2019ve really evolved our strategies and our thinking by customer segment, how we\u2019re going to market, and the strength of our performance. You will see broadly our leadership team to include obviously our two vice chairmen, Don Kimble and Chris Gorman, but deeper into our businesses, a chance to introduce our new Chief Risk Officer more broadly to investors and analysts as well, Mark Midkiff, so we are looking forward to appearing as Team KeyCorp and talking about the future of our business.","Mike Mayo","Well staying on the theme of investor day, I guess you\u2019ll talk about scale. You have a lot of scale against smaller banks but not as much as the largest banks. I look forward to hearing some insights at investor day. But when you look at your digital engagement with consumer customers, what percent of your customers are online and how much do you spend on technology every year?","Beth Mooney","Those will both be topics within investor day, so we are very much teeing up this notion of how we think about scale and how we drive our business against products and businesses and client segments where we can scale, such as our discussion of what we have successfully done in our middle market, commercial and corporate banking. Dennis Devine will be walking through our consumer platforms and digital strategies, as well as we have said that of our $700 million to $800 million a year roughly in technology operation spend, $200 million of that is against investments in digital and other capabilities for our product set, and then we are also going to talk a little bit about how we think about fintech partnerships and investments there as well, so a wide range of topics.","Mike Mayo","Last question, small one. I think I see tangible book value flat from the second quarter to the third quarter, despite some good earnings. Is anything happening with securities or OCI, or am I missing something?","Don Kimble","Yes Mike, the tangible book value was negatively impacted by OCI to the tune of about $0.08 a share, and then the other impact that mitigated some of the lift you would have seen in tangible book value also was the fact that we bought back $542 million of stock, and that\u2019s on an incremental basis dilutive to tangible book value. ","One thing to keep in mind, mentioning OCI, is that if you look back to where our OCI has moved since the day that we announced First Niagara, we had about an $0.86 negative impact to our tangible book value per share because of OCI, because of interest rates. If you would add that back on to our current tangible book value, we\u2019d be in excess of the tangible book value per share that we were at the day of announcement by about $0.16 or $0.17 a share. It just doesn\u2019t show given the changes in rates and the impact of OCI, but we are making progress to recapture that lost tangible book value.","Mike Mayo","All right, thank you. See you October 30.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Beth Mooney","Thank you.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.","Saul Martinez","Hey, good morning everybody. Wanted to ask a follow-up on the guidance for non-interest income of mid single digits. I\u2019m struggling with how you get there. I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned IB and debt placement fees, but that was probably the only line item on the fee line that was a bright spot this quarter. So mid single digits kind of implies, I think, $25 million, $30 million sequentially. What am I missing - is there some seasonality we\u2019re not taking into account? I guess where do you fill that gap in terms of sequential growth?","Don Kimble","There is clearly some seasonality, and I would say that in addition to investment banking debt placement fees, most if not all of the individual items are expected to have some growth from the third quarter to fourth quarter level, and so that wasn\u2019t the case for this past quarter, given seasonality. We do expect growth in just about every single one of those line items going into the fourth quarter.","Saul Martinez","Okay. Are there any specific areas that are going to drive it or have more seasonality, or is it just pretty broad based across all the categories?","Don Kimble","I\u2019d say it\u2019s broad based, and some of the things that you would see seasonal lift would include corporate owned life insurance tends to be high in the fourth quarter, that deposit service charges and cards and payments revenues tend to be higher in the fourth quarter than they are in the third quarter. Some of the other items we mentioned earlier, such as deposit service charges, were artificially low this quarter, which should see some pick-up against next quarter. Each one of those, we believe will be contributors to our outlook for growth in the fourth quarter.","Saul Martinez","Okay, fair enough. Can you remind us how much Key insurance and benefit impacted the revenues this quarter? I think I have in my mind $60 million for full year was the run rate, and did it all fall into the trust and investment services line? I guess related, how much of a tailwind did you get in terms of expenses from the sale of that business?","Don Kimble","The trust and investment services line had about $7 million of insurance-related revenues to our KIBS sale. Much of that was more in the contingent fee revenues that we recognized in the current quarter, so there really wasn\u2019t a lot of expense reduction going from Q2 to Q3 for KIBS, and most of that was realized in the second quarter. ","Saul Martinez","So $7 million this quarter and not really anything on the expense line?","Don Kimble","That\u2019s correct.","Saul Martinez","Thanks a lot, helpful.","Operator","Next we go to Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Geoffrey Elliott","Hello, thanks for taking the question. Can you give us an update on earnings credit rate? In the previous conference call, you talked about some increases there. How has the movement there been playing out?","Don Kimble","Most of the increases in our earnings credit rate have really been more tied to LIBOR, so we are seeing those rates continue to increase. That does provide some incentive for some of our commercial customers to seek some interest-bearing deposits, because some of their non-interest bearing deposits are being used to offset their other charges and so we do see some shift coming from that. We also do believe that there still is an opportunity for us to grow our commercial deposits, and so we think that could help minimize some of the migration trends that the earnings credit rate would normally have for that area. ","Geoffrey Elliott","Thanks. In terms of that migration out of non-interest bearing into interest bearing, is there anything you can do to help frame that for us? What portion of non-interest bearing deposits do you think potentially flow out over time?","Don Kimble","We really haven\u2019t set that expectation, so let us get back to you with some thoughts on that. I don\u2019t have anything right now that would be helpful for you.","Geoffrey Elliott","I will ask again on the 30th. Thanks very much.","Don Kimble","Thank you, appreciate it.","Operator","The next question is from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. ","Marty Mosby","Don, I want to ask you about the repositioning that you did. Back in the appendix, you explained a lot of different moving pieces that you actually made. In the liquidity impact, I just want to make sure that\u2019s separate from--because there had to be some costs in NII related to this repositioning as well, so I just wanted to make sure that wasn\u2019t somehow counted in liquidity, and do you think--how much of NII or incremental charges came into play, given the repositioning this quarter?","Don Kimble","Good question, Marty. The one thing that we didn\u2019t talk about is in the appendix, we note that we actually terminated $5 billion worth of swaps that were scheduled to mature in 2019. That enabled us to reset our asset sensitivity position back in about the 3% range, because we were seeing that asset sensitivity drift down as deposit betas increased and so we wanted to reaffirm that. We actually terminated those swaps, and so at the end of the third quarter it would have been about $12 billion worth of receive fixed swaps as opposed to the $18 billion that we were at in the last quarter. ","Again, we did that because the yield curve was fairly flat and also because our outlook would have had a few more rate increases than what the forward curve was implying at that time. We\u2019ve actually seen the rate curve move up about 15 to 20 basis points since we terminated those swaps, so it\u2019s proved out to be a fortunate transaction for us. At the same time we did that, we did enter into some floors to help protect the downside, but the total cost of those floors was only $330,000, so it was a very nominal cost to us. ","To your point, as far as the impact for the current quarter, the losses on those swaps get amortized over the remaining life of those swaps, so there was very little negative impact to us in the current quarter - about a million dollars, and we would think that would be more than offset with positive benefits coming forward in the fourth quarter and beyond. We like how it positioned us, and we think it streamlines the overall asset sensitivity position for us.","Marty Mosby","Then if you look at the roll forward of the portfolio, $1.2 billion per quarter, the maturation of your swap book about $1.6 billion, and the overall 100 basis points that you\u2019re picking up, that in and of itself every quarter should generate--you know, I\u2019m estimating somewhere between $5 million and $7 million of incremental NII every quarter, just from rolling those yields back up to current market rates. Is that about right for the impact? ","Don Kimble","That sounds generally about the right range, and that really is allowing us to keep our margin relatively stable even when rates don\u2019t go up, so that helps to offset the deposit drift and also the purchase accounting accretion reductions. As we mentioned before, with the rate increases, we think that the margin should be up one to two basis points in each of those quarters, so that was part of our outlook for the fourth quarter. ","Marty Mosby","Then lastly on the non-performing increase, you didn\u2019t really see delinquencies and you didn\u2019t really see criticized move up - again, if you look back down into the appendix, some of the details. I was just curious, can you give us some flavor because you really were adamant in the sense that the increase in non-performers doesn\u2019t really lend to increased losses going forward, so what is the characterization that forced them to be classified as non-performing and why are you so comfortable that that\u2019s not going to lead to--I mean, what\u2019s the characteristic of those loans that makes you feel like that doesn\u2019t make your net charge-offs go up meaningfully in the next year?","Don Kimble","A couple things. One is that some of those credits were actually current throughout the second quarter so you wouldn\u2019t have seen the delinquency spike from that, so it didn\u2019t have an impact from that perspective going into the third quarter. Second, as we put those credits in the non-performing, we do an assessment as to what type of loss content is there, so we do maintain specific reserves against those credits and\/or write them down as appropriate, and so we believe that they are maintained at the appropriate level and why we don\u2019t believe there is additional loss content there. Third as far as the timing, it really was just part of the overall workout of those individual credits, and each one of them had unique circumstances and issues, some of which were some transactions were expected to happen in the third quarter and got delayed, so it resulted in us taking those to non-accrual status until those transactions are completed. ","Marty Mosby","So then there would be a relatively short workout period if there\u2019s just an expected event in the future, near future that was going to happen, it just didn\u2019t happen in this particular quarter?","Don Kimble","I think that\u2019s a good assessment. ","Marty Mosby","All right, thanks.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Morning, Beth. Morning Don. Don, touching upon future risks, clearly the industry and you folks, even though I know you\u2019ve talked a little bit about a small pick-up in credit issues, but generally speaking credit is very strong. I\u2019m trying to look for other risks for you folks and your peers. Can you share with us what if this U.S. economy, and this is not consensus of course, but what if it overheats and next year at this time, the Fed has moved more aggressively and they\u2019re talking about three or four rate increases in 2020, and even maybe a 50 basis point rate increase, can you share with us what could happen to the securities portfolio, the OCI mark and stuff? Can you kind of frame that out? Again, I know it\u2019s not consensus, probably low probability, but just to kind of give us an idea.","Don Kimble","One, on our investment portfolio, we keep a fairly short average life and average duration. I think it\u2019s 4.9 and 4.3 years on average, so we don\u2019t have a lot of extension risk in our portfolio. We tend to keep it more five-year type of CMO structures, or 15-year pass through paper, so there really isn\u2019t a lot of extension. We could see if the long end of the curve moves up like you\u2019ve suggested that could put some additional pressure on OCI and our tangible common equity. I would say that we tend to be more focused on common equity Tier 1 and some other measures, which we really believe assess where our overall capital picture is, and so even with some additional pressure on the OCI, I don\u2019t think it would take our tangible common equity to a level that would be of concern to us at this point. ","As far as other areas, that\u2019s one of the reasons why we did go to a little bit more asset sensitive position this quarter, is we did believe there was a higher likelihood that we were going to have a December rate increase and continued rate increases in \u201919, as the Fed has suggested, and the forward curve wasn\u2019t implying that. We did tick up our asset sensitivity a little bit to better position us for that potential outcome.","Gerard Cassidy","Then just as a follow-up, what kind of environment would you need to foresee in the future to take the receive fixed swap book down to zero? You mentioned you\u2019ve already lowered it in this quarter, but what would you have to see to say, gosh you know what, we better take that to zero?","Don Kimble","I\u2019d say as a general rule that we want to continue to maintain a moderate risk profile, so we tend to manage our asset sensitivity within a range. That range probably is plus or minus 5%, and so you probably won\u2019t see us take it to zero but as you\u2019ve seen this quarter, we do have the ability and the flexibility to manage that actively. With the use of floors, we can protect us on the downside of it without minimizing the potential upside impact for interest rate increases. We could toggle one way or the other a little bit, but I don\u2019t want you to expect that that\u2019s going to go to zero. ","Gerard Cassidy","Very good, thank you.","Operator","With no further questions, Ms. Mooney, I\u2019ll turn it back to you for any closing comments.","Beth Mooney","Thank you, Operator.

This call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ms. Beth Mooney. Ms. Mooney, please go ahead.","Beth E. Mooney","Thank you, operator. And good morning, and welcome to KeyCorp's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me for today's presentation is Jeff Weeden, our Chief Financial Officer. And available for the Q&A portion of the call are the leaders of Key Corporate Bank and Key Community Bank, Chris Gorman and Bill Koehler. Also joining us for the Q&A discussion are our Chief Risk Officer, Chuck Hyle; and our Treasurer, Joe Vayda.","Now if you would turn to Slide 3. This morning, we announced first quarter net income from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders of $199 million, or $0.21 per common share. Our first quarter results demonstrate continued momentum as we execute on our relationship strategy, strengthen our balance sheet and maintain disciplined expense control. Credit quality also improved in the first quarter, which is a continuation of the trend that we have seen over the past 2 years. Net charge-offs declined to 82 basis points, continuing its migration toward our long-term target of 40 to 50 basis points. Nonperforming assets and criticized loans also showed improvement in the quarter. ","We were encouraged to see continued growth in our commercial, financial and agricultural loans as we continue to acquire and deepen relationships and meet customer needs for credit. Average CF&A loans were up 7.2% compared with the prior quarter, making the fourth consecutive quarter of growth for this portfolio. The growth in our CF&A loan balances continues to be broad-based across our franchise, as well as in targeted client segments in our Corporate Bank, such as industrial and manufacturing, energy and utilities and health care. ","Also contributing to loan growth has been our progress on the commitment we made last year to lend $5 billion to small businesses. Since this program was launched in September of 2011, Key has made over $2.4 billion in lending commitments to small business owners, who remain critical to our economic recovery and job creation. Importantly, in both the Community and Corporate Banks, we continue to add new clients and increase the level of engagement with our existing relationships. ","Our success in executing on our relationship strategy was affirmed through several industry honors and recognitions in the first quarter. They included a top 5 ranking for overall customer satisfaction in J.D. Power's 2011 Small Business Satisfaction survey, excellence award from Greenwich Associates for small business and middle-market banking, awards for our online banking capability from Corporate Insights Bank Monitor and top scores for treasury management services from Phoenix-Hecht. We have also continued to make investments that enhance our ability to serve our clients and grow our business. These include modernizing our branch network, enhancing our online and mobile capabilities and adding more client-facing positions. And we remain on track for an early third quarter closing of our branch acquisition in Western New York. This acquisition will strengthen our franchise and benefit our local communities, clients and our shareholders. ","The final item on this slide focuses on maintaining a strong balance sheet and remaining disciplined in our approach to capital management as previously announced, we received no objection from the Federal Reserve to our 2012 capital plan and subsequently authorized a common stock repurchase program of up to $344 million. The program is expected to begin in the second quarter of this year and will run through the first quarter of 2013. Our capital plan also included an increase in our common stock dividend from $0.03 a share to $0.05 per share. The board will consider the potential dividend increase when it meets next month. These actions represent opportunities for Key to return capital to our shareholders while still maintaining our peer-leading capital position. ","On Slide 4, you can see that we have made significant progress on our long-term goals and our return on average assets for the first quarter continues to be within our targeted range. We believe that we can continue to build on our momentum by leveraging our strong balance sheet and executing our relationship model. Our clients continue to tell us that Key's business model and strategy is distinctive and this is allowing us to win in the marketplace and grow.","We're also focused on managing expenses and improving our operating leverage, which remain critical in the current operating environment. And finally, we will remain disciplined in the way we manage our capital, consistent with the priorities that we have previously outlined: maintaining strong capital for organic growth; increasing our common stock dividend; using the authority we have from the board to return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases over the next 4 quarters; and to be disciplined around opportunities to invest in our business model and our franchise. ","Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff for a review of our financial results. Jeff?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Thank you, Beth. Slide 6 provides a summary of the company's first quarter 2012 results from continuing operations. As we reported this morning, the company earned a net profit from continuing operations of $0.21 per common share for the first quarter. This compares to $0.21 for both the fourth quarter and the first quarters of 2011. I'll cover the other information on this page in more detail on the following slide.","Turning to Slide 7. Average total loans increased $766 million or 1.6% unannualized during the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. As can be seen on this slide, average balances of commercial, financial and agricultural loans increased from $18.3 billion to $19.5 billion, or approximately 7.2% unannualized. And our utilization rate of CF&A loans improved from 46.3% in the fourth quarter to 46.9% in the first quarter of 2012.","Continuing to Slide 8. On the deposit side of the balance sheet, our trend of improving mix of deposits continued into the first quarter, where we experienced an increase in average balances of nontime deposits of approximately $600 million or 1.3% unannualized. During March of this year, certain funds previously invested in our Victory Money Market Mutual Funds were either moved to a Key deposit account or to a new arrangement that we have with another fund provider. This resulted in approximately $600 million of low-cost transaction deposits moving onto our balance sheet. These funds did not have a material impact on our first quarter average deposit balances. The additional liquidity from these deposits will help fund second quarter debt maturities and potential loan growth. As noted on this slide, average balances of time deposits declined approximately $700 million during the first quarter. We have identified, under the highlight section of this slide, the scheduled maturities of our CD book and the rates that apply to the $9.9 billion of CDs maturing at March 31, 2012. ","As we have previously discussed, we have significant maturities of higher-costing CDs in the second, third and fourth quarters of this year. Specifically, approximately $690 million at an average cost of 4.59% mature in the second quarter, followed by $1,030,000,000 in the third quarter at a cost of 5.06%. And then tapering down to approximately $530 million at a 4.88% average cost during the fourth quarter. This compares to approximately $240 million in maturities in the first quarter of this year. These CD maturities, along with debt maturities in the second quarter, will help offset pressure from maturities of investment securities in this extended low-rate environment. ","Turning to Slide 9. Consistent with our comments last quarter regarding our outlook for credit quality, we continue to experience an improvement in our asset quality statistics again this quarter. Net charge-offs declined to $101 million or 82 basis points of average loan balances for the first quarter of 2012. In addition, our nonperforming loans declined to 1.35% of period-end loans at March 31, 2012. Our reserve for loan losses stood at $944 million or 1.92% of period-end loans and represented 141.7% coverage of nonperforming loans at March 31, 2012. As we have identified on Page 19 in the appendix of today's materials, criticized loans outstanding continued to improve, declining for the 11th consecutive quarter at March 31.","Looking to the balance of the 2012. We anticipate continued modest improvement in asset quality and net charge-offs. Regarding provision and reserves, we anticipate the amount to be provided to be less than charge-offs for 2012. And consistent with our comments last quarter, we would anticipate as loan growth continues, we would migrate during the course of the year for provision to be closer to the level of net charge-offs. For the first quarter, our provision expense represented approximately 34 basis points of average loan balances and net charge-offs were 82 basis points of average loan balances. As Beth mentioned in her comments, our long-term target for net charge-offs is 40 to 50 basis points.","Turning to Slide 10. For the first quarter of 2012, the company's net interest margin was 3.16% compared to 3.13% for the fourth quarter of 2011. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $559 million for the first quarter, down from $563 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 as a result of the early termination of a leverage lease, which resulted in the write-off of $6 million of capitalized loan origination costs. Average earning assets were down approximately $1 billion to $71.4 billion for the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. However, all of this decline can be attributable to lower short-term investment balances. Our expectation for 2012 continues to be for the net interest margin to show modest improvement and for average earning assets to remain in the range of $71 billion to $73 billion. ","With respect to the second quarter, we do not expect much change in the net interest margin from the first quarter level as most of the benefit we expect from our debt and deposit repricing opportunities during the second quarter will benefit the third and fourth quarters of this year. Another item which could impact the margin, but not necessarily net interest income, is simply higher levels of short-term liquidity from deposit flows. As Beth commented on, we remain on track for an early third quarter closing of our branch acquisition in Western New York. This will add approximately $2.4 billion in deposits and $400 million in loans during the third quarter.","Our noninterest income was $472 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared to $414 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. The $58 million increase was primarily the result of a $20 million gain we realized on the early termination of a leverage lease, a $43 million improvement in net gains from principal investing and a $19 million improvement in investment banking and capital markets income. These improvements were partially offset by decreases in corporate-owned life insurance, lower levels of gains on loan sales and various other items. Of note, net of the $6 million charged against net interest income for the write-off of the capitalized loan origination costs, the early termination of the leverage lease benefited our total revenue by $14 million during the first quarter. ","Turning to Slide 11. Noninterest expense for the first quarter of 2012 remained well controlled at $703 million, down $14 million from the fourth quarter of 2011. Personnel expense was down $2 million as lower incentive compensation accruals offset seasonal increases in employment taxes. Nonpersonnel expense decreased $12 million primarily from lower cost for professional fees and marketing, partially offset by not having a credit to the provision for losses on lending-related commitments in the first quarter, as well as higher other expenses. ","Slide 12 shows our pretax pre-provision net revenue and return on average assets. Pre-provision net revenue for the first quarter was $328 million and benefited from stronger fee revenue, as well as lower expense levels compared to the fourth quarter. As we look at pre-provision net revenue for the balance of 2012, we anticipate PPNR to be in the range of around $290 million to $330 million per quarter.","And finally, turning to Slide 13. Our tangible common equity ratio and estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio both remained strong at March 31, 2012, at 10.3% and 11.5%, respectively, placing us in the top quartile of our peer group on these ratios. As Beth commented on with respect to capital management, our priorities remain maintaining strong capital for organic growth, increasing the dividend and using the authority we have from the board included in our capital plan to return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases over the next 4 quarters. ","That concludes our formal remarks. And I will return the call back over to the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A segment of our call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll begin with Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank.","Robert Placet - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Rob Placet for Matt's team. The first question, just in terms of share buybacks from here, any color on how you're approaching buybacks and how we should think about the timing of buybacks through the year?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Yes, Rob, this is Jeff Weeden. You should think about timing of the buybacks really are going to be over the next 4 quarters. So that's how we're viewing it. It's not something that we're going to have an accelerated share repurchase program on. It should be kind of evenly over the next 4 quarters. I think in terms of people always wanting to know about price, in terms of where we trade it on a book value basis or a tangible book value, with a tangible book value in the $9.26 range and stated book value at about $10.26. Certainly, where we're trading today, it's accretive in terms of book value, tangible book value and earnings per share.","Robert Placet - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And just separately, given your outlook for average earning assets between $71 billion and $73 billion, any sense of how we should be thinking about mix of loans versus securities as we think about that average earning assets for the rest of the year?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Well, we've been doing some remixing. So as we've had loan growth that's been coming on, the investment portfolio has been coming down. So our guidance for an improving margin includes a number of different moving parts here. One, we have the repricing of our debt and CDs that are coming up. The second part is just the cash flows coming off of investment securities and reinvesting that either in loans or in lower-yielding investments, to some extent. But that's how we're remixing that overall balance sheet.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Ken Usdin from Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I just want to ask you to go into a little bit more color on your expectations for loans to grow. Obviously, they were a little bit stepped-back this quarter because of exit and CRE. So can you just talk to also about like where you expect the majority of loan growth to come from? And also, at what point do we actually see that stabilization in CRE and leasing lines?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Ken, this is Jeff Weeden. The business guys are going to talk here in just a second. But one of the things that we went back and we talked about in the fourth quarter was we said we had a number of loans, the balances came up in the fourth quarter, and we expected actually some of those to be paid down in the first quarter. There's some bridge loan activity that was in there, and so that's part and parcel of it. We also had the leverage lease that paid off in the first quarter, which was around $70 million. So that had some impact on it. On that leasing line that you're referring to, the part that's in the exit portfolio, there may be some lumpiness in that, depending on if we have other opportunities for early termination of these leverage leases. But the rest of the business, I think, is growing fine. And I'd ask Chris Gorman to talk first.","Christopher Marrott Gorman","Let me just give you kind of a quick overview. In short, we see balances growing from here. You asked where they're going to grow. They're going to grow principally in the Corporate Bank in 3 areas. One is our energy area, and I'm going to come back to that in a moment. The next is industrial. And also we're seeing a lot of growth in health care. Kind of big picture, if you look over the last year, in the Corporate Bank, our loans have grown by 5.1%. But that included a strategic runoff that we were doing in real estate of, call it, 10%. And on the other side of the equation, in our corporate and investment bank, year-over-year on an average basis, we actually grew them 36%, 37%. So we are through that in the real estate book, which means we're well positioned to grow from here. We actually look at our backlogs and feel very good about them. I'll give you a kind of one example of kind of finding these niches, and that is in the area of both wind and solar. We were left lead on 10 deals that raised well over $1 billion in the first quarter. So again, Ken, our growth is going to come from picking these niches and continuing to be able to garner new clients. So that's how we're going to grow.","William R. Koehler","And in the Community Bank, Ken, we're seeing continued strength in our pipelines. We also see some strong activity in health care for a lot of the same reasons. Chris sees it on the upper end of the market. And if you look at it regionally, the Northeast continues to be pretty strong and consistently so. The Great Lakes continues to see a lot of activity. Probably our strongest region over the past 4, 5 quarters, I would say, has been at the Great Lakes. And activity in general, in many of the manufacturing sectors, where we are strong as an organization, continues to be pretty good.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Great. And my follow-up question, just on expenses, you guys have done a really nice job of really holding the line on expenses. And I'm just wondering what opportunities do you still see to even take cost out of the business. I know you talked about not necessarily doing Keyvolution too, but with a still high efficiency ratio, what can we see kind of still coming out as you continue to work on that?","Beth E. Mooney","Yes, Ken, this is Beth. And that's a good question. And we made reference to it in our remarks, that clearly in this operating and economic environment, continued focus on expenses is one of the levers we all have to work with to enhance our performance. So while Keyvolution is complete and you're seeing the benefit of that in our disciplined expense ratio that has been coming through in our guidance $700 million to $725 million in noninterest expense, quarterly, we do have continuing programs, a focus on continuous improvement and are continuing to look at opportunities for sourcing, procurement. As we invest in client-facing positions, we're also looking at how we can align our backroom operations and other things that we are doing that are not core to our client experience. So we continue to do a variety of things, it is a culture of continuous improvement, and have a number of initiatives underway that we will think will continue to enhance our efficiency ratio as it relates to the expense side. And Jeff, do you have any other comment?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","No, I think that summarized it well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Can we go back to the Corporate and Community Bank reference that you guys both had year-over-year loan growth, but it looks like your net interest revenue was flat to slightly down in both of the subs there. Can you give us some color on what's going on with pricing?","Christopher Marrott Gorman","Gerard, it's Chris. Well, I mean, the first thing is just generally low interest and the squeeze in terms of margins. What we're seeing in the marketplace, though, is that structure is generally holding. We're seeing just a little bit of pressure around the edges on pricing, but not to a degree that it's concerning us at all. I think what you're seeing is the impact of deposits, candidly, as you look at those numbers.","William R. Koehler","And Gerard, this is Bill Koehler. And in the Community Bank, we're seeing similar trends on loan spreads that Chris mentioned. But the bigger driver for us in this area is the value of our deposits, in this environment, we continue to get pressure there. And it's the same story we've been talking about for a number of quarters now.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Jeff, you mentioned your outlook for net charge-offs. I think you and Beth said, I think, normalized. It's in the 50 basis point level of average loans. And currently, your charge-offs are around 80 basis points. The provision will eventually match the charge-offs, if I heard it correctly. When do you think you can get to a normalized net charge-off level?","Charles S. Hyle","Gerard, this is Chuck. It's hard to predict the timing of this. But I think if you look at our core business and the kinds of business that we're putting on today and if you look at the chart on Page 16, you can see where we are today. And then the CF&A category, we're at 31 basis points. That's a big part of our portfolio. If you look on our leasing portfolio, you'll see actually nothing there. So I think that's a pretty good indicator of the kind of commercial business that we're writing and where we will get to over time. I think some of the noncore business, which we still have, although it's shrinking all the time, is still where the higher charge-off numbers are. So how you project that trajectory is a little hard to do, clearly dependent upon the economy and various other things. But I think it is still a range that is very achievable for this organization.","Beth E. Mooney","And Gerard, this is Beth. I would add that we made a comment in our last quarterly call that to the extent that we do see growth in CF&A, our new business volumes and our new originations, which are heavily candid towards new client acquisitions are coming in at a higher quality and a higher credit quality than our existing books. So if you remix and grow the balance sheet, that will have a positive impact on the level of net charge-offs as well.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Absolutely. If the net charge-offs stays stubbornly around 75 basis points into the middle of next year and with your guys comments about provision and eventually reaching the charge-offs, should we expect the provision to get that high? Or is it more of a provision to the normalized levels that we should be focused on?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Well, Gerard, I guess -- this is Jeff Weeden. I think in terms of the nonperformers also continuing to migrate on down. And clearly, as Chuck talked about it, some of these exit books that are still out there, they'll run a little bit higher on the charge-offs level. So if we're still at the 75 basis points next year, I think you have to look at what's the forward look at that particular point in time. So it's all about the existing book you have a provision or reserve for and it's your forward look that you are trying to anticipate, business volume, et cetera. So I would think in terms of the provision expense normalizing in that 40 to 50 basis point range first, and then seeing the charge-offs kind of work their way down, so...","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Good to know. Okay. And finally, Jeff, on the buyback, you mentioned you think it will be spread out over the 12-month period. Is there anything that would prevent you guys from completing the buyback this year? And then tying into that, with your return on equity around 8.25%, which I assume is less than your cost of capital based on your internal models, when do you think the return on equity number would exceed your cost of capital?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","Okay. Well, Gerard, we're not giving a specific guidance on the return on equity at this particular point in time. I think with respect to the buyback provisions, the capital plan that was submitted had the buybacks over the 4-quarter time period. And that's you should view the overall plan, is lasting over that 4 quarters.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Levin from Citi.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yesterday, one of your competitors sounded very bullish on the economic and lending environment in the Midwest. They talked about a recovery, and they specifically talked about the impact of the energy shales. How would you characterize the Midwest economic and lending environment relative to maybe what it was 6 to 9 months ago?","Christopher Marrott Gorman","Josh, it's Chris Gorman. It remain -- I mean, here's what's going on, our -- the companies in the Midwest continue to do well. They continue to recover. They're obviously not recovering at a pace that all of us would like them to recover. Having said that, there are some real bright spots that happened to play very well with the kind of things that we do here at Key. First is the industrial companies that are here are major exporters, that's one driver. You mentioned the shale play. We're participating in that in a significant way in that we have an oil and gas business. But in addition to that, for example, in our M&A business right now, in our backlog, a very significant percentage of a backlog that's elevated are people that supply into the frac-ing process, which is driven by the shale plays. So there's no question we're benefiting from it. I'll let Bill Koehler cover what's going on. And also, the shale plays, by the way, benefit our retail customers as well because they, in many cases, when you look at places like the Utica Shale field, are the owners of the land that's being leased for the shale play. Bill?","William R. Koehler","And I would say, as well, that as we talk to our clients there, confidence is growing in the smaller end of the market, which to me says that the economy is overall has strengthened. They are serving some of the same industries Chris talked about. They are getting more clarity in their business about -- in their order book. And as a result, they are seeing a lot more opportunity to continue to drive growth in the business.","Christopher Marrott Gorman","Josh, the one thing we're not seeing yet and we're watching very carefully, we're not seeing our customers and clients growing employment. So that's one area that I would say continues to lag. The other area that lags is we don't see huge capital outlays for big, new plants. We do see around the edges people starting to invest in technology, equipment, people investing in working capital, people investing on the margin.","William R. Koehler","And in health care, where in Ohio, obviously, the demographics would suggest that we need continue to support the needs there over time. We are seeing a lot of new construction and consolidation of services across the full value chain within the health care industry. And as a result, we think we're very well positioned from a Community Bank and the Corporate Bank perspective to serve the needs of the industry overall with some very integrated capabilities.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Just on a separate note, you have assets outside of the Midwest, you have those assets in Colorado, Alaska, Florida. Would you ever consider selling them and redeploying the capital for other uses?","Beth E. Mooney","Josh, this is Beth. We obviously constantly evaluate our franchise and our opportunities to strengthen, invest, grow our business, as well as rationalize our business. And we have always said never say never. Everything over time is always needing to be revalidated. At this point in time, relative to our footprint, all our markets are accretive to Key's performance and we don't see any particular ability to appropriately redeploy what could be any potential gain or funds from such a repositioning. As always, the way the character of the franchise was built, there would always be tax consequences. So as we look at it now, our goal is to optimize our performance. We have market-by-market growth strategies and continue to improve the performance. But the mix of our businesses right now, for the foreseeable future, are where we're positioned.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Scinicariello from UBS.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just want to follow up on the -- this building on the success that you've had with the HSBC acquisition. Just kind of curious as you look out and talking about capital deployment, do you see more types of opportunities to continue to round out some parts of the franchise, like the HSBC deal, as you kind of look forward? And if so, would you like to do more of them?","Beth E. Mooney","Steve, this is Beth. We do think that the HSBC transaction is indicative of an opportunity with actually minimal capital to strengthen our presence in 2 key markets. It would be what I would call a small fill-in, where we enhance our presence in Buffalo and in an attractive market such as Rochester to us. So in the right circumstances, we would absolutely be disciplined and opportunistic about what we could do to augment our franchise, where we can leverage our business model, where we can garner new clients and really put to use the alignment between our Corporate and our Community Bank. So as time progresses and opportunities present themselves, we would look to have a point of view to be -- underscore a theme I have also said in the past. But we would be very disciplined about the amount of capital, about what is an appropriate price and that it really does strengthen not only our franchise but strengthens and has a proper return for our shareholders.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you. And then just kind of following with the expense management team and going along with kind of further optimization of the network. I assume you would also kind of look to maybe not you're going to exit any markets but just kind of further optimize your positioning within those. So could there be some kind of pruning along some parts of the franchise, just in keeping with what we're talking about in terms of optimization?","William R. Koehler","This is Bill Koehler. There absolutely is. We are constantly looking at our branch footprint in the context of our overall cost structure, returns in each of the branches, as well as overall channel strategy and our de novo strategy. What you will see this year is we are likely to open roughly half of what we've opened last year in the form of branches, and the lion's share of those will be relocations or consolidations, not strictly de novos. So on a net basis, you won't see a lot of branch growth year-over-year. But we'll reposition our businesses to parts of our markets where -- frankly where our customers are, so we can provide a continued focus on convenience that they demand.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then just one last quick one. I know, as part of the CCAR capital plan approval, you had sought to repurchase some trust preferreds. And I know you didn't quantify the amount, but I was just curious if there is a certain kind of target amount that you like to redeem. I know you've got the request out there for approval to -- but I was just curious if you could quantify just how much you're looking to buy back?","Joseph M. Vayda","Sure. This is Joe Vayda. I'll take that question. We have about $1 billion remaining in outstanding trust preferreds. And each has its own unique economics to the issuer. But we're evaluating particularly those that have regulatory capital treatment call provisions. And that includes primarily the Series 10s, which is about $560 million outstanding. They cannot be called without a capital treatment change, and it's subject to further evaluation.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll move on to Adam Hurwich from Ulysses.","Adam G. Hurwich - Ulysses Management LLC","A question as a follow-up to the first question actually, where you discussed the impact on NIM on the shift between loans and securities. One of the reasons for the size of the securities portfolio, I assume, has to do with the macro environment we've just been through. Given that things are improving for the bank, to what extent do you have an opportunity to reduce the liquidity in the securities portfolio in general regardless of that shift? And what would the impact potentially be on the NIM?","Jeffrey B. Weeden","This is Jeff Weeden. As we look at the investment portfolio, the investment portfolio has been stored liquidity for us. So if you think about it, we've been more liability-driven. So we have the liabilities. We've parked some of the excess liquidity in the investment portfolio. The investment portfolio, itself, is turning about $500 million of cash flow each and every month at this point in time with these particular rates. So we have reinvestment opportunities that happen all the time. So I think as we look at it and we say that we have loan growth, we'll put it into loans at that particular point in time. And that's why you've seen the overall portfolio come down. The other part is on the liability management side of the equation. So to the extent we have debt maturities, which we have $1 billion that matures in June of some TLGP debt, we will look at where the overall flow of deposits are. Deposits have still been positive for us. So to the extent we have positive deposits flows and we have a loan demand that's out there that continues at basically what our expectations are, we will have some degree of need to reinvest in our securities portfolio each and every quarter. But that's factored into our overall guidance. So we've taken all of that into account as we've looked at our net interest margin guidance that we've provided for 2012.","Adam G. Hurwich - Ulysses Management LLC","So Jeff, if I understand you correctly, what it sounds like is given these flows, you don't see a material drop in the total assets of the bank this year.","Jeffrey B. Weeden","That is correct. We actually provided our guidance was for $71 billion to $73 billion of average earning assets. And that's predicated, too, on the fact that we know we have these debt maturities, we have CDs that are repricing. But we also have positive deposit flows in other areas in the transactions and regulated accounts.","Operator","And I'll take our next question from Mike Turner from Compass Point.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Just one asset question regarding the Fed's new guidance in first quarter or regarding NPL accounting for HELOCs or for second liens. I know over 50% of your home equity portfolio is first lien. Maybe -- there didn't seem to be any impact in the quarter on your NPL accounting. Maybe you can just speak to that reserve accounting and why there was no commensurate increase at all in NPLs.","Charles S. Hyle","Yes, Mike, this is Chuck Hyle. We have been, I think, quite fortunate in our HELOC portfolio over the years in terms of how we've underwritten it. You mentioned the fact that well over 50% are first liens. We've been tracking that information. We've been tracking the firsts that we do have, that others have that we don't on our seconds. We think we have very strong methodologies in terms of understanding the quality of that book. It has performed, we think, on a relative basis, very well through the cycle. We do very aggressive work on looking at credit bureau scores every 2 months. We have a quarterly appraisal mechanism. And all that has been factored into our provisioning effort. We have a lot of quantitative analysis around that. And as a result, with the new guidance that has come out really, we view it as having virtually no impact on our portfolio. And I think our performance has underscored our approach to that.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And so what percentage for those HELOCs, where you don't own the first but there is one, what percentage of those do you actually have data on the first lien?","Charles S. Hyle","I can't give you the exact number, but we worked through various vendors to track that information. And we have, I think, a pretty good fix on what is out there.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And it appears we have no further questions at this time.

This call is being recorded. ","At this time I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Beth Mooney, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead ma'am. "," ","Beth Mooney","","Thank you operator. Good morning and welcome to KeyCorp's, third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Joining me for today's presentation is Don Kimball, our Chief Financial Officer, and available for the Q&A portion of the call is Chris Gorman, President of our Corporate Bank; EJ Burke and Dennis Devine, Co-Presidents of our Community Bank; and Bill Hartmann, our Chief Risk Officer.","Slide two is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments, as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call.","Turning to slide three. Key\u2019s third quarter reflects solid trends in our core businesses, good credit quality, and disciplined capital management. However, overall results did not meet our expectations. We will provide more color and context around our results, as well our expectations for improvement in the fourth quarter. ","In both the Community and Corporate Bank, revenue increased relative to previous quarter; however, the improvement was more than offset by lower gains from principal investing and leverage lease terminations. Average loans increased 5% from the year ago period, driven by a 11% increase in commercial, financial, and agricultural loans. ","Linked quarter average balances showed a modest increase. Our commercial loan growth was negatively impacted by seasonality, capital markets activity, and the exit of non- strategic assets. Period end loan numbers were up 1% reflecting growth late in the quarter, and that momentum has continued into early October. ","We continue to make progress on our client focused strategy, including growth in retail clients and increasing sales productivity across our franchise. Late in the third quarter, we also closed the acquisition of Pacific Crest Securities, adding an important new industry vertical and underscoring our commitment to being the leading corporate and investment bank serving middle market clients. ","There was a fair amount of activity in the expense line this quarter. A pension settlement charge and our Pacific Crest acquisition added $26 million. Absent those items, core expenses were well controlled and were down from the prior year and previous quarter, as well as below our guidance range. Additionally, we incurred $15 million in charges related to our efficiency initiatives in the quarter. ","Our reported efficiency ratio was 69.5% for the quarter, and we do not find this acceptable. The ratio excluding pension and efficiency charges was 66%, which was above our previous run rate and was largely a result of lower revenues in a few categories. ","It is important to note that we expect this number to come down next quarter and to continue to make progress on our efficiency goals. Don will discuss more about our path forward in his remarks. ","Our strong risk management practices resulted in another quarter of good quality trends. Net charge-offs to average loans were 22 basis points, well below our targeted range. Non-performing assets declined 28% from the year ago period and our non-performing asset ratio is down to 74 basis points. ","Our level of new loan originations was consistent in the quarter with the prior quarter and our new business has a better overall risk rating than our existing portfolio, and while the environment remains competitive, we are remaining disciplined with structure and staying true to our relationship strategy. ","In terms of capital management, we continued to execute on our capital plans by repurchasing $119 million in common shares in the quarter and we also closed our Pacific Crest acquisition in under 60 days from the time of announcement, and remain on schedule with our integration plans. ","As I look at our results, I\u2019m encouraged by many of the trends in our core revenue and expense; however, the quarter overall did not reflect the earnings potential of our company and fell short of our expectations. ","Don will spend some time discussing the details of our third quarter results and more importantly, our outlook for improved performance in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we remain on a path to achieve our full year guidance. ","With that, let me turn it over to Don. ","Don Kimble","Thanks Beth. I\u2019m on slide five. This morning we reported net income from continuing operations of $0.23 per common share for the third quarter compared to $0.25 for the year ago quarter and $0.27 for the second quarter. This quarter, we incurred $35 million or $0.03 per share of costs associated with our efficiency initiatives and pension settlement. ","The pension settlement charge was $20 million and was triggered by lump sum distributions, which were related to the reduction of approximately 1000 FTE as a result of our efficiency initiatives. Similar to last year, we would anticipate having additional settlement charges in the fourth quarter, which are expected to be in the range of $5 million to $10 million. ","On the revenue side, we also had some developments late in the quarter that impacted our results, the most significant being several investment banking transactions that were delayed into the fourth quarter. We also saw lower than expected principal investing gains, as well as a $7 million reduction to revenue that was related to the visa litigation settlement. I\u2019ll cover many of these items on the slide throughout my presentation, so I\u2019ll now turn to slide six. ","Average total loan growth continued in the third quarter with balances up $2.5 billion or 5% compared to the year ago quarter and up $185 million from the second quarter. Our year-over-year growth was once again driven primarily by commercial, financial, and agricultural loans, which was broad-based across Key\u2019s business lending segment. Average commercial, financial, and agricultural loans were up $2.6 billion or 11% compared to the prior year and were relatively stable with the second quarter. ","Third quarter loan balances were negatively impacted by seasonality such as floor plan lending, clients taking advantage of attractive capital markets, alternatives and the exit of non-strategic assets such as Key Equipment Finance International. ","Importantly, new business loan originations remain consistent with the prior year. We also saw more loan growth in the latter part of the quarter, and as Beth mentioned, this momentum has continued into October and bodes well for the fourth quarter. And based on that, we expect annualized link quarter average loan growth in the fourth quarter to be in the mid-single digital range driven by commercial lending, and that we will meet our full year guidance. Importantly, we are remaining disciplined with our relationship focused in the quality and structure of our new business. ","Continuing on to slide seven. On the liability side on the balance sheet, average deposits were up $2.4 billion from one year ago and up $1.3 billion from the second quarter. Deposit growth of 4% from the prior year and 2% from the prior quarter was largely driven by inflows from commercial clients, as well as increases related to our commercial mortgage servicing business. And as a result of our continued focus on improving deposit mix, year-over-year interest-bearing liability costs declined from 56 basis points to 52 basis points.","Turning to slide eight. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $581 million for the third quarter compared to $584 million in the third quarter of 2013 and $579 million in the second quarter of this year. Our net interest margin was 2.96%, which was down 2 basis points from the prior quarter. The reported decline in net interest income and the net interest margin from the prior year was primarily attributed to lower asset yields and higher levels of excess liquidity, which was partially offset by loan growth and a more favorable mix of lower cost deposits. ","Compared to the second quarter this year, net interest income was up $2 million, primarily due to an asset growth, higher loan fees, and an improvement in funding costs and the benefit of the day count. For the fourth quarter, we expect net interest income to remain relatively stable with the third quarter level. ","We also expect to maintain our modest asset sensitivity position. As we have highlighted before, we have the flexibility to manage and quickly adjust our rate risk position and the duration and characteristics of Key\u2019s loan and investment portfolios continue to position us to realize more benefit from a rise in the shorter end of the yield curve.","Slide nine shows a summary of non-interest income, which accounts for approximately 42% of our total revenue. Non-interest income in the third quarter was $417 million, down from both the prior year and prior quarter, primarily due to lower gains from principal investing and leverage lease terminations. ","We did, however, see positive trends in several of our fee-based businesses. Despite several large transactions being delayed into the fourth quarter, investment banking and debt placement fees remain strong at $88 million. ","We also saw growth in trust and investment services and deposit service charges. For the fourth quarter, we expect non-interest income to be up in the low double-digit percentage range from the third quarter as a result of a strong finish to the year for investment banking driven by a strong pipeline, which includes deal activities that moved into the fourth quarter. It also includes a full quarter\u2019s worth of Pacific Crest activity and a normal seasonal lift in corporate-owned life insurance, as well as a more typical run-rate for principal investing gains.","Turning to slide 10, non-interest expense for the third quarter was $704 million, down $12 million from the year-ago period and up $15 million from the second quarter. Quarter expenses were well controlled and below our previously communicated guidance. As I mentioned earlier, reported expense includes $15 million in efficiency charges and a $20 million pension settlement charge. Combined, these two items added 350 basis points to our efficiency ratio. ","We also incurred expense of $6 million during the quarter related to Pacific Crest Securities. Normalizing for Pacific Crest and the pension charge, which were both not included in our prior guidance, expense levels came in below our previously communicated $680 million to $690 million range as outlined in the lower right hand side of the slide. ","Core expense levels continue to benefit from our continuous improvement efforts, including the consolidation of 12 branches in the third quarter and the rightsizing of our businesses and support areas. ","In the fourth quarter we would expect reported expense levels to remain relatively stable with the third quarter, including a full quarter of Pacific Crest and a reduced pension settlement charge anticipated to be in the range or $5 million to $10 million. We also anticipate fourth quarter expense levels to include efficiency charges of approximately $10 million. ","Importantly our guidance is consistent with our previous outlook for 2014 expenses. We remain committed to continuing to generate cost savings through our continuous improvement efforts, which will enable us to make investments and offset normal expense growth. ","Moving to slide 11, our report efficiency ratio was 69.5% for the quarter and 66.7% on a year-to-date basis. This was clearly higher than our expectations. However, it does include elevated efficiency and pension charges, which year-to-date totals $69 million, well above our original estimate of $30 million for the full year. ","Excluding efficiency and pension charges our year-to-date efficiency ratio was 64.5%. The higher charges reflect an acceleration of our initiatives as we continue to manage core expenses in an appropriate pace and make investments that will translate into future revenue growth. ","The efficiency ratio remains an important measure and we expect to continue to make progress in the fourth quarter and 2015 from our current level. We have a pass forward built around business growth and expense management. Over the next two to three years we are committed to moving our cash efficiency ratio down to 60%. Importantly, longer term we are targeting a ratio in the high 50s. ","Turning to slide 12, net charge-offs were $31 million or 22 basis points of average total loans in the third quarter, which continues to be below our targeted range. At September 30, 2014 our reserve for loan losses represented 1.43% of period in loans and 201% coverage of our non-performing loans. Importantly as Beth mentioned, the quality of our new business volume has consistently been better than that of our existing portfolio. We expect net charge-off to remain below our targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points in the fourth quarter. ","In turning to slide 13, our tangible common equity ratio and our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio, both remain strong at September 30 at 10.29% and 11.26% respectively. As Beth mentioned, we repurchased $119 million or 8.8 million common shares in the third quarter. ","Importantly, our capital plans reflect our commitment to remain disciplined in managing our strong position. Our Tier 1 common ratio has remained above 11%, while we have paid out a peer-leading amount of capital to shareholders. ","Moving onto slide 14, this is our fourth quarter and our full year 2014 outlook. As Beth mentioned, we continue to expect to achieve the full year guidance that we provided at the beginning of this year. ","For the fourth quarter we expect an improvement from our third quarter run rate consistent with my comments today. Average loans should growth in the mid-single digit range annualized from the third quarter, as we benefit from recent growth, solid pipelines and normal seasonal trends, especially in our commercial businesses. ","Revenues should reflect a meaningful pickup in non-interest income next quarter in the low double-digit percentage range as a result of a strong finish to the year for investment banking, including a full quarters impact of Pacific Crest Securities and a strong pipeline heading into the fourth quarter, a normal seasonal lift in corporate owned life insurance and what we would assume to be a more normal run rate for principal investing gains. ","Reported expenses should remain relatively stable with the third quarter, including the addition of a full quarter of Pacific Crest, as well as an additional pension and settlement cost this quarter, albeit at a reduced level. ","Credit quality should remain a good story with net charge-offs below our targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points. And finally, we expect to continue to execute on our share repurchase authorization consistent with our capital plans.","With that, I\u2019ll close and turn the call back over to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). The first question is coming from the line of Steven Alexopoulos. Please go ahead sir. He is with J.P. Morgan. ","Steven Alexopoulos - J.P. Morgan","Good morning everyone. I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s me. ","Don Kimball","Good morning. ","Beth Mooney","Good morning. ","Steven Alexopoulos - J.P. Morgan","Can I ask you guys; on the efficiency ratio, it seems that focus is shifted to this long term 60% target. Are you still targeting 60% to 65% over the near term? It doesn\u2019t seem like we are hearing much about that anymore. ","Don Kimball","Steven, this Don. What I would say is that for the last several quarters, we\u2019ve talked about our plans to drive that efficiency ratio to the lower end of that previous guidance, and with the benefit of rates we should be able to drive it to something below 60%. So at the conference this past quarter, we changed our guidance to a long-term perspective of driving at below 60%. So we would expect to have a path to continue to drive it down from the current levels and be in that long-term guidance range over the next two to three years.","Steven Alexopoulos - J.P. Morgan","But Don, should we read into that, that you don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to be in that range near term. Is that why you are moving this to a longer-term view? ","Don Kimball","I would say the concern we had was that there were questions around would we be happy if we maintained it at the higher end of that range, and so 60% to 65% range was the previous guidance. And what we are focused on is driving positive operating leverage and the outcome of that should be to continue to drive that efficiency ratio lower, and that is our expectation for next quarter going into 2015 and for the next two to three year time period. ","Steven Alexopoulos - J.P. Morgan","Okay, and simultaneous with including an outlook for higher rates. The 10 year has now hit 2%. Can you help us think about how much incremental pressure that you put on loan yields, securities yields, and I don\u2019t know where you are with HQLA, but do you need to build securities here at this level. Thanks. ","Don Kimball","The long end of the curve doesn\u2019t have as much of an impact on us as the shorter end of the curve. If you look at our asset portfolio, loans typically have an average life of three years. Most of our loans are LIBOR based and so we are going to see more lift when we see the shorter end of the curve moving up. ","When we look at the investment securities that we are purchasing, over the last couple of quarters, we\u2019ve seen yields for purchases in the 2 to 2.25 level and so with the longer end of the curve coming down, it\u2019s pushed that down a little bit, but it shouldn\u2019t have a meaningful impact in the overall margin from what our current guidance would suggest. ","And then as far as our HQLA and the LCR implications that we estimate as of September 30, that our LCR ratio would be around 80%. Our target for the first quarter of 2016 would be 90%, and we think we can get there with cushion with making some modest changes to continue to change in our mix of investment portfolio over to more Ginnie Mae\u2019s, maybe some slight increases in the overall investment portfolio and then also some product changes, which we don\u2019t think will be significant in any way. ","Steven Alexopoulos - J.P. Morgan","Great. Thanks for all the color. ","Don Kimball","Thank you. ","Operator","","Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill is next. Please go ahead sir. ","Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners"," ","Good morning guys. ","Don Kimball","Good morning Scott. ","Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners","So I guess first question is just on loan growth. There has been a little noise in the last couple of quarters. I think last quarter it was the flattish end of period numbers, and in this quarter, a little more sluggish average. ","Obviously it hasn\u2019t caused you to alter the full year guidance, but I was just curious if you could maybe put some or make some comments around any changes in demand you are seeing or any kind of changes in your risk appetite that might have caused things these last couple of quarters to come in a bit lighted than you had anticipated, if first of all that\u2019s an appropriate conclusion. ","Chris Gorman","Sure Scott, this is Chris Gorman. Good morning. As you think about our model, our model is we only put about 15% of all the capital we raise on to our balance sheet. So on a trailing 12 basis for example, we raised about 55 billion in over 1,000 transactions, and again only about 15% finds its way to our balance sheet. And what that means is we can have some pretty big variations as you look quarter to quarter. If you look over the last five quarters or so, it probably ranges from $350 million to $900 million. ","Now as you think about the third quarter, a couple of interesting things. One, new business volume was basically spot on from what it was in the prior quarter when we grew by $900 million. The reason that occurs is we sometimes bridge significant transactions. In the case of last quarter, we bridged something in the second quarter and took it out in the third quarter. That total was about $250 million. There was one particular transaction that was about $170 million, just to give some texture. ","The other thing that we are always doing is reallocating our capital and all of our other resources for that matter, and in the third quarter as we always do, we really exited about 200 million of loans. ","The last thing I would tell you is, we continue to maintain our discipline. So as you know Scott, we are leading most of these deals. We could easily take a bigger piece; we could be a buyer of some of this paper. We\u2019ve elected not to do that. So you are going to see variations as you go quarter-to-quarter. ","I think both Beth and Don alluded to the fact that as you look forward, we are comfortable with the guidance that we\u2019ve provided all year, and the reason for that is (a) our pipeline; and (b) if you look at the fact that in the corporate bank we grew say $350 million during the quarter or 1.6%. As we look at the ending balance, it was up about $650 million. So I hope that gives you a little bit of texture for kind of what\u2019s going on intra-quarter here in the Corporate Bank.","Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners"," ","Yes, that does. So, I appreciate that Chris. And then while I\u2019ve got you, maybe a separate question. Don had alluded to a couple of the deals that you got in the investment-banking pipeline getting pushed to the fourth quarter. Are you able to provide a little context around that? In other words, are these just kind of individually unique circumstances that happen to tally to a few deals, so we get pushed through or are there any concerns given the market volatility and weakness that those deals would just not get completed. How are you thinking about that dynamic? ","Chris Gorman","Well Scott, let me start with, they are always market dependent and we are always worried about market volatility as you think about our transactions. ","What Don alluded to is there were a couple of significant transactions, neither of which had gone away, both of which were pushed from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. But as you look at our total pipeline and we always probably adjust our pipeline, we feel pretty good about the fourth quarter. In fact, based on our interactions with our clients, the discussions we are having with our clients and our risk-adjusted pipeline, we believe the fourth quarter will be the strongest quarter of the year for us in investment banking and debt placement fees. ","Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners","Okay, good, that\u2019s helpful and I appreciate it. That\u2019s it for me, so thank you.","Don Kimball","Thank you, Scott. ","Beth Mooney","Thanks Scott. ","Operator","","Erika Najarian with Bank of America is next. Please go ahead. ","Erika Najarian \u2013 Bank of America","Good morning. Thank you. ","Don Kimball","Good morning. ","Beth Mooney","Good morning. ","Erika Najarian \u2013 Bank of America","My first question is just a clarity question. In terms of your guidance for expenses for fourth quarter, should we take the $704 million reported as the base or the $678 million core as the base? ","Don Kimball","Our guidance was compared to the $704 million reported, because keep in mind that in the $704 million this quarter included the pension settlement of $20 million and roughly $6 million of Pacific Crest. ","Next quarter we\u2019ll have a full quarter\u2019s worth of Pacific Crest and so that will roughly be $20 million or so of expenses and then we expect our pension charge to be lower. So again, pension we said would be in the $5 million to $10 million and so with the combination of those items, the total will be expected to be relatively stable with that $704 million reported level. ","Erika Najarian \u2013 Bank of America","Got it and just sneaking one last one in, given Don your comments on the LCR being at 80% now and just remixing your securities portfolio to exceed your fully phase-in requirement by 1Q \u201915, and clearly you\u2019re more sensitive to the short end of the curve. Is it fair to say that this quarter\u2019s margin represents close to the bottom near term, even though the 10-year is at 2%. ","Don Kimball","If we look at our margin today of 2.96%, we believe that even with rates being flat with where they are at today, that the margin will hold in relatively stable for next several years and so we do believe that we are at kind of a plateau there and I think you saw that with stability in our net interest income on a relative basis compared to the previous quarter and even the previous year now and so I think that\u2019s starting to reposition that dynamic a little bit for us. ","Erika Najarian \u2013 Bank of America","Great. Thank you very much. ","Don Kimball","Thank you. ","Beth Mooney","Thank you.","Operator","Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley is next. Please go ahead. ","Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great, thanks. Don, a quick question for you. In terms of the unusual charges or the efficiency charges as you call them, how much longer do we take these, because they\u2019ve been around for a long time. It seems that you would expect them to be around for a while more. What\u2019s the outlook on that?","Don Kimball","For this quarter we had an additional consolidation of 12 branches and some other expense moves in connection with rightsizing some of the business and staff areas. And to your point, we will always have some smaller level of efficiency related changes going forward. ","I would say that this year the level of them have been much higher than what we would have expected. We talked earlier in our script about $69 million worth of efficacy and pension related charges this year on a year-to-date basis, versus our full year estimate of $30 million. And so I would say that $30 million level is probably more of a full year type of projection and more of a normal environment. ","What we did see this year was probably a little bit more pressure on revenues and felt that it was important for us to take additional efforts further enhance our expense reduction efforts. ","Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Got it. Okay, so $30 million for \u201915 at least a ballpark estimate, okay. ","Don Kimball","And we haven\u2019t given guidance yet for \u201915, but I think that will be more of a normal level, that\u2019s correct. ","Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, and just second question, in terms of how you are thinking about lending or which categories you are targeting, where the 10-year is currently at 2%, does that drive any of your lending decisions or more specifically is there any loans, like CRE for example where you may pull back because of where rates are if things don\u2019t change. ","Chris Gorman","So Ken, its Chris Gorman. With rates like this at the 10-year, what you\u2019ll see is a significant pick up in some of things we do when we act agent, not principle. And as a result whether its Fannie, Freddie, FHA, those longer term fixed deals, you\u2019ll see a lot of our clients opting for those. ","Obviously the CMBS market has enjoyed a nice recovery this year. We think total issuance in the CMBS market will be between $90 billion and $95 billion this year. So that\u2019s really \u2013 you really see it impacted more, our clients going long and going fixed and that really lends itself to our business model where we are functioning as agent not principal. ","Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","All right. Thank you. ","Operator","Ken Usdin with Jefferies is next. Please go ahead. ","Josh Cohen \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Hey, this is actually Josh in for Ken. Thanks for taking our question. Can you speak to the low tax rate you guys realized this quarter and then how we should think about this going forward?","Don Kimball","Yes. Our tax rate reflects the benefit of a couple of credits. Those would be typical for us to have credits throughout the period. I think that our tax rate prospectively should be in the 25% to 28% range. ","Josh Cohen \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Okay and then I noticed that the CRE yields held flat linked quarter after almost 10 quarters of compression, and this is on top some pretty strong loan growth in that bucket. Can you provide some color on what you\u2019re seeing here in terms of competition?","Chris Gorman","Sure. This is Chris Gorman speaking. I\u2019ll take a pass at that and then EJ Burk may have some things to add to it as well. What we\u2019re seeing is we are very, very targeted and so as you think about our multi family business, these are people that we do a lot of business with and so its really kind of a relationship approach as opposed to sort of one piece of paper that\u2019s sort of a one-off piece of paper. ","So I would say it\u2019s a relationship at something for our targeted owners of real estate. We are doing a lot with them. Those are the people that in fact were providing some construction loans too. So I would say that\u2019s why it\u2019s holding up. ","Ed Burk","Yes, and the only other thing I would add is that our mix in real estate has changed a bit. Early in the cycle we did a lot of refinancing and with the market much stronger and property fundamentals a lot better, we shifted a little more to private owners of real estate, more stabilized property and there you are going to see, you will have a little better pricing power.","Josh Cohen \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Okay, thanks for the color.","Don Kimball","Great, thank you.","Operator","Bob Ramsey with FBR Capital Markets is next. Please go ahead.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets","Hey, good morning guys. First question, talking about Pacific Crest, I know you identified the costs that were there this quarter and your expectation for the fourth. Could you talk about the revenues? I know they weren\u2019t around for very long this quarter, but the revenues if any that were there this quarter and sort of what the expectation there is in the fourth quarter?","Chris Gorman","Sure Bob, Chris Gorman. Let me start by, I just want to welcome the whole Pacific Crest team onto the platform. We have been very, very pleased with how the integration has gotten since we announced this transaction just at the end of the second quarter. ","In terms of revenue, they were only around for part of September. The revenue and expenses were about $6 million on each side of the equation. As we go forward, what we\u2019ve said publicly is they had a run rate last year of between $80 million and $85 million. Their pipelines are stronger today than they were when we started talking to them way back in August of last year, August a year ago that is. ","So we feel good about the trajectory of the business. We feel good about what it brings to the platform.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets","Okay, great. And then remind me, the revenues coming through is a combination of the investment banking line and the trust investment services line. Is that correct?","Chris Gorman","That\u2019s correct, and it\u2019s about half and half as you think about their business; half investment banking, half equity sales trading and research.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets","Great. And then I was also curious; I know you talked about loan growth. You guys said earlier that you could easily on the commercial deals take a bigger piece in a lot of these transactions. Given that the asset quality, the loans you guys are marking today seems to be even better than the historical book. Is there a reason that your not taking little bit bigger pieces of these when you\u2019ve got so much capital on your balance sheet and why not grow a little faster?","Don Kimball","Well, we clearly want to grow, make no mistake. I mean, as we look at every single quarter, we want to grow loans, deposits, fees, clients, bankers, we want to grow across the board. We think the way to do it and the most sustainable way though is to really go at growing clients and while its tempting to buy a piece of paper or its tempting to take a big hold position, what we want to do is maintain our moderate risk profile. We think over the cycle that will serve us well. ","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you guys.","Don Kimball","Thank you.","Operator","Bill Carcache with Nomura is next. Please go ahead.","Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura","Thanks. Good morning.","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","Don Kimball","Good morning.","Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura","I had a follow-up question on your earlier comments regarding your efficiency initiatives. The additional expenses make complete sense as the industry evolves and adapts to the technological changes that we\u2019re seeing, but there are others who are absorbing those expenses into their normal ongoing operations without having to call out specific efficiency initiatives. ","And so I guess my question broadly is, what do you think it will take for Key to reach the point where it can absorb these costs without having to call them out every quarter and maybe some of your earlier comments you just said that will \u2013 maybe its next year when we\u2019ll reach a point and I guess maybe I\u2019ll stop there and love to hear any thoughts around that.","Don Kimball","Right. And we\u2019re not calling those out to say that they are non-recurring, because we do expect to see a recurring level of restructuring charges. Why we call them out each quarter is that there is some fluctuation of their ability in that expense line from time-to-time and so this quarter and last quarter we had higher than normal levels of branch consolidations, which increased the level of restructuring charge. And so we think it\u2019s just important for us to highlight what the core level of expenses are and also recognize that there is going to be some variability in that restructuring line item."," ","Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura","Okay, thank you. My other question is around the deposit mix. We know that over three quarters of your deposits reside inside of the Community Bank, but how much of that is small business and I guess more specifically, can you share how you think about the retail versus commercial mix of your deposit base? ","Don Kimball","Sure. As far as small business, it\u2019s in the $4 billion range as far as total deposits for smaller business. We are very focused on our retail core deposit base and that would include small business as a part of that and we recognize the value of those deposits is clearly going to increase with the new rules as far as the LCR requirements and so we are very focused on that. ","Dennis would you like to add anything as far as retail deposit base?","Dennis Devine ","Sure. This is Dennis Devine, Co-President of the community bank leading consumer and small business; that\u2019s absolutely right. And as you think about consumer and small business and business banking for deposits, I would certainly think about that continuum across how we think about our business banking segment and down into small business; very important segments for us.","In our deposit base you see quarter-to-quarter growth. You do continue to see the improved mix of those deposits as well. So as this trench of CD\u2019s, higher rate CD\u2019s continues to run, you see us growing core deposits. ","You see us aggressively in the context of the community bank and in the retail bank looking to grow the client base, to grow our relationship strategy, introducing the products, which have had some real success over the course of the past quarter and growing the number of clients that we are bringing to Key. And so that\u2019s a central part of how we think about success in the community bank as the growth of core relationship clients, the deposits that come with them and certainly as the rate environment rentals see more and more value there.","Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura","Thank you, that\u2019s very helpful.","Operator","Terry McEvoy with Sterne Agee is next. Please go ahead.","Terry McEvoy - Sterne Agee","Thanks. I just have a question on the payments business. You\u2019ve been spending there for the last few years on just generically speaking payments. So if I look at the revenue line, its kind of flat quarter-over-quarter and up a bit year-over-year. Was that spending just to stay competitive or would you expect that line, the revenue line to grow over time. ","Don Kimball","Yes Terry, this is Don and I would say that we clearly expect that revenue line to grow over time, and we are making investments in new products and capabilities. We are starting to sell those and so we are starting to see some benefit from those, but it clearly hasn\u2019t hit stride yet, the full stride yet and so we would expect this to be an area where we would see better than average growth for our fee income for that category. ","Chris, anything else you want to add there?","Chris Gorman","No, Terry its right. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve invested a lot of time. We\u2019ve actually moved a lot of talented people into our commercial payments area. Its an area that we are very much focused on; we are getting traction on the purchase card. ","The prepaid program that we are involved with, we just had a couple of major wins and based on the competitive landscape, we are actually pretty optimistic about being able to be impactful in the prepaid space, particularly because from a public sector perspective we are very focused on certain public entities that we think could benefit from it.","Terry McEvoy - Sterne Agee","And then just a follow-up question. Beth, I was reading the American Banker article last week about you and it mentioned the key basic credit line, which was compared somewhat with the deposit advance product, but it just didn\u2019t fit that description. As others were getting out of that product and similar products, is this scenario of growth and maybe quantify how large this specific product is for Key.","Beth Mooney","Yes Terry, I\u2019m going to ask Dennis Devine to augment my answer, but it was an opportunity for us to really differentiate how we are thinking about responsible banking and serving client bases that historically have been underserved and with products that are under scrutiny and concern, and we feel like we\u2019ve done a number of things in that space to really make sure that we\u2019ve made affordable alternatives available, and I\u2019m going to let Dennis tell you a little bit more about that, because I do think it\u2019s a point of distinction as well as a point of pride for a company.","Dennis Devine","Thanks Beth, and to reinforce Beth\u2019s point specifically, it is not a deposit advance product. It\u2019s a small line of credit that we make available, specifically to clients who traditionally have been unable to attain traditional or prime credit to the banking relationship. The criteria that we look at are deep and its based on the client\u2019s relationship that they have with us. ","Again, these are small lines and we look to build our credit history. Its very much designed to help introduce our clients to their ability to obtain and then manage credit. I think very small lines in the thousands of dollars has been a traditional max in the low end of the thousands of dollars and we\u2019ve just extended that number up a little bit higher to try to create greater opportunity for our clients, but its designed to serve a population that wouldn\u2019t otherwise be served in a responsible credit facing way, so that we can serve underserved populations and continue to build out the communities that we have. ","But again, very much directly aligned with our relationship strategy. These are core clients of Key that have brought our relationships with us that we are looking to extend and help.","Terry McEvoy - Sterne Agee","I appreciate that. Thanks.","Operator","Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets is next. Please go ahead.","John Hearn - RBC Capital Markets","Good morning. This is actually John Hearn on for Gerard. Just a quick question for you on the interest rate sensitivity table in your Q. I believe it\u2019s a 200 basis point increase in rates, result in a 3% increase in net interest income. Does that exist exclusively on the short and intermediate terms or is it parallel shift of the yield curve.","Don Kimball","The underlying assumption is that the entire yield curve moves up by 200 basis points over a 12 month period and keep in mind though that really our asset sensitivity is more generated or source from that shorter end of the curve and so that\u2019s where we would benefit the most and so that 10-year into the curve really doesn\u2019t have as much of an impact.","John Hearn - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And have you examined where we see a flattening of the yield curve where it happens more in the front end and not in the back end. Can you say what the result would be for net interest income then?","Don Kimball","We have looked at twists and one of those would be where you see a flattening, where the short end of the yield curve moves up and that would be beneficial to us. We haven\u2019t quoted what kind of an impact that would be, but it would be helpful just from having that LIBOR and the shorter end of the curve move up.","John Hearn - RBC Capital Markets","Great. All right, perfect, thank you. And then just as a quick follow-up, with your mobile banking adoption, could you speak to just the percentage of customers that are in the mobile channel currently and what are you expecting as we look forward, maybe to 2015.","Dennis Devine","This is Dennis Devine. We\u2019ve seen north of a 30% year-over-year increase in the activity of our mobile clients. You\u2019ve seen us introduce very competitive and strong solutions across not just the core mobile platforms that you would traditionally expect, but across an expanded set as the devices that our clients are using as we extend into windows and Droid and Amazon capabilities. ","And so as building on Beth and Don\u2019s comments from earlier, as Key looks at its ability, both to serve its clients and to reposition our business, to serve those clients in a cost efficient and effective way, our digital investments really build upon mobile and so from a mobile first perspective is the way we think about serving many, many of our clients and on important part of our strategy is making sure that we\u2019ve built up the talent to be able to do just that.","So we\u2019ve seen substantial growth. There is no doubt it\u2019s the most explosive source of client activity in our business over the course of the past year. We expect that to continue. ","John Hearn - RBC Capital Markets","Great. Thanks for taking our questions.","Beth Mooney","Thank you.","Operator","Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research is next. Please go ahead.","Geoffrey Elliott \u2013 Autonomous Research","Hello there. I wondered if you could discuss how the widening in high yield spreads impacts the business; either in terms of impacts on the investment banking and capital market side or on the lending side by potentially pushing customers back from capital markets and other alternatives towards borrowing from Key\u2019s balance sheet. Thank you.","Chris Gorman","Sure. This is Chris Gorman speaking. I mean, the biggest driver in the high yield market is if there are net inflows or outflows and after seeing a series of launch where there were outflows, there have been inflows into the high yield market and in fact we\u2019ve been able to price a deal, one deal already this week. ","So if that market is healthier, that is the high yield market, that is very, very beneficial for transaction related revenue and we have a pretty significant M&A business. That business is up year-over-year 70% and part of the reason that its up is the availability of financing vehicle such as the high yield market. ","The interesting thing that we\u2019ve talked about before; right now our model is frankly best served when the markets have some level of disequilibrium, because we are able to move from product to product. So to the extent they are seized to be a high yield market, that would probably benefit our platform overall, because we have all the various tools that we can go to, to fill in that gap in the capital structure.","Geoffrey Elliott \u2013 Autonomous Research","Thank you.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) The next question is coming from the line of Sameer Gokhale with Janney Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Don Kimball","Good morning.","Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","I had a question about your share buybacks this quarter. When I look at your buybacks, I think you spent $119 million and based on your remaining authorization it looks like you could do \u2013 you have $315 million left, about $158 million per quarter. ","Your run rate has been a little bit below that and I was curious as to whether we should expect you to use up all of that authorization looking out the next two quarters or might you not spend all of that on buybacks. How should we think about that?","Don Kimball","As we look at our share buybacks, they are consistent with our capital plan that we submitted to the federal reserve earlier this year and so some of the timing of the share buybacks are based on shares that are issued in connection with employee compensation plans and other things and so some of those maybe weighted toward the quarters that those are granted, which is typically in the first quarter of each year. And so absent that I would say that generally the share buybacks are fairly consistent throughout the year and our progress to-date is very consistent with the plan that we submitted.","Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Okay, but I\u2019m sorry. We should expect the pace of buybacks to pick up over each of the next two quarters? ","Don Kimball","We would expect to see greater share buyback in the next two quarters compared to what we\u2019ve exercised in the first two quarters of this capital plan, that\u2019s correct, yes. ","Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Okay, thank you. And then another question was just your Lean Six Sigma initiative. Obviously you\u2019re very focused on improving your efficiency ratio. Of course part of that is part of function of revenues, but in terms of just your Six Sigma implementation and it sounded like this was really the first time you\u2019ve ever measured end to end process ever at a company, and I want to find out if you have any early reads, any early wins in those related to Lean Six Sigma or if its just too early in the process here to really talk about it in depth. ","Because it sounds like for a company that really hasn\u2019t ever measured its processes end to end, it could be a lot of low handing fruit that you could take over the next few quarters. Can you talk about that a little bit?","Beth Mooney","Yes, I\u2019ll go ahead. This is Beth, and give some context on that and then I\u2019ll ask Don to give perhaps more granularity. We do look at Lean Six Sigma as an opportunity for our company and you are correct. What you would call the true Lean Six Sigma approach, the end-to-end process where you both drive for a revenue opportunity, client outcomes, as well as looking forward to ways to be more productive and efficient as an opportunity for our company. ","We have launched approximately 10 different Lean Six Sigma programs. Of course our projects right now are varying in degrees of size and significance, but it is something that we are more broadly putting into the company, everything from our sales process to how we look at our credit originations. ","So we are excited at early outcomes, root causes, where we are in the process and the opportunities that will yield both for revenue expenses, as well as a better client experience and I\u2019ll let Don give a little bit more dimension to that.","Don Kimble","Sure. A couple of examples of where we found success with this and it would include in our branch sales process that Dennis have talked before and we\u2019ve mentioned recently here that if you look at our sales per person, per day in the branches, they are up over 30% year-over-year and that whole process was subjected to a Lean Six Sigma effort and review and I think it was helpful in achieving that. I wouldn\u2019t say it was that by itself, but that clearly helped set the table for us.","Another area that we are close to wrapping up as well is the whole commercial lending side and within the middle market space and so we\u2019ve seen some real good progress there as far as making that process much more efficient and effective and are counting on lots of benefits from that going forward as well. ","And so as Beth said, this is in the early stages. We do believe this could be a core part of our culture going forward and we are getting a lot of excitement and interest from all of our employees that have participated in these efforts already.","Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Great, thank you.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","And we have no further questions. I would now like to turn the conference back to our host Beth Mooney; please continue.","Beth Mooney","Thank you operator.

As a reminder this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chairman and CEO, Beth Mooney. Please go ahead.","Beth Mooney","Thank you, Operator. Good morning, and welcome to KeyCorp's second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. In the room with me is Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer, and we announced in June that Chris Gorman and Don were both recently named Vice Chairman of our company; and as such, we have Chris Gorman here joining us today in his new capacity as President of Banking at Key.","Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call.","Now I will move to Slide 3. This morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $393 million or $0.36 per common share. Our quarter included a number of notable items that we have outlined on the slide, which in total contributed a net benefit of $0.02 per share. Overall, it was another strong quarter, which reflects our continued business momentum across the company and the realization of value from our First Niagara acquisition. In the second quarter, excluding notable items, we generated positive operating leverage of 10% compared with the year-ago quarter, driven by revenue growth from our acquisition as well as our core businesses. Revenue benefits from both higher net interest income and continued growth in our fee-based businesses. On a linked quarter, expenses remained relatively stable despite some seasonal increases in certain line items. And importantly, we reached $400 million in annual run rate cost savings from our First Niagara acquisition.","We remain confident in achieving $50 million in incremental savings by early 2018, which will allow us to continue to deliver value to our shareholders. Our cash efficiency ratio, excluding notable items, was 59%, and our return on tangible common equity moved to 13%. Credit trends remained strong during the quarter, with net charge-offs of 31 basis points and nonperforming loans down 12% from last quarter. In the second quarter, we increased our common stock dividend by 12% and continued repurchasing shares. We also received no objection from the Federal Reserve on our Capital Plan, and we are particularly pleased to highlight that it included two additional dividend increases in the plan period. By the second quarter of next year, this would result in a dividend of $0.12 per share or a 26% increase from the current level, obviously subject to board approval.","Moving to Slide 4. We've continued to make investments in our talent, products and capabilities to drive growth, which contributed to our strong results this quarter. I've already mentioned the contribution of First Niagara, but we still have opportunities to reduce expenses further and deliver meaningful revenue synergies. I remain very confident in our ability to achieve the remaining $50 million in cost savings by early next year, bringing the total to $450 million or 46% of First Niagara's full year 2015 expense base. And we've been pleased with our initial success in generating incremental revenue in areas such as commercial mortgage banking and payments. Over the next several years, we expect to reach $300 million in annual revenue synergies. The investments we have made across our businesses have also helped fuel record results in our fee-based businesses like investment banking and debt placement, which reached $575 million on a trailing 12-month basis.","Cards and payments income have also grown significantly with compounded annual growth of 18% over the last three years. These two businesses have generated more than $300 million of combined revenue growth over the past three years, and more than 80% of that has come from our core business and the investments we have made at Key, in our people, in our products and our capabilities. These businesses were also identified as opportunities for First Niagara revenue synergies, and we are still in the early stages of those being realized.","And importantly, we are continuing to look across our organization and make strategic investments that will drive future opportunities for us. We recently announced the acquisition of HelloWallet, which has been a core component of our financial wellness offering. This acquisition further embeds HelloWallet into our platform, enhances the consumer value proposition and provides us with improved data and analytics.","We will also fully control the investment roadmap and continue to strengthen and tailor HelloWallet's capabilities to help our 3 million clients improve their financial wellness.","We also repositioned our merchant services business by acquiring our clients from a previous joint venture, which resulted in a $64 million gain during the second quarter. Our actions ensure we can best serve our clients with our direct relationship strategy going forward. This also better aligns our economics with the performance of the business and our clients.","I believe these examples are illustrative of our enterprise-wide approach to continue driving and improving the value we provide our clients and our shareholders.","I will close my portion of the call by restating my earlier point that it was another strong quarter for Key, demonstrating the value of our First Niagara acquisition and the core momentum we have built in our company. And this is translated into stronger operating results, a cash efficiency ratio of 59% and a return on tangible common equity of 13%.","With that, I will turn the call over to Don for a more detailed look at the quarter. Don?","Don Kimble","Thanks, Beth. I'm on Slide 6. We reported second quarter net income from continuing operations of $0.36 per common share. This compares to $0.23 per share in the year-ago period and $0.27 from the first quarter.","As Beth mentioned, our results this quarter included a net benefit of $0.02 per common share from notable items made up of a $64 million onetime gain in our merchant services business, a benefit of $43 million from the finalization of purchase accounting, merger-related charges of $44 million and a $20 million charitable contribution.","Earnings per common share, excluding these items, grew compared to both the prior quarter and the prior year.","As Beth highlighted earlier, excluding notable items, our cash efficiency ratio was 59.4%, and we had a return on tangible common equity of 12.9%. Over time, we have seen continued improvement in these metrics. And with our second quarter results, we are either at or approaching our stated long-term targets.","I will cover many of the remaining items on this slide in the rest of my presentation, so I'm now turning to Slide 7.","Total average loan balances of $87 billion were up $25 billion or 41% compared to the year-ago quarter and up $369 million or 0.4% unannualized from the first quarter. Compared to the year-ago period, average loan growth primarily reflects the impact of the acquisition as well as ongoing business activity, with commercial and industrial loans continuing to be a driver.","Sequential quarter growth in average balances was driven by commercial and industrial loans, which were up 1.7%, and offset lower commercial real estate and consumer balances.","Our geographically-based core relationship business performed very well in the second quarter. Overall, our Community Bank middle market lending grew 4% un-annualized linked-quarter, with broad-based growth across Key's franchise, including strong loan production coming from our new and overlapped markets in the Northeast.","In our Corporate Bank, client dialogue and deal flow were strong across the board. We raised a significant amount of capital for our clients, but we did see a mix shift towards capital markets' alternatives, which muted our loan growth.","During the second quarter, only 14% of the capital we raised went onto our balance sheet, as capital market alternatives remained attractive for our clients. As an agent, we were able to meet the needs of our clients and generate strong fee income, as evidenced by our investment banking and debt placement fees.","In real estate specifically, this mix shift was visible, with over $400 million in balances moving off our balance sheet during the second quarter and into the capital markets.","I would also note that we continue to be selective in commercial real estate, having stepped back from certain markets and asset classes while also keeping the size of our construction book relatively small.","Consumer loans primarily reflected the continued decline in the home equity portfolio, largely a result of pay-downs during the quarter. Our guidance for the year remains in the $87 billion to $88 billion range for the full year average balances. We project being at the lower end of the range, with an increase in commercial loan growth in the second half of the year.","Continuing on to Slide 8. Average deposits totaled $103 billion for the second quarter of 2017, an increase of $29 billion or 39% compared to the year-ago period, and up $700 million or 0.7% un-annualized compared to the first quarter. Cost of total deposits was up 3 basis points from the first quarter, as commercial deposit pricing gradually moved higher for select relationships. We also saw growth in higher-yielding deposit products. Overall, our deposit betas continue to remain below historic levels, as we are maintaining our pricing discipline in our markets.","Compared to the prior year, second quarter average deposit growth was driven by First Niagara as well as core retail and commercial deposit balances. On a linked-quarter basis, the change in deposit balances was primarily driven by core growth in CDs, NOW and MMDA, partially offset by a decline in escrow balances. Consumer deposits, which include our retail franchise as well the small business and private banking, now account for 60% of our total deposit mix.","Turning on to Slide 9. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $987 million for the second quarter of 2017, and the net interest margin was 3.30%. These results compare to the taxable equivalent net interest income of $605 million and a net interest margin of 2.76% for the second quarter of 2016, and $929 million and a net interest margin of 3.13% in the first quarter of 2017.","Included in the second quarter net interest income is $42 million from the finalization of purchase accounting, which added 14 basis points to our net interest margin for the quarter.","Excluding the impact of the finalization, accretion contributed $58 million or 19 basis points to our second quarter results. This compares to $53 million or 18 basis points in the first quarter.","Our outlook for the second half of the year assumes approximately $5 million of [correlated] decline in each of the next two quarters, resulting in approximately $100 million of accretion in the second half of the year. Excluding purchase accounting accretion, net interest income increased $282 million from the prior year, largely driven by the impact of First Niagara and higher earning asset yields and balances.","Growth of $11 million from the prior quarter resulted from the higher earning asset yields, which was partially offset by higher funding costs and lower loan fees. Excluding the impact of purchase accounting accretion, our net interest margin was 2.97% for the second quarter, up 2 basis points on a linked-quarter basis, as the benefit from higher interest rates more than offset funding costs and loan fees. With finalization of our purchase accounting, our slide also now includes the remaining loan mark, which stood at $345 million at June 30, and the remaining PCI accretable yield of $137 million.","Moving to Slide 10. Non-interest income in the second quarter was $653 million. Excluding notable items, which includes a onetime merchant services gain and a small benefit from purchase accounting finalization, noninterest income was $592 million, up $119 million from the prior year and up $15 million from the prior quarter. Growth from the prior year reflects the impact of the First Niagara acquisition as well as continued business momentum and investments across our franchise. Investment banking and debt placement fees increased $37 million, driven by higher commercial mortgage banking, underwriting and advisory fees. Compared to the first quarter, the $15 million increase in non-interest income largely reflects an $8 million increase in investment banking and debt placement fees. Operating lease income and other leasing gains increased $7 million, and cards and payments related revenues increased $5 million.","Turning on to Slide 11. Reported noninterest expense for the second quarter was $995 million, which includes $44 million of merger related charges and $16 million of other notable items, a charitable contribution and a small benefit from purchase accounting finalization, both of which were in other noninterest expense. ","Our expense level this quarter reflects our commitments to reduce expenses and improve efficiency. As Beth mentioned, during the quarter, we reached $400 million of annualized cost savings. And as we look out to the second half of 2017 and into early 2018, we will be executing on the remaining incremental $50 million to reach our full target of $450 million. Compared to the second quarter of last year, and after adjusting for notable items, noninterest expense was up $229 million. Growth primarily reflects the acquisition of First Niagara as well as higher incentive compensation related to stronger capital markets performance. Linked quarter expenses adjusted for notable items were up $3 million. Second quarter expense levels mostly reflect normal seasonal trends, including increased marketing efforts.","Turning to Slide 12. Net charge offs were $66 million or 31 basis points of average total loans in the second quarter, which continue to be below our targeted range. Second quarter provision for credit losses was also $66 million, matching the level of charge offs. Non-performing loans decreased $66 million or 12% from the prior quarter and represented 59 basis points of period end loans. At June 30, 2017, our total reserve for loan losses represented 1% of period end loans and 172% coverage of our nonperforming loans.","Turning to Slide 13. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio at the end of the second quarter was 9.97%. As Beth mentioned, we increased our quarterly common dividend by 12% to $0.095 per share. And in accordance with our 2016 Capital Plan, we repurchased $94 million of common shares during the second quarter. We also had no objection to our 2017 Capital Plan, which includes two common share dividend increases, reaching $0.12 per common share in the second quarter 2018, as well as a common share repurchase program of up to $800 million.","Slide 14 provides you with our outlook and expectations. We remain committed to generating positive operating leverage, and have updated our guidance to reflect our second quarter results. Consistent with our previous guidance, our outlook does not include merger related charges. Based on our results in the first half of the year, we expect full year average loans to be in the low end of our $87 billion to $88 billion range, driven by strength in C&I. Average deposit balances for the year will reflect the expected run-off of some non-core deposits from the second quarter and should be in the range of $102.5 billion to $103.5 billion.","Net interest income is expected to be in the range of $3.8 billion to $3.9 billion, marking an increase from our previous guidance to reflect the impact of higher interest rates and purchase accounting accretion. Our outlook assumes no additional rate increases this year, and the betas will remain well below their historic levels.","We continue to expect quarterly impact of purchase accounting accretion to trend down over time, with the second half of the year totaling approximately $100 million. The quarterly impact should decline at a consistent pace from the second quarter level of $58 million, a decline of about $5 million a quarter.","We anticipate that noninterest income will be in the range of $2.35 billion to $2.45 billion, an increase from our prior guidance, reflecting the second quarter merchant services gain as well as continued growth from our ongoing business activity and the acquisition. Noninterest expense should be in the range of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion, which includes the impact of merchant services and HelloWallet. We expect merger-related charges, which are not included in the guidance, to trend down in the second half of the year from the second quarter level.","2017 net charge-offs should continue to be below our targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points, and provisions should slightly exceed our level of net charge-offs to provide for loan growth. Our GAAP tax rate is expected to be in the 26% to 28% range for the full year, reflecting a higher marginal rate on incremental earnings. And we remain committed to our long-term financial targets on the bottom of the slide: continuing to generate positive operating leverage, operating at a cash efficiency ratio of less than 60%, maintaining our moderate risk profile and producing a return on tangible common equity in the 13% to 15% range.","I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And first from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Steven Alexopoulos","Regarding the loan growth guidance being at the lower end of the 87 billion to 88 billion range for average loans, I think you ended average loans at the midpoint of the year at 86.3 billion, right? That implies only 340 million a quarter for growth for the second half, which is relatively soft. Is the drag from home equity loans driving this outlook for more muted growth? Or is something else going on?","DonKimble","Well, Steve, for us to get to $87 billion, starting with an 86.3 for the first half, that means we'd have to be at $87.7 for the second half of the year. And so it would be a fairly sizable loan growth and a pickup from what we've been experiencing in the first half of the year.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. Got you, Don. Okay. With the deposit costs ticking up quarter-over-quarter, Don, how are you thinking about the core margin here, ex the purchase accounting adjustments?","Don Kimble","Yes. We're showing a 2.97% for the current quarter without purchase accounting, that's up 2 basis points from the last quarter. It really reflects about 3 basis points from the March beta impact as far as the rate increase, offset by about a basis point lower from loan fees. And so going forward, we would expect to see some lift again in the third quarter from the June rate increase, that we would continue to expect to see a lower impact from purchase accounting accretion in future quarters.","Steven Alexopoulos","Do you think deposit costs keep trending higher at the pace we saw this quarter?","Don Kimble","I think that there's a couple of things that impacted us this quarter. One was the impact of the rate increase, but also we saw a mix shift in the current quarter. And so our outlook wouldn't imply the same type of mix shift going forward, but we would expect to see some of the same impact I talked about before as far as the June rate increase, and then also the purchase accounting adjustment.","Steven Alexopoulos","And then just a big-picture question for Beth. With the full First Niagara cost saves now in, the additional $50 million is on track, what do you think about what's next for Key? Do you do another bank deal here? Do you keep doing small deals, such as HelloWallet? What's the playbook?","Beth Mooney","We've always said that we would invest in people, products and capabilities. And I think this quarter was the reposition of our merchant servicing and the purchase of HelloWallet because that's very consistent with our strategy and our actions over the last couple of years. We've also said that, obviously, we felt First Niagara was a compelling opportunity and a unique fit for Key. And at the time, many banks talk about acquisition for scale, acquisition to reach a certain size. We have never talked about our strategy or our playbook in those terms. We've always said we have a full complement of what we need to serve our customers. But as we looked at First Niagara, we did believe it was a compelling fit. And as we sit here today, I do believe it was a good use of capital and has indeed created real value for our shareholders. So we are not yet done realizing the value. While we have realized the $400 million, we do have additional expense synergies. We're working on the client and revenue synergies. I don't believe we need further acquisition to meet our long-term goals. But I've also learned to never say never. But I believe that our strategies are sound, our focus is clear and that we're creating real value for our shareholders.","Operator","Next, we'll go to John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.","John Pancari","I just wanted to get a little bit of additional color on loan growth trends that you're seeing. On the CRE side, I know you indicated some of the impact of the permanent financing markets. Does that imply that the front-end production on real estate generation is slower, at least on the construction side, and if you can talk about that a little bit? And then on the C&I side, I'm not sure if you mentioned line utilization. Sorry if I missed it. And just really interested in what you're seeing there in terms of CapEx pickup at all at your borrowers, and if that's driving a pickup in demand at all.","Chris Gorman","So a couple of things, as it relates to our CRE business, we still are seeing a lot of flows. If you look at our commercial mortgage banking business, we're up significantly year-over-year, and the pipelines are up. So there's a lot of flow within our real estate business. But as Don mentioned and Beth mentioned, there's a bit of a mix shift, that which goes on the balance sheet and that which we place elsewhere. So good flows in real estate, but the reality is there are market opportunities for our clients as these debt markets are wide open, and we're taking advantage of those for the benefit of our clients. With respect to risk management in real estate, we've talked before about keeping the portion of which is construction to a pretty low percentage, in this instance about 13%, and that's by strategy. And the other thing we've talked about, gee, for a couple of years on this call, is there are certain categories in certain locations, multifamily, gateway, gateway cities, for example, where we've been, from a risk profile, for some time sort of moderating our exposure there. With respect to your question on utilization, our utilization is really up a de minimis amount on a linked-quarter basis, about 0.5%. It doesn't necessarily show up particularly in CapEx as we think about our clients. Our clients remain optimistic. The discussions we're having with our clients remain very, very strategic and focused, but we are not seeing a whole lot of capital expenditures at this point.","John Pancari","Okay, that's helpful. And then my follow-up is -- kind of getting back to Steve's M&A question, Beth, it sounds like you're certainly going to still look for the strategic fits, and you favor these smaller type of nonbank deals potentially. And when it comes to bank deals, it doesn't sound like you completely ruled it out, and especially if you see something compelling. What I'm wondering is, and because this is where investors' concerns are, if you did find something compelling, how do you feel about earn-back? That was the biggest issue with the First Niagara deal that investors had is that it was a long earn-back period for tangible book value. How do you feel about that? Is that something that you will go near again in terms of how long the earn-back was implied on the First Niagara deal? Or is this something that you want to steer clear of, and you're going to look for something with a much shorter earn-back?","Beth Mooney","So John, I'm going to start conceptually. Strategically, Key is well positioned. We've got a strategy that I think is compelling and a trajectory in our core businesses that is now complemented and augmented by First Niagara. We -- and we are not yet done realizing the value of First Niagara and realizing the value for our shareholders. So I want to be clear that we are not a company who is seeking acquisition as part of our strategy. So if I led you to another place, I did not mean to. And as it relates to value creation, there are a range of things that we looked at, at First Niagara, not the least of which we really did believe Key was uniquely institutioned to unlock the value prospectively. And I think you see it in our returns on tangible common equity, and our efficiency ratio as well as expense saves at some 45% of the acquired cost base. I'm going to let Don augment where we are in the earn-back on tangible books and how he would describe that. But I want to close, John, with I did not mean to lead you to anywhere that was unintended.","Don Kimble","And as far as Beth's comments, I would just repeat that we've been very pleased with the financial results we've been able to achieve with First Niagara, that we're showing strong improvement in the categories that we knew that were important for us to achieve. We knew at the time of the announcement that the tangible book value dilution and payback period would be a challenge. I would say that we are seeing a quicker payback than what we originally had expected, and that's coming from the strength of the actual results and the performance we've seen to date. If you look at the tangible book value dilution that we have incurred to date, I would say over the next 3-plus years is when we go back to the point that we were at before the acquisition. And so I think that we're well positioned to have a much quicker payback period than what we initially thought.","Beth Mooney","And John, one last comment was, and in terms of stock price appreciation, our stock is up 7 -- some 70% versus the index, bank index for that period, the same period of time up 46%. So the forward value and the value realization, we do believe that was a good use of capital for our shareholders.","John Pancari","No, I agree. And the stock certainly reflects it. And I wasn't implying that you're saying you're going to do those deals. It sounds like you're not completely ruling out, so you have to ask the question because that certainly was a concern when the deal was announced. And lastly, Don, on that three-plus year implication that you just said, which method are you still tracking or using when you're calculating that recovery of that tangible book value? Is that the crossover? Or which one?","Don Kimble","The three-plus years I talked about was just getting back to tangible book value before the time of the announcement. So what we've talked about before was the [parallel]. And so we are looking at a three-year time period to get back to where we were from a tangible book value per share.","Operator","Our next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. ","Erika Najarian","Yes. My first question, on a GAAP basis, just so we -- I appreciate, Don, your comment on the core NIM and how it's going to progress from here. I'm wondering if I could just get a confirmation on the starting point for GAAP NIM for 3Q. When we take out the purchase accounting refinement, do we start with, let's say, 3.15%, all else equal, in terms of the purchase accounting guidance that you noted during prepared remarks, and then forecast from there?","Don Kimble","I calculated 3.16% because it was 14 basis points on the purchase accounting true-up for finalization.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And the second question is for Beth. Clearly, with a CET1 of almost 10%, you have a lot of capital for your risk profile and your size, and you'll be continuing to build it over time. And as we look forward to 2018, what would you tell your long-term shareholders a -- what your range is in terms of medium-term payout? And how do you think about dividends versus buybacks in a time period where the CCAR isn't getting more difficult?","Beth Mooney","Thanks, Erika. Well, as we've talked about it, we have said that one of the things that we think is important, as the CCAR guidelines have been clarified, is the ability to lean into the dividend payout. We believe we hear that from our owners that the level of dividend payout is an important consideration in their investment thesis. So we have talked about a 40% to 50% targeted dividend payout over time. You saw us this year, in the construct of our Capital Plan, for a 2-tiered increase on our dividend payout through the second quarter of 2018. So that is an important part of how we approach CCAR. And then as we balance in any given year what the Capital Plan will look like in terms of return of capital to shareholders, we look at a number of things that, yes, it is indeed true that this is the first year where soft limits around 100% payout were not applicable, and we would always look at what we would do over and above dividends carefully in terms of what we think is the best use of our capital, both in terms of investing in the business as well as returning to shareholders.","Erika Najarian","But just as a follow-up there, I appreciate the comment on mix. And I'm wondering, given that we saw your peers declare a total payout over 100% -- at 100% or over for this year's CCAR, I'm wondering, as you move past the First Niagara deal, if a payout of 100% or over in total with the dividend at 40% to 50% is something that your shareholders could expect.","Don Kimble","Erika, this is Don. And as far as our CET1, that we are at 9.5% after the acquisition, and we feel very comfortable with that level of capital. We do believe that we have to have something north of 9% to continue to meet the stress test associated with CCAR. And so while it could be higher over a short window, we think that to maintain our capital ratios would imply something maybe about an 80% payout ratio. And that's something that we'll have to tweak positively or negatively based on what we see for organic growth and other capital needs.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. ","Robert Siefers","Don, I was hoping you could just expand a bit on your comments on the deposit mix shift in 2Q. I mean, some of the reasoning is pretty obvious with rates moving, but it sounds like there might also be just some other moving parts in the total portfolio. Yes, I think you had mentioned some either intentional or expected runoff. So just hoping you could maybe expand a little on sort of what's going well versus any way you might have been surprised. And then, I guess, more specifically, you indicated the negative mix shift probably would not continue. Just more background on why that would be the case.","Don Kimble","Where we've been pleased is essentially with our retail deposit growth and our core commercial deposit growth. Where we've seen some outflows is more in the non-transaction oriented deposits. And so for example, this past quarter, we saw a decline of about $1.2 billion in our collateralized deposits, which really don't provide any liquidity for us, and had an impact on the overall rates that we have for our deposit mix. I'd say in some of the individual categories, you're going to see a little bit more shift in some of the commercial categories, which are driving up some of the overall rates in some of the deposit categories. But generally, we, again, have been pleased with the retail and core commercial transaction accounts.","Robert Siefers","Okay, perfect. And then just one separate kind of ticky tack one on the higher tax rates expectation. I mean, I definitely get the higher marginal rate on higher earnings. But was there anything else that changed? I guess I'm just wondering, presumably there would've been a ramp expected in the previous guidance as well. So was there anything else that changed sort of quarter to quarter that drove the expectation higher?","Don Kimble","Really, if you take a look at our guidance update, it's up pretax about $100 million. And that incremental earnings is taxed at a marginal rate of over 37%. And so that will have the effect of increasing our average tax rate by over 50 basis points. And so that really is the reason for the shift up in the tax rate.","Robert Siefers","Okay. So then, indeed, then it is just all the higher pretax earnings base?","Don Kimble","You got it, yes.","Operator","And we'll go to Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken Zerbe","Don, I just kind of want to put a finer point on the comments around commercial real estate. I know you guys were talking about sort of your risk tolerance around CRE, but are you actually seeing any actual deterioration in commercial real estate? Do you expect to see deterioration in commercial real estate or weaker market terms? Or is it really just sort of Key's own preference for limiting CRE growth?","Don Kimble","It is very much the latter. And actually, we've seen credit quality trends improve in commercial real estate. And so that hasn't been an issue. Chris had mentioned earlier that a couple of years ago, we started to exit certain markets. And those markets continue to do very well. And so maybe we put the brakes on a little too fast as far as being conservative there, but we want to make sure that we're cautious and using the capital appropriately as far as putting it to work with our customers.","Ken Zerbe","Got it. Okay, that helps. And then just on the expense side, whether it's for you or Beth. Once you achieve the $450 million of expense savings, right, and let's ignore any potential acquisitions you might or might not do, where do you go from there, right? How much room is there to actually take down sort of Key's core operating expenses versus just getting the efficiency improvement because of higher revenues?","Don Kimble","Great. And our model for the last several years has been one of continuous improvement and allowing us to generate cost savings to help fund the investments we want to make back in the business. And we believe that still is available to us prospectively. And a number of the cost-saving efforts that we had teed up before the acquisition of First Niagara were delayed because we wanted to focus most of the resources on the integration of First Niagara. And so we do believe there are some things that we can do to help achieve further cost saves. And that's going to be important for us in the long haul, especially since we're not seeing a GDP growth provide us any tailwinds as far as the growth in our bottom line.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Don, can I ask you two questions on balance sheet mix? Just on the securities portfolio, it looked like it came down a little bit on average. Can you just talk about just that in relation to what was happening on the liability side? Are you investing further? Or are you just kind of taking a pause? And any changes to the kind of roll-on, roll-off yields?","Don Kimble","As far as the overall portfolio, I mentioned before that the collateralized deposits were down [indiscernible]. And that gave us some flexibility as far as managing our overall investment portfolio. It's a free liquidity at that point in time, and so that's something we'll continue to reassess. I would say that, that overall investment portfolio size is more reflective of the balance sheet management and liquidity constraints for the company as opposed to any other purpose. And then as far as the new purchases, they're coming on at about a 40 basis point kind of spread compared to the roll-off position. It's 30 to 40 basis points overall. So.","Ken Usdin","Okay. So still net positive. Second question, just on the right side. Just in terms of this year, you guys were kind of close to the line on Tier 1 capital. And it came to the stress in the CCAR. And you guys are at 80 basis points of RWAs in terms of the preferred after the redemption of the First Niagara. Perhaps, can you just talk through just your comfort with your buffer? And do you anticipate any further needs in terms of that mix of capital over time in terms of [indiscernible] issuance?","Don Kimble","We'll continue to look at it over time because preferred is still an important part of that Tier 1 capital component. I would say as far as our stress-test results, we still believe that there's room for improvement there, that we don't believe that the Fed scenarios give us appropriate credit for some of the cost savings that we've already been able to achieve and discounting out some of the merger-related charges. We also know that there's some data elements that we didn't have in some of our earliest filings that probably resulted in higher loss projections under their models as well. And so we think over time that those both will improve for us as well.","Ken Usdin","Okay. And did that result or did anything about last year's post-merger tighter stress impact the ask that you went for this year in terms of conservatism just given that uncertainty?","Don Kimble","I think that we were pleased, referring to the ask that we made, and don't think that we would've changed that if we would have known what their black box results would've been. So we think it's an appropriate position in the company at this point.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Moss with FBR. Please go ahead.","Kyle Peterson","This is actually Kyle Peterson on for Steve today. Just a couple of questions. So I guess, in core NIM, I kind of appreciate there are some moving pieces there. We had the June rate hike. Security yields are -- or replacement yields are a little better, but then there's also a little bit of moving pieces around deposits. I'm wondering if you guys had any sense of kind of where you see the core NIM going in the coming quarters, given that we did have that hike in June.","Don Kimble","Yes, the expectation would be generally relatively stable, which reflects the benefit of the June rate increase, but also the impact of lower purchase accounting and some of the other mix shifts that you talked about. I think, also, it's important to note that our guidance for the full year shows an increase of almost $100 million as far as the net interest income. And that's reflective of the balance sheet growth that we're expecting and also the strength of the margin going forward.","Kyle Peterson","So I guess, if it's with a little bit lower purchase accounting, then you get a little better on the core ex accretion. Is that the right way to think about it?","Don Kimble","Correct.","Kyle Peterson","And then just a quick question. I didn't catch it in the release, and my apologies there. What was the preferred dividend expense that you guys had this quarter?","Don Kimble","$14 million this quarter, and that's what we see going forward. So I know it was noisy in the first quarter, but it's now down to a stable level going forward.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Scott Valentin with Compass Point. Please go ahead.","Scott Valentin","Just trying to get a sense on the net charge-off guidance for the year. Looking at the table in the presentation, you guys have been below 40 basis points, I think, for the entire period in the presentation. Just wondering if you see things changing in the second half of the year where you expect net charge-offs to increase.","Don Kimble","Our charge-off outlook would be fairly consistent with what we experienced in the first half of the year. You can always see a blip here or there. But generally, we would expect it to be fairly consistent; but as we highlighted before our credit quality metrics in the second quarter all improved, with nonperforming being down 12%. Criticized and classified has also improved. So I think we're pretty well positioned going into the second half of the year.","Beth Mooney","As we look at our portfolio and our mix of businesses, we continue to believe the credit environment is benign. We don't see any emerging issues or concerns in any of our portfolios. And realistically, I think the only kinds of changes to the kind of averages you've seen on net charge-offs would be, as we've talked about, as you bump along the bottom, for lack of a better term, would be some -- if anything, was idiosyncratic, but nothing that suggests a trend or a shift.","Scott Valentin","And just a topical item of late, but just in terms of retail exposure, both C&I and CRE, I don't know if you have that handy, if you can tell maybe what percent of the loan portfolio is retail CRE and retail C&I?","Don Kimble","What we've talked about before was if you look at the direct exposure to retailers, plus the direct exposure to a regional mall combined, it's around $1 billion. And so it's a fairly small portion of the overall portfolio.","Operator","Next question is from Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Peter Winter","I was just wondering, can you just give an update in terms of new account growth, deposit growth in Upstate New York?","Chris Gorman","We have enjoyed deposit growth across the entire, what we call, the new markets. And so we continue to be ahead in terms of what we thought of in terms of what we had modeled in terms of deposit growth. And we also, Peter, continue to be in better shape than we were -- than we had modeled in terms of attrition. And interestingly, on the attrition side, 70% of the attrition, which isn't as great as we would have modeled, are people that were a single-product or a single-service customer. So we feel good about the trajectory.","Peter Winter","Just a follow-up. The comments earlier about customers choosing capital markets versus holding the loans on the balance sheet, loans held for sale had a nice increase from first to second quarter. Would that be a good indicator for the second half of the year in terms of capital markets' CMBS-type business and fee income?","Chris Gorman","Peter, it's a good indicator of the velocity and the activity that we have going on, on our platform. Having said that, we -- there's a lot of churn in that number. So some of those would span quarters, others wouldn't span quarters. So it's not necessarily a number that you can extrapolate perfectly. I will tell you this. We feel good about our business kind of across the board. Our investment banking and debt placement fees will be another record year this year. The actual -- how it lays out from a quarter-to-quarter perspective will be a little smoother this year than last year. Recall last year in the first -- particularly in the second quarter, actually, the markets were challenging. So you had some volatility. But all in all, we feel good about where the business is. But looking at that number specifically, you can't necessarily extrapolate it into the third quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.","Saul Martinez","Hi, good morning. I apologize if you guys addressed this already, but with overlapping calls, it's kind of difficult to keep -- stay on top of everything. But first, on revenue synergies, can you just comment on how you're feeling about that, whether you're seeing that already, to what extent it's in the numbers, and how you're feeling about the $300 million goal that you've laid out in the past?","Chris Gorman","Saul, we feel really good about the $300 million goal. You will recall, when you talked about it being in the numbers, all the modeling that we did around the acquisition, specifically the $300 million of revenue, incremental revenue, were not in any of the numbers and the guidance we had given anyone going back to the acquisition. Getting back to the $300 million, we feel good about it. As you think about things like residential mortgage, payments, indirect auto, commercial mortgage banking, private banking, which is interesting because First Niagara really was not in the private banking business. And our private banking business right now has a lot of momentum. And so we think that's another area. Some of these sales, as you know, have a long tail. Some of them are relatively short. We've had some success that's already closed, for example, in commercial mortgage. But getting back to your question, we feel good about the $300 million in revenue synergies.","Saul Martinez","Understood. And when I said in the numbers, I meant is it showing up already in the first-half results? Have you extracted -- of the $300 million, have you extracted anything thus far?","Beth Mooney","Yes. Saul, in my comments, and we realize we had some overlapping with another call, we said very early days in terms of what's in current results. But lots of confidence about the pipeline, the fit and the value of the revenue synergies going forward.","Saul Martinez","Understood. I'll ask a second question. And again, I apologize if you did address it. But the expense number, the expense guide, $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion in what you've -- obviously, it's up a little bit. But what's the level of investment, level of cost that is associated with HelloWallet and the merchant services?","Don Kimble","That'd be less than $20 million for the second half of the year between tangible amortization and operating expenses.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. ","Marty Mosby","I wanted to ask a different question kind of as a go-forward. As you've gone through the acquisition, the allowance-to-loan ratio has dropped to about 1%. When you think about CECL, so how will that one be affected by what you have in your purchase kind of portfolio? And then how do you think of that in the sense of building back that loan loss allowance ratio as you kind of go into the new accounting?","Don Kimble","One, as far as building back the reserve, normally, we would expect the allowance to increase. But it was flat this quarter, mainly because of the improved credit quality that we experienced throughout the portfolio. We talked about -- before about a 12% reduction in nonperforming, and criticized and classified being better. And so that really resulted in us having a flat allowance. As far as CECL, we're still early stages as far as doing the modeling for that. But generally, we'd expect the allowance to be higher under CECL than you would under previous GAAP. But I think the impact might differ between different loan types and categories. And so it's still too early to see, but we'll start to probably show some increases in the reserves prospectively between now and 2021, when we have to implement CECL.","Marty Mosby","And then, Beth, you've seen the return on tangible common equity move up towards the lower end of your 13% to 15% kind of guidance, which is in direct result from the acquisition. So I think that's really what the benefit of this acquisition was, is really pushing that to a whole new level. What is the next kind of round of improvements to get you from right at 13% maybe towards the middle to upper end of that range?","Beth Mooney","Well, Marty, I think it is a function of implementation of the strategy. You're right. We were beneficial to get a step-change in the level of our return on tangible common equity with the merger. And now from here, it is the improved operating performance, continued strong capital management. And we see a path and a plan to move through that 13% to 15% guidance in the next couple of years.","Operator","Our next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. ","Rob Placet","This is Rob from Matt's team. With regards to your I-banking and debt placement fees, another strong quarter this quarter. Does the strength so far this year make you any more constructive in your outlook for the back half of the year versus maybe where you were last quarter or at beginning of the year?","Chris Gorman","Well, again, we always think that this is a business where you ought to look at it on a trailing-12 basis. We feel really good about the business. As I mentioned earlier, this -- 2017 will be another record year. It'll be another year where we grow it. The other thing I mentioned is this year, on a quarter-to-quarter basis through the four quarters, it will be a little smoother than it was last year. The pipelines -- as we look forward, the pipelines are strong. So we feel good about the business. We feel good about the constructive conversations we're having with our clients. And as always, I would be remiss if I didn't say it's all market-dependent, but we feel pretty good about it.","Rob Placet","Okay. And then just separately, on the $345 million of First Niagara loan marks, can you remind us how much will ultimately flow through net interest income versus flow through credit? And then on the outlook for purchase accounting accretion, following the $100 million you expect in the back half of this year, how should we think about the step-down in 2018 and 2019?","Don Kimble","The accretion all goes through margin. And so what you'll see overtime is building back some of the reserves to offset some of that. But you will see that flow-through through margin prospectively. So like when we talked about the $58 million for the current quarter, you would see that step down to $53 million, and then $48 million would be our outlook for the next couple of quarters. I would also expect you to look at about a 20% kind of reduction per year prospectively from there.","Operator","And we have a question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.","Gerard Cassidy","Beth, can you give us a 30,000 foot type of view? We saw earlier in this quarter, in the second quarter, the treasury come out with their so called white paper on their views of how regulation should change for the banking industry. And when you look at what they recommended, what are one or two or the top ones that would benefit Key if the regulators were to change or act on some of their recommendations?","Beth Mooney","Thanks. I do think the white paper is an important kind of stake in the ground. If you look at nine years post crisis, we certainly have a stronger and more resilient banking sector. We've got high levels of capital and liquidity. So I do think the opportunity to review regulations that align with risk complexity simplification are all important. But I think specifically, as you look at liquidity and capital, there are some opportunities there in terms of what qualifies for LCR requirements. And then I think specifically, some of the capital requirements that would be attributed to mortgage and small business lending would be an opportunity for Key as well as the industry. So we'll see what emerges, but I am encouraged that -- on the list of things that are under review, and I think as I said, at this point, the industry is certainly resilient and well capitalized. And there are some probably opportunities there that would be beneficial.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. And then just as a follow up. Chris, you talked about the strength of the investment banking business, and particularly in the real estate area. And I know it's market dependent, as you mentioned, but when you look at your numbers, how much of it was due to market conditions being as healthy as they are for this business versus you taking market share and improving your penetration of customers? And then as part of that, is the First Niagara -- I know you've got some early wins there. Does it represent 0.5% of that business? Or how does it frame out for First Niagara at this point?","Chris Gorman","So a couple of things. Before I get to First Niagara, clearly, we, Gerard, pay very close attention to where we stand from a market share perspective. And I can tell you, in our capital markets businesses, we are gaining share. And we use an outside service, the same folks that we've used for a long time. And so it is share gain in addition to the markets obviously being open and available. With respect to First Niagara, it's very early days. It would not equate to 0.5%. But what's interesting is we're having a lot of discussions with legacy First Niagara clients. So that's in the future. But in terms of actually having revenue in our investment banking and debt placement fee numbers, not yet a big number. As I mentioned earlier, we did use our commercial mortgage business to place about $200 million with Fannie and Freddie.","Gerard Cassidy","And not to ask for names, but when you say share gains, are you taking it from other regional banks or the universal banks or the foreign banks? Have you been able to parse that out?","Chris Gorman","It's a mix. And particularly, we feel like our model, Gerard, is really capable of really growing relationships with people that need both the balance sheet, need all the treasury services that we provide and need the strategic advice. So we feel like our model, focused on the middle market, is at a competitive advantage to some other models that are more peaky models.","Operator","And with no further questions, I'll turn it back to you, Ms. Mooney, for closing remarks.","Beth Mooney","Again, we thank you for taking time from your schedule to participate in our call today. If you have any follow-up questions, you can direct them to our Investor Relations team at 216-689-4221. And that concludes our remarks. And again, thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. Thank you for your participation.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chairman and CEO, Beth Mooney. Please go ahead.","Beth Mooney","Thank you, Operator. Good morning and welcome to KeyCorp's third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. In the room with me are Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer; Chris Gorman, President of Banking; and Bill Hartmann, our Chief Risk Officer.","Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call.","I am now moving to Slide 3. This morning, we announced third quarter earnings of $0.32 per share or an adjusted $0.35 per share excluding merger-related charges and other notable items. My comments this morning will focus on the adjusted results which are comparable to prior periods. This was our seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year positive operating leverage and a return on average tangible common equity was just over 13% which is consistent with our long-term target of 13% to 15%.","Our results this quarter included a number of moving parts. Most notably a large commercial loan recovery that impacted our provision that was largely offset from lease residual losses in non-interest income. Don will walk you through these line items in his remarks. We were pleased that net interest income excluding purchase accounting accretion was up $27 million from last quarter with the core net interest margin increasing by 2 basis points.","Average loans grew 0.4% linked-quarter driven by commercial and industrial loans which were up 2% unannualized. Our business model and middle market focus enabled us to continue to add clients and take share, which resulted in growth in both C&I loan balances and fee. Our total average loan growth this quarter reflects higher paydowns especially in September and relatively stable trends in our consumer portfolio.","Commercial real estate balances were impacted by clients continuing to take advantage of attractive capital markets alternatives which helped contribute to our strong investment banking and debt placement fees. We also remain disciplined with new deals and have reduced construction loans and project financing which is countered to some of the market trends.","We expect loan growth to be stronger in the fourth quarter based on seasonal trends and strong pipeline. And for the full-year, we expect average loan growth of around 3% excluding the impact of First Niagara. That's lower than we originally expected at the beginning of the year, but reflective of the environment and consistent with our moderate risk profile.","Other positive for the quarter included strong fee-based income across our businesses. As I mentioned earlier, investment banking and debt placement fees continue to grow and we are well positioned as we head into the final quarter of the year, which historically is one of our strongest period. Cards and Payments had a record quarter, up 7% from the prior quarter, reflecting the investments we have made in the businesses our recent merchant services acquisition and some of our early successes with First Niagara clients.","Most of the other fee category showed good growth both year-over-year and liked quarter. Our cash efficiency ratio remained under 60% and we believe we can move that lower with or without the benefit from higher interest rates. Expenses remain well managed with our quarterly results reflecting our recent acquisitions of HelloWallet and Merchant Services as well as some seasonal trends.","Credit quality remains strong with a net charge-off ratio of 15 basis points which as I said before included a large C&I loan recovery. We have also remained disciplined in managing our strong capital position including returning a significant portion to our shareholders. Over the past five years, we have repurchased over $2 billion in common shares and our compound annual growth rate for the dividend has been 14%.","In the third quarter, we repurchased $277 million in common shares and paid a dividend of [$0.09 and $0.105] per share. Overall, it was a solid quarter which reflects our success in executing on our strategic priorities, growing our business, and delivering on our commitments. As we look ahead, we expect to complete the First Niagara cost savings by early 2018 and remain confident in achieving our targeted revenue synergies.","We continue to see organic growth and momentum across our Company and we have made investments in our people, products, and capabilities to support our relationship strategies and drive future growth. And most recently, early in the fourth quarter, we completed the acquisition of Cain Brothers, a leading healthcare focused merger and acquisitions investment bank. The move will significantly expand our existing healthcare verticals and further enhances our ability to serve our clients with the strength of expertise and capabilities.","I will now turn the call over to Don to provide some additional color on the quarter. Don?","Donald Kimble","Thanks Beth. I am now on Slide 5. We reported third quarter net income from continuing operations of $0.32 per common share. This compares the $0.16 per share on a year ago period and $0.36 in the second quarter. Our results this quarter included a $0.03 impact from merger-related charges in an adjustment to the merchant services gain. Excluding merger-related charges and notable items, earnings per common share was $0.35 up 17% compared to the prior year and up 3% on a linked-quarter basis.","As Beth mentioned earlier, excluding notable items our cash efficiency ratio remain below 60% and we had a return on tangible common equity up over 13%. I will also like to highlight a number of quarter specific items that impacted our results. First, we had a large C&I recovery which reduced our net charge-offs and resulted in a lower loan loss provision. In non-interest income, we also recognized impairment losses on some equipment leases most of which matured in 2018 and later as we thought it was prudent to reflect current market conditions. These two items were essentially offsetting and as such did not impact our core earnings for the quarter of $0.35 per share.","Also professional fees were elevated due to several short-term initiatives and while our recent acquisitions of HelloWallet and Merchant Services will be accretive over time. They added $8 million of expense in the third quarter.","I will cover many of the remaining items on this slide in rest of my presentation. So I will now turn to Slide 6. Total average loan balances of $87 billion were up $9 billion or 12% compared to the year ago quarter and up $312 million or 0.4% on annualized from the second quarter. Compared to the year ago period, average loan growth primarily reflects the impact of the First Niagara acquisition as well as ongoing business activity with commercial and industrial loans continuing to be a driver.","Sequential quarter growth and the average balances was driven by commercial and industrial loans which were up 2% on annualized as we continue to take share in the areas we have targeted. Our C&I portfolio grew despite higher levels of loan paydowns. Commercial real estate loans declined this quarter due to payoffs toward the end of the quarter and planned reduction of certain acquired loans. Home equity loans also continue to experience elevated levels of paydowns which exceeded our loan originations.","During the month of September, loan paydowns increased resulting in a decline in the period-end balances of $450 million during the month. We would typically see growth during September. Given the paydowns from the last month of the quarter as well as our pipelines and expected activity, we've updated our guidance and now expect fourth quarter average balances in the range of $87 billion to $87.5 billion.","Continue to Slide 7, average deposits totaled $103 billion for the third quarter of 2017, an increase of $8 billion or 9% compared to the year-ago period, and up $326 million or 0.3% un-annualized compared to the second quarter. The costs total deposits was up 2 basis points from the second quarter, driven by contractual, rate increases on commercial deposits and a change in the overall deposit mix. Our beta of 17% in the third quarter continues to remain below historic levels as we are maintaining pricing discipline in our markets.","Compared to the prior year, third quarter average deposit growth was driven by First Niagara, as well as core retail and commercial deposit balances. On a linked quarter basis, the change in deposit balances was primarily driven by non-interest bearing deposits from commercial deposit inflows in short-term escrow balances. Growth in CDs also helped offset our managed exit of certain public sector deposits. We continue to have a strong quarter deposit base with consumer deposit accounting for 60% of the total deposit mix.","Turn to Slide 8, taxable equivalent net interest income was $962 million for the third quarter of 2017, and net interest margin was 3.15%. Purchase accounting accretion contributed $48 million or 16 basis points through the third quarter results. This compares with $58 million or 19 basis points in the second quarter. The third quarter decline of $10 million from the second quarter level was primarily driven by $7 million lower benefit resulting from prepayment. The second quarter also benefited from an additional $42 million due to the finalization of purchase accounting.","Looking ahead, we continue to expect to benefit from the accretion to trend down into the range of approximately $40 million in the fourth quarter of this year and further reducing by approximately 10% per quarter in 2018.","Excluding purchase accounting accretion, net interest income increase to $145 million from the prior year, largely driven by the impact of First Niagara and higher earning asset yields and balances. Growth of $27 million in the prior quarter resulted from higher earning asset yields, which was partially offset by higher funding costs and lower loan fees.","Excluding the impact of purchase accounting accretion, our net interest margin was 2.99% for the third quarter of 2 basis points on a linked quarter basis as we saw the fee - net benefit from the higher interest rates.","For the fourth quarter, we expect our core net interest margin excluding purchase accounting accretion to be relatively stable, loan yields in the fourth quarter expected to be stable while deposit costs will continue to increase. We do anticipate the benefit from our investment portfolio as yields on the new purchases are expected to be approximately 50 basis points to 60 basis points higher the maturity.","Moving on to Slide 9, non-interest income in the third quarter was $592 million. During the quarter, notable items included an adjustment to our merchant services gain of $5 million, excluding notable items, non-interest income of $597 million, up $36 million from the prior year and up $5 million from a prior quarter.","Growth from the prior year reflects the impact of First Niagara acquisition as well as broad-based organic growth, which helped offset lower investment banking and debt placement fees relative to our record third quarter level last year. Continue to be on pace for another year growth in investment banking debt placement fees, reflecting the success we've had in growing this business.","Compared to the second quarter, the increase in non-interest income largely reflects continued growth in our fee businesses, including another strong quarter in investment banking debt placement fees and cards and payments income, which is Beth mentioned reached a record level as we continue to benefit from the investments we are making, including the recent Merchant Services acquisition.","Momentum in our business was offset by lease residual losses of $13 million during the quarter. As I said earlier, these equipment leases have maturities primarily extend in the next couple of years, however, we thought it was prudent to recognize a loss to reflect the current market conditions.","Last quarter as is typical - typically more common we had gains in this line item. As of the third quarter lease residual losses or cash efficiency ratio in the third quarter would have improved to 59.2%.","Turning to Slide 10, reported non-interest expense for the third quarter was $992 million, which includes $36 million, a merger related charges. Compared to the third quarter of last year and after adjusting for merger related charges, non-interest expense was up $63 million.","Growth primarily reflects the full quarter impact of First Niagara acquisition as well as ongoing business investments and the recent acquisitions like HelloWallet and Merchant Services. Linked quarter expenses adjusted for merger related charges and other notable items were up $21 million.","Third quarter expense levels mostly reflect the recent HelloWallet and Merchant Services acquisitions, which added $8 million, as well as seasonal trends in marketing and personnel, which collectively added $10 million. We also had $3 million of business services and professional fees related to short-term initiatives that we would not expect to continue going forward.","Excluding these items, expenses were down on a linked-quarter basis. We'll also interact to realize remaining $50 million of merger-related savings by early 2018. Looking forward, the Cain Brothers acquisition will add approximately $20 million to the fourth quarter expense and revenue levels.","Turning to Slide 11. Net charge-offs were $32 million or 15 basis points of average total loans in the second quarter, which continues to be below our targeted range, third quarter provision for credit losses was $51 million. As I mentioned earlier, we had a large C&I recovery during the quarter, which benefited our net charge-offs and provision by $20 million. Despite from the recovery, our portfolio continues to perform well and charge-offs remain below our targeted range.","Non-performing loans were relatively stable, up $10 million or about 2% from the prior quarter and representing 60 basis points of period-end loans. At September 30, 2017 our total reserves for loan losses represented 1.02% of period-end loans and 170% coverage of our non-performing loans. This quarter, we've broken up the allowance for acquired loan portfolio. As you can see on this slide, this allowance has grown as we build provision to coincide with the turnover in the acquired loan portfolio and the associated wind down of the loan losses.","Turning to Slide 12. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio at the end of the third quarter was 10.26%. Capital levels in the third quarter benefited from a change in our methodology related to risk weightings for multipurpose facilities, specifically commitments that can also be used for letters of credit. As Beth mentioned, we repurchased $277 million of common shares during the quarter.","Slide 13 provides you with our outlook and expectations. We remain committed to generating positive operating leverage. However, guidance remains the same with the exception of loans reflecting the results through the third quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we now expect fourth quarter average loans to be in the range of $87 billion to $87.5 billion. Again the remaining guidance for the full-year has remained unchanged.","We continue to expect average deposit balances for the year to be in the range of $102.5 billion to $103 billion. And net interest income is still expected to be in the range of $3.8 billion to $3.9 billion. Our outlook continues to assume no additional benefit from rate increases this year and that betas will remain low well below of their historic levels.","As I mentioned earlier, purchase accounting accretion will trend down over time reaching approximately $40 million in the fourth quarter. Quarterly impact should then decline at a rate of approximately 10% per quarter in 2018. We continue to anticipate that non-interest income will be in the range of $2.35 billion to $2.45 billion and non-interest expense should be in the range of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion. Included within this range is approximately $20 million in added expense from Cain Brothers which closed early in the fourth quarter. In addition, expenses related to HelloWallet and Merchant Services acquisitions as well.","We expect merger-related charges which are not included in our guidance to continue to trend lower. In 2017 net charge-offs should continue to be below our targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points and provision to slightly exceed our level of net charge-offs provide for loan growth.","Our GAAP tax rate is expected to be in the 26% to 28% range for the year and remain committed to our long-term financial targets stated at the bottom of the slide, including continuing to generate positive operating leverage, operating at a cash efficiency ratio less than 60%, maintaining our moderate risk profile, and producing a return on tangible common equity of 13% to 15%.","I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O'Connor","Good morning.","Donald Kimble","Good morning.","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","Matt O'Connor","I want to circle back to the cash efficiency ratio target. You're just below 60% this quarter on adjusted basis and that's in line with the year-to-date. As we think beyond the fourth quarter and you've got a couple of these deals that obviously are a drag on the efficiency ratio, you still got the $50 million sales coming in. Any early thoughts on what to expect in 2018?","Donald Kimble","Matt, we would expect to continue to drive the efficiency ratio down from here. As you highlighted, the most recent transactions are not helpful in that case, but we do believe that there are opportunities between the additional expenses savings that we have remaining of $50 million from First Niagara, which we expect to realize early in 2018. The additional revenue synergies that we'll be achieving from that acquisition and just the organic growth where we continue to drive positive operating leverage to help drive the efficiency ratio down in 2018.","Matt O'Connor","And then just quickly on the purchase accounting accretion. I guess to take that $40 million for the fourth quarter and shrink that 10% per quarter for next year, and I guess you're getting the kind of 120 to 125 ranges for the full-year?","Donald Kimble","That makes sense in that range, yes.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. Thank you very much.","Donald Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Next we will go to Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Scott Siefers","Good morning, guys.","Donald Kimble","Good morning.","Scott Siefers","First one is just sort of a ticky-tack one on that PAA. I think the expectation before had been for a quest like $48 million a quarter for a while. It seems like a fairly large change in the expectation, just curious what drove that change and thinking there?","Donald Kimble","I think as far as the future expectation, we expected that purchase accounting accretion will continue to wind down year after year and continue to get to the point five, four years from now. It would not be adding any benefit at all. I would say that the current quarter came in lower than our expectations as far as that $48 million number because the purchase accounting benefit from the prepayments came in lower than what we would have expected. And so that's the only difference from that perspective and just our outlook will continue to reflect that as our new start point.","Scott Siefers","Okay. And then Don, when you've given the margin guidance, I think you used that core including the PAAs would be stable. Was that they reported margin you expect to be stable in the fourth quarter or the core the way we would think about it without the PAA?","Donald Kimble","What we had said in the script was the core without the PAA. That even with the PAA that still be in that same general ranges because when we say stable we say plus or minus a couple basis points and we would expect the purchase accounting to have that kind of or an offsetting impact.","Scott Siefers","Okay, perfect. I think I just miss heard that, so apologies. And then final question just on the - you got some puts and takes in the loan growth and then it looks like sort of the ongoing growth is pretty strong particularly in the commercial portfolio, but then we've got these kind of unexpected paydowns. I know it can be difficult, but to what extent do you have visibility into the paydowns or I guess more to the point to what extent have you incorporated such phenomenon continuing into the updated guidance.","Donald Kimble","In our updated guidance, we have assumed that the prepayments or paydown would be higher than typical. And that's why we're showing loan growth getting us to $87 billion to $87.5 billion for the fourth quarter. As far as our insights, we were a little surprised by the level of paydowns we saw in September, so I wish our crystal ball is a little clearer than what it is right now, but I would say that that came in higher than expectations and so we're - our updated guidance would reflect that we would see some continuation of some of those higher levels of paydowns.","Scott Siefers","Okay. All right, I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Donald Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Next we will go to Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ken Zerbe","Great, thanks. I guess first question just in terms of the expenses - the expense guidance. I just want to make sure; I'm using kind of the right numbers here to get your $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion of total expenses. If I put instead of this similar numbers this quarter into fourth quarter, I get at the very high end of that range. Is that how you're thinking about it or is there - I did see those items that you mentioned in the HelloWallet and Merchant Services et cetera? Should we back out all those $20 million or whatever million dollars in fourth quarter, so the number would be $20 million or something million dollars lower than where it is now. Any clarity would be helpful.","Donald Kimble","Good comment. As far as our outlook, we're not backing out any of the impact from HelloWallet or the impact of Cain Brothers, so those were included in the numbers. So you're right, if you would add in a similar number for this quarter and the impact of Cain Brothers, we would be at the higher end of that guidance range. I would say that an outlook for the fourth quarter would assume that the core expense levels and Cain Brothers would probably be a little bit below the third quarter level, but when you add in Cain Brothers it would be higher than the third quarter level of 956.","Ken Zerbe","Got it. Understood. Okay. And then just a quick question in terms of going back to the loan balances, I guess that you are expecting the prepayments or the payoffs to continue at this level. But if I just look at like CRE on an average basis down a percent and a half construction is down a lot more, if the past due continue at this point like what point can you actually drive growth in those particular lines?","Donald Kimble","I would say one is, as we've been counting on and continuing to show growth in our C&I of book. I would say that CRE and our construction portfolio did good show decline this quarter. We would not expect that that level of decline to continue that we would expect to be more of an ongoing stable look to that portfolio in the future. That we have seen some decline, especially in the construction portfolio and would expect to see that continue to trend down a little bit.","Ken Zerbe","All right. Great, thank you.","Donald Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning.","Donald Kimble","Good morning.","Christopher Gorman","Good morning.","Erika Najarian","If I - fully appreciate the guidance on the efficiency ratio, but as you both know the conversation with investors sometimes always focuses a lot on dollar expenses. So, on the back of Ken's comments, as we think about some of the core growth that you expect for next year relative to the cost savings from First Niagara? Don, how do you expect that the quarterly trend line on absolute expenses to go sort of in the first half of next year versus the second half?","Donald Kimble","And we'll provide more clarity at the first quarter calls or 2018 outlook. But I would say generally that we would see the remaining $50 million realized in that first part of 2018. Also think about as our revenue synergies would be realized. We've said that that would be $300 million over the next two to three years. We'll also have expense added to tune of about $100 million to support that $300 million in growth. And so we would see that kind of proportionate throughout the next few years to grow to that level of additional revenue levels.","I would I expect core expenses, absent those kind of trends and adjusted for these recent acquisitions would be relatively stable, what we've tried to do is continuing to drive the positive operating leverage by achieving cost savings to help offset some of the expense increases and allow those an investment to drive the revenue growth, which generates positive operating leverage.","Erika Najarian","Got it, and this next question is for Beth. Beth, as you recall there was a lot of consternation in the last quarter's call about some comments that may have been misconstrued on your part about your strategy and I'm wondering if you could - back with this big audience in front of you, you could give us a sense of how you're thinking about capital management for 2018 and 2019 for Key? And I'm asking that purposely in an open ended way.","Beth Mooney","Yes, and I appreciate the opportunity to be clear on point. As we look at Capital Management for 2018 and beyond, I think our priorities are very clear. First and foremost, our ability to use our capital to support our organic growth is our top priority. The ability to continue the dividend increases that have been outlined in our capital submission and was expected continue as we summit next year CCAR as we talked about migrating our dividend payout more - 50% range as a priority and then to continue to repurchase our share to be extent they are attractive for our shareholders and return of capital to our shareholders.","From there strategically our priority would not be M&A. That is not a priority and yet on that front, we do not yet feel like we are fully complete realizing the value of First Niagara for our shareholders. So first and foremost, we believe and credibly important that we complete the job there and make sure that our shareholders realize the full benefit.","And then to the extent, we have done investment, the people product in capability. Those are things that we continue to look to enhance our relationship strategy as well as our capabilities for our customers. Cain Brothers would be a recent example of that and within the second quarter HelloWallet and the purchasing our Merchant Services business would be examples of other areas where we feel like investment support our strategy and enhance our growth.","Erika Najarian","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Peter Winter","Good morning.","Donald Kimble","Good morning.","Peter Winter","If I could just follow-up on Erika's question about the expense that that $100 million in expenses added to support the revenue synergies, would you expect the revenue synergies to come through in 2018 and be above that or is there some type of delay?","Donald Kimble","I would say as far as our revenue synergies, it's a total of $300 million a year, net building proportionally throughout 2018 and 2019 and intend to 2020 a little bit. And we would expect the incremental expenses to be proportionate to that revenue realization. So we don't think there will be any further early build out of those expenses and so we would expect to see that net benefit continue to build throughout the next two to three year time period.","Peter Winter","Okay and just a quick follow-up. You added $19 million to the reserves this quarter, which it looks like - it mostly went in for the acquired loans. Is that a new pace that we should expect going forward?","Donald Kimble","Yes, the $19 million included both the allowance and the reserve for unfunded loan commitments. The $22 million for the - newly acquired loans was a little bit higher this quarter. I don't know that I would signal that's a new pace for us as far as having provision exceed charge-offs by $20 million that we do expect to continue to build that allowance at about a 1 basis point per quarter. So you will see some increased provision to account for that.","Peter Winter","Thank you.","Operator","Next we'll go to Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.","Saul Martinez","Hi, good morning. Appreciate the commentary on the revenue synergies and the benefits you get there. But can you just talk a little bit more about how that's progressing and it does seem like it is something that it does take time free to penetrate and really extract value from those clients. But can you talk a little bit about what you're doing there and how you see that $200 million net run rate playing out and start to filter through the results over time?","Christopher Gorman","Hi, Saul. It's Chris Gorman. Good morning. It's really a few areas where we're principally focused and those areas are - and I'm going to come back to residential mortgage in a minute, it's residential mortgage payments that made a couple of comments about the trajectory of our repayments business where we have a pretty broad portfolio that we're doing a pretty good job penetrating.","Next is private banking. If you look at the legacy First Niagara footprint, there is a lot of wealth in that footprint and our key private banking business can do a good job and we think of penetrating that.","Next we've got a lot of activity in the commercial banking capital markets area. It's kind of fun for me as I'm out in the market calling with people, you really can't differentiate kind of the way we're going to market in the new areas in the legacy area. So I think we're making really a lot of progress there.","And then lastly and importantly, I mentioned residential mortgage that's a business that First Niagara had that's a business that we - Key didn't have in that we're building and we think it's a significant opportunity. If we just get our fair share of the 3 million clients, we have that are taking out residential mortgages.","We think that can be a pretty significant growth business and on that point we've added - if you look at our MLO count just in the last quarter, we've added 20% for that sales force. So that gives you maybe a little bit of the flavor of kind of where we're focused.","Saul Martinez","That's helpful and in terms of when we actually start to show up in the results of this? This sounds like it's a long-term process. You guys have talked about it being a multi-year kind of framework and there's a lot of blocking and tackling obviously. But is this a 2018? Is this a 2019 story? How should we think about what you just said in terms of it actually filtering through in resulted and in topline momentum?","Donald Kimble","I would think that you start to see that build in 2018. As Chris said, we've been building out that residential mortgage business and we'll start to see the benefits there. We're already - seeing some of the benefits start to show some sprouts as far as the payment business and the capital markets related activities. And so those will continue to build those annuities doing for us going forward and start to pickup in 2018.","Saul Martinez","That's helpful. If I could change gears a little bit on and ask about capital. Your CET1 is now above 10%. I think you correct me if I'm wrong. You guys have talked about biggest 9% and 9.5% is an optimal CET1 ratio. Any updated thoughts on capital, it seems like you have a lot of room to rationalize capital and if you could just comment also in relation to that how many changes in SIFI threshold would think about would influence your thinking there?","Donald Kimble","Sure. And you're right. We talked about our long-term target for that CET1 to be in that 9% to 9.5% range. Past year CCAR submission reflected the impact of our acquisition which has some punitive impact to it as far as how the math works, and so our expectation is that we should - that highlight would be able to continue to step up that dividend and have share repurchases to help manage that capital levels down toward that 9% to 9.5% targeted range. And so we're optimistic that we can take those steps here in the next CCAR submission.","To your point as far as the SIFI designation and what type of benefit that might have. Last year, we started to see a little bit of relaxing of some of the payout levels and before we had constraints as far as the payouts couldn't exceed a 100% of total earnings, and so we think that if that SIFI designation would change that could even loosen those restrictions even further. But our objective continues to have a strong level of capital and we believe in that 9% to 9.5% range that would position us very well respectively.","Saul Martinez","That's helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning, guys.","Donald Kimble","Good morning.","Gerard Cassidy","Don can you share with us and looking at your earning asset yields particularly in the commercial loan portfolio, you see that they dropped from about 4.34 in the second quarter of 2017 to 4.11 in particular, the construction loans really dropped as well as commercial real estate. What are you guys seeing in that market for the yields to come down like that?","Donald Kimble","Gerard unfortunately what you're seeing in there really is some noise related to that purchase accounting true up that we had in the second quarter. And that was about $42 million most of which hit those categories that you talked about. And so if you would adjust for that, our commercial loan yields were up 15 basis points linked quarter, which reflects the impact of the increased LIBOR for the quarter. And so we're seeing on a core basis, it just makes it more difficult for you all to see it on a reported basis.","Gerard Cassidy","And do you guys find that the underwriting standards are being maintained in those lines of businesses or are you seeing something changes there by chance?","Christopher Gorman","Gerard, it's Chris. So as you think about - specifically since your question was about real estate, what you're seeing is sort of what you would expect at this point in the cycle, so I don't think the underwriting standards are changing dramatically. I will say though with the capital markets being as wide open as they are what you're seeing is that our customers have a lot more opportunity to look at taking 10-year no recourse, 10-year paper, and I'm thinking of Fannie, Freddie, FHA\/HUD, the Life company's, CMBS market has been open. So clearly there are opportunities for our customers, but in terms of what people are putting on their balance sheet, we haven't seen a huge change.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And then Chris speaking of just real estate, the investment banking and debt placement fee line, obviously $141 million good number. Can you break it out between the debt placement fees and pure investment banking? And then second is as part of that - are you able to capture any business from the First Niagara customers in the quarter?","Christopher Gorman","So in terms of the breakout, Gerard we've never provided a breakout by product with respect to that number. So that number that has a trailing 12 run rate of about $550 million, it's obviously - it's a big business for us. We've grown it each of the last several years. We anticipate continuing to grow it this year. As it relates specifically to some penetration into First Niagara, we have had some successes which really gives us frankly a lot of comfort.","One of the areas of success is in commercial mortgage. So far we placed about $300 million of commercial mortgages things that were on our books that first and foremost serve the client better because it's a better deal for the clients. We make a fee; we de-risk our balance sheet, so that's one area. We've also had some wins in terms of things like straight up financial advisory type work which is pretty early to already have been engaged in complete those. So we feel pretty good about that trajectory.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. Thank you, guys.","Donald Kimble","Thank you.","Christopher Gorman","Thank you, Gerard.","Operator","Next we will go to Kevin Reevey with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.","Kevin Reevey","Yes, good morning. I was wondering maybe Don, I know the auto loan book is a small percentage of your overall loans, but a key focus of investors' attention, if you can kind of give us some color as to how the credit in that book perform this quarter versus last quarter?","Christopher Gorman","I would say that credit continues to be very strong there and no deterioration in that portfolio. Keep in mind that we focused on issuing super prime paper, so it's a 760 FICO score on average. So we're very pleased with the performance and we believe that we continue to be positioned well for that business.","Kevin Reevey","And then Don, I just wanted to kind of understand the moving parts on your earlier discussion on the NIM. You'd mentioned something about the investment securities rolling off and did you say you expect to see 50 to 60 basis points increase in yield, so that should offset some of the runoff in the loan accretion as well as the increased deposit cost. So I just want to kind of understand the moving parts?","Donald Kimble","Sure. As far as the investment portfolio, we have about a $1.4 billion cash flow as a quarter coming off that portfolio. For the fourth quarter, we would expect to see about a 50 basis point pick up on that $1.4 billion compared to the run off of that portion of the portfolio and so that will be an add-in that, so we get back to the gains as far as a relatively stable core NIM for the quarter.","Kevin Reevey","Great. Thank you. That's helpful.","Donald Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Next we will go to Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.","Marty Mosby","Thanks. There's two things that really were kind of off track in a sense kind of kept me from doing a little bit better this quarter. And one of those was like you said the PAA as you had all these paydowns in September those paydowns should have really led to higher purchase accounting accretion. So what was the disconnect, I mean I think you mentioned earlier kind of off the huff that you were surprised that it didn't work. When you looked at it, what was the reason that it didn't work this quarter?","Donald Kimble","I would say that the paydowns that we saw throughout the quarter that put pressure on our loan portfolio didn't necessarily correspond to the same type of benefit we would've seen for some categories that had a higher purchase accounting discount recorded at the time of the acquisition. And so those higher credit discount portfolios didn't deteriorated as much this quarter as what they had in previous quarters. And so it was really more of a mix of those paydowns as opposed to the absolute level of paydowns to cause that balance come down at a slower pace.","Marty Mosby","That makes sense. Maybe the better barrowers were able to do that versus credit impaired borrowers. The other thing I was looking at is while your investment banking and debt placement moved up sequentially and was at a higher level. It still was down from last year, and I was just curious if you thought that possibly any of the disruptions that we saw across the country with hurricanes and everything else that was going on, does that somehow possibly delay some of the transactions just because of the business destructions that were going on out there at the back end of the quarter?","Christopher Gorman","Marty, it's Chris. We don't specifically think that the hurricanes and some of the other disruptions had a material impact. A lot of these transactions have a pretty long lead time, and exactly when they happen is a whole to influence of things, but I don't think the weather per se had an impact on the timing of these deals. Having said that, we do feel good about where the pipeline is.","Beth Mooney","And Marty, I would add that if you look at 2016 the first half of the year that markets were depressed and not functioning well, so our levels of investment banking and debt placement fess were not consistent with the level of performance we would have expected. In the third quarter last year is the quarter where you really saw the markets open up and a lot of the pipeline flow through, so third quarter last year was actually a record year and reflects those pent-up demands coming out of the slow first half.","Marty Mosby","Thanks.","Operator","Next question is from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","John Pancari","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. On the loan demand side, just want to talk about the front end a little bit. I know you've been talking about in terms of loan growth the impact of the paydowns and everything, but in terms of the front end that you sounded a little bit more constructive in your commentary around the pipeline. So why don't you give us a little more color around where you're seeing the strengthening of pipeline and also a little bit around line utilization? Thanks.","Christopher Gorman","John, its Chris Gorman. A couple things, as we look forward into the fourth quarter, the pipelines are strong and there's a few things really working in our advantage there. The first is that we have a leasing business that typically is a fourth quarter business.","Second thing is just our business flows continue to be good. Even areas like real estate where we didn't grow loans, we're clearly growing the business. So we have really good for us, as it relates specifically the utilization, pretty flat. So if you go back a year, you go back a quarter right around that is the utilization has been flat. So that is potential upside if people feel the impetus to sort of go along on inventory, which heretofore we haven't seen.","John Pancari","Okay. And then in terms of the borrower sentiment are you still seeing the number of borrowers apprehensive to drawdown online to mid the uncertainty in Washington?","Christopher Gorman","No, I think sentiment has remained sort of as it's been. I would describe it as cautiously optimistic. We're out talking to our clients all the time. But one of the interesting things that we've seen in places as diverse as say, Elkhart, Indiana and Boise, Idaho is all the sudden - it seems like unskilled labor is a little bit tight. It seems like the cost of building materials are starting to increase.","So I would hold those out as sort of a little bit of a sort of green shoots as you think about people getting back to being a little bit more aggressive. But what we're seeing in general is sort of a continuation of what we've seen, which is that our clients are doing well, but they're cautiously optimistic.","Beth Mooney","And John I would add that there is dialog that relates around physical policy particularly related to tax reform and I do think that there is some tendency at this point here to way to see what that in uncertainty translate into an - with the more constructive tax environment. I do think there is some level of demand that might come for.","John Pancari","Okay, thanks Beth. And then on the comp expense, the 3% or 2.5% pickup their own linked quarter basis, how much of that was - I'd be related to relate to the performance in the investment bank and then one of the drivers impacted that? Thanks.","Donald Kimble","Sure, as far as the investment bank, we tend to see about a 30% correlation between the revenues changes and the comp expense that related investment banking debt placement fees. And so that's been fairly consistent over the last couple of years. One of the drivers this quarter as far as total personal cost, this is a - do we see seasonal increases in our healthcare and medical costs and that also drives an increase on a linked quarter basis around $5 million or so.","John Pancari","Okay and then one more from me. The Cain $20 million in revenue and expenses, do you expect in the fourth quarter? How does that trend further out the expense level pare back a bit or how we think about the profitability of the acquirement?","Donald Kimble","We do see a strong contribution coming from Cain. I would say the expenses do come down a little bit and we see a lot of revenue synergies opportunities for us as well as there a great with our world banking franchise. And you add that, Chris?","Christopher Gorman","No, I would just say that as an enterprise, we have about $10 billion of exposure in places like hospital, seniors housing, skilled nursing. Cain is an organization that we have been keenly interested in for some time. So we're adding about 100 people, 25 senior bankers that have very, very good relationships that tie in really well with the business that we built. So the first test we always have when we're looking at any acquisition like this is can we integrate it into our core business and if you think about the offerings that we have in terms of debt payments, equity, we think Cain will be a great fit.","John Pancari","Great, thank you.","Donald Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Mike Mayo","Hi, there are a lot of in and out here. Where is your guidance by line and a little bit worse where is it better? That you look ahead, I think you said you expect that our efficiency next year, but there are some other in and out I might have missed?","Donald Kimble","Yes, as far as our guidance for outlook the one piece that we did change was the loans and so we do see those at a lower level for the fourth quarter than we previously expected and it came in a little light on the third quarter compared our expectations, and so that's the primary driver.","As a result of that, we're seeing a little less net interest income, but we've still kept that in the overall guidance range that we established at the beginning of the year. We've also seeing purchasing accounting accretion come in a little lower than what we had previously expected and so we think that is - there is an area of challenge from that perspective.","The opportunities we continue to see strong fee income growth and we think we're well positioned for the capital markets, space to be strong again in the fourth quarter and we think fee income is growing at a pace. That's an in line to better than where we had been position before.","And I'd say as far as the expense guidance that the only adjustment we've made there really is reflect Cain Brothers that wasn't previously in our guidance and even with that we're still in the range that we could previously provide. So I don't know that has changed materially as well and so I think it's just the three pieces that really have moved a little bit.","Mike Mayo","Got it and maybe this is too simplistic, but I think a KeyCorp with the capital markets being able to capture more disintermediation from the traditional bank lending, in other words, the paydown on the loans borrowers accessing the capital markets more - you've seen more of those revenues there?","Christopher Gorman","Mike, its Chris. We agree that we think the model that we've built is first and foremost well suited to our clients to be able to access whatever the most advantageous capital was. And so to the extent that there are pockets of pretty the markets are wide open in their pockets of opportunity out there, we think we're well positioned to serve our clients and continue to grow our business. It might in any given quarter, not be on the loans, on our balance sheet line. But we can continue to grow our business.","Mike Mayo","All right, thank you.","Donald Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Moss with FBR. Please go ahead.","Kyle Peterson","Hey, guys. It's actually Kyle Peterson on for Steve today. Wondering you guys could talk a little bit more on the capital front, so you guys got the nice boost to CET1 this quarter kind of the methodology reclassification. Moving forward I guess is there a particular in terms of combined payout is there a kind of level or propound you guys are looking at in future cycles or is it more about managing that dividend payout ratio where you want and try to get CET1 more to that 9% and 9.5% range?","Donald Kimble","I guess more of the latter that we do believe we want to see our dividend continue to step up and get into that payout range of 50% and then we will adjust the other capital actions, share buybacks to help manage that capital level down to that target range over time and so that's where we think there should be a nice step up for us in future CCAR periods to be able to reflect those.","Kyle Peterson","Okay, and then I guess a little bit more on the paydowns, I think if I heard commentary correctly and it's looking the numbers. It looks like there were total - is it fair to say they were total a little more toward CRE and construction over C&I and are those trends kind of continuing so far early in the fourth quarter?","Donald Kimble","The paydowns, you're right, probably had a disproportionate impact on the commercial real estate portion and construction. We would expect construction continue to wind down a little bit from the current levels and so we would expect that we also expect paydowns to continue to be an elevated level here in the fourth quarter.","But longer-term, we do think that there's opportunity to show more stability and maybe down the road a little bit of growth there in the commercial real estate portion of the portfolio and that continue to see that line down.","Kyle Peterson","All right, great. That's all from me. Thanks.","Donald Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","And next go to Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Steven Alexopoulos","Hey, good morning everybody.","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","Donald Kimble","Good morning.","Steven Alexopoulos","I wanted to follow-up on John's earlier question. I'm trying to better understand why you're not seeing the slowdown in C&I that many of your peers are seeing. It is just finding your markets more resilient, are you doing a better job of taking market share? Is there a particular market driving growth? Thanks.","Donald Kimble","I think as we step back and look at it, as you know we've always been strong in C&I. So we have a real business built around continuing to go out and as we look at it, it's really share capture because it's not as though we're holding any more of the credits that we're underwriting. So we really attribute that 2% linked quarter on annualized growth to really fortunate enough to be out there and be able to win in the marketplace.","Donald Kimble","One thing I'd like to add to that as well is that historically we rely more on the Corporate Bank as far as generating the C&I growth and I say over the last year and half to two years, we've seen the Community Bank portion of the commercial lending activity also be additive and that's been a real help for us and so we have the entire organization helping to drive that as opposed to just one portion of it.","Steven Alexopoulos","And is the growth broad-based or is there one market they would point to really be heated the story here?","Christopher Gorman","It's really broad-based, as Don mentioned in our Community Bank going to places, last week I was in Salt Lake, I was in Boise, we're getting really good growth across the board and a lot of that is C&I and that's the business of course that just last quarter had double-digit growth. So it's really broad-based.","Beth Mooney","And Steve I would just add to that also part of it if you think about it that we talked about last quarter and it continues into this quarter is that the First Niagara bankers in the new and overlap markets are starting to also contribute the first couple quarters or perhaps more focused on transitioning their relationship books and they are now also starting to see growth, which is gratifying.","Steven Alexopoulos","Helpful, maybe just one final one Don, sorry if I missed this, the new purchase accounting guidance going down 10% quarter-over-quarter in 2018. I think you were originally said you expected 2019 to decline around 20%. How should we think about that? Should we decline 20% of that new level for 2018?","Donald Kimble","First of all, it goes a lot longer than mind - but I would say just continue to assume that 10% decline per quarter to continue for the foreseeable future be a good estimate at this point in time.","Steven Alexopoulos","Perfect, thanks for all the color.","Donald Kimble","Thank you.","Beth Mooney","Thanks Steve.","End of Q&A","Operator","And with that, no further questions. Ms. Mooney, I'll turn it back to you.","Beth Mooney","Again, we thank you for taking time from your schedule to participate in our call today. If you have any follow-up questions, you can direct them to our Investor Relations team at 216-689-4221. And that concludes our remarks.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chairman and CEO, Beth Mooney. Please go ahead.","Beth Mooney","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to KeyCorp\u2019s first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. In the room with me is Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer; Chris Gorman, President of Banking; and Mark Midkiff, our Chief Risk Officer.","Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question and answer segment of our call.","Now I am moving to Slide 3. This morning, we reported earnings per common share of $0.38, which included $0.02 of efficiency related charges. Adjusting for notable items related to the efficiency charges, our results were $0.40 per share, up 5% from the year ago period and down as expected relative to our seasonally strong fourth quarter results.","Our results this quarter benefited from continued growth in our balance sheet, driven by both loans and deposits. The primary driver of loan growth was commercial and industrial loans with average balances up 8% versus the year ago period. Average deposits from both commercial and consumer clients grew 5% over the same period. Our growth reflects the success of our business model, competitive positioning in the market and investments we continue to make across the franchise.","Noninterest income was below our expectations for the quarter, driven by our capital markets revenue. In addition to the expected seasonality in a number of fee income categories, including investment banking and debt placement fees, our investment banking business was also impacted by disruption from the government shutdown and the delayed closing of certain transactions.","It\u2019s important to note that we remain positive about the outlook for this business based on new client growth, high client engagement and strong pipeline, including a record pipeline for M&A advisory fees. We believe this positions us well for the remainder of the year. We also expect growth across our other fee-based businesses and as Don will walk through shortly, we are affirming our outlook for noninterest income for the year.","Expense management continues to be a positive story with cost down 7% from the same period a year ago, adjusted for notable items. This reflects achieving nearly half of our $200 million in continuous improvement target by the end of the quarter. And even more importantly, substantially all of the targeted expenses should be achieved by the end of the second quarter. We remain committed to reaching our 54% to 56% cash efficiency ratio target in the second half of the year.","The final two sections on this slide highlights our strong position in terms of both risk management and capital. Credit quality remains a strength with net charge-offs of 29 basis points, still well below our targeted range. And all of our credit metrics were stable this quarter. We remain committed to disciplined underwriting and maintaining our moderate risk profile.","Our approach to capital has remained consistent and focused on maintaining our strong capital position, while returning a large portion of our earnings to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This morning, we announced our capital plans for the third quarter 2019 to second quarter 2020, which includes a 9% increase in our common stock dividend to $0.185 per share in the third quarter, subject to approval of our Board of Directors. We also plan to repurchase up to $1 billion in common shares over the same period. Our strong capital position supports both our organic growth as well as our planned capital actions.","Also noteworthy is the closing of our Laurel Road acquisition earlier this month. Laurel Road\u2019s platform bolsters our digital capabilities and aligns well with our relationship strategy to build broad-based relationships with targeted clients and prospects. We are excited to have found a firm that so clearly matches our business and a cultural approach to serving clients.","Importantly, during the quarter, we continue to add and grow relationships across our franchise, which drove growth in both loans and deposits. Client sentiment is constructive and our pipelines are strong, driving continued core business momentum, which supports our revenue outlook for the year. We are delivering on our cost savings and remain on a path to reach our targeted efficiency ratio in the second half of this year.","And we are maintaining our moderate risk profile, and strong credit underwriting remains a priority. And the capital actions we announced today are consistent with our disciplined approach and commitment to return capital to our shareholders. Finally, as Don will walk through shortly, we are affirming our outlook for the year, and we remain confident in reaching our long-term goals.","With that, I will close and turn the call over to Don.","Don Kimble","Thank you, Beth, and I\u2019m now on Slide 5. As Beth mentioned earlier, we reported first quarter net income from continuing operations of $0.38 per common share. Adjusting for notable items, earnings per share was $0.40. Our adjusted results compared to $0.38 per share in the year ago period and $0.48 in the fourth quarter of 2018.","Notable items for the quarter totaled $26 million including $20 million of personnel, largely severance, as well as $6 million of real estate expenses, both related to our efficiency initiatives. As Beth mentioned, we continue to make progress toward our $200 million cost saving target with approximately half already realized and the rest expected to be in place by midyear. Importantly, we remain committed to reaching our 54% to 56% cash efficiency ratio target in the second half of this year. I will cover many of the remaining items on this slide and the rest of my presentation, so I\u2019m now turning to Slide 6.","Our business model continues to position us well to grow relationships and loan balances. Total average loans were $90 billion, up 3% from the first quarter of last year, driven by growth in commercial and industrial loans, which were up 8%. Linked quarter growth and average balances was also driven primarily by commercial and industrial loans. Our growth continues to be broad-based across our footprint as well as through our targeted industry verticals.","Our growth this quarter was partially offset by seasonal declines in commercial real estate balances following a strong fourth quarter. We expect to continue to grow loan balances consistent with our 2019 full year guidance as we support our relationship clients. This year will also benefit from the loan originations coming from our Laurel Road acquisition.","The tone and sentiment from \u2013 with our clients remained positive and our pipelines are solid. That said, we remain committed to our moderate risk profile, and we will continue to walk away from business that does not meet our risk parameters.","Continuing on to Slide 7. Average deposits totaled $108 billion for the first quarter of 2019, up $5 billion or 5% compared to the year ago period and down 0.3% from the prior quarter. Growth from the prior year was driven by both retail and commercial clients. On a linked quarter basis, the slight decline in the positive balances was primarily a result of expected outflows from short-term and seasonal deposits.","Core retail deposit growth remained strong this quarter. We continue to see a migration into higher-yielding deposit accounts as we experience a decline in noninterest bearing deposits with growth in now and money market accounts as well as CD balances. Importantly, we are not acquiring at new-rate-sensitive, deposit-only business.","The cost of our total deposits was up 12 basis points from the fourth quarter, reflecting the deposit rate increase as well as the continued migration of our portfolio into higher-yielding products. As expected, our incremental deposit beta was relatively consistent with what we experienced in the fourth quarter. The incremental beta in the first quarter was 56%, bringing our accumulative beta to 35%. We continue to have a strong, stable core deposit base, consumer deposits accounting for 66% of our total deposit mix.","Turning to Slide 8. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $985 million for the first quarter of 2019 and net interest margin was 3.13%. These results compare to taxable equivalent net interest income of $952 million and a net interest margin of 3.15% in the first quarter of 2018, and just over $1 billion or 3.16% in the fourth quarter.","Most of the $33 million increase from the first quarter of 2018 was driven by earning asset growth and the benefit from higher rates. Offsetting this benefit was an $11 million of lower purchase accounting accretion, lower loan fees and the impact from interest rates swaps. Net interest income decreased $23 million or 2% from the prior quarter, driven by two fewer days in the quarter and a decline in loan fees, partially offset by the benefit from higher interest rates. We expect our net interest margin to remain relatively stable and net interest income to grow consistent with our guidance we have provided.","Moving to Slide 9. As Beth said, noninterest income was below our expectation this quarter. Key\u2019s first quarter of 2019 noninterest income was $536 million compared to 6-0-1\u2013 $601 million for the year ago quarter and $645 million from the prior period. Compared to the prior quarter, seasonality impacted several areas including investment banking and debt placement fees, cards and payments and corporate owned life insurance, which all typically hit their lowest point in the first quarter.","Market conditions put additional pressure on our investment banking and debt placement fees, where we saw some disruption from the government shutdown. This especially impacted our commercial mortgage and loan syndication segments. We also had a number of deals that were delayed this quarter. As Beth mentioned, our pipelines are strong and we expect these areas to show significant improvement throughout the rest of this year.","One other item that impacted the current quarter\u2019s performance was $7 million of losses from our principal investing area for the current quarter. This compared to $8 million of gains from principal investing last quarter.","The comparison from the year ago quarter also reflects the sale of our insurance business in the second quarter of 2018, resulting in a $15 million reduction from the prior year and a $6 million impact from revenue classification changes mid-2018 on our deposit service charges. Later, we will review our outlook for 2019, which has not changed from January. This includes our outlook for noninterest revenues to be $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion for the year. This reflects our expectation for a double-digit increase in our noninterest income in the second quarter from the first quarter level.","Turning to Slide 10. Expense management has remained an area of focus for us and our results this quarter reflect the progress that we made against our expense savings target. First quarter noninterest expense was $963 million or $937 million excluding the $26 million of efficiency related expenses. This compared to just over $1 billion in the first quarter of 2018 and $1.012 billion in the prior quarter, which included $41 million of notable items. The table on the bottom left side of the slide breaks out the notable items incurred in both the current period and the prior quarter.","Compared to the year ago quarter, noninterest expense declined $69 million, excluding the notable items. Our lower expense level reflects Key\u2019s efficiency initiative efforts across the franchise. Those in personnel and nonpersonnel costs, reflecting lower FTE and significant progress on our $200 million cost saving target.","Compared to the prior quarter, noninterest expense declined by $34 million, excluding notable items. This quarter\u2019s results were impacted by three areas. Normal seasonality impacts a number of line items in reflecting the day count, and we also see increase in benefit costs in the first quarter. The second area is variable nature of our expenses. It has the lower capital markets revenues resulted in a decrease to incentive compensation expense. And finally, we\u2019re realizing the benefits from our continuous improvement efforts faster than originally expected.","As Beth mentioned earlier, we have executed on half of our plans to reach our annual run rate target of $200 million in cost savings this year. And we expect the remaining savings to be inflated by midyear. This will result in reducing reported expenses by a low single-digit range from the full year 2018 level, and we continue to expect to reach our cash efficiency ratio target of 54% to 56% in the second half of the year.","Our continuous improvement efforts included the following items completed in the first quarter; we announced a closure of over 60 branches; structured the organization to better align with the customer resulting in significant savings; optimized many of the support functions; implemented vendor related savings throughout the organization; and right sized the middle and back office functions.","Moving on to Slide 11. Our credit quality remains strong, and we continue to be consistent and disciplined in our underwriting. Net charge-offs were $64 million or 29 basis points of average total loans in the first quarter, which continues to be below or over the cycle range of 40 to 60 basis points. The provision for credit losses was $62 million for the quarter. Nonperforming loans were $548 million this quarter and represent 61 basis points of period end loans consistent with the prior quarter.","Turning to Slide 12. Capital also remains a strength for our company, with an estimated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio at the end of the first quarter at 9.84%. As Beth mentioned earlier, we remained true to our capital priorities, including returning a significant amount to our shareholders. In the first quarter, we declared a common dividend per share of $0.17, and we also continue to repurchase common shares of \u2013 with $199 million repurchased this quarter.","We also announced our 2019 Capital Plan today for the period of a third quarter of 2019 to the second quarter of 2020. This plan includes a 9% increase in our common stock dividend to $0.185 in the third quarter, which is subject to approval of our Board of Directors. We also plan to repurchase up to $1 billion in common shares over the same period. Our strong capital position supports all of our capital actions along with organic growth.","On Slide 13, we\u2019ve provided our outlook for 2019, which, again, is unchanged from the outlook we provided in January. This builds on our performance and reflects our expectation for another year of strong positive operating leverage and continued momentum across our company. We continue to expect average loan balances to be in the $90 billion to $91 billion range, once again, driven by commercial businesses.","Average deposits should continue to grow, reaching $108 billion to $109 billion average balance range. Net interest income should be in the range of $4.0 billion to $4.1 billion and our outlook assumes no interest rate changes in 2019. We expect noninterest income will be up in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion with growth in most of our core fee-based businesses. This outlook is up significantly from our first quarter run rate reflecting strong pipelines, investments in our fee-based businesses and a return to seasonally higher levels of fee income.","As noted earlier, we expect noninterest income to increase by double digits in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. Additionally, we expect noninterest expense to be down low single digits from a reported 2018 level in the range of $3.85 billion to $3.95 billion. This range includes the realization of $200 million in run rate cost savings and an increase from Laurel Road of approximately $20 million per quarter. All combined, we still expect to reach our targeted cash efficiency ratio range of 54% to 56% in the second half of the year.","We see nothing on the horizon that changes our expectations on credit quality, with net charge-offs and provision expense remaining below our range of 40 to 60 basis points. Our loan loss provision should slightly exceed our level of net charge-offs to provide for loan growth. And our GAAP tax rate should increase slightly to the range of 18% to 19%.","We continue to expect 2019 to be another good year for Key, building on our own momentum and strong expense management, a clear focus on risk and strong returns. On the bottom of the slide are our long-term targets. We expect to reach our efficiency ratio target in the second half of the year. That said, we have significant upside remaining to improve our returns and deliver value to our shareholders. I remain confident in our ability to continue to move toward the top tier of our peer group and believe over time, the market will recognize our progress and improve results.","I will now turn the call back over to the operator for instructions on our Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And first on the line is Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","Scott Siefers","Good morning, everybody.","Don Kimble","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Siefers","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Don, maybe just a little more thought to flush out the NII guide and how you got there? Sounds like the margin on a reported basis is expected to be pretty flat, which suggest that it\u2019s going to be mostly volume that gets you there, but I guess just any more color given that, I think, you\u2019re going to have to average somewhere like $40 million a quarter higher if you wanted to get to the midpoint of the range. So just, I guess any additional color you could provide, please.","Don Kimble","Sure. A couple of things or three things actually will impact that. One is day count, the first quarter is always the lowest day count. It\u2019s about $7 million a day as far as the impact for fewer days and so that cost us about $14 million this quarter. Second area that was weak for us this quarter compared to our expectations was loan fees, and we expect that to return to more normal levels in the second through fourth quarter. And that cost is about $6 million this quarter compared to where we would expect it.","And the last piece is just what you talked about, which is balance sheet growth, and our outlook for both loans and deposits would imply about $900 million of growth from where our average was in the first quarter to what we see for the average for the full year. And that should help drive the growth so that we get back into that range for NII.","Scott Siefers","Okay, that\u2019s perfect and helpful. Thank you very much. And then if I can jump to fees for a second. And I know you noted, hopefully double digits increased in fees in the 2Q relative to the first quarter performance. But is there any way to discuss just how quickly some of these capital markets fees could come back, I guess I only ask because double digit could be in 10% but then the sky is the limit as well. And I think to get to the guide, you\u2019ll have to average much, much higher than like a what 10% increase would suggest.","So how much of the shortfall in the first quarter was indeed like the old timing that could come back immediately in the 2Q, and how much will progress over the course of the year?","Don Kimble","We would expect a meaningful step up in investment banking debt placement fees for the second quarter. Maybe just to hit the broader question would be as far as our noninterest income outlook for the full year. And we acknowledge that the first quarter\u2019s noninterest income of $536 million is well below the run rate for us to get to our $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion target for the full year. It would require an increase of about $120 million a quarter in fee income.","And so as I would look at this, just a few things to keep in mind as far as the investment banking debt placement fees by just returning to the same reported levels we had in second quarter of 2018 through fourth quarter of 2018 that would add $60 million to our quarterly run rate as far as IBND fees. What we\u2019ve talked about is, our pipelines are very strong, we did have deals push out of the first quarter and to subsequent periods, and so we do believe that is on track. And so we do believe that our pipeline support a continuation of building on our model from where we were last year.","Another component is seasonality, first quarter is also low on fee income categories outside of IBND and that should add about $25 million a quarter for seasonality. Included in our other income line item was principal investing losses and typically we see a couple million dollars a quarter in fee income from that. We saw about a $7-plus million dollar loss there and so that would add about $10 million a quarter. And so just to get to the low end of our growth or our target, we\u2019d have to have $25 million a quarter of additional fee income growth.","And so we would see that coming from a number of different areas and those who we\u2019ve talked about consistently have been investment banking and debt placement fees, our cards and payments related revenue and mortgages also on a very good trajectory for us as well. But if we look at our application volumes, we\u2019re up over 50% from both a year-ago levels and also from the fourth quarter levels. And so we are on a path to start seeing mortgage drive some increases in fee income as well. And so that\u2019s kind of how I would answer your question, so hopefully that\u2019s helpful.","Scott Siefers","Yes, it\u2019s very helpful. Appreciate that. Again, thanks for taking my questions.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ken Zerbe","Great, thanks. Good morning.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Ken Zerbe","Could we just talk about your capital plans, just for a little bit? The \u2013 let\u2019s call it the 2019 CCAR year number, the $1 billion. It was a little bit lower than the last year\u2019s, I think it was $1.2 billion plus. Could you just talk about kind of how you went about formulating the $1 billion, why that\u2019s the right number and was there any negative \u2013 potentially negative surprises in your next year forecast that would lead to the lower buyback amount? Thanks.","Don Kimble","There really aren\u2019t any negative surprises as far as our outlook, I would say that last year we had a strong capital substitution with a preferred stock issuance replacing common equity. But the common dividend and the share buybacks combined really are able \u2013 enable us to get toward the top end of some of our guidance ranges as far as capital for next year.","And more importantly, it keeps us just inside what that templates would allow us to do without going through a formal approval process. For us to step up our capital actions from what\u2019s included in today\u2019s announcement would require us to submit a full Capital Plan with the Fed.","Ken Zerbe","Okay. No, I guess that helps. And then in terms of the efficiency initiative expenses, is that something that we could see going forward from here, or is 1Q the end of it?","Don Kimble","We\u2019ll see some again in the second quarter. It should be at a lower total level than what we had in the first quarter but that should be the end of it.","Ken Zerbe","In 2Q, understood. Okay, great. And then just one final question. In terms of your average CRE balances looks like they were down a few percentage or a couple of percentage points, which is a bit more negative than some of the banks have also reported this quarter. Can you just talk about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of CRE, I mean, is it just elevated pay downs or is there something specific about your markets or customers?","Don Kimble","Well, a couple things in commercial real estate balances for us. One is that we do have a commercial mortgage business, and we do see a lot of sales of those assets in the fourth quarter and so that puts our balances a little bit lower at starting point for the first quarter. But second, this is an area where we continue to focus on our risk profile. And we\u2019re not seeing the opportunities there for growth that we\u2019re seeing in C&I and some of the other categories and so we\u2019re probably a little more cautious there than some of our peers might be.","Ken Zerbe","All right, sounds good. Thank you.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Erika Najarian","I just wanted to follow up on Scott\u2019s line of questioning. And Chris, if you could weigh in on some color, too. Don, you mentioned that just getting back to the previous level for investment banking gets you to a starting point range of about $155 million for the second quarter. And I\u2019m wondering if you could give us any more color on \u2013 you also mentioned Beth, in your prepared remarks about a record pipeline for M&A advisory fees. So try and think through, how much of the timing difference could really boost sort of the second quarter run rate?","Chris Gorman","Erika, it\u2019s Chris. Good morning. Well, first of all, let me acknowledge that clearly the first quarter was not the first quarter we expected from a perspective of investment banking and debt placement fees. As it relates to the timing, as we look forward, none of the deals that were pushed out have been lost. So then it\u2019s a question of when are they actually captured? And we\u2019re off to a very good start here in the beginning of the second quarter.","So we feel good about the trajectory and what really gives us, and I think both Beth and Don mentioned this, what gives us really the most comfort is kind of across the boards we have pipelines that our elevated from this time last year. And specifically, Erika, with respect to our advisory pipeline, our M&A business, it\u2019s a record. So those are kind of some of the things that give us confidence as we go forward.","Don Kimble","Erika, we feel much more comfortable and confident in our full year outlook as opposed to giving a quarterly guidance on that specific line item. And as we saw this quarter, we were surprised by some of the transactions being pushed out of the first quarter into subsequent quarters. And so we know that the core business is there, the activity is there to support the kind of growth that we want to see going forward and so that\u2019s why we\u2019re very focused on that $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion fee income line item.","Erika Najarian","Understood. And then a follow up on capital return. I know that banks in your category were sort of restricted by the Fed template, which carries over sort of the tougher CCAR of 2018. And I\u2019m wondering what the decision tree was in terms of having to go through the full CCAR in theory? I think some \u2013 most banks had said that the parameters at this year would be easier versus sort of just doing the template?","Don Kimble","Well, one, it was helpful for us and that with these capital actions, it really doesn\u2019t make progress and move us toward our targets. Both from a common dividend payout ratio, it gets us closer to that 40% range and also the share buybacks I think are very important for us. And we actually totaled a little bit more towards the share buybacks this time than what we would have before. And with this level, it does start to bring us down toward that 9% to 9.5%, the targeted range.","And so one, it\u2019s helpful that even with the template, it approaches that level, what we have is a possibility if we feel that we need to step up capital actions. We have the ability to resubmit a Capital Plan at any point in time and don\u2019t have to do it just now. So that\u2019ll be something we can consider in the future if we feel a need to step up beyond where our current plan would include.","Erika Najarian","Got it. So just I understand the process for the banks in your category. Let\u2019s say that the stock value, market valuation continues to provide a window of opportunity to buying back shares. You could submit, I think, is it \u2013 up to 1% of RWA. Without having to go through any sort of formal approval process?","Don Kimble","There is de minimis approval. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a full 1% of RWA, but I don\u2019t know what that level is of the top of my head there is ability to get a de minimis adjustment.","Erika Najarian","Got it, thank you.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","And next we\u2019re going to Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Good morning.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Just a follow up on the capital side. Obviously, doing a lot of catching so I think you\u2019re the first bank out there to kind of give the plan in your stars. But it does sound like it\u2019d be pretty compelling to go through the hassle of the paperwork. And it just offer more flexibility, I mean you\u2019ve been pretty clear about not being interested in bank deals. We got small deal closing here. I don\u2019t know if the acquisition appetite has changed but it does seem pretty compelling to go back and ask for more. If the acquisitions strategy hasn\u2019t changed, especially in light of flatter yield curve, not robust loan growth.","Don Kimble","Well, Matt, I can say definitively our acquisition strategy has not changed so that is not a priority for us, and so we are very focused on executing in star strategic plan and generating organic growth. And to your point, we could have some additional flexibility as far as increasing our capital actions and we\u2019ll just have to assess that over the next couple of quarters as the split of that limits us in the current environment or whether we want to file a full Capital Plan and adjust to that request.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. And then just separately the expense management this quarter was very good to help offset some of the weaker fees and you clearly sound confident that the fees will come back strongly the rest of the year. If for some reason the revenue is a little bit weaker than you hoped for, are some of these cost adjustments or cost savings sustainable?","Don Kimble","Yes. Well, the cost savings are sustainable. And I would also argue or suggest that as we saw this quarter, many of our revenues also have a highly correlated expense number with that. So that the expenses are variable to those revenues that are being generated in this case, those capital market revenues are highly correlated, and we\u2019ve said that in the past it\u2019s been about a 30% correlation and so there is that opportunity to adjust that. We\u2019ve talked a lot about making sure that we hit our efficiency targets and make sure that we deliver on our commitments to the street.","And part of that is making sure that we continue to focus on expense control in order to help manage to achieve our targets even if the revenues are weaker. So I think you\u2019ll see ongoing efforts for us to continue to manage that down and would expect our efficiency ratio to continue to decline each quarter from here on out this year. And so that will allow us to achieve that targeted level.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay, thank you.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to David Long with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","David Long","Good morning, everyone.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Chris Gorman","Good morning.","David Long","With the rate curve flattening inter quarter, how is that changed your investment decisions in your securities portfolio?","Don Kimble","I would say as far as our investment decisions, it hasn\u2019t changed a lot. Now what you did see from us quarter was about $1 billion increase on our investment portfolio and that was because our liquidity levels continued to be above where we wanted to be and so we move that out of short-term and into our portfolio. The nature of the investments is very similar that we tend to look at agency CMOs and those have been very predictable for us as far as cash flows, and we don\u2019t like a lot of the mortgage pass-through security so we don\u2019t have the variability associated with that.","One of the thing we did do is this quarter we started to enter into more interest rate swaps and floors again and so we added over $4 million of those to really shift our asset sensitivity to be more neutral and to make sure that we\u2019re not only more balanced but also have greater protection in case the rates do start to go down at some point in time.","David Long","Got it. And then in your \u2013 in the quarter, what yields were you investing in? What type of yields were you getting on new purchases?","Don Kimble","First quarter, the average yield for the new purchase was 335%, and the raw offer rate for the portfolio was at 229%. So we picked up over 105 basis points on those reinvestments, I\u2019d say that in today\u2019s marketplace, it\u2019s a little tighter than that probably about 30 basis points tighter because of the flatness of the curve.","David Long","Perfect. Thanks for the color, Don.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Next question\u2019s from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning, Beth. Good morning, Don.","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Gerard Cassidy","Don, can you shoot with us any color on CECL? I know we won\u2019t need the official number until probably later this year but some of the banks have come out with the Day 1 increase in reserves and in fact Wells Fargo surprised I think people by saying that their Day 1 reserve will not increase but decrease. Any color on how yours are shaping up?","Don Kimble","Yes. One, Gerard, if you could tell me what the economic outlook is on the first quarter of 2020. We might be able to predict what that is because CECL is going to be more variable based on what the economy would show. I would say more generally though that for CECL, we think that there should be very little impact and maybe even some slight decreases in some of the commercial categories. If you look at the reserves maintained by Key and other banks that tends to be with an assumed loss recognition period of about three years, which is also about the average life of loans.","And so we don\u2019t believe that there should be much of an increase there and potentially, again, maybe even on a slight decrease. And on the consumer front, we do believe that there will be increases on the CECL reserves that most banks will have about 1.5 years worth of charge-offs for consumer products and many of the consumer loans have an average life of well north of the 1.5 years if you look at home equity and mortgage, you might even assume a seven year kind of life. So we think that the reserve requirements under CECL will increase those.","Now for Key, that\u2019s actually a good relative position because of about 75% of our loan portfolio is commercial and then 25% is consumer. And so we think that the impact should be less than what we\u2019re seeing from many of our peers.","Gerard Cassidy","Great, thank you. And following up, I know you guys have been pretty definitive on your views on M&A. But maybe Beth, there\u2019s some speculation I think in the market, linking your recent proxy proposal to increase the number of authorized shares with maybe potential M&A. Can you give us any color on what \u2013 why it was increased?","Beth Mooney","Yes. I\u2019d be glad to, Gerard. And on the proxy proposal, it really was an administrative action and it\u2019s actually something that we knew that our level of share authorization would need to be addressed. And if you look at our 2019 equity compensation plan, the additional shares are now necessary. It\u2019s actually been over 20 years since our last authorization. So in determining the requested amount, we basically evaluated ISS\u2019 published voting guidelines, and our increased authorization is actually at the lower end of the ISS guidelines.","So our thinking was to avoid requiring frequent proposals. It was our intent to request an amount of authorized shares that would suffice for a long period of time. So it was purely administrative and not linked to any strategic actions or plans.","Gerard Cassidy","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","John Pancari","On the \u2013 back to the capital markets revenue, the IB and debt placement revenue. I got all your color on how you\u2019re thinking about that and the seasonality and the pickup and pipeline. So I guess to think about it for the year, if we look at full year 2019 versus 2018, given your expectation of a bit of a rebound here, is this fair to assume that we could see growth in full year 2019 revenue and IB in debt placement versus over the FY2018 level?","Don Kimble","Yes. That \u2013 I would just say that we\u2019re focused on our guidance range for fee income overall, and we talked about the $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion and for us to get in that range, it does require us to show increases in investment banking debt placement fees to more normal levels and show growth beyond that for the rest of the year. And I prefer not to go into much more detail, specifically about those line items and just the group in total.","John Pancari","Okay, all right. And then separately, back to capital deployment, I know that you had indicated that you\u2019re deployment level even though it came in below some of our expectations, it does get you in \u2013 you said approaching the top end of your targeted range. So why not more towards the mid to lower end of that range? How are you thinking about that range here at this point, just trying to get some color on why wouldn\u2019t it be further into it? Thanks.","Don Kimble","We do and plan to overtime manage into that range. I would say that part of the constraint this year is the template does limit the amount of share buybacks that we can do to stay within the guidelines from the Fed. Beyond that, just as we talked about our common equity, excuse me, our common dividend payout ratio be in the 40%, 50% range. We will get there over time as opposed to in one fell swoop. So our expectation would continue to manage that over the next several years.","John Pancari","Okay. And then related to that, the 9%, the 9.5% targeted range. Is that \u2013 you\u2019re still comfortable with that? Or do you think there\u2019s potential that that could move lower overtime?","Don Kimble","We do believe over time, we could see that come down and what would drive that as continued improvement in our operating results that is as we continue to build out our earnings performance that should provide additional support for our capital and therefore, could lower that target over time.","John Pancari","Okay. Thanks. And then one more and then sorry if I missed this, but I know you had reiterated no real interest in bank M&A. On the non-bank side, is there interest in potential further deal similar to the Laurel Road transaction?","Don Kimble","I would say that we are always looking at areas where we can add additional people, products and capabilities to align with our overall strategies. Most of the transactions we\u2019ve done have been much smaller than what either Laurel Road or Cain Brothers were. And so we\u2019ll continue to look at that fill-ins there. But we do believe that the transactions we\u2019ve done have been additive and will continue to generate value and help accelerate our efforts to our strategic goals.","John Pancari","Okay, got it. Thanks Don.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Steven Alexopoulos","Hey, good morning, everybody.","Beth Mooney","Good morning.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Steven Alexopoulos","I want to first start on capital. So what were the thoughts on going out now with the 2019 Capital Plan versus waiting to get a potentially much stronger 2Q under your belt?","Don Kimble","I would say as far as our announcement of our capital plan that \u2013 we knew this would be a topic of conversation from our investors. And so we felt that we go ahead and announce it now and then as far as the levels, we really believe that was in line with our initial expectation and also put it as the high end as far as what the Fed template would provide. And so we felt that it was appropriate to go ahead and announce the plans based on those criteria.","Steven Alexopoulos","And now given the CET1 is now at 9.8%, if you did not have this template constrain, would you be looking to buyback much more than the $1 billion? Or is the reality just that you don\u2019t have as much excess capital as you had in the past?","Don Kimble","Well, keep in mind that our Common Equity Tier 1 has only moved down by about 30 basis points from a year ago. And so there isn\u2019t a huge gap as far as the change from where we were then. I would say that last year we did have a significant preferred stock issuance, which allowed us to buy back additional common shares and so that had an impact on last year\u2019s capital actions. And it\u2019s something that we\u2019re continuing to evaluate. And as we\u2019ve said is we do believe that we have the opportunity, if we believe appropriate to submit a capital plan to increase our capital actions beyond this.","We also knew that it would take some time for us to be able to achieve that, and so we felt that it was appropriate to go ahead and get these actions in place and start making those share repurchases occur and also to increase the common dividend.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay, thanks. Maybe just a final one for Chris. I wanted to follow up on the expectation for double-digit increase in fee income in 2Q. So if we look at loans held for sale, which historically was a good leading indicator of the IB pipeline. Why is the size of held for sale not indicating a larger pickup coming? It\u2019s pretty light actually, this quarter. Thanks.","Chris Gorman","Yes, so Steve, good morning first of all. So as you know, we have a bunch of line items that impact our investment banking and debt placement fees. It isn\u2019t always a particularly perfect correlation between what we have in terms of held for sale and what\u2019s coming out of the pipeline.","I mean, we\u2019re talking about 10% increase quarter-over-quarter in noninterest income. I think the big line items where you\u2019re going to see changes are trust and investment services. We talked about the fact we had insurance there before. Investment banking, you also see \u2013 you also will see pickup in corporate services income, which is derivates in FX, which is tied to transactions. The other thing to mention is obviously M&A never makes its way into the line item that you referenced.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay, thanks for the color. I appreciate it.","Chris Gorman","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Hi, guys. Good morning. Don, can you elaborate on the Laurel Road income statement impacts? You mentioned in the guidance that it continues to be in the interest expense. But how does \u2013how do you expect that now to traject as far as now bringing in balances onto the balance sheet? Is that included in your loan, obviously in interest income outlook? And just maybe you can desize both the revenue and the expense impacts for the year? That\u2019d be helpful. Thank you.","Don Kimble","Sure. As we talked about it from the expense side that \u2013 the transaction closed a little quicker than what we had initially had and so we \u2013 now we\u2019re saying about $20 million a quarter, so roughly about $60 million of expense as far as the impact. The loan outlook has, since the day one included the impact of Laurel road, and so, we do expect that to have a boost to our consumer lending this year and that\u2019s also very helpful. We should also see some lift in fee income, because some of their production, it is the type of production that we would be selling, like mortgages and maybe some of the consolidation loans as well and so we should see some drive there.","The guidance we provided before about \u2013 having about a negative $0.02 impact this year. Is probably about the same general range, so it\u2019s not much higher or lower even though it\u2019s been in place for one month more.","Ken Usdin","Okay. Got It. And one more on capital. So with the letter math Don, I guess, is there a way you can help us describe when you thought through it like what the \u2013 what your limiting ratio is? Last year you were Tier 1, I believe limited in CCAR. Did the letter math change, what you find to be your binding constraint without going through the formal CCAR process? And does that change in terms of how you think about managing capital going forward at all? Thank you.","Don Kimble","You\u2019re right, the template still shows Tier 1 is being our limiting factor there and will give us the opportunity to issue some preferred stock to help with that as well. So that\u2019s a part of the consideration going forward.","Ken Usdin","Okay. So that wasn\u2019t a change in one of the reasons why you limited. It would just seem that the letter math would have been better than a \u2013 more than $1 billion?","Don Kimble","Our math is within $12 million of what that template shows for the $1 billion. Just put it in perspective.","Ken Usdin","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Next we\u2019re going to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Mike Mayo","Hi. I just wanted to follow-up more in the investment banking. But just to clarify, if you were to get a little more specific guidance for second quarter. Second quarter fee growth should be somewhere between 10% and 99.9%.So when I give a little bit more guidance for that range, I guess Scott asked that question earlier.","Don Kimble","Yes. I would say that up double-digits and Mike, just to put it in perspective, I think earlier someone mentioned that fee income was up in IBND fee. So I think number was $155 million for the second quarter, I think that those general ranges are consistent with a kind of a double-digit increase from where we are in the first quarter.","Mike Mayo","Okay. So my question really relates to investment banking. If you look at organic investment banking growth the last few years, it\u2019s not where it was before that. And I just \u2013 some of this is timing what you said, deals are delayed not dead, but that\u2019s also true for your peers, which performed better whether similar size or the largest.","Some of this could be mix. You talked that the record M&A backlog, that\u2019s not huge in the scheme of things. So I guess, in terms of management, since Chris Gorman, since he kind of rose further up and maybe a little further away from that business. Does it have the same intensity that it had in the past. I know you created that, but most importantly it\u2019s the competition. Goldman Sachs this week said that they\u2019re hiring 100 new coverage bankers to cover 1,000 new companies, which I think are middle market companies.","I think Goldman Sachs is pretty much saying they\u2019re going after your customers in the investment bank. So what role does \u2013 whether it\u2019s the mix or management or the competition have on investment banking revenues, which have decelerated over the last several years on a core business stripping out, Pacific Crest and Cain Brothers? Thanks.","Chris Gorman","Thanks for your question Mike. I mean, if you go back and it\u2019s still very true today for people to compete with us, they have to be focused on companies that are in the middle market, companies that need the full breadth of an integrated model and that are within our industry groups. And there\u2019s always competition and we have great respect for our competition. But the reality is, in terms of on any given opportunity, the team showing up and being able to check all those boxes, we very much like our chances when we\u2019re out there competing.","So one, we continue to grow the business, we\u2019ve successfully integrated both Pacific Crest Securities and now Cain Brothers, which is kind of tricky when you successfully integrate boutiques. No question there\u2019s competition, but we really like where we\u2019re positioned in the market and as we said, we expect to continue to grow that business.","The other thing that we mentioned at our Investor Day that I think is really important is the nature of the repeat revenues. So we\u2019ve been able to build a business where 50% of our customers do something strategic every three years or so. And I think that\u2019s really important, and Mike, what\u2019s going on right now with frankly the slowing growth in general in the economy, but really healthy balance sheets is, we\u2019re having a lot of strategic discussions both with our clients and with our prospects.","Mike Mayo","I mean, so what do you think \u2013 I mean, also you have JPMorgan fit into the market banks so even if that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing today, how do you \u2013 what do you say to your team over the next three years when you see headlines like Goldman Sachs this week or JPMorgan at their Investor Day? Everyone seems to all of a sudden love the middle market for investment banking. So are you just keep doing what you\u2019re doing and then hope it stays the same? Or what can you do?","Chris Gorman","So we will keep growing our business in a very targeted way. We talked about focus scale that day, in October, we will continue to go about the business in doing that. The real secret to serving these middle market companies is really the coordination of all the pieces and parts, whether it\u2019s the balance sheet, the advisory, the hedging, the operating accounts and that\u2019s not easy to replicate, I\u2019m not saying it can\u2019t be replicated, but the reality is, that\u2019s a tough business model to replicate as it relates to the broader middle market.","Mike Mayo","All right. Thank you.","Don Kimble","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Great. Thank you. Our next question is from Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.","Saul Martinez","Hey guys, good morning.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Saul Martinez","So a couple of things. First, I guess following-up on the last question from Mike. Don, your \u2013 the guidance for full year assumes that \u2013 I guess the bridge to get to the guidance assumes that you get back to the 2Q 2018 to 4Q 2018 run rate for IBCs, And I get that there\u2019s a pipeline strong, Q2, you may have some visibility but is that \u2013 how reasonable is that assumption because you did \u2013 especially in the back half, you did have a strong year, you mentioned slowing growth, competition was mentioned. You had a lot of pay downs last year. Is that \u2013 how confident are you that, that run rate is the right one to use going forward?","Don Kimble","One, the walk forward that I provided just that\u2019s a component getting back to that level, we also believe there is growth for the business and growth for other areas in the business. But as far as our confidence, as Beth said in her comments that pipelines are all very strong. And we do have record levels of pipelines in M&A and some of those M&A transactions were part of those that were delayed out of first quarter. And so we have good insight or sight line into the near-term there.","But more importantly, if you look at the last 30 to 40 days, our activity levels, our calling efforts, they\u2019ve all stepped up and so that\u2019s fitting the table nicely for not just the current period but long-term type of growth in opportunities for us in this category.","Saul Martinez","Okay. If \u2013 I know you\u2019re \u2013 each press confidence, you can hit your target. If you do come up a little bit short on the fee side, is there more room on the expense side to manage expenses even lower than what you\u2019re guiding to right now? How much flexibility do you have in terms of discretionary expense?","Don Kimble","Our expense range is based on the assumption that we are inside our revenue targets as far as both fee income and net interest income. And if we see weakness in those categories, we do expect to see our expenses come down appropriately. And as \u2013 we\u2019ve mentioned many of the fee categories that have some variability to them are more capital markets related. And there is a high variability that the expense associated with that as well.","Saul Martinez","So even if you\u2019re a little short on revenues, do you feel confident you can get to the 54% to 56% in the back end of the year?","Don Kimble","That\u2019s our plan, yes.","Saul Martinez","Final thing for me. Laurel Road, you mentioned some of the impacts. But can you just give us a sense how much is it could add to your consumer indirect loan book? And at what yields it would be put on?","Don Kimble","Yeah, that, I would say that last year Laurel Road originated about $1.2 billion in production. And so we do believe that they can continue to grow their core, and we\u2019ll just continue to operate their business. We also think there are synergies like combining with Key, and we have a number of customers that really overlap well with that medical professional field. And so we think there is additional products that we can distribute through that platform as well.","Keep in mind too that some of those loans are going to be balance sheet and some could be sold in the markets like the mortgage production. And so we\u2019ll see it come through on both the loans and the fee income. But I\u2019d say the $1.2 billion in production is a good starting point.","Saul Martinez","And I think in the past, you mentioned that the yields are similar to what you have in the other parts of your consumer book. So I mean, remind us that\u2019s what like 5.5%, 6% is that sort of the\u2026","Don Kimble","Yes, that 5.5% range is a good range for the production, yes.","Saul Martinez","Got It. All right. Thank you.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","Next we\u2019re going to Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.","Marty Mosby","Thanks. And kind of a sequence of the questions I wanted to ask. One is, if you look at investment banking, it\u2019s down from fourth quarter to first quarter, the last five years I think it\u2019s been a trend. I was expecting rates maybe they kind of kick in and maybe accelerate some of the deals, maybe they\u2019re just getting a little bit more pushed out but the seasonal trend looks to be pretty solid with what you\u2019ve seen in the past. If we look at the actual variance in the sense of what we\u2019re looking at in the sense of EPS, there\u2019s probably $0.02 or $0.03 related to what the compression was just in this one fee income line.","So I just \u2013 I\u2019m trying to take the expenses that were associated with the less revenues and kind of net that out. But I\u2019m thinking $0.02 or $0.03 was probably the impact for this particular quarter, given the compression you saw from fourth quarter into the first quarter for this fee and line item?","Don Kimble","Marty, the math I guess, is in line. If you just take a look at what our investment banking debt placement fees line item was versus a year ago. That\u2019s a $33 million decline. You also take in consideration the other capital markets revenues were impacted whether it was corporate services income or the markets impact as far as there\u2019s principal investing losses. And so those are all meaningful as far as the impact and constraints on our revenues.","On the expense side, to your point, capital markets revenues, there tends to be about a 30% correlation to the expense. And so for that $33 million and reduced IBND fees that would be about a $10 million incentive attached to it. So if you worked through all the math, it probably \u2013 for those three areas, it probably would be in that $0.02 or $0.03 range compared to what we would have generally expected in more normal market environments.","Marty Mosby","And then that is such a key to see that come back next quarter. So we\u2019ve been through that discussion a lot. It has at least shown that trend to come back in the second quarter anyway and especially if there were some delays, you might be able to see that. But if you kind of now connect that and the need to make sure that you\u2019re hitting these targets, there is still an opportunity, you\u2019ve been doing a great job moving your investment portfolio yields higher.","And with what you saw with the template and a sense of what you could give back in dividends and share repurchase, you could actually take that difference so to say we rebought, repurchased $1.2 billion last year, this year we\u2019re going to repurchase around $I billion. Take that $200 million, actually invested and accelerating the pickup, that 50 to 75 basis point difference between what\u2019s going to mature in the next couple of years and where the market is to actually pick up a significant amount of earnings.","So you have excess capital, this is capital you would actually re-earn over the next couple of years and it would have to actually give you a little bit of a backdrop to help soften some of this reliance just on this one thing coming back. So just wanted to see what kind of potential you might have, given the excess capital you have that might not go through the template, but could be used in a different area.","Don Kimble","Our objective is to have capital to support organic growth, and so we do expect that we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve got a lot of business activities that would result in growth for us. Based on the commercial side, we continue to see nice growth in commercial lending activities over the last five or six years and so that\u2019s been a source of strength for us. We also believe that the Laurel Road should add additional volumes to our balance sheet.","And so we want to make sure that we have the capital there to support that and that\u2019s our priority. To your point as well, on the investment portfolio that, we would expect to see that stay relatively stable. And so we think that our loan growth will be funded by our deposit growth but maintain that and more the same level and so we think that it should translate to core earnings growth for us with those types of assumptions.","Marty Mosby","And we\u2019re not asking about \u2013 talking about increasing the portfolio as much as it just getting the existing size up to the current market rate. So you could take that and you could even be smaller in size, if you want to fund more loans and still get that benefit from the point of liquidity. But getting that portfolio rate that still believes 2.5% up towards where market rates are today, like you said that front book that you can accelerate that.","And that acceleration would help you kind of step into some of this weakness and offset the need to see such a stepwise leg up. And then Beth, what I wanted to kind of get you to respond to was, when we talked to investors, I mean the biggest issue that comes back was the valuation for KeyCorp just kind of stands out amongst the large cap banks, is really about management and how people can kind of rely on and it even had some of the questions with the guidance you\u2019ve given is, can we really believe this? This next step up is going to be critical for you to be able to accomplish, given I think that suspicion or doubt that\u2019s still lingering from whatever people felt because of the acquisition announcement a couple of years ago.","So I think addressing that and kind of talking about where you believe and how you feel, confident in how you\u2019re going to accomplish this year end goals because year-end goals really haven\u2019t changed very much. So we\u2019re really being asked to believe in the back half of the year offsetting the weakness that we\u2019re seeing in this particular quarter. So just wanted to see if you could address some of those concerns that we hear consistently.","Beth Mooney","Yes, Marty I would say that first and foremost, we didn\u2019t acknowledge that on the noninterest income front, we were like this quarter. And we mentioned specifically investment banking debt placement fees and then some of the market impacts that you even saw, such as in our principal investing portfolio and so forth.","Reiterated our guidance. Don, I think early in the call kind of outlined and trying to make sure people could brainstorm this first quarter to how we looked at reiterating basically our revenue guidance for the year as well to try and help make sure that you understood where our confidence came in reiterating both noninterest income, as well as our revenue guidance for net interest income. We\u2019ve obviously started the year with a very strong start on expenses. So again, we have a trajectory here that gives us confidence to meet the commitments we made around our efficiency ratio in our full year plans in that regard.","And we\u2019re engaged in a number of efforts that will drive shareholder value. In addition to our continuous improvement initiatives, we\u2019ve got the Laurel Road acquisition, we have other investments we\u2019ve made in our business. And we believe we have the full complement and capabilities to affect our plans deliver on our commitments. And we are very much focused and our priorities are clear. And what we wanted you to hear today is while we have a low base in the first quarter off of noninterest income, specifically in investment banking, we have a clear path and we have a clear plan to realize our commitments.","Marty Mosby","Thanks for your willingness to answer that. Very good and that step forward on revenues Don was very helpful. Thanks.","Don Kimble","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Peter Winter","Good morning.","Don Kimble","Good morning.","Chris Gorman","Good morning.","Peter Winter","On the net interest margin, Don you mentioned that the outlook is to be relatively stable going forward. Can you just give some of the puts and takes?","Don Kimble","Sure. That, as far as the stability one we would expect loan fees to pick up again to more normal levels and that costs us again 2 basis points this quarter and so that should be in add. We also think that the reinvestment of our bond portfolio, that this past quarter we had about $900 million of cash flow off that, we think that cash flow will continue. And we should have 70 basis points or thereabouts improvement from the reinvestment there, which will be helpful.","The third piece will be helpful for us, too. As you might recall that we had some swaps that were terminated last year. And those swaps are those that matured through 2019. In the first quarter that had a negative impact as far as the amortization of the impact of that of about $14 million. And that won\u2019t go away throughout the rest of the year.","And so from the first quarter to the second quarter, you\u2019ll see that amount drop from $14 million to roughly $6 million, so an $8 million pickup there. Now offsetting that, we would expect to see deposit rate continued to drift up a little bit and probably mid-single digits here in the second quarter, but probably low single-digits after that. And that\u2019s really the result of our customers continuing to migrate into more interest-bearing type of product as from where they\u2019ve been historically in.","So you\u2019ve seen the consumer opt for more time deposits and seen more shifts out of the noninterest-bearing DVA into interest-bearing DVA and things like that. And so, we think all those combine allow us to keep that margin relatively stable going forward.","Peter Winter","All right. Thanks very much. That\u2019s all I had.","Don Kimble","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And Ms. Mooney, no further questions. I\u2019ll turn it back to you for any closing comments.","Beth Mooney","Again, we thank you for participating in our call today. If you have any follow-up questions, you can direct them to our investment relations team at 216-689-4221. And that concludes our remarks today. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"12490":["KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) Q1 2017 Results Earnings Conference Call April 20, 2017  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Beth Mooney - Chairman and CEO","Don Kimble - CFO","Bill Hartmann - Chief Risk Officer","Analysts","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Samuel Ross - Evercore","Scott Siefers - Sandler O\u2019Neill","Bob Ramsey - FBR","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Lana Chan - BMO Capital Markets","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks","Saul Martinez - UBS","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","Kevin Reevey - DA Davidson","Peter Winter - Wedbush Securities","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to KeyCorp's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chairman and CEO, Beth Mooney. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Beth Mooney","Thank you, Operator. Good morning and welcome to KeyCorp's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Joining me for today\u2019s presentation is Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer. And available for our Q&A portion of the call is Bill Hartmann, our Chief Risk Officer.","Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments, as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call.","I am now turning to Slide 3. Key reported strong results for the first quarter which reflects continued business momentum throughout our company and our success in realizing value from our First Niagara acquisition. My comments this morning will exclude merger-related charges which were $81 million or $0.05 per share in the quarter.","We generated positive operating leverage in both the year ago period and prior quarter and our pre-provision net revenue was up 58% from last year and 6% from the fourth quarter. Revenue trends reflect strong net interest income and another quarter of solid performance from our fee-based businesses including our capital market area.","Both revenue and expenses reflect our acquisition of First Niagara last August and the addition of over 1 million new consumer and commercial clients. Our result this quarter also reflects significant progress on our cost savings targets and efficiency goals. This has been accomplished by continuing to focus on legacy key expense levels, as well as executing our integration plans for First Niagara.","At the end of the first quarter, we had achieved 85% of our targeted cost savings of $400 million from our acquisition. The remaining 15% will be realized by the end of next quarter and we expect to exceed our initial savings target and deliver $450 million of cost savings by early 2018.","Our cash efficiency ratio this quarter moved to 60.4% and we're on a past to move that below 60%. Credit quality remains strong this quarter but lower net charge-offs and a reduction in non-performing assets and loans relative to the prior quarter.","We also maintained our strong capital position with the common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.9%. During the quarter, we repurchased $160 million of common shares and subject to Board approval we expect to increase our common stock dividend in May.","Moving now to Slide 4. During the quarter we made significant progress with our First Niagara acquisition and as I mentioned earlier, we expect to exceed our initial cost savings target but the conversion of branches, systems and clients completed in the fourth quarter our teams continue to execute our detailed merger plans as we moved into 2017.","In addition to the completion of our branch consolidations plans, we have now exited approximately half of the corporate real estate space that was identified along with our work to decommission nearly all of the targeted application and servers.","From a strategic perspective, our confirmation with First Niagara has truly transformed our market presence particularly in Upstate New York where our history days back nearly 200 years. We now have leading market share in a number of important markets and have improved our scale but deposits per branch are approximately 70%.","We have also made broad-based progress in strengthening the relationships with our 1 million new clients. Retail deposits have grown from the conversion dates in every First Niagara market. We are also seeing strength in areas like commercial mortgage banking, payments and residential mortgage as we continue to build out that platform.","Critical to our success with First Niagara is our ability to deliver on our financial targets and the commitments we have made. As I said, we remain on track to achieve our initial $400 million in cost savings by the second quarter and we expect to reach $450 million by early 2018. This would represent 46% of First Niagara\u2019s full year 2015 expense base.","With our first quarter results, we are operating at a level consistent with or better than the financial targets we announced with the acquisition. And while not included in our financial targets, revenue synergies from our acquisition provide significant upside. We have been very pleased with our early wins and remain confident in our ability to deliver a broad range of products and services to our new client.","I will close my portion of the call by restating, that it was a strong quarter for Key and also the third consecutive quarter that we have shown value creation from our First Niagara acquisition. During each of these quarters, we have grown our business by expanding client relationships and delivered on our cost saving commitments and this is translating into enhanced operating results.","As evidenced by our 60% cash efficiency ratio, and 13% return on tangible common equity both of which improved by 400 basis points from the year ago period. While we are reporting results that reflect the value of the acquisition, we believe they have not yet been fully recognized in our stock valuation.","With that, I will turn the call over to Don for more detailed look at the quarter. Don?","Don Kimble","Thanks Beth. I'm on Slide 6.","First quarter net income from continuing operations was $0.32 per common share after excluding $0.05 of merger-related charges as compared to $0.24 per share in the year ago period and $0.31 in the fourth quarter which excludes $0.11 of merger-related charges.","As Beth mentioned, we generated positive operating leverage for the quarter. Excluding merger-related charges, our cash efficiency ratio was 60.4% and we had a return on tangible common equity of 12.9%. I\u2019ll cover many of these items on this slide in the rest of my presentation so I\u2019m now turning to Slide 7.","Total average loan balances of $86 billion were up $26 billion or 43% compared to the year ago quarter and up $773 million or 1% unannualized from the fourth quarter. Compared to a year ago period average loan growth primarily reflects the impact of the acquisition, as well as ongoing business activity with commercial and industrial loans continuing to be a driver.","Sequential quarter growth and average balances was driven by commercial loans which were up 2% and reflecting ongoing business activity and lower payoffs in our real estate capital line of business. Consumer loans primarily reflected the continued decline in home equity loan portfolio in line with market trends. As we previously communicated, we plan to finalize purchase accounting including the fair value of acquired loan portfolio in the second quarter.","Continuing to Slide 8, average total deposits totaled $102 billion for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $30 million compared to a year ago period and down $3 million compared to the fourth quarter. The cost of our total deposits was relatively stable in the first quarter with a beta of less than 10% for total interest bearing deposits we remained - we maintained our deposit pricing discipline despite the increased interest rates.","Our guidance assumes the beta will remain low throughout this year. Compared to the prior-year, first quarter average deposit growth was driven by First Niagara, as well as continued momentum in our retail banking franchise. It is important to note that retention of the First Niagara deposit base is exceeded expectations. As Beth mentioned, retail deposits have grown in every First Niagara markets since the conversion date adding approximately $600 million in total balances.","Consumer deposits which include our retail franchise, as well as small business and private banking now account for approximately 60% of total deposit mix. On a linked-quarter basis, the change in deposit balances was primarily driven by escrow deposits along with a target reduction and certain short-term commercial deposits.","In the corporate bank as expected we saw a decline in deposits as we exited low value rate relationships and collateralized deposits. On a period in basis, deposit balances were stable with growth from our retail franchise offsetting lower escrow deposits.","Turning to Slide 9, taxable equivalent net interest income was $929 million for the first quarter of 2017 and the net interest margin was 3.13%. These results compare to taxable equivalent net interest income of $612 million and a net interest margin of 2.89% for the first quarter of 2016 and $948 million and a net interest margin of 3.12% in the fourth quarter of 2016.","Keep in mind fourth quarter results included $34 million related to the third quarter refinement of purchase accounting. Included in the first quarter net interest income is $53 million from purchase accounting accretion which added 18 basis points to our net interest margin for the quarter. This compares with $58 million in the fourth quarter which excluded the prior period refinement.","Our outlook would assume that the impact of purchase accounting accretion will continue to decline at the same pace. Excluding purchase accounting accretion, net interest income increased $264 million in the prior-year largely driven by the impact of First Niagara and higher earning asset yields and balances. Growth of $20 million in the prior quarter resulted from higher earning asset yields which partially offset by two fewer days in the quarter.","On our slide we had a detail to show the trend in our net interest margin excluding the impact of purchase accounting accretion which is 2.95% for the first quarter to benefit from higher interest rates and lower levels of liquidity.","I\u2019m going to Slide 10, non-interest income in the first quarter was $577 million, up $146 million from the prior year and down $32 million from the prior quarter excluding the fourth quarter benefit from merger-related charges. Growth in the prior year was driven by higher investment banking and debt placement fees, a result of improved capital markets conditions and activity. It was a record first quarter for this business.","We also saw growth in the prior year and a number of our other businesses like Trust and investment services, service charges on deposit accounts, and cards and payments income which benefited from the acquisition and ongoing business activity.","Compared to the fourth quarter, lower non-interest income largely reflects lower investment banking and debt placement fees which had a very strong fourth quarter along with corporate owned life insurance which is seasonally lower in the first quarter.","Turning to Slide 11, reported non-interest expense for the first quarter was $1 billion which includes $81 million of merger-related charges. A detailed breakout of merger-related charges is included in the appendix of our materials.","As Beth mentioned, our expense levels this quarter reflects our commitments to reduce expenses and improve efficiency. 85% of our targeted cost savings have been achieved and are reflected in our first quarter results.","On the bottom line on the slide you can see that our quarterly run rate after adjusting for merger-related charges, pension settlement and intangible amortization refinement was $58 million lower compared to the fourth quarter. We expect to achieve the remainder of the $400 million initial cost savings target in the second quarter and as we look out to the remainder of 2017 and enter early 2018, we will be executing on our revised target of $450 million, an incremental $50 million from our initial target.","Moving back to reported expenses compared to the first quarter of last year and after adjusting for merger-related charges, non-interest expense was up $253 million. Growth primarily reflects the acquisition of First Niagara, as well as higher incentive stock based compensation.","Linked-quarter expenses adjusted for merger-related charges were down $81 million. Lower incentive levels reflect the merger cost savings achieved, as well as the lower pension expense due to the fourth quarter settlement charge. Additionally, lower incentive and stock-based compensation for the first quarter was offset by seasonally higher benefit expense.","Turning to Slide 12, our net charge-offs were $58 million and 27 basis points of average total loans in the first quarter which continues to be below our targeted range. First quarter provision for credit losses was $63 million which slightly exceeded the level of net charge-offs.","Non-performing loans decreased $52 million or 8% from the prior quarter. At March 31, 2017 our total reserves for loan losses represented 1% of period end loans and 152% coverage of our non-performing loans.","Turning on to Slide 13, common equity Tier 1 ratio at the end of the first quarter was 9.9%. In accordance with our 2016 capital plan, we repurchased $160 million of common shares during the first quarter. Also we both redeemed and converted some of our preferred stock in the quarter. In February, we redeemed our preferred series fee which totaled $350 million and in March we converted our 7.75% Preferred Stock Series A in the common shares which added approximately $21 million in common shares outstanding.","For the first quarter, our preferred stock dividend totaled $28 million with the Series C redemption and the Series A conversion, we would expect our quarterly run rate to move down to $14 million.","Slide 14 provides you with our outlook and expectations for our recorded results in 2017. Merger-related charges are excluded. We remain committed to generating positive operating leverage and have updated our guidance to reflect our first quarter results.","We continue to expect average loans increased in mid single-digit percentage range which translates the full year average balances of $87 billion to $88 billion. We expect loan growth to exceed deposit growth with full year average deposit balances in the range of $104 billion to $105 billion.","Net interest income is expected to be in the range of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion. The $100 million increase from our previous guidance with our outlook assuming one additional rate increase late in the year and the data will remain low for the remainder of the year.","We continue to expect the quarterly impact from purchase accounting accretion to trend down over time with the 2017 full-year amount in the range of $180 million to $190 million, approximately 20% below the fourth quarter run rate. The quarterly impact will decline consistent with the phase that we experienced in the first quarter. We anticipate that non-interest income will be in the range of $2.3 billion $2.4 billion as we continue to drive growth from ongoing business activity and the acquisition.","Non-interest expense is expected to be in the range of $3.65 billion to $3.75 billion and once again does not include merger-related charges. With the incremental cost savings we expect to achieve from the acquisition, we're also anticipating higher levels of merger-related charges. We expect charges to increase proportionally from the regional $550 million estimate.","In 2017, net charge-offs should include - should continue to be below our targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points and provision should slightly exceed our level of charge-offs to provide for loan growth. To wrap up, this quarter was important to us. We've been committed to realizing the value of the acquisition to achieve the improvement in our operating performance and to continue to drive core growth.","And while we are not there yet, we are on the cost of delivering our performance within our long-term target range. We remain committed to our long-term financial targets as have shown at the bottom of this slide which include continuing to generate positive operating leverage, reducing our cash efficiency ratio to less than 60%, maintaining our moderate risk profile, and producing a return on tangible common equity of 13% or 15%.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to the operator for instructions in the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O'Connor","Good morning. I was wondering if you could just elaborate on the trust line actually, that was quite positive and just any more color in terms of what was driving that?","Don Kimble","We are continuing to invest in this area and reflected the growth in our investment services business along with the benefit of certain trading activity that occurred during the quarter as well and so we view that as a area of ongoing focus for us.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. And then - sorry it's been a very long and early days here, just in terms of progression on the purchase accounting accretion, I know you commented on that earlier but how should we think about that kind of invest this year and then looking ahead in terms of how quickly it burns off?","Don Kimble","Sure, what we've talked about is that from fourth quarter to first quarter we saw a decline from $58 million to $53 million. We would expect that same type of decline to occur on a quarterly basis going forward. We are down about $5 million a quarter and we always said for the full year, we expected the accretion to be in the $180 million to $190 million range and just to give you a perspective.","We would expect that same type of decline occur prospectively in quarters after that the remainder of 2017 as well.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Next we'll go to John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Samuel Ross","This is actually Sam Ross on for John. Thanks for taking the question, just had a couple of quick ones. The first is, I know you guys gave some color on your commercial portfolio based on the outstandings, and I'm just wondering if you can size it to your exposure to the retail industry specifically to the mall factor.","Don Kimble","One, it's a fairly small portfolio for the overall we referred questions about regional malls and also direct exposure to retail businesses. And I would say that our outstanding balances are less than $1 billion on that combined portfolio to fairly small ports overall and we've been very pleased with the performance so far.","Samuel Ross","Great, thanks. And then maybe just as a follow-up, just want to hear your general sense of both line utilization and maybe just borrower appetite, I know that some of your competitors talked about still borrowers being on the sidelines, I just wanted to get your updated thoughts on what you guys are seeing in the market?","Beth Mooney","Sam, this is Beth Mooney. We have seen line utilization remain relatively consistent now for several quarters and I would tell you that borrowers - what I would tell you the sentiment that we're hearing is canteen towards optimism but not yet translating into different behaviors or activities as it relates to their borrowing and banking activities but there is level of emerging confidence that I think if it is not with some level of fiscal stimulus, as well as other legislative and tax reform out of Washington that could translate into increased and heightened activity.","Samuel Ross","Good. Thank you for taking the questions.","Operator","And next go to Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","Scott Siefers","Good morning, guys. Don I was just wondering if you can expand a little on your commentary on the margin, I mean you gave the lock in the presentation which I appreciate but even within that backdrop, the core margin improvement was just a lot more substantial than I might have anticipated.","So I wonder if you could spend a second or so on how things came in relative to what you might have anticipated and whether it was simply deposit betas being effectively zero or just capturing so much of the asset side. How did things relative to what you would've thought. And then if you can just sort of expand on your outlook for the core margin more specifically as well.","Don Kimble","I would say that the core margin did come in stronger than what we would have expected back in January. I think it was driven by a number of different items. One, you mentioned the betas, and there were lower than what we had modeled, I would say that the impact of the December rate increase added about six basis points in margin to us just because of the betas were lower than expected.","We also had picked up about three basis points in margin related to lower levels of liquidity. We talked about some of the temporary or short-term deposits that left in the first quarter on average basis and we saw a corresponding reduction to our fed cash account and so that added about three basis points.","And so that really represents the 9 of the 13 basis point improvement. So that really was the other core activity and growth we saw on the balance sheet. We benefitted a little bit from higher yields on some the portfolio purchases that we made throughout the quarter and so those were helpful as well.","Going forward as we look at the margin, I would say that we will continue to see pressure as those purchase accounting accretion benefits amortized down so by declining about 5 million a quarter that caused about two basis points a quarter for us and so going forward we did say that we expect to see betas remain low for us and so we would expect in general that the margin to be relatively stable for the year reflecting the impact of both those items.","Scott Siefers","Okay. That\u2019s perfect. Thank you. And then separately now you've officially put out the quantification of the higher cost savings number, can you just spend second talking about where those - where you see the incremental potential for that additional $50 million.","Don Kimble","Sure, and as far as the additional part of the $50 million and Beth commentary she talked about the progress we made on certain systems conversions and space related occupancy with that cost and many of those are near completion and so we would expect to see those realized throughout the end of this year and first part of next year and so you will see ongoing reductions and computer processing\/vendor related expenses associated with the technology and then also lower occupancy costs from reducing some of our non-branch related expense.","Scott Siefers","All right, great. Thank you, guys very much.","Operator","And we'll go to Bob Ramsey with FBR. Please go ahead.","Bob Ramsey","Hi, good morning guys. Maybe just circle of the conversation on the core margin piece and we kind of exclude the purchase accounting. Is it fair to think that given the March fed increase you guys could see something of a similar magnitude in terms of benefit from the higher yield on assets, something maybe 8 to 10 basis points on lift?","Don Kimble","By overstating a little bit as you look at our core margin we talked earlier that about three basis points that came from the benefit of lower liquidity. We don't expect to see that continue to drive that kind of incremental benefit.","The other thing is that we talked about some of the lift on the investment portfolio and while we do believe that our new purchases will be at a higher rate than the roll-off of the cash flows from our existing portfolio, we're seeing rates per day about 20 to 30 basis points below where they would've been before for new purchases and so that lift would not be as significant but we do expect to get additional benefit from that March rate increase and we do believe the base will remain low for this next rate increase as well.","Bob Ramsey","Okay. I appreciate your guidance is predicated on only one more rate increase at the end of the year. If that rate increase came sooner or if there was an incremental increase, how much of a benefit do you estimate that could provide to the margin?","Don Kimble","At some point in time we are going to start to see beta start to pickup in and so I don't know when that is but as we talked about before this last rate increase that was about 6 basis points of margin. I think that subsequent rate increase I would expect to be slightly below what we are realizing from the past rate increases and so we will start to see that benefit get smaller in perspective rate moves.","Bob Ramsey","Okay. Fair enough. Shifting to I guess certainly clean up a question. Could you give me what the preferred dividend expense was at this quarter and then what you expected to be in the second quarter given the retirement of couple of classes of preferreds.","Don Kimble","Good question. It's $28 million for the first quarter and we would expect the second quarter to be $14 million and so each of those two preferred issuances is at about $7 million quarterly dividend.","Bob Ramsey","Perfect. And do you also have handy the number of share and price for share repurchases quarter and a get a dollar amount in total but a significant break out.","Don Kimble","We\u2019ve talked about $160 million and that was including net and growth shares and the total shares that were bought back I don't see that handy. Vern, do you have that in the table someplace? Okay, repurchase were 8,673,000 shares in the open market.","Bob Ramsey","Okay. That\u2019s perfect. And last question, just sort of thinking about the expense run rate is we head into the second quarter. I know you said you expect the remainder of the initial First Niagara cost savings to commence. I guess that takes us maybe about 15 million lower and seasonality should be I guess another tailwind theoretically in the second quarter. Any sense of kind of putting all together where we should be thinking about expenses next quarter?","Don Kimble","We really haven't provided second quarter guidance but I would say that we do expect to realize that remaining 50 million incremental per quarter. One thing to keep in mind is that we also have targeted $300 million in revenue synergies related to the acquisition we talked about incremental costs associated with that of about $100 million a year. And so you will start to see some investments being made to achieve this kind of revenue synergies as well.","Bob Ramsey","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Steven Alexopoulos","Good morning, everybody. I'm going to start on the expense saves, it's great to see already raising the expected cost phase in the First Niagara. And Beth on prior calls you had indicated that, the cost save commitment to the board or internally was above the 400 million level with cost saves in an estimated 450 million. Is that the level that you committed internally or could there be upside to the 450?","Beth Mooney","That is consistent with what we had committed internally into our board as we undertook the acquisition.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay, that's helpful. And Beth I want to follow-up on your comments that business customers are more optimistic but cautious right waiting to see what comes out of Washington. I don\u2019t know if you heard Huntington's call yesterday, but they were very bullish on loan growth really pointing to the Midwest, seeing an economic revival sold by American fee income in Washington. Are you seeing more activity today in your Midwest markets compared to the rest of the footprint?","Beth Mooney","We are seeing relatively well distributed activity. We do not see a pocket set of either underperforming or over performing, it has been a consistent level of activity across our franchise and markets. And will tell you as we look at our first quarter investment banking and debt placement fees. Clearly the debt capital market piece of our business is incredibly strong and so we do see some of our manufacturing base which would be included in the Midwest as else being an auto related - still being very strong.","But with our model we see dispersion of activity and obviously with our acquisition we have more bankers on the street than we've ever had in our eastern markets as well.","Steven Alexopoulos","Maybe if I could squeeze one more for Don. Relative to the 53 million of accretion reported, how much of that was scheduled and we think about the guidance you're giving us 180 million to 190 million, has it split out between scheduled accretion and what you think will be accelerated?","Don Kimble","We really haven't broken that out I would say that estimated in our projections a level of prepayment to be consistent with what we\u2019re experiencing so far. So we can see if we can dig out a little more detailed then just what the actual breakout of both stated and expected.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. I mean, well I\u2019m try gin to get a sense Don is, if there's a big cliff affect coming as we move into 2018 and 2019 on the schedule.","Don Kimble","What we would expect to see a continued trend as far as essentially about 20% reduction per year and so we're not forecasting any big drop off in 2018 compared to the 2017 level of decline.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. Got you. Thanks for all the color.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ken Zerbe","Just a question on the investment banking business. Obviously good quarter this quarter, when you think about going into second quarter, have industry conditions changed in terms of the outlook, obviously your fee guidance in total didn\u2019t really change that much but just wondering if things were unique in first quarter and different in second quarter - versus seasonality. Thanks.","Beth Mooney","No Ken, typically our first quarter on investment banking and debt placement fees is always a seasonally like quarter historically it tends to end strong in the fourth quarter. So the fact that this was a record quarter for this business is a good indication of core momentum in that business and as we go into the second quarter again assuming markets are constructive as they have been, our pipelines are definitely strong if we go into the second quarter.","Ken Zerbe","I guess does that imply the - of your 2.3 billion to 2.4 billion of fee guidance that you may end up \u2013 that's easier to hit the higher end of that range or there are other offsets?","Don Kimble","Well I would say Ken if you take a look at our first quarter level of non-interest income it's $577 million, so you annualize that and that's the very low end of that to $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion numbers. So we would expect growth in that line item along with other fee categories but I don't want to get too prescriptive as to where we would reside in that range at this point.","Ken Zerbe","Understood. And then just a question on capital, when you think buybacks and when we think about going into the end of '17 and '18. What's the right level of CE Tier 1 that you're comfortable holding? In any way you would like to target at least?","Don Kimble","We talked before about post the acquisition our CET 1 was 9.5% and for banks this still will go through the quantity a portion of the CE Tier process. Don't see a lot of this pass the quantitative portion without leasing 9% to Common Equity Tier 1.","And then so I think that kind of gives a range of where you would expect we were very pleased with the 9.5% level and can see that still been in a strong level of capital but we'll provide more color after the '17 CE Tier results are announced.","Ken Zerbe","All right, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy, RBC. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning, Beth. Good morning, Don. Beth, you talked about the loan growth being kind of spread out across your different franchises around the country. Can you share with us what you're seeing from the acquired? And you've done a very good job in describing the cost savings from the First Niagara transaction. Can you give us some detail on what the loan growth has been in that new - I know it's an existing market but from those new customers that you've acquired?","Beth Mooney","Yes Gerard. At this point in time we also did note that the deposit growth has been very strong and the attrition of clients has been less than we would have expected. So we felt like we are off to a very good start and I would tell you pipelines are building across loans, as well as payments opportunities and specifically with the mix of the balance sheet with First Niagara with a relatively large commercial real estate book, we are also seeing a variety of activities that can lead into our commercial mortgage banking which goes into our investment banking and debt placement fees.","So as we look across the board on those new million consumer and commercial clients, we do see momentum building and in the first quarter you\u2019re still not even fully six months passed the conversion date, and as you can well imagine going into the beginning of the year we were declaring ourselves back to [BAU] and we see those pipelines in that momentum building.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. And then Don, I think you talked about the revenue synergies from this transaction, can total about $300 million, and the cost to get that will be about $100 million. Again, the expenses are very clear, you shouldn't spent very easily in the press release and stuff. Where would you say are you on these revenue synergies? Are you 25% into them? 10%? What do you stand there?","Don Kimble","I would say we are still at very early stages at this point in time in some of the areas we have talked about our cash management and treasure management activities for our commercial customers and while the pipelines are very strong, we really haven't seen the full benefit kick-in from those yet.","Another area we talked about it is residential mortgage and we're starting to build out the commercial - the mortgage loan officers and other support areas for that business that we really haven't seen the revenues kick in for that yet either and we're early stages for that.","And so I would say that with a few exceptions, we are just really starting off that process and starting to see some of the early seats as far as the those opportunities.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. And then on that number, have you guys done any analysis to say that - to achieve the $300 million, what percentage of it would be coming from your new customers that use some of those services from competitors of yours? So you'll have to steal that business versus new growth because you are into - deeper into markets that are in Upstate New York.","Don Kimble","For the most part these are new product or services and so what we're picking up is a greater market share of that existing customer relationship. Keep in mind as for some of the commercial products and services, first we didn't have those capabilities to sell into their customers and they were hiring people from other banks that we were able to bring over the commercial loan relationships but not necessarily the treasury management capabilities. And so we believe that we can have success in driving that additional account acquisition.","On the residential mortgage side, that we really didn't have this is a true product offering throughout the key footprint and each one of those key customers probably have a mortgage loan, but we want to be a top of mind for when they look out to buy next house or when they want to refinance.","And so this is really getting to a point where we're successful in getting our share of the market as opposed to creating a new product or offering.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Lana Chan with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Lana Chan","Good morning. Just one to two follow up question done on the incremental 50 million of cost savings just thinking about how that flows through should we think about that being invested for force abilities revenue synergies initiatives?","Don Kimble","We look at them separate and independently and we might drive those cost savings from the bottom line and at the same time we do make investments to get additional revenues. And so they're not dependent on one another there are mutual exclusive but we\u2019re continuing to hold our team accountable in driving that $450 million cost savings target. Our board is fully accountable to drive that and we\u2019re also holding each other accountable to make sure we can drive that $300 million in revenue growth and recognize that there are some incremental cost associated with it.","Lana Chan","Okay. And just one quick follow-up also on the decline in sort of the excess and liquidity this quarter some of that was you said deliberate decline and some of the commercial deposits. How should we think about that going forward in terms of some of the detail growth is obviously going to come back so net-net for the margin going forward?","Don Kimble","I would say that are assumption is these levels remain consistent with where they're at today.","Lana Chan","Okay.","Don Kimble","And you wouldn\u2019t see a lot of the other changes in the deposit balances or the cash position prospectively.","Lana Chan","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Next we'll go to Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.","Marty Mosby","Thanks Don I want to ask you little bit about $3 paying building allowance and the purchase account accretion. When you\u2019re starting to convert these loans over you have to kind of take the accounting and it just the way that they forces will do this is crazy but you\u2019ve to take it from netting against the loan so actually building the allowance.","It was a pretty nice $40 million difference between the PAA and the building allowance this particular quarter. So just wanted to kind of get your thoughts on how those two things should be balancing out.","Don Kimble","Good question I would say that the kind have some new answers to it essentially what we do on a quarterly basis is look at our level of reserves it would be required on that purchase portfolio and see how that compares to the discomfort that remains. And so at some point in time we\u2019ll have to start building reserves in connection with that. I would say that as those loans mature and are originated in a new form that were required to book reserves on that.","What we've talked about externally is that we think that the average loan life is about four years and so over that four years that allowance will be growing from the 1% to say about 120, 125. And so you will see a build in the reserve prospectively but we don't expected to be lumpy at this point in time.","Bill Hartmann","And then to a degree that there was a net positive I kind of just think of that as accelerating the benefits and as that kind of roles off with that $5 million dollars per quarter you\u2019re going to generate more synergies, more incremental revenues. And actually the offset is it, because this upfront benefit but then you're really generating the core business to replace that and more as you move forward.","Marty Mosby","It\u2019s a good way to look at it.","Don Kimble","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.","Saul Martinez","Hi good morning thanks for taking my question. Just I guess follow up on net interest income net interest margins and thinking through the guidance so you up the guidance at 37, 38 given what you did and once you kind of imply the run rate of at the low end $925 million I think at the high end $960 million this quarter obviously we\u2019re 929 on the NIIE even considering the incremental purchase accounting accretion of 5 million per year it seems like there's maybe a bit of conservatism built into that number. I guess question is it fair to say that and is it fair to think that you\u2019ll likely be closer to the higher end of that range?","Don Kimble","I would say that if you take a look at our 929 this quarter and multiple times four you\u2019re still at the low end of that 37 or 38 range as far as our full year guidance. We do say and expect that that purchase accounting accretion will decrease by $5 million a quarter. And so that 180 to 190 level for the entire year is below that first quarter level of $53 million.","And so it does create a hurdle for us to grow through. The question will be is what kind of betas will exist going forward for the market rate increase and for the rate increase that we assumed at the end of the year and then beyond that it\u2019s just making sure we continue to grow the asset base and we would expect to have net interest income grow from that.","So again the variables on margin tend to be more than the impact of the betas and overall liquidity position of the variable on net interest income tend to process more on what we will see from changes in deposit rates with future rate increases.","Saul Martinez","Okay. No, that\u2019s helpful. And then I guess more specific questions that project if you address this say gone on late but did you have any benefit at all from any tax benefit this quarter at all from restricted stock units or options?","Don Kimble","Yes, tax benefit was there so if look and see tax rate absent the merger related charges I think it was 24.8% we do guide for a range of 25% to 27% for the full year. And so there was back in the current quarter from that.","Saul Martinez","Okay. So we can just take 24.8 to a more normalize rate and that\u2019s kind of the benefit you got from it this quarter?","Don Kimble","That's correct, yes.","Saul Martinez","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Ken Usdin with Jeffries. Please go ahead. And we will move on to Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead","Geoffrey Elliott","Good morning, thank you for taking the question. It seems like on the first Niagara deal it sounds that you\u2019re pretty happy with how things are going you increased the expenses target to the 450 million given that you now quite the way through integration that's one how do you think about future M&A?","Beth Mooney","This is Beth and I would say that our work is not yet done and I think our priorities are clear there is additional work to realize and deliver all the cost savings we\u2019ve always said while not in our initial projections that we shared with the street we announced the transaction that the revenue synergies were significant and a real opportunity for us and so I would tell you that we do not yet believe our shareholders have realized the full value and benefit of this acquisition and our priorities and our focus are very, very clear.","Geoffrey Elliott","And so as opportunities come up now does that mean you have to kind of turn away from them and focus on this or how long does it take until you can start to locate something else?","Beth Mooney","No, as we have said we have everything we need to be successful between our business model our geographies our capabilities and so as we look at the prospects for TNR our commitment on our long-term financial targets and our operating performance we have what we need to be successful and meet the goals and objectives that we have outlined to the street First Niagara has been instrumental as we said in our ability to achieve some of the financial metrics and performance particularly in return on tangible common equity and efficiency ratio so it\u2019s been very beneficial but as a company Key is well positioned in the market to succeed.","Geoffrey Elliott","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin Reevey with DA Davidson. Please go ahead.","Kevin Reevey","Good morning. I know of your loan book as a small percentage of your loan portfolio can you talk about the credit trends you've seen in that book and the most recent quarter?","Don Kimble","I am sorry which book did you say.","Kevin Reevey","The auto loan book.","Don Kimble","I am sorry, yes, I would say our loan book has continued to perform well and delinquency levels have maintained very well and keep in mind that our auto loan book is what I refer to a super prime and FICO scores is north of 750 on average and we\u2019re focused on making sure that we extend credit to the borrowers that aren\u2019t reliant on the value of the collateral to get our money back and are more focused on their capability that to repay and that has continued to do well for us.","Kevin Reevey","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we have a question from Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Peter Winter","Good morning I was just curious you talked about how borrower sentiment was very positive not translating into loan growth. But can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of the loan pipelines?","Beth Mooney","Yes Peter, this is Beth I would tell you that we've always talked over the last couple years about borrowers being cautiously optimistic and I would say they have definitely chanted towards to optimism I do see our pipelines are up year-over-year and they are very strong going into the second quarter you add to that that we have also increased our sales force and our client base with First Niagara.","So as we go into the balance of the year, we have not only improving sentiment that likely is going to translate into increased activity but we also have another level for growth in terms of the acquisition of First Niagara, those relationship managers and that client base. So prospectively we feel good about loan growth.","Don Kimble","Peter, this is Don. One other thing to add and Beth had highlighted this earlier as well, that keep in mind too for the first quarter for us but we had our record first quarter as far as investment banking debt placement fees. And the strength is really coming from our commercial real estate and loan syndication areas and we are actually retaining a little bit less on our balance sheet than what we normally would based on the availability of the markets reporting those areas.","And so that results in a little bit slower loan growth for us but still represents the strength as far as our ability to generate capital for our customers.","Peter Winter","Just a quick follow-up, just going back to the expense guidance with the additional 50 million expenses. Would you think that it would come in more towards the lower end of the range or is it a function of what happens on the revenue front that maybe makes you come in more towards the middle higher rent just given the additional cost saves now?","Don Kimble","Peter you guys are just trying to pin me down to the actual number you're putting in your models here, but\u2026","Peter Winter","Take the low end or high end of the range.","Don Kimble","What I would offer up for that is if you look at the incremental $50 million. We talked about those synergies really been achieved later in 2017 and early 2018 and so the impact on the full-year 2017 won't be that significant for that incremental $50 million and so while we do believe it's real, we are able to hold ourselves accountable to achieving that but that really doesn't impact the outlook as much you might expect.","Peter Winter","Okay, thanks very much and very good quarter.","Operator","And with no further questions, I'll turn it back to you Ms. Mooney for any closing remarks.","Beth Mooney","Again, we thank you for taking time from your schedule to participate in our call today. If you have any follow-up questions, you can direct them to our Investor Relations team at 216-689-4221. And that concludes our remarks for today.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Ms. Beth Mooney. Please go ahead.","Beth E. Mooney","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to KeyCorp's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me for today's presentation is Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer. And available for the Q&A portion of the call are the leaders of Key Corporate Bank and Key Community Bank, Chris Gorman and Bill Koehler. Also joining us for the Q&A discussion are our Chief Risk Officer, Bill Hartmann; and our Treasurer, Joe Vayda.","Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments, as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call.","Turning to Slide 3. Our results reflect another quarter of improved performance as we had positive trends in core revenue and expenses, and our credit quality improved to levels we haven't seen since 2007. We also continue to execute on our capital priorities. Revenue benefited from solid loan growth, driven by an 11% increase from the prior year in commercial, financial and agricultural loans, as well as improved trends in several of our fee-based businesses.","Importantly, we continue to have success in acquiring and expanding relationships. For example, in our corporate investment banking and real estate areas, we have generated 21% more revenue from new clients year-to-date versus the same period in 2012, reflecting our more targeted approach and the benefits of our distinctive business model.","As you have seen over the past several quarters, this model has allowed us to capitalize on revenue opportunities. Whether through execution in the capital markets when conditions are favorable or by offering on balance sheet alternatives, our commitment remains the same: to do what's right for our clients.","We also continue to invest in our businesses, as well as address areas that do not fit our relationship strategy. In this quarter, we have examples of both. As announced, we completed our commercial real estate servicing acquisition. This brought in over $1 billion in low-cost escrow deposits and further leverages our existing platform. We are now the third largest servicer of commercial and multifamily loans and the fifth largest special servicer of CMBS in the United States.","The sale of Victory Capital Management was also completed on July 31, resulting in an after-tax gain of $92 million. Additional gain may be realized as the profits of receiving client consent continues through January of 2014.","We also made good progress on expenses this quarter. Importantly, we met our announced expense target that we set in June of 2012 to achieve annualized savings of $200 million. This reflects the dedication and hard work of our entire team to make some difficult choices, to reduce costs and make us a more efficient company.","As a result, noninterest expense, excluding efficiency-related charges, was down 4% from the prior year. And as Don will discuss, our adjusted cash efficiency ratio was 64% this quarter, at the upper end of our near-term goal of 60% to 65%. Although this is an important milestone for us, it is not an endpoint. This is now part of our culture, and we are already working to improve efficiency and productivity by identifying new opportunities to grow revenue and reduce and variabilize our expenses.","I'll finish with a couple of comments on capital. During the third quarter, we repurchased $198 million in common shares as we continue to execute on our current repurchase authorization, and our Tier 1 common ratio remained above 11%. We will remain disciplined in the way we manage our strong capital position and stay consistent with our stated priorities of supporting organic growth, dividend, share repurchase and opportunistic growth.","Overall, it was a very good quarter for Key, and it positions us well through the end of the year and as we move into 2014. We are optimistic that progress is being made in Washington, and we continue to encourage our leaders to work together to find a solution that is in the best interest of our country. It would be regrettable to reverse the progress we've made in the recovery, as well as the progress we've made to regain client, investor and global confidence in our financial system.","However, at Key, our focus remains the same and that is to execute on our business model, drive and invest for growth, become more efficient and productive and to be disciplined in the way we manage our capital.","Now let me turn the presentation over to Don for some details on our third quarter results. Don?","Donald R. Kimble","Thank you, Beth. Slide 5 provides highlights from the company's third quarter 2013 results. This morning, we reported net income from continuing operations of $0.25 per common share for the third quarter, compared to $0.21 for the second quarter of 2013 and $0.22 for the third quarter of 2012. I'll cover many of these results in my remarks later, so let's turn on to Slide 6.","Third quarter results include a number of significant items, which have been detailed for you on this slide. First, results reflect the impact of early termination of leveraged leases. These transactions reduced net interest income by $8 million and increase noninterest income by $23 million, resulting in a net gain of $15 million or $0.02 per share. As with the prior lease terminations, the gains associated with these transactions were not taxable.","The total tax impact of leveraged lease terminations was $13 million or an incremental $0.01 per common share. This lowered our tax rate by about 4% this quarter. I would expect our tax rate to return to a more normal level next year in the range of 26% to 28% on a GAAP basis.","Next, we incurred $41 million or $0.03 per share of costs associated with our efficiency initiative, including pension settlements this quarter. The pension settlement of $25 million recorded as lump sum distributions exceeded a threshold that triggered the recognition of a curtailment loss. While we could have additional settlement losses in the fourth quarter, it is not expected to repeat in 2014.","Within discontinued operations, we also realized a pretax gain of $146 million from the sale of Victory. After tax, this gain equated to $92 million with the cash portion totaling to $72 million. Importantly, this represents the amount of the gain we have realized to date. And as Beth pointed out, an additional gain may be realized resulting from client consents received through January of 2014.","Also included in discontinued operations, we recorded an after-tax charge of $48 million related to the fair value of loans and securities in Key's 10 education loan securitization trusts. This charge resulted from additional market information about projected trends for default and recovery rates that became available during the quarter. Based on this information and Key's internal analysis, certain assumptions related to valuing the loans in these securitization trusts were adjusted.","Turning on to Slide 7. Average total loans for the third quarter were up $575 million or an annualized 4%, compared to the second quarter of 2013 and up $2.6 billion or 5% compared to the year ago quarter. Loan growth continues to benefit from Key's focus on targeted segments and the capabilities we're able to provide commercial clients. Our loan growth outpaced industry measures in the third quarter and the quality of our loan originations continues to be high and consistent with our moderate risk profile. While clients remain cautious, our outlook for loan growth remains consistent with our prior guidance of mid-single digit year-over-year growth driven by CF&A lending.","Continuing on to Slide 8. From the liability side of the balance sheet, average deposits, excluding foreign branch balances, were up $494 million from the second quarter and up $3.4 billion from 1 year ago. Deposit growth from both the prior quarter and year ago quarter was primarily due to an increase in demand in interest-bearing commercial deposits and higher escrow balances from Key's recent commercial real estate servicing acquisition. Over the past year, our mix of deposits has significantly changed with CDs declining and low-cost transaction accounts increasing 10%. As a result, year-over-year deposit costs declined from 38 to 22 basis points.","Turning on to Slide 9. Our taxable equivalent net interest income was $584 million for the third quarter, compared to $586 million for the second quarter and $578 million for the third quarter 1 year ago. Results in both the third quarter 2013 and the prior year reflect the impact of early termination of leveraged leases. These transactions reduced net interest income by $8 million in the third quarter of this year and by $13 million in the third quarter of 2012. Excluding the impact of leveraged lease terminations, net interest income in the third quarter of this year would be slightly higher than a year ago period and 4% higher than the second quarter on an annualized basis.","For the third quarter, the company's net interest margin was 3.11% or 3.15% when adjusted for the 4 basis point negative impact of the leveraged lease terminations. This compares to 3.13% for the second quarter. As you can see on this slide, the net interest margin this quarter was negatively impacted by lower earning asset yields, offset by lower funding costs. Over the next couple of quarters, we expect the net interest margin to be relatively stable to the reported third quarter level with potential downward pressure dependent on levels of liquidity.","We also maintained our modest asset-sensitive position. Importantly, the use of interest rate swaps provides us with the flexibility to manage and quickly adjust our rate risk position.","While Key, along with other asset-sensitive banks, generally benefit from a rise in both short-term and long-term rates, the duration and characteristics of Key's loan and investment portfolio position us to realize more benefit from a rise in the shorter end of the yield curve. We anticipate for the next few quarters, loan growth will exceed deposit growth, which should result in a relatively stable net interest income.","Slide 10 shows a summary of noninterest income, which accounts for approximately 44% of our total revenues. Noninterest income in the third quarter was $459 million, up from $429 million in the second quarter, but below the $518 million in the third quarter of last year. Importantly, the third quarter of 2012 included gains of $54 million associated with the redemption of trust preferred securities. As I mentioned previously, we had leveraged lease terminations in both the third quarter of 2013 and the prior year, which led to the gain of $23 million in the third quarter of this year and $39 million in the prior year. Adjusting for gains from the trust preferred securities and the leveraged lease terminations, noninterest income in the third quarter was up 3% from the prior year and up 7% analyzed from the prior quarter.","Many of our core fee income categories have shown strength through the third quarter. Investment banking and debt placement fees continue to grow and are up 29% on a rolling 4-quarter average basis as we continue to do more business with our commercial clients and win market share. Corporate services is also -- have also performed well, up 13% from the prior year. This includes fees from letters of credit, foreign exchange and derivative trading, among others. And cards and payments income is up 16% compared to the same period 1 year ago, reflecting our investment in and our focus on payment products, including our reentry in the credit cards during the third quarter of last year.","Turning to Slide 11. Our noninterest expense for the third quarter was $716 million, including $41 million in charges related to the efficiency initiative and pension settlement. As discussed earlier, the $25 million pension settlement was triggered by high levels of lump sum distributions from the plan. While we may have additional settlement losses in the fourth quarter, we do not expect this to repeat in 2014. Adjusting for these charges, expenses were down 4% from the prior year and up slightly from the prior quarter as we increased marketing expenses related to our client acquisition and borrowing campaigns.","During the quarter, we closed 8 more branches and continued with other efficiency initiative implementation plans. As Beth commented earlier, we achieved our target by capturing $207 million in annual expense savings. We plan to provide a final count of our cost savings associated with our efficiency initiative when we announce our full year results in January.","Going forward from that point, the savings from our continuous improvement efforts will be embedded within our expense run rate and will help drive our efficiency ratio lower. We have made a lot of progress over the last 5 to 6 quarters, but there still is a lot more we can do to improve our overall productivity.","Turning to Slide 12. Our net charge-offs declined to $37 million or 28 basis points of average loans in the third quarter. This continues to be below our targeted range and is the lowest level since the first quarter of 2007. You may recall that in the third quarter of 2012, Key, along with other banks, received updated regulatory guidance on consumer loans, which is -- which is what led to elevated charge-offs in the year ago quarter. Adjusting for this guidance, net charge-offs were still down by 42% from the prior year.","Total commercial loan net charge-offs this quarter remained low at 5 basis points of average loans, and recoveries were up $12 million or 41% from the prior quarter. The breakdown of asset quality by loan portfolio is shown on Slide 19 in the Appendix.","At September 30, 2013, our reserve for loan losses represented 1.62% of period-end loans and 160% coverage of our nonperforming loans. We anticipate that net charge-offs will remain at or below the lower end of our targeted range for the next few quarters and for provision expense to be near the same level.","Turning to Slide 13. Our tangible common equity ratio estimated -- and estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio both remained strong, at September 30, at 9.93% and 11.11%, respectively. Earlier in the quarter, regulators approved the final rule for implementing the Basel III regulatory capital standards. The mandatory compliance day for Key begins in January of 2015 with transitional provisions extending to January of 2019. Our current estimates of Tier 1 common equity as calculated under the final rule was 10.6%, which exceeds the fully phased-in minimum requirement.","As Beth mentioned, during the third quarter, we also repurchased $198 million of shares of our common stock. This amount includes repurchases related to the cash portion of the net after-tax gain from the sale of Victory.","Moving on to Slide 14. This is a summary of our near-term outlook and expectations, which are generally consistent with our prior guidance and assume an orderly and timely resolution of current issues in Washington. As I stated earlier, we expect average loans to continue to grow year-over-year in the mid-single-digit range and our net interest margin to remain relatively stable with our reported level this quarter.","Our net interest margin may be impacted further by liquidity levels and competitive and\/or economic environment.","Revenue trends, over time, should also benefit from continued growth in our fee-based businesses.","We continue to anticipate expenses in the range of $680 million to $700 million in the fourth quarter, and remain committed to achieving a cash efficiency ratio of 60% to 65%. While i've reached our $200 million expense savings target, we will continue to identify additional savings opportunities. And it's important to keep in mind that there is variability in our expense levels related to items such as incentive payouts, tide to production, reserves for unfunded loan commitments and seasonal factors.","Credit quality should remain a good story with net charge-offs at or below our targeted range of 60 -- 40 to 60 basis points. And we expect our loan loss provision to be near the same level of net charge-offs.","And finally, capital management will remain a priority, including continuing to execute on our remaining share repurchase authorization of $187 million.","With that, I'll close and turn the call back over to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of our call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","In terms of the efficiency initiative with you guys now being above the $200 million and you're now in your targeted range, moving forward, how much do you think is left to drive additional improvements in the efficiency ratio? Could there be another $50 million? $100 million? Or is that too aggressive given what you've already realized?","Donald R. Kimble","This is Don, and I'll go ahead and take the first crack at that. As far as the additional expense savings, we will continue to target areas of opportunity. We're going to be much more focused on driving positive operating leverage, which will drive us to the lower end of that near-term target of 60% to 65%. We think that's appropriate for now that we clearly will identify specific areas. But right now, we're not planning on having any named initiatives or named programs that would target a specific dollar amount.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And maybe just one follow-up, Don. You guys had good C&I loan growth in the quarter where other banks are seeing declines or talking about borrowers being very cautious. What are you seeing on the pipeline? And do you expect strong C&I to continue through year end?","Christopher Marrott Gorman","Steve, it's Chris Gorman here. We -- our pipelines look pretty good. As we look forward, both on the fee side and on the loan side and we compare kind of where we are year-over-year where we were this time last year, we feel good about it. And we think it's a direct result of being pretty focused about and disciplined about who we're targeting doing business with. So as you know, we're not necessarily focused necessarily in growing loans. What we're focused on is growing clients and expanding relationships. And as we look at the pipelines that have come out of that, we feel pretty good about it.","William R. Koehler","Steve, this is Bill. On the commercial side, we would say -- I would say something similar. We have seen continued moderate improvement in the consumer, which has helped us over the past few quarters as our consumer loan volumes continue to improve.","Operator","And we'll go next to Steve Scinicariello with UBS.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just want to get some color on some of the kind of productivity enhancements that you guys are going to try to start working on and have been working on, but especially as we look into 2014 and what that might mean in terms of kind of revenue growth initiatives as well?","Beth E. Mooney","Steve, this is Beth Mooney. I will go ahead and give a couple thoughts in that regard. We have been definitely thinking about, and as we've talked about, balancing our ability to become more efficient and productive with our ability to invest and support revenue growth, which is incredibly important that we do both. So as we look into 2014, we see opportunities, as Don outlined, to continue to become more cost effective and work at additional efficiency. But we also look at opportunities to invest in additional client-facing people and relationship managers as we see success in our businesses, as we are growing CF&A loans. So we continue to think we can invest to acquire and deepen relationships. We've talked about technology as an enabler and making sure that we remain competitive within mobile and digital, supported by further branch rationalization and continuing to make sure our consumer segments are more efficient. We also see opportunity to look at potentially adding and expanding to our product capability such as credit cards and payments. And you've seen us do a number of things this year, both through the commercial real estate servicing as well as the exit of Victory, that shows that we're very much trying to keep within our business model of a relationship strategy that we believe is differentiated and pull both levers of investing and creating more productivity for revenue, as well as becoming a more efficient and cost-productive company.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That's perfect. And then if you could -- as you look forward into 2014, what might some of your priorities be to accomplish by the end of that year?","Beth E. Mooney","Priorities to accomplish by the end of the year, I would tell you, is, I think, as we talked about, is the continuing efficiency and productivity both of our income statement, as well as our balance sheet. We've talked about the mix of assets and our opportunities within our cost of liabilities. We also think we could become more efficient within our operations. And we also want to make sure we invest in our businesses for growth and remain very disciplined in capital. We think that we've had a good opportunity this year to return capital to our shareholders, as well as at the margin have a few opportunities to utilize capital and enhance our capabilities and products.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just want to clarify. On the termination of the leveraged leases, Slide 6, you have the impact of $15 million after-tax. But in the footnote, and I think you referenced this, Don, the $13 million of tax benefit. Should we be adding those numbers up to think about the total impacts of $28 million of, I guess, technically, onetime gain related to the leveraged leases?","Donald R. Kimble","That's an accurate description, Ken. Yes, the $13 million is incremental. It's not necessarily just specific to that transaction, but as a result of it. So you're right.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then just a follow-up question. In terms of your excess liquidity, I was a little surprised when you were talking about the NIM or the downward pressure due to excess liquidity. I'm kind of curious what your expectations or your outlook is for your liquidity position. Like do you expect to get much more? Is there something that we don't know about that would drive up your excess?","Donald R. Kimble","Yes, Ken, that's a great question. I think in this environment, we're not exactly sure what might happen as far as changes that could impact that. But right now, our guidance is based on our loan growth slightly exceeding our deposit growth. But there are a couple of things that could impact that. That if the economy slows, we could see less loan growth. We could also see greater inflows to Key. And one thing to keep in mind, too, that is part of our commercial real estate servicing business that while we have a very stable base of deposits there, there might be temporary flows that could result in increases to overall liquidity position, which could impact our net interest margin percentage, but not have a significant impact on the overall net interest income.","Operator","And we'll go next to Bob Ramsey with FBR.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","It's maybe a silly question, but could you explain to me sort of what it is that triggers the early termination of leveraged leases? Is this basically like a loan prepayment with prepayment penalty income? Or what is it exactly?","Donald R. Kimble","Yes, this is customer driven and would allow, similar to what you said, as far as an early prepayment. But it's not necessarily a penalty that's triggered there. It's just the way that the revenues are recognized. And by the early termination, there are certain things that are accelerated as far as the recognition.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And I guess, the question about tax benefit there was answered. But even when I sort of adjust that $13 million out, looks like your tax rate was 24%, 25%, kind of below what you're expecting for next year. I'm curious what the other factors are there this quarter for tax rate? And then how you're thinking about the tax rate in the fourth quarter?","Donald R. Kimble","Yes, as far as next year, you're right. We're providing guidance of 26% to 28%. That's about where we were on a GAAP basis through the second quarter that we said that this transaction had an impact of about 4 percentage points. And this was a primary adjustment that occurred. But the remaining adjustments occurred from essentially recognition of additional tax credits that were taken in the third quarter. So we do believe the core rate is 26% to 28%. And fourth quarter should be slightly higher than the third quarter, but in line with the full year expectation.","Operator","And we'll go next to Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My first question is on your comment and your ability to flex your interest rate risk position through the use of swaps. And is there any way that you can help us think about the puts and takes of the swap income that you could potentially give up in exchange for x percent more of asset sensitivity?","Donald R. Kimble","Great question, Erika. As far as the swaps, we note that we have about $14 billion worth of swaps, about $9 billion of which we use to manage our overall rate risk position. If we increase or decrease that, we tend to have a fairly short average life for those swaps than the 2- to 3-year time period. And so the average spread there is about 70 basis points. So for every $1 billion of swaps, you would be giving up 70 basis points of future income associated with that swaps on a near-term basis. But it does help reduce our over -- increase, excuse me, our overall asset sensitivity. And Joe, it's about 0.5 point for every $1 billion? What's the impact there?","Joseph M. Vayda","That sounds about right. Erika, the way to think about it is simply take the current swap curve and roughly the 2- to 3-year maturity off of short-term LIBOR and that differential in spread times whatever volume you want to use is a good proxy for an income differential.","Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I see, okay. And just my second follow-up question is as -- clearly, you are well in excess of all the regulatory capital hurdles that you need to adhere to. As you prepare for the CCAR next year, do you expect a backup in long rates to be included in the severely adverse case? And have you modeled your capital return and capital return potential asks for more stringent interest rate risk tests on the bond portfolio?","Donald R. Kimble","Last year's part of the CCAR process, the -- one of the stress scenarios did assume a rate increase to see what the impact would be on your bond portfolio from that. One of the benefits we have of being a CCAR bank, but not being a [indiscernible] is the ability to go ahead and opt in or out associated with the OCI impact to capital. And so even though it could have an impact on TCE, we have the flexibility up through the first quarter of '15 to make the determination as to whether or not we want to include or exclude that impact. And I think that provides us with a little bit more cushion than many of the larger banks might have to deal with.","Beth E. Mooney","And I would just add, Erika, too, that we have talked in the past that our portfolio is also intentionally very short, average duration of around 3.6 years. And so when you look at our mix of investments that are in that portfolio, we have what I would call less risk and less extension risk than many other portfolio.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Bryan Batory - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","This is actually Bryan Batory from Ken's team. My first question is on the other fee line. So that was down $2 million quarter-over-quarter, which looked a little bit light considering the commercial servicing deal closed at the end of 2Q. Can you just comment on if there's anything noncore that ran through that line this quarter? And what the pickup from the commercial servicing deal was in the third quarter?","Donald R. Kimble","We've not provided a lot of detail as far as the fee income impact from the commercial servicing deal. There are increased fees that we do receive, but part of the real benefit really is coming from the $1 billion in additional core deposits we're getting from that relationship. As far as the other income category, there really aren't any other significant large unusual items going through this quarter, but we did have some small incremental gains last quarter. But I would suggest that, that is more of an ongoing level at the current quarter amount.","Bryan Batory - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And my next question is for Chris. You mentioned that pipelines, both for commercial fees and loans, were pretty -- in pretty good shape. But I'm just wondering if you've seen any change in customer appetite to drawing on lines or whatnot over the past couple of weeks just in light of what's going on in D.C.?","Christopher Marrott Gorman","Bryan, what we've seen over the last couple of weeks has been fairly consistent. I think most of our clients have been very cautious. I think there's been a lot of uncertainty. We've seen a willingness, interestingly enough, to look at strategic alternatives, but not really a willingness to invest in people or property, plant and equipment. And I would say that is unchanged over the last couple of weeks. The only new data point I have for you recently, as I know a couple of our clients that wanted to roll over CP, 30-day CP, and this is specifically yesterday, they could have rolled 45, but they couldn't roll 30-day. But I am not seeing our clients really adjust yet to some of the uncertainty that's been generated in Washington.","Operator","And we'll go next to Keith Murray with ISI Financial.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just on the fourth quarter expenses. So the core number for the third quarter looked like around $675 million. You mentioned that marketing was up in the quarter. When we think about the guidance for the fourth quarter that you gave us, what's the right core number? I know there'll be noise in there related to efficiency, et cetera, but what's the right way to think about the core?","Donald R. Kimble","Consistent with our guidance last quarter, that $680 million to $700 million does include onetime transition or severance type of costs. And so we had estimated that somewhere in the $15 million to $20 million range. And so that would be included in that $680 million to $700 million.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just conceptually, if you looked at your ROA target this quarter, you guys are sort of right in the middle of the range, the 100 to 125. Do you think about the ROE, the annualized sort of $0.26 or so that you're in this quarter to around a 9% or so ROE? If you think about the future and if you get up to the 125 basis point target, let's say, from an ROE point of view, how much upside do you see? Do you feel like you have to grow the overall balance sheet to sort of increase leverage to get the ROE to a more meaningful target range? I know it's tough. Given the CCAR, you probably won't be able to return over 100% of net income, so capital will grow. Just trying to get a framework of how you guys think about the ROE.","Donald R. Kimble","No, I think that you hit on some of the challenges there. And I don't know that we want to speculate as to what kind of additional leverage can we get off the balance sheet. We do believe that our balance sheet can become more efficient than it is today. Our loan-to-deposit ratio is in the low 80% type of range and it's 82% or 83% and our target there is 90% to 100%. And so by making the balance sheet more efficient, it should drive a stronger margin for us. Combine that with the benefits from increased interest rates, we think that 1.25% type of ROA range should increase, reflecting the impact of interest rates and it'll allow us to get a stronger return on equity.","Operator","We'll go next to Terry McEvoy with Oppenheimer.","Terence J. McEvoy - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","The strength in the investment banking and debt placement fees, could you talk about what industry verticals those have been coming from? And would those be in similar targeted segments as the commercial bank? What I'm getting at is are you continuing to see a better link between both those parts of Key and generating both loans and now a nice fee income as well?","Christopher Marrott Gorman","Terry, it's Chris. Clearly, the growth that we've enjoyed has come specifically from our targeting of certain industries. And you look at things like real estate, our industrial business, our growing health care business, we've actually had a lot of lift in our consumer and our energy business. So it's really very focused in the areas that we're in. And that's where our pipelines are as well. Now as it relates to our coordination with the community bank, there similarly we are focusing where we're really strong in those industry groups. And so those trends we looked to continue as well.","Terence J. McEvoy - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And just as a follow-up. Part of the third quarter loan growth, your strength in loan growth, was home equity, which is somewhat seasonal. I think you hinted that in the press release. Would you expect to see some slowing in Q4 if home equity does not replicate the growth they had in Q3?","William R. Koehler","So Terry, this is Bill. We would see home equity slowing down a little bit into the fourth quarter. We have seen -- we're pleased that our home equity loan origination extended into the summer longer that it has in the past. And we think that is a good indication that, as I said earlier, the consumer is getting stronger. And we think that's good for the business and the economy long term, but the fourth quarter is always slower.","Operator","We'll go next to the Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","A question I have is regarding the capital ratios. Obviously, your Basel III Tier 1 common ratio is very strong with the estimate. Some of the banks, JPMorgan and Citi, in particular, had given us their level that they expect to manage that, which in their cases, will be 10%, 10.5%. Do you guys have a level where you want to carry that Basel III Tier 1 common ratio that you want to manage that you could give to us?","Donald R. Kimble","This is Don. And I would just like to add to that, that we are one step further as far as being able to define what we believe is the appropriate capital level with the release of the final rules. We think a more appropriate time period for us to get more specific as far as our operating range would be after this next year's CCAR process and making sure that we have a full appreciation for what to expect prospectively on the impact in the capital requirements. Unlike the large banks that you had referenced, it's not as clear to us as far as what kind of capital buffer would be required for an organization that's in the lower end of the CCAR buckets. And we want to make sure that we can fully assess the impact of the stress testing and base the capital requirements with the results from that next year.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So once you have confidence on what the numbers that you're going to be expected to carry, all the regional banks, not just you guys, you guys will disclose to us at some point in the future where you're comfortable relative to those requirements?","Donald R. Kimble","It would be our expectation to disclose that at some point down the road. And I wouldn't suggest that being in January of next year, but I think it will be appropriate for us to establish a target there, I guess.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes, okay. And then on the loan growth. You guys had obviously nice year-over-year loan growth, double digit. But the sequential annualized number, as you pointed out, has slowed down. Is there been a slowdown with your customers in loan demand? Or what's caused the slowdown on an annualized basis relative to that year-over-year basis number that you gave us?","William R. Koehler","Gerard, this is Bill. We've had -- the comments that were made earlier by Chris about our clients being a little more cautious and watching the developments and watching -- looking for more visibility with respect to tax and health care policy, all those things contribute to an environment where our clients are less comfortable investing, especially in people. So we have seen that and I would say that has contributed to some of the slowing down in the sequential growth.","Beth E. Mooney","And Gerard, I would just add that I think it's a little bit, in some ways, a tale of 2 cities, that if you look at it by segment in terms of the size of the company, I think the smaller businesses to midsized businesses, which would be typically in our Community Bank, have been more cautious than what we have seen in some of our targeted clients that's in the Corporate Bank.","Operator","And we'll go next to Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Tom Hennessy - CLSA Limited, Research Division","This is Tom in for Mike. My first question's related to just generally on loans, and I may have missed this. Did you see any utilization rate changes on the commercial side? And then on the CRE side, just incremental commentary. The competition's picked up there. What are you seeing and what are you targeting?","Christopher Marrott Gorman","So Tom, it's Chris Gorman. A couple of things. First of all, with respect to utilization, utilization picked up slightly quarter-over-quarter. But in general, there has not been any market change in utilization for some time x some activity that occurred late last year that was tax driven. So that's point one. With respect to what's going on in the real estate market, we feel like we have a pretty good eye on what's going on in real estate. We have generated -- we've actually generated fundings of about $30.5 billion this year and only about 13% actually did we put on our balance sheet. So our business model is such that we sort of see both the syndication market, we see what's going on in the equity market, the debt market, and of course, the commercial mortgage banking business. There is no question that, as it is across-the-board, competition has increased. And we've seen some compression of spreads both in the real estate business, and frankly, across all businesses. But for us and our approach where we're really focused on owners of real estate and we're focused on mid-cap REITs, we see plenty of opportunity as we look forward.","Tom Hennessy - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Excellent, that helps a lot. And then just as my -- as a follow-up, a little more technical of a question, though. Just generally, share buybacks have been on a good trend. Your basic share count declined by about 11 million, 12 million this quarter, but I noticed a $10 million increase actually on the diluted side. Is there anything that triggered that out of the ordinary? And I mean, I'm just used to the spread being a little tighter on those 2.","Donald R. Kimble","Yes, as the price fluctuates here, you're going to see changes in the impact of stock options and other diluted shares. So that's really what's driving it. And beyond that, it's just the timing of the actual share repurchases and when they occurred.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Craig Siegenthaler with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Nicholas Karzon - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is actually Nick Karzon for Craig. I guess, first, on the $41 million of efficiency charges, I think I saw $25 million on the pension settlement and $6 million in severance. Can you help us think about which bucket's the remainder -- the remaining $10 million were in?","Donald R. Kimble","Yes, they really are spread in the number of categories including occupancy costs, professional fees and other. And much of it relates to the costs associated with the additional branch closures and also some contract renegotiations.","Nicholas Karzon - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then as a follow-up, I think you mentioned $15 million to $20 million of onetime charges are included in the fourth quarter guidance. Is that just including efficiency initiative charges or would that -- does that also include some portion of pension settlement as well?","Donald R. Kimble","No, that's primarily the efficiency initiative charges. Not sure how much we would have associated with pension. Since we did trigger that recognition threshold, any lump sum distributions that would occur in the fourth quarter would also trigger an additional loss. But we think it would be much smaller than the year-to-date catch-up that we had for $25 million in the current quarter.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Marty Mosby with Guggenheim.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Beth, I wanting to ask a little bit about the capital ratios. As you've been able to deploy a good portion of your earnings, your capital ratios have actually been able to drift lower. Do you still think you'll be able to continue to kind of push at that level of 90% to 100% of your earnings in total payout going into the foreseeable future?","Beth E. Mooney","Marty, this is Beth, as you asked for. And that would be reflective of trying to have a point of view on what 2014 CCAR guidance and rules and opportunities will be. We've been pleased this year that we were able to, at an analyst average, have an 80% payout as well as the opportunity to return the net after-tax gain of Victory. So you're right, we've had a good year in our ability to return capital to shareholders and that is one of our capital priorities. But I think it is too soon to have a view of what the 2014 CCAR will be. But it is incredibly important to us to continue to look at our dividend and share repurchase and return of capital to our shareholders.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And just a follow-up to that. Is there any re kind of composition in the sense that you were a little bit conservative on the dividend and pushed the share repurchase as your stock price was below tangible value. As that flipped going into next year, would you redistribute your priorities between dividends and share repurchase?","Beth E. Mooney","And again, at this point in time, we have not gotten the 2014 CCAR guidance nor started working and formulating our response in terms of what will be the mix that we request for the return to our shareholders. So again, premature, but something obviously that we will look at as we submit our application in January.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then just, lastly, on the -- we've accomplished the efficiency initiative that we started off talking about over 1 year ago. And now, are there follow-through projects that are coming out? What is the focused kind of to start pushing efficiencies initiatives to still get some benefit out of that?","Beth E. Mooney","As we've said, we did realize our $200 million targeted goal. And Don mentioned in his comments, many of those will be fully realized in our run rate in 2014. We do have some initial projects that we are working on and we've also introduced a very robust Lean Six Sigma process into our company to look at end-to-end processes, as well as client experience. So we look at those opportunities and middle office opportunities in terms of how certain transactions and processes are done, as well as we continue to look at, organizationally, how we do things in various areas of the banks that could possibly be done in more efficient ways, as well as continuing to say what in terms of both our staffing, our distribution and how we are aligned and organized can we do to be more effective and efficient.","Christopher Marrott Gorman","Marty, it's Chris. The only thing I would add to what Beth has mentioned is this is really a cultural change for us. And so while we haven't quantified it and there's certainly no name to the program, we will continue across all of our businesses to look for efficiencies, and my guess is we'll find some.","Beth E. Mooney","We talk every earnings day to our broader employees after we do this call and that is very much a theme that the highest performing company, this is a way they do business culturally, what they do year in and year out. We think we've gotten a lot of discipline, we've gotten a lot of rigor, we've learned a lot in our ability to meet these objectives. We will continue to expect this of ourselves outside of a named program, but a way, to certainly support our plan for growth, as well as becoming more efficient and productive.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","So then the momentum you feel kind of coming out of this culture change and initiative would make you feel, at least directionally, that you should see further improvements and efficiencies are likely?","Beth E. Mooney","We are requiring that of ourselves.","Operator","And there are no other questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Beth Mooney for closing remarks.","Beth E. Mooney","Thank you, operator. And we thank you all for taking time from your schedule today to participate in our call. If you have any follow-up questions, you can direct them to our Investor Relations team, Vernon Patterson or Kelly Dillon at (216) 689-3133. And that concludes our remarks for today. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, everyone. That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation."]}}
