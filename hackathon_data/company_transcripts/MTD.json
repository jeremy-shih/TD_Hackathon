My name is Doris, and I will be your audio coordinator for today. After the speaker's remarks there will be a Q&A session. It was my \u2013 at this time, I would now like to turn our presentation over to your hostess for today's call, Ms. Mary Finnegan. Ma'am, please proceed.","Mary T. Finnegan - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Thanks, Doris, and good evening, everyone. I'm Mary Finnegan. I'm the Treasurer, and I'm also responsible for Investor Relations at Mettler-Toledo. I'm happy that you're joining us this evening. I am joined by Olivier Filliol, our CEO, and Bill Donnelly, our Executive Vice President. I need to cover just a couple of administrative matters. The call is being webcast and is available on our website.

Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Thank you, Mary, and welcome to everyone on the call. I will start with a summary of the quarter, and then Bill will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments before we open the lines for Q&A.","The highlights for the quarter are on page three of the presentation. We had a great start to the year with excellent sales growth. We had expected sales growth in Q1 to be strong, and local-currency sales growth reached 12% in the quarter, better than expected with very good broad based growth. We are quite pleased with these results, which reflect our ability to capitalize on favorable market conditions and very strong execution of our growth initiatives. Further progress on our modern initiatives are reflected in the strong margin expansion, which contributed to an excellent 36% growth in EPS for the quarter. All in all, very pleased with first quarter developments. Our outlook for Q2 and remainder of the year is also positive.","Let me now hand over to Bill to cover the financials.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Okay. Hello, everybody. I hope you are all having a good day. Sales were $594.6 million in the quarter, an increase of 12% in local currency. The Troemner acquisition contributed approximately 1% to local-currency sales growth. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales were 10% \u2013 sales increased by 10% as currencies reduced sales by 2% in the quarter.","On slide number four, we show local-currency sales growth by region. Sales grew 14% in the Americas, 13% in Europe and 9% in Asia\/rest of world. China sales growth was 12%. Growth in the Americas benefited by 3% from the Troemner acquisition. As Olivier already mentioned, you can see that these percentage increases reflect a strong and broad-based sales growth.","On the next slide, we outlined sales growth by product line, which is also broad-based. Laboratory sales increased by 13%, while Industrial sales increased by 12% and our Food Retailing business grew by 8%. Troemner benefited from \u2013 benefited our Lab growth by approximately 3%. All comparisons are in local currency and versus the prior year.","Turning to slide number six, let me walk you through the key items on our P&L. Our gross margins were 57.7%, a 210-basis-point improvement over the prior year amount of 55.6%. While comparisons were relatively easy as gross margins were slightly down last year, we had a couple of factors that helped our margins this quarter. First, we had good productivity gains in our plants and in our Service business, giving us strong sales growth. Second, we continue to benefit from pricing, which was up by 190 basis points, which increased our gross profit margin by approximately 80 basis points.","Material costs were neutral in the quarter, with savings in certain material categories offset by higher commodity prices in others. We are very pleased with the increase in gross margins and expect further improvement as the year progresses, although we won't have the same benefit of easier comparisons as we did here in the first quarter.","R&D amounted to $31.4 million. That represents an 11% increase in local currency. Our growth in R&D in the quarter was driven by the timing of some new product launches. SG&A amounted to $184.2 million. That's an 11% increase in local currency over the prior year. Variable compensation, investments in our Field Turbo program, and employee benefit costs all contributed to the increase.","Our adjusted operating income reached $127.3 million in the quarter, and that's a 25% increase over the prior-year amount of $102.0 million. Currency reduced operating profit by about $1.4 million in the quarter, a little worse than we expected last time we spoke. Our adjusted operating margins reached 21.4%, and that's a 250-basis point increase over the prior year.","A couple of final comments on the P&L. Our amortization expense was $10.0 million in the quarter, while interest expense was $7.7 million in the quarter. Our other income was $5.7 million in the quarter, and that included a nonrecurring gain of $3.4 million from the sale of a manufacturing facility in Switzerland. This is part of our initiative to reduce our Swiss cost base by consolidating certain operations into an expanded facility. For comparison reasons, we've excluded this gain from adjusted EPS. And also included in other income is financial income of about $2.3 million.","Now let's cover taxes. We have assumed an annual effective rate of 22% for 2017, which reflects a 2% reduction from last year due to the new accounting policy with respect to the excess tax benefits on stock option exercises. As a reminder, prior to 2017 this benefit was recorded in equity and was reflected in a reduction in diluted shares outstanding. Therefore, the P&L and the effective tax rate were not impacted.","As we discussed on previous calls, we'll have variability in our quarterly tax rate due to the timing of stock option exercises and the accounting requirements around them. In order to make our guidance and comparisons easier, we are reflecting our estimated annual 22% effective rate in our quarterly adjusted EPS. You will see that our actual tax rate in the quarter was approximately 19%, and we've excluded the difference between the actual rate of 19% and our forecasted full-year rate of 22% in calculating adjusted EPS. We remain comfortable with our full-year tax rate of 22%, which is before nonrecurring discrete items.","Moving to diluted shares, they amount to $26.6 million in the quarter, which is a 3% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, offset in part by higher shares outstanding due to the accounting change I just mentioned.","Adjusted EPS was $3.34 per share, a 36% increase over the prior-year amount of $2.46 per share. On a reported basis, EPS was $3.48 per share as compared to $2.40 in the prior year. Reported EPS includes $0.04 of restructuring and $0.06 of intangible amortization. In addition, as we already mentioned, reported EPS includes $0.14 due to the lower tax rate, and $0.10 for the gain on the sale of the Swiss property.","Okay, that's it for the P&L. Now let me turn to cash flow. In the quarter, free cash flow amounted to $59.2 million, as compared to $23.3 million in the prior year. We remain pleased with our working capital management, and achieved further improvements in DSO, which we reduced by one day to 42 days as compared to the prior year. ITO was 4.6, and that's consistent with the prior year.","Okay, now let's talk about guidance. We have a very strong start to the year, and our outlook for Q2 is also quite positive. We continue to execute well, and believe we're gaining traction from our excellent product pipeline, our innovative Spinnaker sales and marketing programs, and investments in our Field Turbo resources.","Market conditions are favorable and we're capitalizing on the growth potential for our initiatives. At the same time, we acknowledge that uncertainty exists in the global economy, and that market conditions can change and they can change quickly. We will also face increasingly tough comparisons as the year progresses, specifically in the second half of the year. We expect market conditions to remain favorable, but recognize our growth rate later in the year will be impacted by these tougher comparisons.","That provides you background on our market assumptions, now let me cover the specifics. Incorporating the strong start to the year, and with the assumption that market conditions remain stable, we're increasing our organic local currency sales growth assumption for 2017 from 5% to 6.5%. Of this increase, approximately 1% is due to better-than-expected Q1 results, and about 50 basis points is due to improved growth for the reminder of the year.","For the year, we expect local currency sales growth of 7%, which includes 50 bps of growth due to the Troemner acquisition. Incorporating our Q1 beat and higher organic sales, we now expect adjusted EPS for the full year to be in the range of $6.95 (sic) [$16.95] per share to $17.15 per share, and that's a growth rate in the 15% to 16% range. We expect currencies to reduce earnings growth by 1.5% to 2% for the year.","Now turning to Q2, we expect local currency sales growth for Q2 to be in the range of 8% to 9%, and that includes about 1% contribution from Troemner. This will give us adjusted EPS of $3.85 to $3.90 per share, and that's a growth rate of between 20% and 21%. We expect currency to reduce earnings per share growth in the second quarter by about 2.5%. One additional comment, the impact of currency on sales growth, we expect currencies to reduce sales by about 3% in the second quarter and 2% for the full year.","Okay, that's it for my side, and I now want to turn it back to Olivier.","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Thanks, Bill.","Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab had very strong broad-based growth in the quarter as all product lines performed quite well. We continue to benefit from our strong product pipeline, Field Turbo investments, and innovative sales and marketing programs, which are helping us gain share. We expect continued good growth in Lab, but recognize that Q1 was our easiest comparison for the year.","Industrial also had great growth in the quarter. Favorable market conditions and our strong competitive position continue to bode very well for our Product Inspection business. Multinational food manufacturers continue to standardize on our products and services on a global basis. We expect strong growth from Product Inspection in the second quarter. Core Industrial also did quite well in the quarter. What was particularly nice is that we saw good growth across all regions. We did benefit from easier comps and some project activity, but overall, very pleased with strength in this business. Finally, retail came in better than expected, driven by very strong results in Europe due to new labeling regulations which drove higher than expected sales.","Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales growth in Europe was strong, driven by very good growth in Lab, while core Industrial also had good growth, driven by some project activity. As already mentioned, Retail was up strongly. One additional comment, we had some benefit in Europe in the first quarter, given the timing of Easter, which this year was in Q2 but last year in Q1.","In the Americas, Lab did well with growth in most product lines. Product inspection was very strong, and core Industrial did quite well, also driven by some project activity. Retail was down double-digits in the Americas in the quarter, against strong growth in the previous year. Asia\/Rest of World grew high single digits, with good growth in Lab and Industrials offset by decline in Retail. Most product lines had very good growth. China did better than expected with 12% growth in the quarter. Lab in China continued to do very well, and we were very pleased to see strong growth in Industrial in the quarter. One final comment on the quarter results, Service had a strong quarter with 11% growth.","The strong start to 2017 reflects favorable market conditions, but also our successful execution of our growth initiatives. We have several key initiatives aimed at gaining market share, one of which is our initiative surrounding global key accounts. Let me provide some additional background on what we are doing in this area.","Our global key account efforts focus on customers in food, pharmaceuticals, and chemical industries. As a market leader we have a wide range of product and service solutions, and a large direct sales force presence that enables us to be a true partner for these global customers, which have diverse needs in many locations.","We develop relationships at a high level with these organizations, which provides us the opportunity to sell based on the value of our solution. Increasingly, customers, particularly in segments such as Food Manufacturing, wish to standardize their equipment across their global location. We are ideally suited for this, and leverage our customer contacts to influence our roll-out of a solution across many sites, or ensure we are preferred vendor for order opportunities.","In addition to furthering relationships at these customers, we are also utilizing our big data analytics initiative to improve the quantity and quality of our sales targets within these large and global diverse customers. For example, we use our sales projects alert initiative to identify when customers might be reaching decision-making points in their investment projects, or to help us identify size of large accounts, while Solutions might be able to fill penetration gaps.","Capitalizing on our broad product offering and value selling are important to convert these opportunities to sales. Our sales teams have access to tools that help them demonstrate the competitive advantages of our offerings. For example, with increasing frequency we are highlighting the value of our software platform, which helps customers meet their high data integrity requirements. In 2016, sales growth at our targeted global key accounts grew well above the company average. We have further identified opportunities for 2017, and believe we can capitalize on them to drive further penetration with these customers.","Another initiative in which strong execution is yielding good results is our Field Turbo program. We have added more than 500 field resources over the last two years. We have put together a structured process to evaluate market opportunities and establish specific multi-year targets for these additional hires. Similarly, we leverage best practices across the market organization in terms of recruiting, hiring, and training these front-end resources. We are working on another wave of additional hires in 2017. We are pleased with the market growth we are achieving in these target areas, and expect continued good results from the Field Turbo additions.","That concludes our prepared remarks. As mentioned earlier, we are very pleased with the strong start to the year. At the same time, we recognize uncertainty exists in the global economy and we'll continue to monitor it closely. With continued good execution of our growth initiatives and stable end markets, we believe we can continue to generate good sales and earnings growth.","I want now to ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll pause for just a brief moment. Our first question is from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Steve, your line is open.","Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Can you hear me now?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yeah, we can, Steve.","Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Can you hear me? Okay. Thanks, guys. I had you on mute \u2013 had you on mute for a second. Bill, just wondering if you could comment about how you're thinking about the full year now, in two areas. Given the strong results here in the first quarter, what are you thinking in terms of overall revenue growth in both China, and then for your Industrial business overall for the full year?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Sure. So, let me start with the China piece of the business. I think we're very happy with the start to the year. And as you guys have seen with us over the years now, when there's tough periods of time in the Industrial business, we often kind of bounce back there. And I think we're seeing some of that return of the normal replacement cycle in our Chinese business, and just in general, the improving industrial environment there. So if we kind of look out to the second half of the year, what's built into our guidance is that some of what we have seen so far won't continue at that same rate, but it should still be better than maybe what we felt, let's go back six months ago. Okay?","Then with regard to our Industrial business, we do \u2013 we are very happy with the start to the year. We think that, maybe even in parts of the world a little bit better than we expected as well. If I look at Europe for example, I think that our European Industrial business benefited a little bit in the first quarter due to the timing of Easter, as Olivier mentioned on the call. But maybe adjusted for that we would say, hey, in the western part of the world, maybe things can continue, adjusted for slightly maybe tougher comps in the second half and this Easter consideration. We do monitor the PMI numbers. The PMI numbers have been improving, but we're not \u2013 we're not yet ready to say that hey it's a time yet for big growth. So...","Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Just one follow-up, then. I believe you made a reference to a $0.10 gain from a sale of a property in Switzerland. Just wanted to confirm whether that was in or out of your guidance?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yes. So it's out of adjusted EPS. If you kind of look in the press release, you'll see a larger than usual number on the other income line. But it's footnoted to say that we pulled that out then, and took that out of adjusted EPS.","Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Perfect. Okay, thanks, Bill.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, good afternoon, guys. Thanks very much. Bill, a question for you on pricing. Just curious if you can give a little color on how that's played out year to date relative to plan, and the extent to which that dropped through to gross margin? It would be helpful if you could quantify that somehow? Thank you.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Sure. So, in the first quarter we had a net realized price increase of about 190 basis points. Little bit better than we expected, but I also think it's worth saying that some of that comes in areas like, let's pick vehicle, Isaac, so in the vehicle business if we look at the steel decks we have, we're having higher costs for the decks. And remember too, a big piece of our vehicle business is in China. So steel prices in renminbi terms have gone up even more than we talked about here in dollars, and so we've passed on some of that. So this 190 basis points has \u2013 how we're doing versus beginning of the year guidance is a little misleading, just to take those numbers one for one.","But we're happy with the start to the year. And that 190-basis-point price increase contributed to about an 80 basis points of the gross margin expansion that we had in the quarter.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understood. And then maybe a little bit more hypothetical on capital use. Obviously you guys have done well with Troemner since the deal, but wondering if the funnel of deal activity has changed at all for the better or worse? Obviously equity prices are quite high, but you have also a lot of flexibility in the balance sheet, so I'm just wondering if you can probably-weight the likelihood of an acceleration in deal activity? Or at least characterize the nature of what you have on the radar? Thank you.","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","I would say that the strategy remains very much the same. Acquisitions are part of the strategy, we pursue always many targets, we have an attractive radar. And we can't really time the opportunities to our own desire, it's often when a seller is willing. And many of our targets are privately-owned companies, can have succession topics and so on. The financial metrics the valuations play often a smaller role for the timing, but certainly we are very focused on the topic. And you have seen us doing stuff in the last two or three years, and yeah, I wouldn't mind if another opportunity like Troemner will materialize.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understood. Thank you, guys.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Thank you, Isaac.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, Thanks. Olivier, can you elaborate a little more on the Lab strength? I think people are conditioned to think about the recovery in Industrial, but you guys put up great numbers in Lab. I know you had a slightly easier comp, but can you talk a little bit about the strength there, and the sustainability?","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yes. Yes. Hey, very pleased to say that Lab was strong across the globe, across all the product lines. There were a few ones that had tougher comparisons and that played a role, like if you recall Automated Chemistry had a very strong previous year. They still had good growth this year, but maybe less than the average Lab. The same was also true for pipettes in the U.S., where we had a strong comparison but still I'm very happy with it.","I would particularly also highlight Europe and China, where we continue to have really good growth. I think it's a reflection also that Lab serves many end-user markets, it's not just the life science. And many of these end-user markets start to be stronger and we see that also in our results. I would add also, I feel we had benefit from the strong pipeline, product pipeline that we built up. And we had many new products launched in recent years, and they all play well in the market, get good reception by customers.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then I guess on incremental investments, you flagged some of the R&D projects and continuing investments in Field Turbo. Can you talk a little bit just with the topline upside on how you're thinking about maybe expanding on some of these incremental investments?","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yes. So the additional R&D investment often is a question of timing when we launch products and we have quite a couple of important launches, not just in Lab, across all the product portfolio in Q1, partially also in Q2.","And probably more important is than the investment in Field Turbos. The Field Turbos, they typically we say the first year is really an investment. It's about recruiting, onboarding, training, building up the pipeline. And then we want to see that typically in the second year, the Turbo or the individual breaks even. And then in year two, three, we start to have a payback also on the initial investment. And I certainly see that this is happening. I would say the expectations \u2013 we exceed even our own expectations at right now, but that's more a reflection that the markets offer more growth than we originally planned.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Just last one on repos. You guys have been very consistent with your additional capital deployment, going back to share repurchase. Just any thoughts on, given where valuation is, whether the returns there would impact maybe the pace of buybacks going forward?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Sure. I'll take that one. So, the way we look at it, Tycho, is that we generate a lot of free cash flow. We look at the efficiency of different things. We certainly see that, our intrinsic value calculations for how we think we can build a business over time, it still makes complete sense to continue the share repurchase program.","I think there could be periods of time in the future where we have one or the other acquisition that might be bigger than some of these, more like Troemner's or whatever, a little bit bigger than the small bolt-ons, where we might think about our balance sheet and choose one or the other. But sitting here today, our \u2013 we feel comfortable with the share repurchase program. We intend to continue with it as described earlier in the year. And we think that makes a lot of financial sense for shareholders, given where we see the intrinsic value.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Dan Arias with Citi.","Bryan A. Kipp - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, guys. This is actually Bryan Kipp on behalf of Dan. Congrats on the quarter. Just wanted to take a step back, you highlighted some of the new products and how they're contributing to overall momentum that we're seeing here. Can you give a little bit more color around the incremental contributions, and whether or not the pipette launch that you guys had, the stand or UV\/VIS, or some of the products last year, are really contributing now?","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yes. Okay. So when we talk about new products, it's often new product generations. It is a product that has additional features, has additional benefits to the customer, but typically replaces an existing product. You mentioned UV\/VIS. UV\/VIS is kind of an exception, because that's a new product category. But these new product categories like UV\/VIS wouldn't have such an impact on the top line. You build this business over many years, rather than launching it and have an immediate impact.","But the whole upgrade of our product portfolio drives the replacement cycle. And that's why I say overall it helps our momentum, it helps us to increase prices because we have more differentiated value proposition and so on. But it's difficult to isolate the exact impact, because it's broad-based. It helps gaining market share, but then saying how many basis points, it's really difficult. It's a continued stream of improving the competitive advantage that we have.","Bryan A. Kipp - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And just to help characterize back-half growth, just given the sequential stepdown that we're going to kind of see, I think two-thirds of your overall growth is implied in the first half. How do you guys think about the Field Turbo investments that you did last year in contributing to back half, as well as some of these new products? Is your expectation more that that's just GDP plus growth, and that's where it's going to flush through, to maybe that 4% to 5% local currency range? Or is there more kind of baked in there?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","I think it's tough to just put a \u2013 for us to give you a guidance in reference to a GDP number or something, but maybe we look at it and our analysis would say hey, the comps get a little bit tougher. Maybe I give a comparison here to the first quarter; I pick on maybe our Retail business had growth, in part due to some new regulations that came out at the end of the year. We weren't expecting that growth here in this first quarter. We certainly think that over the course of the year that we're going to be at a much lower number, and that'll work itself out.","If I look at the China business, and you guys probably get tired of hearing us say it, but the \u2013 we're always careful with how we forecast that China business. It's \u2013 it can turn fast, it's \u2013 different economic situations or political situations could change demand quite quickly in China, or the credit situation there. And we do feel that we're currently benefiting from some pent-up demand, and it's unclear how that long \u2013 how long that will last. And while we feel good about \u2013 well, I would even say we feel great about our start to the year in China \u2013 we're cautious about how the second half will be.","So yeah, we are looking at those tougher comps, and I think let's see how the second quarter plays out. Let's see how our order entry and backlog looks sitting here in July, and I think we can give you guys a better picture at that point in the year. But I think at this point we're careful to get carried away after this one really strong quarter of growth.","Bryan A. Kipp - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","All right. Appreciate it. Thanks for the color.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Mm-hmm.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Ryskin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Hi, thanks. This is Mike Ryskin actually on the line for Derik. Congrats on the quarter, clearly. Appreciate your comments on what you discussed earlier in terms of targeting the global key accounts, and how those areas grew well above the company average. I was wondering if you could quantify how much that contributed to your topline growth, in any way? And whether the share gains you're seeing there, are they focused on any particular end-market or product segment? And then also what's the runway with sort of that initiative? Is this something that's still in the early stages, or will it be a contributor for some time?","And then a follow-up also on the timing of Easter, is it \u2013 that you called out as a tailwind in 1Q. Is it fair to say that's probably approximately a 50-basis point contribution to topline growth? And so, we should expect sort of similar headwind built into the 2Q numbers?","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Okay. Good. Let me take the first one on the global key account program that we have. Hey, what's maybe important to say, none of our end-customers is more than 1% of our revenue. So, while these are very important customers, they \u2013 the difference is when we have a large group of them, where we apply this improved sales and marketing techniques that I described. And in that sense, there are many years for us to benefit from these improved approaches, because we can apply them to many, many customers. And at this stage we are working on two handfuls of customers where we really apply the full program, but we're going to scale it up and I'm confident that we have a long-lasting impact.","Quantifying the impact on the whole group, I want to be cautious to really give a number. I think what's for us more important that we see that the approach is really working, that's why I mentioned to you that they are growing above the group average, because that gives us the confidence that we have a good program in place.","In terms of the Easter ...","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","The Easter, it's impossible to exactly quantify, but I think, could it be two to three points of European growth in the quarter? I think that's a realistic kind of number. Certainly less in the U.S., and not impacting Asia.","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","The reason why it's more Europe, it's because many Europeans take a vacation around Easter. So it's not just about the one or two working days, it's maybe they go on vacation the whole week. And that's why we call out here Europe.","Michael Ryskin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Got it. Thank you, that's really helpful.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.","Luke Sergott - Evercore Group LLC","Hey, guys. It's Luke in for Ross. Great quarter. Just kind of two high-level ones from me. If you could talk about the different margin expansion opportunities that you have within each business, and kind of how you balance between investing for growth and how you look at maybe it's time to take out some OpEx?","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yep. Maybe on the latter one, I try to drive a resource allocation process in the company where we reallocate resources towards the businesses that have the best long-term profit margin upside for us, and certainly also the businesses that have the best strategic value for us. And so, for many years we have been for example favoring the Laboratory business over the Retail business. And this is certainly something we continue to do. In the last few years, when you think about China, we did some restructuring in the Industrial part of the business as we continue to invest in the Laboratory business. So, we do that resource allocation, we do prioritize in these terms. And when I think about Field Turbo investments, additional R&D money, this is all taking place.","When it comes to going for investment and tentatively reduce cost at our other parts, that is probably more driven by geography at this stage, because it's very difficult to play offensive and defensive at the same time in a market organization. And at this stage, we feel actually pretty good in most of the countries around the world, if not all. And so at this stage we are mostly in an investment mode, and very selectively we do maybe cost measures in a country.","It's a little bit different when we talk about the producing organizations. When you look for productivity there, it's more programs that we have in place. On the last call in February, we talked about Stern Drive. This is a program that is going on across the globe, and there we definitely also do cost measures whenever we have good opportunities to execute them","Luke Sergott - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Great, thanks.","Operator","We do have a question from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.","Zachary R. Wachter - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, hi. This is Zach Wachter on for Steve this afternoon. Thanks for the question. Just looking geographically at your local currency growth, it looks like, even if I take out Troemner from the Americas and Easter in Europe, you had a nice underlying acceleration on a two-year stack in those regions. What drove the upside in particular? I know you said that research was down double digits in the Americas. Was it really Industrial driving that upside?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","I'm hesitating on the double-digit comment. So if I'm looking at our Americas business, if I look at our Lab business excluding Troemner, we grew by let's call it 6.5% or something like that in the quarter, which is certainly a solid result. And it compares to a plus seven in the prior year, so the stack numbers are very solid. Our Product Inspection business, which can be quite lumpy, had 30% growth, and that drove a lot of our Industrial growth in that part of the world, and we are very much looking forward to that comp a year from now.","But we have a lot of good things going on in Product Inspection. We're certainly taking some share, and that's a \u2013 one of the \u2013 somebody was asking about what kind of customer groups, but that's certainly one that Olivier's strategies around global key accounts has been helping us. And then our core Industrial business did very solidly as well, and let's see how that picks up in the coming quarters. What's worth noting is actually our Retail business was down mid-teens in the second quarter \u2013 or first quarter, I'm sorry. But that was, frankly, against mid-teens growth in the prior year.","Zachary R. Wachter - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And on the same comp-adjusted measure it looks like China, you actually saw a nice acceleration here in the quarter, but meanwhile, Asia\/Rest of the World was more stable. Were there any pockets of softness in other parts of Rest of World?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","No. If I kind of \u2013 I'm recalling a chart in my head, I think we had almost everybody was up mid-single digits, with, actually, Brazil and Russia not big markets but showing some very nice growth. I don't remember, even, anybody of material size having a decline, so....","Zachary R. Wachter - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks for the question.","Operator","We do have a question from the line of Rob Mason with Baird.","Rob W. Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yes, good evening. Thanks for taking the question. You mentioned that, Olivier, that Service, I think, grew 11%. Is that adjusted for Troemner?","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","No, it's not. Without the Troemner effect, it would be about 9%. Which is of course a very good number; Service is a much more stable business, and when we exceed the long-term average by a couple of points we are extremely happy. I think it's a reflection actually of good execution, and what particularly made us happy was that it was across the globe, and particularly also in the Americas. So really good execution, and shows the potential of Service.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","And maybe Europe benefited from the Easter that we discussed earlier.","Rob W. Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. But still, that's a step up from where we trended, even exiting 2016. So...","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Definitely.","Rob W. Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","...why would that necessarily \u2013 I understand the dynamics and maybe lack of visibility in some of the Product business in the second half of the year \u2013 but why would Service back off that number materially?","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","I think, actually, the last point that Bill made about Easter impacting Europe, that's certainly one.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","And then the second one is, Service, in terms of the labor piece of our Service, Q1 is the smallest one. So, you know, if you \u2013 I'll make up a number, if you pick $1,000 worth of contracts, the impact of that in terms of the growth rate on the first quarter is just going to be a little bit larger.","So, we were being open. We were surprised at it, and maybe we will do a little bit better in the quarter. It's certainly an area we've been investing for growth, so I'd like to see the growth continue. But if I look at our forecast for the second quarter, we're going to see some impact due to the Easter. But let's see how Q3 and Q4 come together.","Rob W. Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Okay. And also, Bill, the \u2013 with the first quarter, the operating margin expanded I think you said 250 basis points. If I do my math correctly, it looks like maybe there's 150 basis points baked into the second quarter. But as I look at the full year, or at least the second half, it's \u2013 there's not nearly as much in the second half. Is there anything that your \u2013 one, is my math correct? And I guess if so, is there anything that we should think about in the second half of the year, other than just the growth rate?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yeah. I think the biggest impact is due to the growth rate. I was just looking at one of Mary's schedules here to see if currency had really a different impact, and no, it's similar. So, yes, slight \u2013 Mary's saying a little bit worse, but it's mostly driven by the pure volume impacts.","Rob W. Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Just the last question, the share count that underpins the 2017 guidance, give us a feel for that?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yes. So, it's 26 million, 266 point.... And just as a reminder, that that includes the new accounting rules regarding the stock option stuff. And I guess maybe that number, I guess it's updated to the most recent stock price, or \u2013 let me tell you it this way, last week's stock price.","Rob W. Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Very good. Okay. Thank you. Nice quarter.","Operator","And we have no other questions in the queue at this time. I'll turn the call back over to management for any remarks.","Mary T.

I'm Mary Finnegan, Treasurer and responsible for Investor Relations at Mettler-Toledo, and I'm happy to welcome you to the call. I'm joined today by Olivier Filliol, our CEO; and Bill Donnelly, our Chief Financial Officer. I want to cover just a couple of administrative matters. This call is being webcast and is available for replay on our website at www.mt.com. A copy of the press release and the presentation that we refer to on today's call is also available on our website.","Let me summarize the Safe Harbor language, which is outlined on Page 1 of the presentation.

I will start with a summary of the quarter and then Bill will provide details of our financial results, and I will update the guidance. I will then provide an update on some of our growth initiatives. As always, we will have time for Q&A at the end.","The highlights for the quarter are on Page 2 of the presentation. We are pleased with our local currency sales growth of 6% in the quarter. Market conditions were weaker than the last quarter, particularly in Europe. In addition, prior-year sales growth of 11% was very strong. We were pleased to achieve a 13% increase in adjusted EPS in the quarter. We do not expect market conditions to improve in the short term and have initiated appropriate cost control measures. While we are managing cost levels more closely, we will also continue to make strategic investments for future growth. This includes investing in emerging markets, our Spinnaker sales and marketing programs, new product development and our Blue Ocean program. With our strong focus on execution, I believe we can outgrow the market and continue to take market share. We will cover these points in more detail on this call. But let me turn it to Bill to provide more details on the second quarter results as well as guidance.","William P. Donnelly","Thanks, Olivier, and hello everybody. Let me start with additional details on sales which were $570.3 million in the quarter, an increase of 6% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased by 2% in the quarter which included a negative 4% impact from currency.","Turning to Page 3 of the presentation. We outline sales by geography. In the quarter, local currency sales increased by 6% in the Americas, 14% in Asia\/Rest of World, while they declined by 2% in Europe. Acquisitions contributed 1% to total sales growth and contributed 2% to European sales growth.","The next slide provides full year sales. For the 6 months, sales have increased by 6% in the Americas and 16% in Asia\/Rest of World. Sales were flat in Europe for the period. Acquisitions contributed approximately 1.5% of sales growth in the first half and contributed 2% to Europe and 1% to the Americas for the 6 months","On Slide #5 of the presentation, we outlined our sales by product area for the second quarter. In this quarter, lab sales grew by 8%, while industrial sales increased 6%. Food retailing declined by 6%. Acquisitions contributed 2% to industrial sales growth in the quarter, so our core product lines, lab and industrial, grew by 6% on an organic basis in the quarter.","The next slide provides year-to-date sales growth by product area. Laboratory sales increased by 8%, industrial sales also increased by 8% and food retailing declined by 3% for the first half. Acquisitions contributed 3% to industrial sales growth.","Now I'm turning to Slide 7 which shows the profit and loss statement. Let me walk you through the key items. Gross margins were 52.4% in the quarter, a 40-basis point decline from the prior year. We benefited from volume, pricing and currency, however, these benefits were more than offset by some unfavorable mix mostly within the industrial business and the fact that Europe was weaker than prior year and Europe, as we've commented last call, has the highest percentage of direct sales and therefore the highest margin within our regional mix.","R&D amounted to $28 million, a decrease of 1% in local currency. SG&A amounted to $170 million, an increase of 3% in local currency. The increase was related to front-end investments largely in emerging markets, offset by lower variable compensation. Adjusted operating income amounted to $101.1 million, which represents a 7% increase over the prior-year amount of $94.5 million. Our operating margins were 17.7%, a 90-basis point increase over the prior-year level.","Let me give you a couple of final comments about the P&L. Our amortization was $5.4 million in the quarter while interest expense was $5.7 million. Fully diluted shares were $32 million -- $32.0 million. Adjusted earnings per share was $2.15, a 13% increase over the prior-year reported amount of $1.90. We benefited from a lower tax rate in the quarter, which was partially offset by currency headwinds. On a reported basis, earnings per share was $1.93 as compared to $1.82 in the prior year. Reported EPS includes pretax restructuring charges of $7.8 million, which represents $0.18 per share. Given the current environment, we are enacting a series of cost control measures. These include the exit of certain product lines, transfer of functions to lower-cost countries, workforce reduction and rationalization of certain operations. We expect to complete these initiatives over the next 2 years. Total restructuring charges, including the amount recognized this quarter, will range between $20 million and $25 million, which is primarily for severance cost. We expect to reduce operating costs by approximately $40 million annually when these measures are completed. This means we will not get the full benefit until some time in 2014.","The next Slide summarizes our results for the first half. Adjusted earnings per share was $3.80, a 14% increase over the prior-year amount of $3.34 per share.","Now let's talk about cash flow. Free cash flow amounted to $69.3 million, on par with the prior year. DSO amounted to 41 days while ITO was 4.5x. We're pleased with both of these levels. For the first half of the year, free cash flow is up 16% over the prior year.","Let me update you on the currency matters before I turn to guidance. As most of you know, our primary currency exposure is the Swiss franc versus the euro. Traditionally, these exposures have ranged between $150 million and $200 million, with our Swiss franc expenses typically higher than our European revenues. The combination of the decline in European revenues and the meaningful decline in the euro exchange rates corresponding to a significant increase in the Swiss franc exchange rate has led to our exposure being now comprised of $100 million of Swiss franc euro exposure and $85 million of Swiss franc U.S. dollar exposure. As most of you know, we have not hedged the Swiss franc euro historically given the operational nature of the exposure. Hedging cannot eliminate the risk for us but rather pushes it out to the future. Our philosophy has not changed in this. However, we felt it was prudent to remove some of that risk.","As a reminder, the Swiss National Bank in September 2011 pegged the Swiss franc at 120 to the euro. Given uncertain -- increased uncertainties surrounding the euro, we have now locked-in the current forward Swiss franc-euro rate for the next 12 months in the majority of our exposure. While this will not eliminate our currency risk, it would provide us an adjustment period to correspondingly look at cost structure adjustments if the 120 peg was removed. We do not view this as an ongoing hedge program, but rather a program to eliminate event risk in the near term. Once a clear resolution is -- once a clear resolution for Europe is known, we would expect to remove that. Maybe one other background comment on it is that, given interest rate differentials between in the euro and Swiss franc, it was at a historically low cost in terms of being able to purchase this insurance.","So now let me spend a minute on guidance. We are pleased with our results in the first half of the year but acknowledge there is greater uncertainty in our markets than there were 3 months ago. The global growth is slow, particularly in Europe, and we need to adjust sales expectations accordingly. As I mentioned earlier, we've initiated cost control measures throughout the organization. These include headcount reductions and reduced discretionary spending. It will also include longer-term projects, including some to reduce our Swiss franc cost structure. With that as a backdrop, let me provide some details.","For the full year of 2012, we expect the local currency sales growth to be in the range of 3% to 5%. This compares to previous guidance of 5.5% to 7.5%. For the full year, acquisition growth represents approximately 50 basis points. With this top line reduction in the benefit of our cost initiatives, we now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $9 to $9.40, which represents a growth of approximately 8% to 12% over the prior year. Previously, we had expected adjusted EPS to be in the range of $9.20 to $9.50. We acknowledge that the range is wider than we typically provide, and this reflects wider sales guidance and greater uncertainty in the market today. For the third quarter, we would expect the local currency sales growth to be in the range of 0% to 4% growth with adjusted EPS in the range of $2.15 to $2.35, a growth of between 7% and 17%.","In terms of the currency impact on sales, we would expect currency to reduce sales by approximately 6.5% in the third quarter and reduce sales by approximately 4% for the full year. This is based on current exchange rates. Okay, that covers my comments on guidance. And I now want to turn it back to Olivier.","Olivier A. Filliol","Thank you, Bill. Let me start with summary comments on the business conditions. Labs did well in the quarter with an 80% local currency sales growth, although with the previous year comparison was not as challenging as what we saw in the first quarter, and what we will face this quarter. In terms of product lines, Analytical Instruments, AutoChem and  Process Analytics is very well. Balances and pipettes also have growth. We continue to benefit from our sales from marketing initiatives, pricing as well as good product pipeline. Industrial was up mid-single digits on an organic basis. Our core industrial business was up low-single digit, a good result given the 18% organic growth in the prior-year period. Product Inspection was up nicely against a strong prior year. Retail was down in the quarter with declines in all regions of the world.","Now looking at the geographies. Europe was down 4% on an organic basis. This was weaker than we expected driven by core industrial and retail. We don't expect improvement in Europe in the third quarter. Americas was up 6% on an organic basis, a little better than we expected. We have good growth in both lab and industrial. Core industrial, which faced strong growth in the prior year, was up low-single digit. Product inspection have a good growth in quarter. We would expect sales in Americas to remain solid this quarter. Finally, Asia\/Rest of World was up 14% in the quarter. A little better than we had expected. Lab and industrial both have double-digit growth. We expect sales growth in this region in the third quarter to be high-single digits to low-double digits.","Let me also comment on the cost measures that Bill discussed. We are reducing headcounts, streamlining product categories and transferring activities to lower-cost countries. These options will make us even more cost competitive in the coming years. We will remain alert to changes in market conditions and we will take further actions if the environment weakens.","That provides some context on how we view our business today. We believe we can continue to grow faster than our underlying markets, and execution of our growth initiatives is key to achieving this.","Let me provide some examples of how we are positioned for growth. China has been an important driver of growth for many years. As we have spoken to you in the past, our businesses in China is more weighted to core industrial as compared to Mettler-Toledo's worldwide mix. We believe [indiscernible] will change our sales mix as China's economy further develops. We believe this is particularly true with respect to China's strategic intentions to its sciences and product quality in general and food safety specifically. With our broad offering, we are well positioned to capitalize on these dynamics. A great example is our product inspection business in China.","As a reminder, our product inspection business provides solutions to the food producers and pharmaceutical companies to help them assure product's quality. We have the most extensive offering in the market from checkweighs, metal detectors, X-rays and most recently, Vision Inspection. While the clear market leader and the dynamics of this market are very positive, given concerns surrounding food safety and quality concerns with pharma industry. Product inspection represents approximately 17% of total group sales and enjoys strong operating margins.","In China, we have a leading market position in product inspection, which represents less than 10% of China's sales as product inspection adoption by food producers is below the level of the West. We have the broadest offering in China and have recently launched our Vision business to this market. We are recognized for the food -- for the quality of our instruments and for our extensive regional coverage, with more than 30,000 services offices throughout China. This provides much better field service coverage as compared to any other competitor. Approximately 65% of our customers are food, 20% are pharma, with remainder, chemical and auto.","There are 5 factors contributing to strong growth dynamics of this business in China. First, food and pharma industries continue to grow faster than overall GDP creating positive momentum. In particular, packaged foods enjoy accelerated growth as evolving lifestyles are creating more demand for convenient food options; second, while food safety regulations in China are more heavily weighted to chemical contamination, we expect a clear move to physical contaminants over time. Metal detectors are the excellent instruments, are the most important products of physical contamination detection; third, China has heightened focus on GMP, good manufacturing practices, which is also a driving growth for quality instruments; fourth, increasing which inflation is driving demand for automated solutions; and finally, market conditions are likely to remain positive given the continued evolution of the middle class and the increasing demand for higher quality products. We are strongly positioned with multinationals and large local Chinese companies. We're working to offer low-cost instruments and expand our proven segment marketing techniques to capture more share in the medium and small local Chinese entities. Although product inspection in China is a small portion of its business today, its growth will likely exceed that of our overall Chinese business. This is one example of how we can capitalize on the increasing focus of quality in China and the other emerging markets. We believe there are similar opportunities in other product categories such as process analytics, certain analytical instruments, and certain industrial quality control offering.","Let me provide another example of how we are well positioned in each market to capture growth. Our Automated Chemistry group provides technology and software to translate bench scale chemistry into commercial processes. Bio pharma and chemical companies are under intense pressure to bring products off to market. They must create numerous opportunities and evaluate them quickly and eliminate poor candidates. We are the market leader in automated lab reactors and associated analytical tools, which analyze chemical reactions in the real-time. With this information, our solution to help increase our productivity, develop safe processes and ensure commercial processes, deliver higher yield at lower cost. Our principal customers are pharma and chemical companies. While pharma budgets are down, R&D spending is still significant. We also see big pharma continuing to decline was being replaced by mid-sized pharma, CRO's and generics, which will continue to take a bigger piece of the profit pool. The market and earnings for automated chemistry are very strong as we estimate almost 2\/3 of potential users do not use any technology at all. Of the 1\/3 that does use technology, 1\/2 is in-house engineered solutions. With special small piece of the potential market penetrated, we believe there is a big opportunity to migrate these chemists and engineers to new technologies to improve productivity. Spinnaker-type marketing program are key to identifying and targeting this potential users. We recognize we need high-value marketing to make these contacts aware of our deep knowledge in this area of our solutions and to help them solve problems. Emerging markets also provide a significant opportunity for automated chemistry. It is estimated the life science total spend will grow at twice the level of the developed markets by 2020. We are very well positioned to capture this growth trend. We also see opportunities in other markets such as polymer, petroleum and petrochemicals. Finally, we have the largest service force in this market, which provide not only a competitive advantage but good growth opportunities as well.","Product Inspection in China and our automated chemistry offering are just 2 examples of how we are positioned well in each growth markets. That concludes our prepared remarks, and I would like to ask the operator to open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jon Wood from Jefferies.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So Olivier, I would like to hear, it looks like you lowered your top line by 2.5 points local currency. I would love to hear specifically what drove that from a geographical perspective, as well as if you can from a product line perspective versus your last update?","Olivier A. Filliol","It's certainly a reflection of what we have seen already in the second quarter. And you heard us saying that Europe came in weaker than expected. We would certainly see an ongoing uncertainty about how Europe will develop. And we want to remain cautious with our expectations from the European market. I would also say the Americas, while we still see good momentum, we are a little bit more cautious for the rest of the year than we were during our last call. And what I look at to emerging markets in China and would also see that -- and a recovery the Chinese momentum like we all expect might take a little bit longer. So it's a combination of all of the 3 regions, but I would certainly emphasize the European market that is definitely weaker than we expected on the last call. So that's a geographic view. When we look at more from a business line, we would see food retailing certainly be weak outlook for us. And then when I look at core industrial, they are certainly also suffering from this economic uncertainty, and so I would also see that core industrial would be weaker. All of the businesses, I would expect similar to what we have seen year-to-date.","William P. Donnelly","I was going to maybe put a little bit of numbers to give you a feeling, Jon. So we probably think the lab business could be growing maybe 2% or 3% in the coming quarter, which certainly is a little bit less than that we have enjoyed the first part of the year. And then the industrial business will do a little bit better than that, maybe 4%, maybe 5%. The food retailing business though is going to be weaker than we expected. That could be as much as 10% down in the third quarter. And then geographically, it will slow up a little bit more in Europe so we probably would be at 5% to 10% decline in Europe. And in the Americas will be, similar to what we saw in the first half of the year, maybe a little bit less, a little bit less, a point or 2. And then we'll see the rate come down, we think somewhere around 10% or so for Asia\/Rest of World.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","That's great. Can you, Bill, call out China in the quarter and parse out the core industrial from the lab there?","William P. Donnelly","China in the quarter grew by 10%, and the lab businesses grew mid-teens and the industrial businesses grew around 10% or so. We actually had a large decline in retail. Retail was down high teens.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg from Macquarie Holdings.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","So can you, Olivier -- can you maybe talk about just looking at 3Q, because if you take your midpoint of your guidance and total revenues, you expect to be down 5%, I'm just kind of just taking the midpoint roughly. But EPS to be up close to 10%? If not a little more than midpoint. Can you maybe just -- I know your little bit of currency benefit. It's where you've been in the third quarter. But can you maybe just talk about how you expect that to flow through the P&L in the third quarter?","Olivier A. Filliol","Okay. So just maybe I would be repeating some things that you said. But you're right, midpoint of the range at around 2% and we should have 6%, 6.5% impact due to exchange rates. So in terms of our gross profit margin, you'll see it relatively flat compared to what you saw a year ago, which from trained perspective, is a little bit better than what you saw the last couple of quarters where we had to decline. It could be 10 or 20 basis points one way or the other, but relatively flat. Our operating expenses you'll see in local currency, you won't see much growth in terms of operating expenses. In fact, you could even see a little bit of a decline on the SG&A line. And that reflects some of the things we've talked about in terms of cost measures.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay. That's helpful. And then, are you planning -- I remember last time when things slowed a little bit, you suspended doing the buybacks, are you still going forward with your buyback plan?","Olivier A. Filliol","No, no change in plans. This was an extraordinary situation. But at that time -- situation today looks very different.","William P. Donnelly","It had more to do with the financial markets than our business.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","So no change today. You expect to use your free cash flow to buy back?","Olivier A. Filliol","Correct.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then, one last one for me if I can. You mentioned, Olivier, you asked being a little bit more cautious. Is that just -- is that more from just what you read and what you see or are you starting maybe see a little bit of that come through an order and some kind of more from the ground and from the sales force or that is being cautious given from a macro perspective?","Olivier A. Filliol","It's definitely the latter one. Of course, we read also the newspaper. We also see in general that my numbers that indicate that. But if I look at -- if talk to our businesspeople, our few people in general, will we still see good momentum.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias from UBS.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","On the cost actions and the margin improvement or but the margin efforts, can you just remind us how much of your manufacturing is now done in low-cost regions and maybe, comment on the ability to move production over there in a way that make sense?","Thomas E. Reinckens","So today we produce about 30% of our products we sell worldwide local countries particularly in China. And about 40% of our material purchase are coming from the low-cost countries. The measures that we are talking here is actually very broad-based. It is not just manufacture-related, it's also a sourcing of materials, that plays a role. And we're also looking at sourcing services more from local countries. So it's a wide range of activities and it's not just related to the production of products.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess on the expenditures for Blue Ocean, how are the reductions in cost make you think about taking that program global? Is that something you're going to stay on course with or maybe do you slow those plans a little bit?","William P. Donnelly","I think in terms of our operating margin expansion over the medium to long term, that's one of our key enablers, and so we're going full steam ahead on the program.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And now I guess maybe just one more question on pricing. Bill, I think the last time we talked about pricing and a lot of this maybe coming off this quarter. Is that something you saw and maybe just extend beyond lab and talk a bit about what you think you can do pricing wise for the rest of the year?","William P. Donnelly","So in the quarter, realized prices we estimated were up 270 basis points and so that's 260 now on a year-to-date basis. I would be surprised if that number didn't move up a little bit more the next couple of quarters again.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Ross Muken from ISI Group.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","How should we think about sort of the pacing in some of these geographies where we saw the deceleration? I mean you look at the macro data and you mentioned PMI before we saw a pretty decent step down in June, and it's sort of -- it looks like it's continued a bit into July. How would you sort of characterize it particularly in more challenged parts of the business in terms of the magnitude of change and sort of the timing.","William P. Donnelly","I guess, first comment would be, Ross, that we would very much reflect a little bit of forward-looking view this combination looking at our leads. PMI kind of data, and what the guys in the field, are saying when we came up with things. We did have, in the course of the quarter, less order growth than we had sales growth. And that also kind of played into it, and that's probably one of the items that we contributed to things. Now if we look at actually regeneration numbers, I think were reasonably satisfied with what we see. So maybe a little bit less in some parts of the world, but if we look at those numbers globally, regeneration looks pretty good. And I think you got a sense from Olivier as well that our discussions with the field guys are again reasonably good now. That being said, we think what we propose this guidance is probably realistic assessment.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And you felt like there was one part of the -- whether it's geographical or subsegment specific that you probably expect the largest variants from sort of corporate plan that it stands, where do you think, maybe in a more drill down level, we more likely to see things kind of come in above or below depending on sort of that trajectory through Q3 and Q4 just from a global demand perspective in terms of what you're seeing now in orders versus where the specs are?","Olivier A. Filliol","For my geographic standpoint, it's definitely Europe where we have seen a rough decline over the last few months and we certainly forecast that it's going to be staying very challenging. And within Europe, if I look at the business plans and particularly also food retail, where we have some comparison topics. But then secondly also that we see that orders have slowed down significantly and the second business line is certainly also more impacted this calling down [indiscernible].","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Knight from CLSA.","Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Just a follow up, Ross, on Europe. So I guess the laboratory's right side of the business is fairly resilient in European marketplace.","William P. Donnelly","As a reminder, we do a laboratory business. And I know you know this, but I think it helps the people listening to the question, it doesn't include just labs stuff sold into life sciences. And we have a lot of industrial customers that are buying the equipment as well as, chemical companies, for example, but food companies as well. And so, we would expect lab to be more resilient, but there is a meaningful portion of that laboratory business that's also going to industrial customers that has some similar dynamics to our industrial sales.","Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And laboratory was the highest organic growth rate in the quarter, Bill? What would be the product's newest highlight behind that?","William P. Donnelly","In terms of the laboratory business, processing analytics really did the best with the major product categories. Our automated chemistry and analytical instrument businesses both did quite well. What's maybe interesting, Paul, about those last 2 is, ticket price-wise. Those are our higher ticket price items. Now AutoChem, I think, is a business that we have that's just executing really well now. Good product cycle as well as a good penetration in some of their key accounts. The analytical instrument business largely benefits from a relatively one of the easiest comparison it has, and with the prior quarter is the second quarter, and I would say that explained it the most.","Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then I guess looking back on Q1 gross margin, was item we all looked at in Q1, it seems like the sequential improvement in gross margin, mix is better in Q2 and I guess the ultimate question is it looks like China is improved on profitability as well. What would your thoughts be there?","William P. Donnelly","We would expect gross margins to improve trend-wise versus the prior year. In Q3, that will be driven by as I mentioned earlier, our pricing should add a little bit more in the course of the quarter, I think 4x is going to be marginally better. And then mix wise, I did -- it also could be, maybe not better than the prior year, but because I think we're still going to have a headwind in Europe, but at least within the industrial business, I think, some product categories would do better than others. The biggest headwind we have on gross margin now is the fact that our European business, which is the place where we have the highest percentage of direct sales as opposed to sales through distributors and therefore the highest gross profit margin is the weakest region.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Could you maybe comment on the China visibility that you have into the government funding source to -- I think we've talked your pacing of those dollars from the five-year plan and then also sort of the dynamic you're seeing in maybe tier-2 versus tier-1 cities. I think the tier-2 cities are sort of a new area of focus in the last year or so?","Olivier A. Filliol","So let me start. Maybe with first piece of funding. And what we have certainly seen is that this project, that they are less funded at this stage for 2 reasons. On one hand, the stimulus funding that we benefited over the last few years is definitely gone. That has one impact and the second one is we see that in this transition of leadership, many project on hold, people want to wait until the new leadership is really in place and the decision makers, the new decision makers are really confirming this project. I would, however, expect that this situation will rapidly improve and will  definitely be helpful for us. When it comes to the new 5-year plan and how that can benefit from last, there are different initiatives in this 5-year plan are beneficial for us. It's more focused on signs, it's more focused on quality. It's also more focused on environmental topics where there will be demand for our product. And so in general, I would say this is beneficial. And so all in all, I think this change in leadership will have to be beneficial for us and should start to do yield already, improvements in the coming weeks.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then maybe on the financials. Bill, can you comment on how you feel about pricing power right now, especially for the back half of the year? And then on the share repurchase, did you guys give out -- how many shares you repurchased and [indiscernible] you might see a little bit more willingness to buy back more than you previously got into the back half if you got attractive prices?","William P. Donnelly","Okay. So first on pricing, I think, we -- the details on pricing look good. Win-loss reports look good. Price realization reports look good. So we feel pretty confident that we'll have a continued positive trend in the second half on pricing. Now in terms of the share repurchase program, as a reminder, we file a 10b-5 plan that allows us to purchase through blackout periods. The way that we execute that is we're purchasing fixed dollar amounts. And so that fixed dollar amount would therefore the number share repurchase will vary to a certain extent based on the stock price going up or down. In terms of us doing something more, there is -- that's something that we're disclosing at that time. At this time whether our board will consider that at some stage during the -- later in the year, that's possible, but I would say there's no certainty at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First maybe just on the cost actions. I mean, how much of this is accelerating things you would have already been doing in terms of the transfer of product lines, and can you maybe comment on exiting product lines? You made that comment earlier. And I'm just also wondering, is it disproportionally biased to any of the businesses, any of the business segments?","William P. Donnelly","Okay. So in terms of exiting product lines, we do have a couple of areas that we did exit. They both fell -- they're relatively smaller product categories, I think it's not something that we need to further adjust guidance or something like that. There are product lines within industrial and within retail that we were focused on there. And in terms of geography, you can imagine there's a focus on Europe in general which has the biggest weakness. And to a certain extent, we've been talking to you guys for a while about us trying to, over the medium term, move our Swiss franc cost structure or reduce our Swiss franc cost structure over time. Now in terms of things we would do -- would've done otherwise, I think in some cases what we're doing reflects volume. But many other things you're correct are things that we would've done at some point over time but maybe look to accelerate it. To a certain extent, I would also highlight maybe that some of the things that we're able to do as part of the program are things that start to -- are enabled to a certain extent by some of the investments that we've been making in the Blue Ocean program as well that allow us more flexibility because we're on a common set of systems and data and processes that allow us to move things a little bit more nimbly than we might have in the past.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And in terms of your comments on kind of the back half of the year, I mean you talked about expectations for lab to be up a little bit 2% to 3%. I think you said in the third quarter. Presumably, that's all U.S. or, I mean, in light of the funding environment, I guess what I'm wondering is are you projecting the U.S. academic market to be down here in the back half of the year?","William P. Donnelly","As you know, academic maybe compared to some of the other guys in this space is not as big a segment with the exception maybe of the pipette business. And in the pipette business, that's not one of the strong points. Although I would highlight we'll probably do better than most in that segment because it's an area where our market share has been higher in biotech and pharma. And so it's been getting a little bit more emphasis from us than we do actually see that trend wise, we would appear to be doing better than maybe competition in that particular sector. So but the feedback we get from the pipette guys is that it's not a particularly strong area right now. But we're happy. Actually, we have modest growth in the U.S. pipette business and I think compared to what I've seen with some other guys with similar product categories, that seems to be pretty good.","Olivier A. Filliol","Definitely, I would say, I think we expect this growth from the U.S., but the emerging markets would also be a contributor to the global macro. So it's not just the U.S.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then just last one, I guess, from a portfolio management standpoint. You talked about the product line divestures. I mean do you see other opportunities to -- for business divestitures? You've gotten rid of some of the food retail business a couple years ago, for example. And alternatively, just comment on how you're thinking about M&A in this environment.","Olivier A. Filliol","Nothing of particular size here. This product line streamlining that Bill discussed before and really just a relatively small product lines specific applications on what we did for the divestment of software business that we did in retail 2 years ago or so that was more sizeable and I don't see us doing anything in particular of that size in the near term. Actually, we feel very good about the growth of portfolio and the growth of franchise.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then from an M&A perspective, are you looking at doing the capital deployment a little bit more aggressively in the current environment?","William P. Donnelly","Prices really remains the same as we have now the last few years. We are focused on more adjacencies, close adjacencies that we yield good synergy potential on their typical sizes of $20 million to $50 million businesses. And we continue to screen the market that there's nothing in particular that I would see to be announced. I don't think that the market offers particularly good opportunities in this time. So I think we will really pursue a very similar strategy as we have done in the last few years on this one.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then one last one and then I'll hop off. Can you comment on trends in July versus June just in terms of how much things deteriorated month-to-month?","William P. Donnelly","At this point, if I look at kind of order trend for the 2 months, I don't think we are looking at a materially different picture.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So maybe I'm being a little bit slow. But in the second quarter, you did 6% local currency growth and you grew earnings by 13%. In the third quarter, you're guiding to the midpoint of local currency at 2% and looking at 12% EPS growth. So I'm just -- with the restructuring as a currency, what's giving you the confidence that you can kind of support an equivalent level of growth with a lower volume basically coming through?","Olivier A. Filliol","It's almost completely explained by the cost measures we described and maybe to a smaller extent a little bit better margins.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's fine. I just -- that's why we thought it was going to be answered. I just wanted to make sure I'm not being slow on this. And I guess when you look at the cost actions that you're taking, it sounds like things are going to be moving a little bit slower than they did last time in 2009 when you did it. Is that because you're doing more ongoing investment right now, I mean you've got things like Blue Ocean going on. Just could you talk about just how quickly you're moving and I guess how -- what you're doing now compared to what you did then?","William P. Donnelly","I think the sales numbers are -- our view of the market is different too. We're suggesting a 2% organic growth for the second half of the year as compared to, I guess, we had a 10% decline or something in 2009 and we were running, at some quarters we're in the mid-teens down. So I think it's very much that is the reflection at us. But we made investments in '09 in strategic areas and we're making investments now as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sung Ji Nam from Cantor.","Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","So just going back to emerging markets and specifically China, what percent of your business in China is project oriented?","William P. Donnelly","Well, the industrial business, which represents about 60% of sales or so has a meaningful amount of project to business. If I were to talk about big, big projects, maybe in normal cycle it might be as much as 15% of that sales, maybe even 20% in the really good times. That's part of the business that's probably we see the most. If we look, for example, and you guys can see us bit in the balance sheet, because we have less deferred revenue than we normally do, and that's almost completely related to China. Less big projects which have more of a deferred revenue mechanism as part of how you recognize things there.","Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of maybe some of your relatively larger other emerging market regions like India, Brazil and Russia, could you comment on kind of what kind of trends you're seeing there and what your outlook may be? I know, India, for example, with the currency, you might be having some difficulties and things like, if could you comment on that?","Olivier A. Filliol","To maybe just frame it, China is actually really the biggest county in the emerging market mix. It's about half of our emerging market sales. And then it rapidly drops off to smaller numbers like India is in the range of 3% growth or 3% of total sales. And also Russia is actually even lower than India. So this becomes smaller numbers.","William P. Donnelly","India has actually performed well for us. Year to date, we had actually growth north 20%. And in India, we tried I feel is an excellent accomplishment by the team considering that the currency is actually a bit difficult situation for us in India. And India overall is certainly more challenging than it was previous years did very well there. If I look at other emerging markets also, South East Asia, for example, Korea very happy with all these numbers and what the team is doing. And also countries like Mexico. Eastern Europe was weak but had actually a tough previous year, and Brazil, we certainly also see the economy -- economic situation is more challenging than we had in the past. But all in all, I am very happy with all the emerging markets and many of them are actually performed much better than China and China was at 10% growth against a strong previous year, it did actually also well for us.","Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then finally from me, could you maybe about the competitive landscape? Obviously very fragmented there. But just given our they kind of obviously similar challenges and is this a good opportunity for you, are you finding opportunities to take greater share in this environment?","Olivier A. Filliol","So when we talk about competitors, we have in the lab space mainly global competitors as when we talk about core industrial in particular. We face more local competitors. I would certainly see a situation where we have a competitive advantage that is particularly also beneficial in this more difficult economic environment. We are certainly very agile with our marketing programs and with our very strong direct sales approaches, we are closer to customer which is always good in this environment. I would clearly see that we continue to gain market share. I don't see that the big opportunity to change the competitive landscape, I think it is a more continues evolution here. I will -- overall programs that we have in place in terms of coming out with new products, implementing superior marketing programs, expanding our field force into one. These are all initiatives that help us continuously win market share and is not particularly focused in an economic cycle.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Robert W Baird.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just a couple of things. Bill, Olivier, how did the service piece of the business perform relative to the product piece, against that local currency growth range?","William P. Donnelly","So our service business grew by 4% in the quarter and the product business grew a slightly more and then to the extent that we're seeing a change in our growth rate, we would probably expect a similar growth rate in service in the second half of the year and most of the client would relate to the product side of the business.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I see. Okay. All right. And then, Olivier, your comments on Americas. I was just trying to maybe summarize what you were talking about. Is there a particular piece of the business, lab or industrial specifically that you're more or less concerned about, and is that from feedback from the sales force? Or is it just a general tone that you feel is weaker?","William P. Donnelly","It's a little bit what we see in the pipeline. And the 2 weaknesses or areas of slowdown that I would see is food retail has certainly had a slowdown and second one, is of course core industrial is always more exposed to changes in the momentum. Lab performed well for us and we would expect them to continue. Product Inspection had over a good second quarter and had exceptionally see good ongoing momentum there, particularly also driven around food safety that is a key topic around the world in particular also in the U.S.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Okay. And then can I ask, given Mettler's manufacturing exposure to China, as we look at some of these product transfers, do we still consider China to be a low-cost region?","William P. Donnelly","Yes. Probably you're talking about particularly for direct labor people. Rick, you're often talking 1\/10 of the price and our costs in material for our types of material often we would probably averaged 20% lower in some product and probably categorize [ph] even more","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. So we don't need to develop a different region, for instance, to serve the Eurozone?","Thomas E. Reinckens","No. What we need to realize, and of course, we experienced also weight inflation, but our productivity gains in our Chinese facilities are actually quite impressive, and there is a very strong focus of our team to continue on that path. We see productivity gains in production area, but we certainly see that across the whole value chain, and not the least also on the sale side, service side of your people. So the topic of cost increase in China is, of course, a topic but I feel we can offset that nicely through productivity gains.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just the last question. The $7.8 million of restructure that you took in this quarter. What would be maybe the anticipated benefit in the second half?","William P. Donnelly","Well, just maybe the key way in which you'll see it not all of that relates to our operating expenses. But I as I mentioned in the response to another question. You'll see a decline in our SG&A expenses in the second half in local currency.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Greg Halter.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","I'm not sure if I heard the number of shares that were repurchased in the quarter for 6 months.","William P. Donnelly","We repurchased 435,318.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","All right. And given the change with the cost control measures, any change in your thoughts on capital spending for the year?","William P. Donnelly","I mean we're -- maybe I'd answer it in terms of cash flow. We do see that we'll probably do a little bit better on the cash flow side. I think we had guided to a 15% growth in free cash flow and we'll probably do a little bit better than that.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","Okay. Looking at R&D, just wondering if there are any change in your thought process there, again given the cost control measures and what your expectations may be for 2013 as well?","Thomas E. Reinckens","R&D strategy is a very continuous one. It's not particularly impacted by these cost programs that we have in place. And we do R&D for so many different product lines and we have so have many new products that are coming in that you will see a little bit of quarterly changes that can be driven by peaks in certain product launches. But all in all, I would say the R&D pipeline as well as the R&D investment is quite a steady one.","William P. Donnelly","I would maybe add that one of our productivity gains that we get in R&D, Greg, is what I would describe as some kind of low-end R&D, where we're talking about drawings and stuff like that. We're doing more and more of that in low-cost countries or outsourcing, and that's giving us productivity gains with our western guidance and we've also invested the last couple of years in some programs and systems that allow us to work better on a global basis, PLM type of stuff. And we're starting to see some of the benefits from that as well.","Olivier A. Filliol","To build on what Bill said, we have expanded our software development capability out of India, which is complementing software development that we do in Switzerland. You can imagine that it's -- from a cost-cutting point, this very a beneficial to do it in India.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","All right. And one last one for you. Given the implementation of the ERP, just wondered if you've run across any issues that may be -- being compounded by the situation in Europe and other parts of the country relative to the core businesses?","William P. Donnelly","No. Our Switzerland has been up and running the new system for quite some time. So not there. China has been up and running, as you know, since Q3 last year. And then we're targeting taking the U.S., the main part of the U.S. operations in the early part of next year. So there is not anything going on now that would, I would say is even operational challenge in this regard. I mean, this change management OpEx always with the new systems. And of course, we're enhancing it as well as we go along cause we want to get more and more out of it, but nothing that I would say is causing operational headaches.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Goldman from CL King.","Robert M. Goldman - CL King & Associates, Inc.","A couple questions. You mentioned the $40 million of cost savings would fully experience in 2014. You gave us a little bit of feel for what might happen in 2012, but unless I missed it, I wasn't sure how 2013 comes out. So should we assume half the benefits in 2013 or just help us explain how to get from your zero cost saving to the $40 million?","William P. Donnelly","Over the time sequence?","Robert M. Goldman - CL King & Associates, Inc.","Right.","William P. Donnelly","Yes, I would say that we'll probably be in the run rate during the middle of '13 more than half probably closer to 3 quarters of the way to that target. And as we get farther and farther into it, we'll disclose to you guys how that's progressing. Hopefully we'll do it a little faster and hopefully we'll do a little more. But I think that the $40 million number it being readied by the early part of '14 is probably a realistic assumption at this stage.","Operator","There are no further questions in queue. If I could turn the call back to management for closing remarks.","Mary T. Finnegan","Thanks, Martina and thanks everyone for joining the call.

I\u2019m joined here today with Olivier Filliol, our CEO; and Shawn Vadala, our Chief Financial Officer.","I want to cover just a couple of administrative matters. This call is being webcast and is available for a replay on our website. A copy of the press release and the presentation is also available on the website.","Let me summarize the safe harbor language, which is on Page 2 of the presentation.

I will start with a summary of the quarter and then Shawn will provide details on our financial results and updated guidance for 2020. I will then have some additional comments and we will open the line for Q&A.","The highlights for the quarter are on Page 3 of the presentation. Sales growth in the quarter came in better than expected and was quite good given the excellent 8% growth in the prior year quarter. Total local currency sales growth in the quarter was 4%, growth in the Americas and China was strong. We again face meaningful headwinds in the quarter due to adverse currency and the impact of tariffs. With the benefit of our productivity and margin initiatives, we were able to overcome these challenges and delivered strong growth in operating margins and EPS growth.","For the full year 2019, we exceeded $3 billion in sales and achieved 5% growth in local currency. Food Retail was down significantly in 2019, excluding this business, we have 6% growth in local currency sales. We achieved a strong improvement in operating margins and a 12% increase in adjusted earnings per share. Given the material headwinds we faced in 2019, we are quite pleased with this performance. One final comment on full year 2019, we generated more than $530 million in free cash flow, a very strong level.","Let me make some comments upfront on the coronavirus that is impacting China. To date, we have had no health impact to our employees in China for which we are grateful. We\u2019re working with the team on contingency and backup plans due to travel and back to work restrictions that the government has imposed. Even before these actions were undertaken, we have taken steps such as eliminating our annual sales force meeting and non-critical travel to reduce the risk to our employees. We expect the coronavirus to significantly impact sales in China in the first quarter due to the loss of selling days.","At this time, we would expect to recover the sales later in 2020 and therefore have made no adjustments for full year sales growth for the coronavirus. I wanted to mention this upfront, so that you can put it into perspective as you evaluate our results and updated guidance for 2020.","In terms of the full year, our view on 2020 has not changed significantly since we last spoke. We continue to remain confident in our growth, margin and productivity initiatives. We believe we can continue to gain market share and drive earnings growth. Excluding Food Retail and the near-term impact of the coronavirus demand in our markets remain solid. Although we are cautious on the macro economic environment as uncertainty does exist and there are pockets of weakness in certain end markets. We will continue to invest for growth, but we may agile if market conditions change. Based on market conditions today, we believe we are well positioned to generate solid sales growth and strong earnings growth for 2020.","Let me now turn it to Shawn to cover the financials and guidance.","Shawn Vadala","Thanks, Olivier. Sales were $844 million in the quarter, an increase of 4% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, total sales increased 3%, as currencies reduced sales growth by approximately 1% in the quarter. On Slide number 4, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales grew 6% in the Americas, 1% in Europe and 5% in Asia\/Rest of World. China had growth of 8% a little bit better than what we expected the last time we spoke.","The next slide shows year-to-date results. Local currency sales for the year grew 5% and as Olivier mentioned, excluding Food Retail, local currency sales growth was 6% in 2019. By region for the year sales increased 6% in the Americas, 3% in Europe and 6% in Asia\/Rest of World.","On Slide number 6 we outlined local currency sales growth by product area. For the fourth quarter laboratory sales grew 6%, industrial increased 2% with core industrial up 4%, while product inspection was flat. Food Retail declined 2% in the quarter.","The next slide shows full year sales growth by product. In 2019, laboratory sales grew 7% in local currency, industrial grew 4% with core industrial up 6% and product inspection up 2%. Food Retailing declined 8% in 2019. Overall total sales in 2019 were up 5% in local currency and 6% if we exclude Food Retailing.","Let me now move to the rest of the P&L for the quarter, which is summarized on Slide number 8. Gross margin in the quarter was 59%, a 60 basis point increase over the prior year level of 58.4%. Stern drive initiatives on material costs and productivity and pricing were strong contributors to margin growth. Partly offsetting these positives were tariffs from the U.S.-China trade dispute. R&D amounted to $35.3 million, which represents a 2% decline in local currency. This decline was impacted by timing of activity in the 15% local currency growth in R&D in the prior year.","SG&A amounted to $206.7 million a 3% increase in local currency over the prior year. The increase was driven by investments in our field force and growth initiatives in higher variable compensation, offset in part by cost savings initiatives. Adjusted operating profit amounted to $256.3 million in the quarter, which represents a 7% increase over the prior year amount of $239.7 million. We estimate currency reduced operating income by approximately $3.5 million. We also estimate tariffs were a gross headwind to operating income by approximately $2.5 million. Absent adverse currency and the gross impact of tariffs, operating income would have increased 9% in the quarter. Operating margins reached 30.4% in the quarter, the first time we crossed 30% and represented a 110 basis point increase from the prior year. We\u2019re quite pleased with this increase in the quarter.","A couple of final items on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $12.8 million in the quarter. Interest expense was $9.6 million in the quarter. Other income amounted to $1.9 million. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 20% before discrete tax items and adjust for the timing of stock option exercises.","Moving to fully diluted shares, which amounted to $24.6 million in the quarter and is a 3.5% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $7.78, a 14% increase over the prior year amount of $6.85. Absent currency and the gross impact of tariffs, our adjusted EPS growth would have been 16% in the quarter, a level we are very pleased at.","On a reported basis in the quarter EPS was $7.84 as compared to $7.11 in the prior year. Reported EPS in 2019 includes $0.11 of purchased intangible and amortization, $0.15 of restructuring and a $0.32 difference between our quarterly and annual tax rate due to the timing of stock option exercises. In the quarter, we also incurred a onetime non-cash deferred tax gain of $0.64 related to changes in Swiss tax law. We expect our effective tax rate to remain at 20%. One final point on reported EPS. In Q4 of last year 2018, we recorded a onetime non-cash acquisition gain of $0.75.","The next slide shows our full year P&L. We are very pleased with our 2019 results. We achieved 5% growth in local currency sales, 100 basis points improvement in operating margin and 12% growth in adjusted earnings per share. We\u2019re particularly pleased we\u2019re able to overcome to a degree the headwinds from adverse currency and tariff costs.","That is it for the P&L and we\u2019ll now cover cash flow. In the quarter adjusted free cash flow amounted to $186.2 million, a 23% increase over the prior year on a per share basis. Our working capital statistics remain solid with DSO at 40 days and ITO at 4.5 times. For the year adjusted free cash flow amounted to $531.3 million as compared with $455.9 million in the prior year. This represents a 20% increase on a per share basis and represents a net income conversion of approximately 95%. We\u2019re very pleased with this level and believe we can continue to further improve net income conversion in the future.","Now let me turn to guidance. As you heard from Olivier, we\u2019re not making any changes to our full year outlook for 2020. We continue to feel confident about our ability to execute on our growth and productivity initiatives. We believe we are well positioned to continue to gain share regardless of the macro environment. We also believe we can continue to expand operating margins through our ongoing productivity and pricing programs. We remain cautious on the macro economic environment as certain indicators are weak. While we believe our business is less susceptible to an economic downturn than in the past, we don\u2019t believe we are immune to economic cycles. We will remain in the investment mode, but keep agile to adapt if market conditions necessitate.","Now let me cover the specifics. We continue to expect local currency sales growth in 2020 will be approximately 4%. While the total sales growth is the same, we now expect Food Retail to be modestly down for the year in a double-digit decline in the first quarter. The last time we spoke, we had expected Food Retail to be up low-single digits for the year and to be down in the first quarter, but not in the double-digit range.","Our sales guidance for 2020 remains unchanged and we are also maintaining our full year adjusted EPS guidance in the range of $24.85 to $25.10, which reflects the growth rate of 9% to 10%, while we have incorporated our Q4 [indiscernible] currencies have deteriorated since the last time. In total for 2020, we expect currency and the gross impact of tariffs to reduce our EPS growth by 2%. Absent currency and tariffs, our EPS growth of 11% to 12% is the same as what we provided in November.","Some further comments on 2020 guidance, we expect interest expense to be approximately $42 million in 2020 and the amortization to be $53 million. Other income in 2020 will be approximately $7 million. You will note this is higher than the last guidance and it is related to pension accounting that is offset to a degree by higher pension costs that are above the line and included in operating profit.","Now let me make some comments on Q1. Based on market conditions today, we expect local currency sales growth to be approximately zero to 1%. We recognize this is not a level, you were expecting, so let me walk you through a few factors that are impacting our Q1 sales growth. First, Q1 will be our toughest sales growth comparison for the year, as we had 7% growth in the first quarter of last year.","Second, we expect Food Retail to be down double digits in the quarter, which impacts sales growth by approximately 1%. And third, as Olivier mentioned earlier, we expect the coronavirus to have an impact on our sales in the quarter, but not for the full year. In Q1, we would expect sales in China to be down mid-to-high single digits, which impacts our sales growth in the quarter by approximately 2%.","The impact from the coronavirus is of course difficult to estimate and reflects our current review of the situation, which is based on the assumption that people return to work on February 10. For the full year, we continue to believe that China will have sales growth in the mid single-digit range, the same level that we communicated last quarter.","Let me summarize, what this means to Q1 sales growth. Excluding the impact of the retail decline and adjusting our guidance for the estimated coronavirus impact, we would have expected sales growth in Q1 to be in the range of 3% to 4%. On a two-year stack basis, this would have been growth in the 10% to 11% range, which we\u2019re pleased with.","I realize, we were providing you a lot of numbers but thought it would be helpful to put the Q1 sales guidance into perspective. We would expect that adjusted EPS in the first quarter to be in the range of $4.20 to $4.30 a growth rate of 2% to 5%. Absent currency and tariffs adjusted EPS growth in the first quarter would be 7% to 10%.","In terms of free cash flow, we expect approximately $560 million, which is a 10% increase on a per share basis. We plan to repurchase shares of approximately $800 million in 2020, which includes an incremental amount as we target a net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio of 1.5 times. As in the past, we will buy shares evenly throughout the year.","Some final details, with respect to the impact of currency on sales growth, we expect currency to reduce sales by approximately a 100 basis points. In the first quarter, we would expect currency to reduce sales by 160 basis points.","That\u2019s it from my side and I\u2019ll now like to turn it back to Olivier.","Olivier Filliol","Thank you, Shawn. Let me start by providing some additional comments on our operating results. Our lab business continues to perform very well with 6% local currency sales growth in the quarter. Most products lines did well, particularly if you look at it on a two-year basis.","Sales growth in the Americas and China was particularly strong. Our laboratory business is well positioned to continue to gain share and we\u2019re pleased with our robust product portfolio. We expect market demands to remain favorable, especially in pharma life sciences. We also sell our lab instruments into other end markets and see some pockets of weakness in certain end market. Overall, we expect good growth in our laboratory business in 2020, although we face more challenging comparisons after several years of very strong growth. ","In terms of our industrial business, product inspection was flat in the quarter, in line with our expectations. We continue to believe this business will grow low-to-mid single-digit in 2020. As we discussed last quarter, we have not yet seen the large food manufacturers return to full investment mode, particularly with respect to global rollouts. We believe this is a matter of timing and are well positioned to capture growth once these food companies return to investment mode.","Core industrial did great in the fourth quarter, increasing 4% against 13% growth in the prior year. This was better than we had expected and we are very pleased with the performance. We\u2019re executing well in core industrial as this business continues to gain traction with a Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives. Core industrial is also benefiting from innovation. Underlying market demand is good enough and we can capture growth given the diversity of our products, customers, end markets and geographies.","Finally, Food Retail was down 2% in the quarter, pretty much on target with what we had expected. However, our outlook for this business has deteriorated since the last time we spoke. We expect it to be down double digits in the first quarter and be down for the year. Underlying market demand is weak and although we have easy comparisons, we don\u2019t expect meaningful improvement until later \u2013 in the later part of the year.","We had assumed last time we spoke that given the lower level of project activity in 2019 we would have some recovery in 2020. Based on our outlook for Q1, we don\u2019t see this happening until later in the year. As a reminder, we are managing this business for profitability, which also makes forecast in sales a bit challenging. We have enacted cost reduction actions over the last year in light of the challenging conditions.","Now let me make some additional comments by geography. I will start with Europe, which was up low single-digit. Lab had growth, while core industrial and product inspection were down against very strong growth in the prior period. We continue to think this business will be up low single-digit for the year. We would expect a modest decline in the first quarter, principally, due to significant decline in Food Retail as well as the 9% growth in Q1 2019.","Americas continues to do very well with 6% growth in the quarter. Lab and core industrial had strong growth. We expect market conditions to remain favorable and expect solid growth in 2020. But this region will be impacted by prior year comparisons.","Finally, Asia\/Rest of World had solid growth with most business lines doing well except for Food Retail. China had strong growth in the quarter with double digit lab growth and high-single-digit industrial growth. Excluding the temporary impact of the coronavirus, our outlook for this region remains favorable, but they will continue to face strong multi-year comparisons.","I want to point out that in Q1 last year China grew 13%, the strongest quarter of the year. Due to this tough comparisons and the impact of the virus we discussed earlier, we now expect Q1 sales in China to be down mid-to-high single-digit. Our full year sales growth in China remains unchanged from our previous level of growth in the mid-single-digit range for the full year, principally, due to strong multi-year comparisons and the slightly more challenging industrial environment.","One final comment on the business. Service and consumables together represent about one-third of our sales growth and both grew 7% in 2019, very happy with this strong accomplishment. That concludes my comments on the different pieces of the business.","We often speak to you about how we view our Spinnaker sales and marketing programs as key differentiators in the market. Another important differentiator is the strength and breadth of our product offerings. Let me give you some additional insights, starting with our laboratory offering. We can provide more than 40% of the instruments that the scientists or chemists uses daily in a typical analytical lab. These instruments range from balances and pipettes to analytical instruments such as pH Meters, Titrators and UV Vis. And finally to our automated chemistry solutions, which can help in drug process development.","We compete against different players across these product categories. No one has the breadth and the leadership of bench instruments than we do. Our LabX software can link these instruments and provide connectivity to our LIMS or Laboratory Information Management System. This is a very powerful competitive advantage as none of our direct competitors has anything close to this capability. More important than the number of instruments, we can provide is, the value of these instruments provides to our customers.","Across the portfolio of instruments, we focus on three important value dimensions. First is automation. Our instrument provides greater efficiency, highest sample throughput, and less errors in daily laboratory tasks and analysis. Second is information. Our instruments can perform complex analytics often with one-click of a button and also can improve the integrity and traceability of the data. This is especially critical in regulated environments.","The final dimension is measurement quality. We provide services such as calibration and good measurement practices to support the quality of our customer processes. We refer to the value outlined in these dimensions as the power of the bench. Our focus is to leverage and response to global trends that our customers face, such as demand for greater productivity and digitalization and data management needs.","Our lab solutions ensure compliance and data integrity and provide real advantages in terms of automation and productivity. We have additional product launches and R&D developments in 2020 that will continue to win forth the strength of these value dimensions.","Likewise, on the industrial side, our product offering is very strong and we continue to distance ourselves from competition with the breadth of the offering. Our industrial customers are constantly striving to improve the productivity and streamline data management. We are launching several highly innovative products and applications that help with these challenges.","For example, InVision is our breakthrough innovation for manual workplaces, where weighing, counting and packaging tasks have high error potential. InVision uses machine learning and combined weighing technology and camera recognition for fail-safe parts identification in milliseconds. Guided working steps, automatic data capture and process verification significantly increases production, quality and worker efficiency.","The instrument directly connects to the customer\u2019s production and ERP systems, providing full data visibility and visual proof of order fulfillment. We expect customers could achieve productivity improvements of up to 30% with this evolutionary product. This is just one example of many new product developments underway, where the combination multiple sensor technology, the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence enables us to develop breakthrough innovation with unique new value proposition.","Furthermore, by utilizing the R&D expertise throughout the world, we can develop these products at very short time period. These are just a few examples of the strength of our R&D innovation that continues to be an important component of our market share gains.","That concludes our prepared comments. We\u2019re very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter and full year 2019. While uncertainty exists in the global economy, we believe we are well positioned to gain share and deliver good earnings growth and solid cash flow generation in 2020.","Now I want to ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brandon Couillard","Hey, thanks and good afternoon. Olivier or Shawn, as we sort of think about China and the virus impact on the first quarter, which segments would be more impacted than others, is lab versus industrial? Would you expect to recoup most of that in 2Q or more over the balance of the year? And would you remind us how much of the China manufacturing is for the export market versus domestic consumption?","Olivier Filliol","Okay. So referring to the segments with the biggest impact, first, I want to start the fact that offices are closed here for additional days it has an impact across the business. The second impact that I want to highlight is the restrictions of the field sales force in terms of traveling. And again, that\u2019s quite broad-based. On that latter part, however, we can take a mitigation measures. We are, for example, very active already this week in rolling out a broad training program to our own sales force as well as our indirect channel partners to be more effective in telesales.","In the past, we did telesales with a focused team. Now we want to make sure also fail-safe people are experts in telesales and leveraging that. Now this is kind of the short term impact. Now what \u2013 when we think about segments, we need to think also the demand side that will be impacted here in Q1 and as an example, the one that we expect to be most impacted is the retail business. The retail business is impacted because the Chinese consumers behave differently at this stage. And that we will feel in a quite strong way. The lab business, I would expect to be actually much less impacted. There might be even some upside later in the year.","Now in terms of how fast this comes back, we do expect a pent-up demand. We do also expect that from a Chinese government standpoint there might be some stimulus that will help. I would hope that we see already some of that in Q2. But certainly expect that it\u2019s going to take Q3 and Q4 to fully recover, so certainly not the full recover in Q2, absolutely not.","And then in terms of the supply chain, you asking how much of the products we produce in China and then export to the West, I would first say, we have a part where we produce in China, but of course, we also source components and that\u2019s quite significant. But on the good news is, we are very close on this whole supply chain impact. Our local Chinese team has done a fantastic job in assessing the impact and taking mitigation factors. I have also my global supply chain team very actively on that one. We have, for example, contacted all our suppliers and all our Chinese suppliers. So far, it has given us green lights. We feel comfortable. We have also taken mitigation factors.","At this stage, we do not expect any significant impact on our global supply chain. I do not expect any significant delivery issues coming out of that. But this is also assuming that operations will come back on February 10. And if there are not, I still feel mitigation factors will help. But of course, it called loss for weeks.","Brandon Couillard","Thanks. And just one more, the core industrial business is pretty remarkable given the tough comp in the fourth quarter. Do you sort of elaborate on some of the drivers there? If there was any perhaps fourth quarter budget plus dynamic and maybe speak to some of the innovation and maybe new products that might be supporting the strength? Thanks.","Olivier Filliol","So indeed very happy about the results, did also exceed expectations. I really feel this is a reflection of very good execution by the teams around the world. Because the end user markets that we serve with core industrial were not particularly strong as mentioned that we even saw some pockets of weaknesses. Nevertheless, we did here very well. I feel the core industrial benefits from things that we shared with you at previous occasions in the context of Spinnaker sales force guidance for example, helps really very nicely in the core industrial, because it helps us to guide the sales people to the industry segments that are the most relevant and most interesting for us.","We had, for example, particular focus on life science industry and pharma industry for core industrial. That helped. So on the one hand, this whole how the go-to-market dynamic and the marketing then was strong and then we had a good product portfolio. There were many smaller innovations, but all together they make a difference. We had hardware products, but we had also software products that we had into use the last two years that benefited. At the previous occasions, I had shared that with you, for example, a new portfolio for the floor scales, but also in the area of counting scales and so on, so good product.","On the prepared remarks earlier, I just highlighted the product InVision that we definitely also feel is prove of strong leadership in innovation. Now none of these products will be important enough to really make a difference to the top line, the group sales. But in aggregation together they make a difference and they sometimes help us to open new doors and sell significant solutions to key accounts.","Brandon Couillard","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Derik De Bruin","Great. Thanks for putting me early, before all the questions get asked. Just quick one. You mentioned some softness in the lab business, some type of softness. Could you elaborate on that one? I would assume some of that could be your thermal analysis portfolio?","Olivier Filliol","Let me quickly jump in. We\u2019re talking about certain end markets that have weaknesses, not, okay. So it\u2019s really end markets. And when I talk about end markets, and this wasn\u2019t just slapped, this is kind of overall, if you think one-third of our revenue roughly comes from pharma life science and the other two-thirds come from many different industries. And we have industry \u2013 end user industry like metal, plastic, electronics and even some chemical industry that wasn\u2019t particularly strong.","And it depends a little bit by region. But for example, in Europe you have the automotive industry that is really weak. Now automotive itself is not an important segment to us, but there are suppliers to the automotive industry that are relevant for us, plastic, but also again components at all. And so we had these end user markets. Now when you will say, hey, that\u2019s more relevant for industrial. No, actually for lab too, because we have a lot of instruments that go in quality labs. And so we saw, so for example, thermal analysis would go and be relevant there also weighing and so on.","Even that, when you look at the whole product category for us, we did well, but when we analyze it by end user segments, we saw some pockets of weakness. And that was what I tried to highlight, kind of also say trying to say, hey, we have here an economic environment that is good enough for us. But that doesn\u2019t mean that every end user segment is as strong as life science.","Derik De Bruin","Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. And I guess just sort of looking at those pockets or just looking about those things that there\u2019s, I mean, do you think there\u2019s \u2013 when those segments do recover, is there pent-up demand in those segments? I mean, given that they\u2019re sort of like outside in the life sciences area?","Olivier Filliol","Derik, I think for these segments we are rather late cycle and in that sense, I think right now, we are in that situation. We saw it in Q4. We will also see it in Q1. But I think actually there is upside on that one. I rather think we see it also in certain PMI statistic and so on that these segments should actually start to recover. But let\u2019s be also cautious. The overall global economy is fragile.","Derik De Bruin","Yes. Great. And then just one follow-up. Obviously, tariffs had been a headwind for you and we\u2019ve got this trade deal on the horizon between the U.S. and China. Can you sort of talk about your expectations sort of for the trade outcomes and sort of like how that could impact it if things get resolved?","Olivier Filliol","So the deal that took place doesn\u2019t have a direct benefit to us. So the tariffs that we are impacted on are still in place. And I don\u2019t think there is anything near term here that could change. However, the fact that there was a deal between U.S. and China helps the overall economy helps confidence in China and that\u2019s good for us. Again, I do not expect that tariff situation will change you in the near term. And so we are assuming for tariffs, the status quo. And that means, we still have headwinds for tariffs for another two quarters.","Shawn Vadala","Yes. So just to be clear, we\u2019re going to have headwinds for Q1 of about 2%. It was the gross impact of tariffs and then we\u2019ll have a little bit of impacting Q2.","Derik De Bruin","Great. And just one final question, Shawn. What\u2019s the embedded number for operating margin expansion in your 2020 guide?","Shawn Vadala","Excluding the impact of currency, we\u2019re probably looking at about 70 basis point improvement in 2020. But currency will probably right now we\u2019re looking at it, it could have a headwind of up to 20 basis points.","Derik De Bruin","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Your line is open.","Patrick Donnelly","Great. Thanks, guys. Olivier, maybe just on the guidance since the last update last quarter, we now have the headwind from Food Retail turning negative for 2020, a little bit of uncertainty around coronavirus, a bit of a headwind in 1Q at a minimum. I\u2019m just kind of think through, how it seems like a few things have turned against you guys yet, you\u2019re maintaining that overall guide. Was there just enough conservatism in the original number, you\u2019re able to absorb these headwinds, maintain the guidance, maybe it\u2019s more fair now there\u2019s a little bit of a cushion removed or other just things in the portfolio improve a bit to allow you guys to maintain that number?","Olivier Filliol","I would say, I highlight two things. First, we did better than expected in Q4 and that day was \u2013 even more confidence in our execution, it shows that our programs are really going well on. And so that played a role. And the second one is, you mentioned here a few things that we are more concerned now, but then I would highlight core industrial that I feel better. And I highlighted, we had really a very good results here in Q4. And we have better confidence for the full year. So I think that\u2019s a combination of things. Net-net, I feel as comfortable about the guidance for this year as I was in November. And that\u2019s really why we keep the full year guidance even that we see here for Q1, a bigger target.","Shawn Vadala","And as we mentioned in the past too, one of the big questions we had a quarter ago is, what is it going to be like when we start to lap some of these tough comparisons in core industrial? I mean we just lapped 13% last year and we have one quarter behind us in that regard and now it gives us a little bit more confidence in the momentum in that business.","Patrick Donnelly","That\u2019s helpful. And then just on the recovery of the sales later in 2020 in China specifically, could you just talk through what gives you the confidence that those are going to come back? And then on top of that, just, any metrics that could help us think about, if this headwind does keep going, if China is shut down a little bit longer than February 10, how sensitive is the business to another week, another two weeks, et cetera, anything you can provide would be helpful there.","Olivier Filliol","So we \u2013 from experience, we have seen that if you have \u2013 if we have a significant slowdown, we have the pent-up coming back and that\u2019s just based on experience and we have every reason to feel the same way here. And as mentioned before, I do expect that the government will also support the economy and that we will benefit. And there are certainly areas where we probably going to see more investments, particularly in the area of life science as an outcome of this.","The second question, it\u2019s not an easy one to answer. To be honest, we have spent a significant time to review here with our local team. The impact now for this February 10 we sought. So I think it will mostly depend what kind of actions the government takes. If the government would suddenly extend this lock periods for operations that people would not allow to go back to the facility or so. That\u2019s one. But the other one is they might restricts travel. And I can\u2019t be give you good numbers here for all the different scenarios.","From today\u2019s perspective, I\u2019m not particularly concerned about the supply chain. I think we can master that and we have reasonable contingency, even if this takes a few extra days, I don\u2019t see that as a big problem. The bigger question is actually how our customers will react in that situation. That\u2019s the big one. I think what we can manage things we \u2013 you heard me saying before, we have contingency plan. When we think about alternatives, we have this tele-channel that we can activate and all that stuff. But it\u2019s difficult to anticipate what the customers will be. And we have so many different customers in China. You have international customers, you have the local ones, you have food, you have life science.","So every extension will impact our numbers. No question. But I think with our guidance that we gave you and the details we gave you \u2013 we gave you already quite some indication that this extra days of closing has a significant impact on our numbers. And if this is extended by one or two weeks, then you need to assume that our numbers will be worse than what we are guiding you right now in Q1, right.","Patrick Donnelly","I appreciate the color, Olivier. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tycho Peterson","Hey, thanks. On the cost side of things, you had flagged some cost reduction actions last year. I felt like they may be over in the first part of this year, but it seems like those programs are continuing. Is that a correct assumption? And are you accelerating any cost actions on the food business in light of what\u2019s now a lack of recovery there?","Olivier Filliol","Yes. And so we initiated the front cost actions. There were cost actions related to the Food Retail business. These were executed throughout last years and we\u2019re going to have the benefit also ongoing list here. There were also cost actions that we did in the area of IT, back office and so on. These were executed mostly in Q3. And so we have more benefits coming in this year. So yes, different things, we have benefits in 2020 coming from that. And we build it in our guidance.","Shawn Vadala","And then on top of that, of course, we have our ongoing programs under the stern drive umbrella that we\u2019re constantly doing as well too.","Tycho Peterson","And then Shawn, can you quantify the price contribution in the fourth quarter and you had the question before on tariffs, but as we think about those eventually kind of getting unwound, just your latest thinking on ability on the capture price this year in the environment?","Shawn Vadala","Yes. Sure. So in pricing, we\u2019re very pleased with the quarter. It came in very much as we expected, just slightly under 2.5%, which kind of puts us right at that same kind of number on a full year basis. And then in terms of tariffs, on an annualized basis, the gross headwind is about $25 million. As we\u2019ve kind of communicated in the past, if it all went away, some of the mitigation actions would also go away. We\u2019ve kind of mentioned in the past that we would see probably an EPS growth benefit of 1% to 1.5%. I\u2019d probably say sitting here today it\u2019s maybe closer to 1.5% kind of benefit on an annualized basis.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then just lastly, given the unchanged China outlook, setting aside the coronavirus impact, are you factoring in any government stimulus versus a macro slowdown there in the base business?","Shawn Vadala","We haven\u2019t \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s not like we have a formula where it\u2019s so micro, but I mean certainly it\u2019s in our thinking to give us confidence that we can still meet the midyear \u2013 I mean, I\u2019m sorry, the mid-single digit sales growth guidance for the full year for China. As kind of Olivier, kind of already mentioned with the expected recovery in the second half of the year. But certainly, that could be an upside that we could see in the latter parts of this year.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Dan Leonard","Thank you. Circling to China again. Can you elaborate on the fourth quarter performance, it came in better than we were looking for. Where did you exceed plan? And some of the other companies and analytical instruments talked about some weakness in China in Q4 and towards year end. Apparently you didn\u2019t see that. Can you discuss maybe what the differential trends you were seeing?","Shawn Vadala","Yes. We were very pleased with China, came in a little bit better than we expected 8% growth. On the laboratory side, we were double-digit growth. So we\u2019re very pleased with that given the stack comps that we\u2019ve talked to you about in the past, but equally very happy with the industrial business. I mean, our industrial business was up high single-digits, very strong high single-digits. So we\u2019re very pleased with that type of growth as well to. Offsetting that is we had a weaker results in the local retail business there. But otherwise very pleased with what we saw in the quarter. And frankly, we were feeling very good entering 2020 before the coronavirus situation.","Olivier Filliol","Yes. I would actually put it to really good execution by the team. I think the team does a fantastic job. They are very effective in implementing Spinnaker. And they are really good at going off to the industry segments that have the best opportunities. And that was very helpful in that environment that we experienced here in China last year.","Dan Leonard","And then my follow-up, how are you thinking about Europe into 2020? You\u2019re coming off three quarters here, where growth was barely about flat. You have a tough comp in Q1, so that\u2019ll be four quarters that type of result. How are you thinking about the outlook for that region looking forward? Thank you.","Shawn Vadala","We expect to get off to a slower start there. As you mentioned, we have our toughest comp there with a 9% growth in the prior year. Europe will also have a little bit of retail effect in the first quarter as well. But right now, we continue to feel like the economy has been good enough there. But we\u2019re very much aware of where PMI has had been over the last year. We continue to monitor it closely. But as we always say, as long as customers stick to their replacement cycles, we feel pretty good. And similar to China, we also have a very strong execution by our sales and marketing organization in Europe. And given that it\u2019s our largest direct business, we often get the most impact from a lot of our Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives there.","Dan Leonard","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Arias with Stifel. Your line is open.","Dan Arias","Afternoon guys. Thanks. Olivier, on the food business. It sounds like this will end up being a pretty prolonged period of just challenging conditions by the time all said and done. I guess I\u2019m wondering, once you recovered a bit, do you think there might be some new market share opportunities? Is that in the picture or is the competitive landscape pretty settled with a bunch of big players in it?","Olivier Filliol","I think the competitive landscape is quite settled because we are not running the Food Retail business for market share. We really run this business for profitability. We are focusing particular on large accounts. We are focusing on the most attractive countries. And in that sense, we have refined our strategy and are executing that strategy and we\u2019ll stick with it even when the market will recover.","Yes. I think we are really \u2013 we want to be very disciplined on that business. We have been running this strategy for quite a few years. And of course, it hurts when we see that it impact our top line. But this resource shifting that we are doing in the organization helps us to grow many businesses with excellent profitability, with excellent long-term growth opportunities.","And the Food Retail business, we did less of that. And as a consequence, it became smaller in percentage of the total business. Today, Food Retail is about 7% of our revenue. This is much less than what it was couple of years ago. And I feel this is the right strategy. So I\u2019m not irritated by these temporary challenges, but of course it hurts, no question.","Dan Arias","I got you. Okay. And then Shawn, I guess maybe this is a housekeeping question. But anything from a pacing perspective across the quarters of 2020 that look either different or clearer than they did back in October, aside from the obvious with the virus and food factors more additional on their fundamentals.","Shawn Vadala","Yes. No, of course the recovery from the coronavirus is now like the topic that\u2019s going to impact Q2 versus Q3, but nothing really standing out from my mind when I look at the rest of the year at this point in time.","Dan Arias","Okay. Thanks much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open.","Andrew Wall","Hi, this is Andrew Wall on for Jack. Turning to product inspection, can you walk us through some of your customer segments in the trends and spending?","Olivier Filliol","The biggest category is packaged food. And that\u2019s the biggest one. But you would also have, for example, the cosmetics industry also a little bit of pharma and you also have a meat, which can be unpackaged meat. So these are kind of the different categories. They are typically big companies. Many of them have global operations. Yes, that would characterize kind of the key end user segments.","This packaged food companies, the branded packaged food companies have a rather difficult period. There are new market trends from consumers that impact things. You have channel topics that they face, these branded consumer package companies. And you see that also kind of the overall performance of these companies\u2019 market caps and so on. And that has an impact on their investment behavior. And we feel that.","Andrew Wall","That\u2019s great. Thank you. And in Europe, have you seen any impact from stalking related to Brexit?","Olivier Filliol","No. The whole Brexit topic has not been a particular relevant one for us. Now we had our contingency plans in case it would have been a hard Brexit. Now things are really calm for us. And of course, if at the end of the year this hard Brexit becomes again a probability, then our contingency plan will be very relevant. But I want also to remind the UK it\u2019s about 3% of our revenue. So even if Brexit would have some demand implications, it\u2019s not so relevant for the group level.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Vijay Kumar","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Olivier, just maybe a big picture on the revenue side. I appreciate all the macro comments. But if you just look at over the last few years, lab products, it\u2019s running pretty hard. It did slow down in 2019. In 2019 you also had food, which was severe and you had tariffs, which were incremental. If the macro really hasn\u2019t changed, I\u2019m just \u2013 where is the delta coming in when you look at versus 2019 versus 2020. I think, putting all the pieces together, I think you\u2019re trying to say macro hasn\u2019t changed. But we\u2019re trying to be prudent. So maybe just walk us through on some \u2013 where you think could be the plus and minus.","Olivier Filliol","Let me have Shawn to respond here just to clarify a few things and then I\u2019ll come back.","Shawn Vadala","Yes. So Vijay, maybe one thing is that in 2018, if you\u2019re comparing it to growth in 2018, included a little bit of acquisition growth. So I think if you look at 2019 and 2018 on an organic basis, were both \u2013 above, I think it was 7% in both years. So from our perspective, we don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s any difference or slow down. And especially when you look at our growth on our multi-years stack basis, we feel very good about the business and the momentum. And if you look at inside the business, I think, particularly interesting this year as you saw very, very strong growth across many of the product categories.","And so it just shows you the breadth of the portfolio really working the robustness of the portfolio, lots of new products coming out in the last few years. And of course, lab benefits disproportionately from our Spinnaker initiatives just given the end markets and a lot of the focus. So we actually felt very good about lab entering this year, recognizing people might\u2019ve wanted us to guide higher than mid-single digit, but really it was very much just related to the multi-year stack comp.","Olivier Filliol","Yes, I leave it, I totally agree in that sense. I don\u2019t think there is a particular effect here that we need to highlight.","Vijay Kumar","Understood. And then maybe one last one. And Shawn, maybe I missed this. But the pricing assumption for 2020, is that consistent with 2019? And anything on the tax line, pluses or minus for 2020 versus 2019.","Shawn Vadala","Yes. So on the pricing side, we had kind of previously guided between a 150 basis points to 200 basis points, acknowledging that the last few years we\u2019ve been in that 200 plus basis point range. But I think it\u2019s also fair to say in the last few years, we\u2019ve also been able to take advantage of some inflationary situations or the tariff situation. We kind of entered 2020 with a lower inflation environment around the world. So I think we probably will see something more the 150 basis point to 200 basis point range. And then in terms of the tax rate, no change to 2020. We expect to be at 20% before discrete items in 2020.","Vijay Kumar","Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Steve Willoughby","All right, thanks for squeezing me in here. I guess, first Olivier, based on the feedback you\u2019re hearing from either internally or externally, how confident are you at this point that things get going again next Monday in China?","Olivier Filliol","From today\u2019s perspective, everything point out to this, but honestly things have changed a lot every day. We have been on the phone and the email exchanges every day and there was always news. I think in that sense, I am confident with the information that I have. But I have also seen that individual provinces make their own decisions and that can also influence us. It can be travel restrictions specific to provinces and so on. But again, from today\u2019s perspective, we do expect that we can re-launch our operations.","Steve Willoughby","Okay. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on that. Are you expecting any \u2013 in terms of the revenue headwind from this kind of extended holiday, does it impact the segments equally or would \u2013 one of the segments impacted more in the near term here?","Olivier Filliol","As I covered early on, first, we are impacted now just by the fact that we can\u2019t meet our customers. And that we can\u2019t really take orders or initiate quote and all these things. I would say, independent across all the industry segments. But then there are industry segments that will be impacted in terms of demand in Q1. I was highlighting that for example, retail will probably be more impacted than life science pharma customers, maybe even packaged food companies. So there will be differences.","Steve Willoughby","Very good. Shawn, just one quick one. If I have my notes correctly from a quarter ago, I had written down that you were thinking about 90 basis points of margin expansion this year, when backing out FX and I think you said, 70 basis points. I just wanted to clarify that.","Shawn Vadala","Yes. We were a little bit more optimistic on the margin maybe three months ago. One of the things kind of mitigating that was higher pension service cost. So there\u2019s a benefit below OP on that for the non-service part, but the service part is above OP. So they kind of largely offset each other in terms of EPS, but it\u2019s a little bit more of a drag on OP.","Steve Willoughby","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Brennan with UBS. Your line is open.","Dan Brennan","Great. Thank you. Thanks for taking the questions. Olivier or Shawn in terms of the 2020 kind of making up the temporary shortfall here in Q1. Does that work equally for both consumables and instruments? I would assume instruments, again, you likely kind of make those up, but I\u2019ve figured consumables, whenever research isn\u2019t done or whatever things aren\u2019t done in Q1 probably get lost. So can you just speak a little bit to, I know you\u2019re more instrument heavy. But how do you characterize kind of the ability to make up both instruments and\/or consumable whatever\u2019s loss in Q1?","Olivier Filliol","On the consumables topic, most of our consumable is actually related around liquid handling pipettes. Actually the pipette business could be one that has some upside from the whole thing. You can imagine, but pipetting is very important and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised that we saw a trend to on will be intensified. It\u2019s even an area that where you right now see in our Chinese business. So I don\u2019t think that we will lose on the consumable business for the full year. And even the other part of the consumable, I don\u2019t think will be much impacted. The consumable piece is impacted by the research activities and in the area of production. For example, when I think about process analytics and so on, I don\u2019t think that the demand would be impacted for the full year.","Shawn Vadala","And we might see something in field service. But that\u2019s a smaller part of the Chinese business versus our global average.","Dan Brennan","Great. And then I know you addressed this earlier, but I wasn\u2019t clear, maybe I just missed it. Are you assuming in the full year guide that the government does produce some additional stimulus or that Shawn, I think you may have actually said to Tycho\u2019s question that would actually could lead to upside. I just want a clarification on that.","Olivier Filliol","It\u2019s part of the pent-up recovery that we were mentioning before. It\u2019s not huge, but we have it\u2026","Shawn Vadala","It was a consideration.","Dan Brennan","Got it. And then this might be hard to do, but given coronavirus is kind of impacting a lot of things outside of China. But is it possible to kind of step back from coronavirus and say, you\u2019ve been pretty consistent since last year flagging these uncertainties and some pockets of weakness, but we have seen PMIs tick up a little bit here. Is it possible to look at \u2013 separate coronavirus from what you\u2019re seeing globally? And do you think as you look back over the last couple of quarters, are things looking any better or is it stable\/worse? Because the language seems similar, I just want to see how you\u2019d characterize the global environment for your businesses.","Olivier Filliol","It didn\u2019t change too much. I think, I was highlighting before that I felt better about our execution in Q4, particularly also in core industrial, but also overall I felt better on that piece. What came in weaker is Food Retail. And certainly we have certainly global economy things, but I wouldn\u2019t give too much weight on that. So net-net, I feel the same.","Dan Brennan","Got it. And then, maybe one more just on product inspection. What could we look forward in terms of visibility kind of the environment getting better? Is it packaged food CapEx? Are there any trends we can watch ourselves just to kind of see or get ahead? And when this market could begin to recover and you kind of see that investment spending happening?","Olivier Filliol","Package food CapEx is certainly a good indicator for that. This is an indication how much investment is going in packaging equipment and all the things that is. And in general, I would say when the consumer packaged food \u2013 consumer package companies recovering we will see investment going back into it.","Dan Brennan","Great. Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to the presenters.","Mary Finnegan","Thank you. And thanks everyone for joining us this evening. As always, if you have any questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out. Take care and have a good night, everyone.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."],"14901":["Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.

Please proceed, ma'am.","Mary T. Finnegan - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Thanks, Jennifer, and good evening, everyone. I am Mary Finnegan. I'm the Treasurer and responsible for Investor Relations at Mettler-Toledo. I'm happy that you're joining us tonight. I am joined by Olivier Filliol, our CEO, and Bill Donnelly, our Executive Vice President. I need to cover just a couple of administrative matters. The call is being webcast and is available for replay on our website. A copy of the press release and the presentation that we will refer to on today's call is also available on the website.","Let me summarize the Safe Harbor language, which we have on page two of the presentation.

More detailed information with respect to the use of and the differences between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided in our Form 8-K.","I will now turn the call over to Olivier.","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Thank you, Mary, and welcome to everyone on the call. I will start with a summary of the quarter and then Bill will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments before we open the lines for Q&A. The highlights for the quarter are on page three of the presentation.","Let me start by saying it was a very good quarter and it reflected strong strategy execution by our teams around the globe. Local currency sales growth was 9% in the quarter with broad-based growth in all regions and most product lines. Demand in the Americas and Europe was very good. Asia, rest of the world did particularly well with good growth in China and strong growth in most other countries in this region. We are very happy with these results, which reflects solid market conditions and as already mentioned, continued strong execution of our strategies.","With the benefit of our margin and cost initiatives, we had good growth in margins which contributed to excellent growth in earnings per share. Cash flow was also quite good in the quarter. We are very happy with our performance as well our outlook for the remainder of the year and 2017.","Before I turn it to Bill to cover the numbers, let me comment on the management changes that we announced today. Many of you have met Shawn Vadala most recently at our Investor Meeting in California in July. He has worked with Bill for almost 20 years and was promoted to CFO three years ago. Shawn is highly respected within our organization for his knowledge of our business and its processes as well as his business acumen.","Shawn has been a key contributor to many of our margin enhancement programs. For example, pricing has been an important profit driver for us and Shawn has led our efforts in pricing since the beginning. Shawn has also played an important role in helping effectively shape the resource allocation within the organization toward our strategic priorities of the fast growing, more profitable businesses. Shawn has worked closely with me to initiate our big data analytics programs. For the next 12 months we expect Shawn to continue to focus on his existing responsibilities and you will gradually see him more on the Investor Relations front beginning in about a year from now.","Some of you have also met Oliver Wittorf at our investor meeting. Oliver has been with us for 13 years and has one of the most diverse and key careers within our management team. Oliver has held a number of important roles including being Head of Operations for our Boston-based process analytics business. He was a project lead in China for our Blue Ocean program and for the last few years, he has held our Global Supply Chain Team Lead, which included our very successful procurement program and the establishment of our regional hubs.","He will keep his supply chain responsibilities and take over daily responsibility for IT and Blue Ocean. He is ideally suited for this expanded role within the organization. I am confident that both Shawn and Oliver have the experience and track record to be strong contributors to our executive team and to further the development of the finance, supply chain, IT and Blue Ocean functions within our organization. I have worked with both of them over many years and look forward to many more years with them in their expanded roles.","From an investor perspective, very little will change over the next 12 months and Bill and Mary will remain your principal contacts. Bill will gradually reduce his time commitments and beginning in 2018, Bill will begin to hand over the investor relations activities to Shawn and ensure a smooth transition. Mary will continue in her role in investor relations and treasury and continue to be your day-to-day contact.","Finally, I want to express how pleased I am that we have orchestrated a smooth and well-planned succession for Bill and that we can continue to leverage Bill's unique contribution to the company for another two years. Bill demonstrated his great leadership in nurturing his successors and often working with me to make this a gradual transition, which I'm very grateful for.","Let me hand it over now to Bill.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Thanks, Olivier, and hello everybody. Let me reiterate or reinforce Olivier's last point. I'm pleased about the transition that we've put in place, and proud that we have developed these two strongly highly capable leaders in Shawn and Oliver. Further I'm happy to continue to serve this great company and help drive its development for the coming two years, and of course, I also look forward to working with all of you.","Now, let me come back to the quarter and cover the financials. Sales were $650.6 million in the quarter. That's an increase of 9% in local currency. The Troemner acquisition contributed about 1% to that growth. On a dollar basis our sales grew by 8% as currencies reduced sales by about 1% in the quarter.","On slide number four, you have local currency sales growth for the third quarter. Our sales grew 7% in the Americas, 8% in Europe, and 11% in Asia\/rest of world. America's growth excluding Troemner was about 6%. In the next slide we provide year-to-date local currency sales growth which was 6%. By region, Americas had a growth of 7%. Europe is 4% and Asia\/rest of world has increased 8% on a year-to-date basis.","Now on to slide number six. We outline sales growth by product area for the quarter. Lab had good growth with local currency sales growth of 9%, of which approximately 2% was from Troemner. Industrial increased by 8% and food retailing increased by 13%. All these comparisons are versus the prior year.","The next slide summarizes year-to-date sales by product line. Lab had a local currency sales growth of 8%, industrial, 5% and food retailing 6%.","Now to slide number eight. Let me walk you through the key items in our P&L for the quarter. Our gross margins were 56.8%, that's a 60 basis point improvement over the prior year amount of 56.2%. Pricing and material costs decreased as pricing increases and material cost decreases contributed to the improved margin, which was offset in part by some targeted investments in our service business as well as an unfavorable mix.","R&D amounted to $30.1 million, that's a 6% increase in local currency. SG&A amounted to $187.7 million, that's an increase of 8% in local currency over the prior year. Higher variable comp largely explained by assumed higher performance against our budget targets, as well as investments in our Field Turbo program, were offset by cost savings in other parts of the business.","Adjusted operating income was $151.7 million in the quarter. That's a 13% increase over the prior year amount of $134.3 million. Currencies benefited operating profit by $1.5 million and, yes, that was not a typo. We had a currency benefit this quarter. The first one in some time. Adjusted operating margins were 23.3%, that's 110 basis point increase over the prior year.","A couple of comments to the P&L. Our amortization was $9.1 million while our interest expense was $7.2 million. Our effective tax rate continued to be 24%. Our fully diluted shares for the quarter were 26.9 million, that's a 4.4% decline from the prior year reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program.","Adjusted earnings per share was $3.89 per share, a 19% increase over the prior year amount of $3.26 per share. On a reported basis, earnings per share was $3.77 as compared to $3.16 in the prior year. Reported EPS includes $0.04 of restructuring, $0.05 of purchased intangible amortization, and $0.03 of acquisition transaction costs related to Troemner.","The next slide shows the year-to-date P&L. We had local currency sales growth of 6%, operating income increased by 9% and adjusted earnings per share increased by 15%.","Now taking a look at cash flow. In the quarter, free cash flow amounted to $125.6 million as compared to $107.1 million in the prior year.","We remain pleased with working capital management and achieved further improvements in DSO. ITO was 4.6, which was flat with last quarter. Cash flow on a year-to-date basis amounted to $263.7 million. That's an increase of 16% on a per share basis. For the year, we expect free cash flow in the $380 million range.","Now let's turn to guidance. We are raising our full-year 2016 local currency sales guidance to approximately 6% versus 5% previously. This reflects organic growth of approximately 5.5% and about 50 basis point of sales growth from the Troemner acquisition. We have also raised our earnings per share guidance and now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $14.61 per share to $14.66 per share. That's a growth of approximately 13%. This compares to our previous guidance of 11% to 12% growth or $4.40 per share to $4.50 per share.","With respect to the fourth quarter, we expect local currency sales growth to be approximately 5%. This includes approximately 1% growth from Troemner. We assume adjusted EPS will be in the range of $5.08 to $5.13. This reflects a growth rate of 9% to 10%.","Now let's turn to 2017. We are coming off a very strong third quarter and we have expectations for a solid Q4 as well. We believe we are executing well. We have a strong product pipeline. Our Spinnaker sales and marketing programs as well as our Field Turbo investments are yielding tangible results. These factors are within our control and we feel confident about them.","Offsetting these positives are some lingering questions regarding the global economy. In particular, we see continued risk in China, some uncertainty in Europe, and we will face tougher comps for example in our lab business as well as the Americas.","Taking into account these factors, we expect local currency sales growth to be about 5% in 2017. This will include 50 basis points from the Troemner acquisition. This should result in adjusted EPS in the range of $16.05 to $16.25 per share and that's a growth rate of 10% to 11%. We expect currency to reduce adjusted EPS growth by about 1% in 2017.","In terms of quarterly guidance for 2017, as usual, we'll provide that on our upcoming calls. However I know you'll be updating your model and I just want to point out that we will have a tough comp in Q3 next year, given the very strong results that we are reporting today.","In terms of currency impact on sales growth, we expect currency to reduce sales by about 1.5% in the fourth quarter. This will result in a 2% impact on sales growth for the full year 2016, and in 2017 currency should reduce sales by about 1.5%.","Finally, in terms of cash flow next year, we expect free cash flow to be in the $390 million range. This reflects a 6% growth on a per share basis, which is below our normal target and that has to do with higher capital expenditures.","As we explained last year, our CapEx levels in 2016 and 2017 are higher due to facility expansions related to our product inspection businesses as well as a facility consolidation we are doing in Switzerland. These expansions will amount to approximately $55 million in 2017. We've built into our assumptions $500 million of share repurchases next year, which is the same amount as we did this year.","Okay. That's it from my side, and I now want to turn it back to Olivier.","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Thanks, Bill. Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab had a very good growth in the quarter. All product lines performed well. Our strong product pipeline, benefit of Field Turbo investments and continued strong sales and marketing programs are all contributing to favorable results. Spending by our biopharma customers continues to be favorable. While government and academia was not strong in the West, it's not a big segment for us.","Industrial was stronger-than-expected in the quarter, including core industrial which increased mid-single digits. Core industrial was particularly strong in Asia\/rest of the world, but was up in China as well. In the Americas and Europe, we benefited from some projects in transportation and logistics, but the core industrial markets remain difficult.","Product inspection was up strongly in the quarter, with particularly good growth in Americas and Europe. We continue to penetrate large multi-national food companies as the supply of choice as they seek to standardize the product inspection equipment. We have made some good inroads over the last 12 months to 24 months and we expect good results in the fourth quarter as well.","Finally, retail increased 13% in the quarter, much better than we had expected as some projects moved forward for Q4. We had good growth in all regions. We would expect retail to be down in the fourth quarter.","Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales growth in the Americas continues to be very solid. Biopharma and food were our strongest segments. Lab had growth against strong comparisons in the prior year. Product inspection and retail did very well in the quarter with a number of large projects. Core industrial also had growth and benefited from some project activity in transportation and logistics, but as expected, many industrial segments remained weak.","Europe's growth exceeded expectations. Similar to the U.S., Biopharma and food were good segments. Lab and product inspection benefited from these trends. Core industrial benefited from some transportation and logistics activity, but similar to the U.S., many industrial segments were weak. Finally, retail also had very good growth, and as already mentioned, was partially due to some projects moving from Q4 to Q3.","Asia\/rest of the world grew double-digits in the quarter. Lab growth in China was again in double-digits with almost all product lines showing very good growth. We continue to be very pleased with this performance, which reflects the good demand, particularly in life sciences as well as the benefit of our actions to redirect resources to fast growing market segments.","Industrial in China had modest growth as we continue to be impacted by the overcapacity in the industrial manufacturing sector. We are seeing good growth in certain industrial markets such as chemical pharma and OEMs, but this is being overshadowed by weakness in markets such cement and metals. One final comment on the business. Service grew 6% in the quarter.","Those are all my comments on current business trends. Now let me provide a broader update on our strategy and how it continues to evolve and positions us well for the next year and beyond.","Let me start with our sales and marketing strategies. At our Investor Day in July we discussed one of our new initiatives in this area and that is our effort to generate leads and better focus our sales efforts by leveraging big data. Our data sources include our contact database, our installed base of instruments, hits on mt.com, and increasingly rich data streams from Blue Ocean as well as some third-party data.","We are becoming more sophisticated in how we use this data to target incremental growth. We are in the early stages of developing the potential of big data, but we already see opportunities to refine our current strategies and identify new sources of growth and sales productivity.","As shared at the Investor Day, we are using big data to help us identify better where customers are investing, account locations that need more focus on cross-selling, and the likely effect this means to succeed. We also recently launched Spinnaker 5, which is focused on increased sales productivity. The tools from Spinnaker 5 are being used to help units refine their channel strategy, more effectively balance the resources between field and inside sales, and achieve better results in account penetration and cross-selling.","Finally, we have started our next wave of Field Turbo and expected to add 200 additional field resources in 2017. We believe the first waves of this Field Turbo program have been effective in helping us gain share.","We talk to you a lot about sales and marketing, but our share gains would not be possible without an excellent product pipeline. It continues to be very strong, particularly on the lab and product inspection side. Let me give you one example from our Rainin pipette business. As a reminder, we have proprietary pipette with superior ergonomic design and which each have an embedded RFID chip for tracking. The team is now launching SmartStand, an easy-to-use pipette asset management system. This instrument can store up to four pipettes and read the embedded RFID chip to immediately determine if the pipette is within required calibration specification.","For regulated labs in the pharma biotech industries, this is a major support tool that eliminates the manual and time-consuming process of tracking calibration dates to verify the pipette is proper to use. Our pipettes have long been known for the ability to provide reproducible data. SmartStand further helps our customers to ensure this data was generated on a verified pipette.","We believe it will help drive our service business as well as lab conversions, as more researchers seek to benefit from our RFID-enabled pipettes. This is one new product launch that's representative of how we continue to drive value of our customers.","As you can see, we have much underway in terms of targeting top-line growth. We also continue to make very good progress on our margin initiatives. Our pricing, productivity and supply chain initiatives continue to evolve and yield tangible results. There is a lot of work behind all of this, particularly in an organization as ours that has so many complexities. With continued diligence, we can move these initiatives to the next level.","That concludes our prepared remarks. In summary, we believe we are executing well and market conditions are good enough for our customers to keep their replacement cycles. With the benefit of our growth initiatives, we believe we are continuing to gain share and continue to improve our margins. Assuming demand in our markets remain stable, we expect to continue to generate good sales and earnings growth.","I want to now ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Tim Evans with Wells Fargo Securities.","Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you so much. On the strength in industrial, it sounded like the growth there was driven primarily \u2013 or the surprise I should say \u2013 was driven primarily by a couple transportation and logistics items. If you stripped those out, would the underlying growth have kind of been that low single-digit territory where it's been running? And secondarily, I was wondering if those two projects were pulled forward from Q4. Thanks.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","So maybe, so first, for our industrial business in total, the key good performer was actually product inspection. Product inspection grew by low double-digits in the quarter. We did do mid single-digit kind of growth in our, what we would refer to as our core industrial business. That business would have been maybe \u2013 trying to do the math here in my head \u2013 maybe 1.5 less without the T&L projects.","The T&L projects maybe weren't as close on our radar screen, and frankly they are a little bit smaller. The retail projects did move from Q4 into Q3, and that's the one that was we more had in mind with that reference to coming a little earlier than we expected. The T&L project I think largely came in maybe in total a little better than we expected, but wasn't so much different than we expected from a timing point of view.","Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Just a couple quick things. Good afternoon, by the way. Could you just dig into pricing here a little bit? Not just on this quarter, but also Bill, what kind of price? Did we trendline price out into 2017 when we talk about guidance?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yeah. We did. We run a couple different scenarios. So I think the good news on pricing is that the tools we have, the strategies we have, the products we get to apply pricing to continue to get better. But it is a lower inflation environment globally. That represents some different challenges, so I think kind of at a baseline level, I could imagine we maybe only do 150 bps next year. But I also see some upside in terms of Shawn and the team are putting together some new things in the area, for example of services, where I think we have some opportunity and also reaching out to some other countries. So I hope that there is a little bit of upside to that number too.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then I also just had a question, Olivier, when we talk about the 5% growth for 2017, would you just kind of handicap the risk to that number, either geographically or by product segments? I'm curious, where might you see the biggest risk, and conversely, maybe the one area or two areas where you see the best possibility of upside?","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Okay. In terms of risk, if I look to Asia, it's particularly China, and how will industry do in China? And that's rather difficult to predict and as we described before, for industry China, their segments that do well, chemical, food and so on and the others still difficult. But forecasting and anticipating how the Chinese economy do overall is difficult and the industrial business is particularly exposed to the cycles in China.","And of course we have also comparison topics. We have, for example, a very strong performance in biopharma, I would here highlight, including also in Europe. And we going to feel that next year. How will this evolve is, in that sense a certain risk in it.","Now, on the upside, I would say China industry could actually clearly come stronger in than we expect. As I mentioned before, there is a high volatility on that one, so that's one. If biopharma continues to be that strong, we would benefit across many businesses. That would be really nice. And then there is a certain pent-up demand that we had always seen when a overall economy strengthen, pent-up demand in CapEx where core industrial would benefit in particular. So that's another upside that I could see.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","One thing strengthened. Okay. And just maybe one last question, promise; just kind of open ended question here a little bit. I think \u2013 Olivier, I think you and Bill, if I'm not mistaken kind of do your annual budget \u2013 global tour of your regions in September\/October period. And I'm just curious if there's any next level observations either politically or from a business perspective that \u2013 if I'm right on the timing of your tour \u2013 that you brought back with you from, in particular China?","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Particular China. Actually...","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","China, I think the one thing the guys told us about was that at the beginning of next year the Chinese Politburo will do their changes. The two top guys will stay in place. If we look back at that historically, this has typically been a time where you maybe see a little bit is \u2013 like, people kind of wait-and-see. But the guys are a little bit more optimistic this year, because with the two top guys staying in place and a lot of people frankly worried about the Chinese economy that there will be more emphasis to kind of keep growing. And so, I don't think \u2013 the five-year plan's in place and I think it's just \u2013 they are optimistic that we won't see a slowdown there.","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Actually, in that context the change takes place early in the year and everybody feels by Chinese New Year the uncertainty should be gone. This is different to past changes. And past changes where really the whole team, and this time it's a few people that will retire, age wise, and so there is continuity in the political leadership.","One other highlight that we saw during this business review in China was our strengthening position in lab and in particular, Pipettes and pH. I was very pleased to hear that we are winning market positioning and becoming leaders in Pipettes and pH in China which is \u2013 typically takes a couple of years and is very attractive, because of course these are businesses with great profitability, great consumable streams. So this is our examples. We had certainly many more from other countries too. One that for example just to share with, in India we are so pleased to see how the growth goes there.","We talked a lot about this Made in India that how this is helping. I mentioned that I love it, because for us we always depend also that the industrial manufacturing is important, drives quality, drives to export industry and that's for example something that I could feel very strongly when I met the Indian team.","We see it in our good numbers. They one thing, next year they are moving to a VAT tax structure and that could in the short-term impact a little bit our numbers. But, so every country has something specific. And it was good to sense it. All in all, we came back from the tour in a very positive way. Extremely pleased by the plans, but also \u2013 and I think you referred to that a little bit, the macroeconomic and the government environment, we feel good about that.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","I'm curious, on the biopharma side, whether by any of this sort of distinct customer sub-segments you saw notable changes in demand or whether there was any bias between higher-priced instrumentation, lower price instrumentation, because we've definitely seen some choppiness from, maybe not peers, but others who address the customer base. So we're just trying to discern if it was a price point question or really it's maybe more specific to certain sub-segments.","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Was actually really broad based, and important to say, it's certainly not particular the big pharma. Actually we even saw a few ones in big pharma that slow down some of their purchasings due to internal things like new procurement initiatives and so on. Now, it was in essence broad based. We see good activities with CMOs. We see good activities with CTOs. And we have many businesses that serve this market. So from production to research, we benefited. And I didn't see any particular patterns between the more sophisticated or the more value instruments. It was broad based.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks, Olivier. And maybe, Bill, just quickly on the tax line for next year, I would have thought you guys \u2013 maybe you mentioned it and I missed it but \u2013 have gotten a little bit of a benefit from the stock comp tax shield. I'm just curious what the assumption is there.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","So, we assumed a 24% rate now. We are working through the models. As you guys know, we've been hitting this 24% tax rate for a while, but running a cash tax rate lower than that, in part explained by stock options. So we're \u2013 got to go through and see with the accountants where we come out, but I would assume that that could benefit us a couple percentage points when things get final.","I think what \u2013 I'm not sure how much you've studied it yourself, Ross, but one of the things that I think is awkward about it is, it's got to mean people could have quite different tax rates by quarter. So, one of the things we would be dealing with is, we could maybe estimate what the full year impact was, but the nature of it would make our tax rate jump around quite a bit in the quarters, and I think it will take an increased level of investor communication to predict that. And in part, that's why I think we'll wait until maybe February to elaborate on what it will precisely mean for us. But you're right, it's positive.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. Just a couple of clarifications for me. (35:54)","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Hey, Steve. If you are still talking, I think we lost you. It's gotten very quiet.","Operator","And Steve, your line is open.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hello?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Steve?","Operator","And I believe we've lost Steve. And our next question is from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. I want to spend a minute on Europe. You had a big quarter there and I know you called out the pull forward effect in the retail business. Hoping you could maybe quantify how much that contributed to the local currency growth and wondering if maybe there was a \u2013 secondary effects where maybe your market share gains that you referenced were concentrated in the region and that also helped. Just trying to reconcile the fact that you grew so well there versus what we're seeing everywhere else.","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Bill will talk about the quarter effect. Let me just say, overall, it was a great quarter for Europe. Lab and product inspection was particularly strong, really. And also for Q4, in general, good, but we will have declined in retail. But for example, product inspection, that did very well in Q3, will continue to do also Q4 well. So maybe, Bill, just on this effect between the two quarters?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","So our retail business in Europe was \u2013 sorry, lost my spot \u2013 was up about 14% and I think it will be down probably double-digits in the fourth quarter. So it's just kind of a timing topic. As you know, our retail business at the gross and operating margin line's a little less than the other businesses. So, not such a material impact in terms of operating margin and profitability flow through, but yes, timing wise that was the impact.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And then just a clarification question on China. Appreciate your comments on the political backdrop. I just want to clarify that that's the reason why you guys kind of called out the potential for a little bit of risk next year in that region as opposed to any fundamental changes in key end markets. Just want to make sure I understood the sources of risk that you guys are keeping an eye on?","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Hey, I would say on China, we have seen that predicting China is little bit more difficult and I think particularly for the industrial business. And it's difficult to say when certain industry will pick up again and start to really invest in capacity expansion and all these things. And it could also turn in the other direction. So we are cautious about particular the industrial business. On the lab business I feel much more comfortable that we will have a steady growth.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understood. Thanks so much, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good afternoon.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Hey, Derik.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a few questions. So, Bill, can you quantify or just give us some guidance on what you are looking for in terms of gross margin expansion year-over-year 2016 to 2017? What's embedded in your guidance?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","40 basis points, 45 basis points, something in that range up to 50 basis points depending kind of on how currency plays out, and also of course the comments on our pricing initiatives as well, whether we do a little bit better than the 150 bps.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. At your Analyst Day you mentioned, and you just mentioned on the call here your initiative to sort of target and discover where you installed base is and sort of targeting upgrades and replacements in that. I guess, how far into that initiative are you and I guess when we really start seeing some incremental benefits of that? And the question is like, how much of your installed base do you think is amenable to that sort of activity?","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","So, we have two big data initiatives that we talked about at the Investor Day. One was these old product replacement initiatives where we have today a very good transparency on all our products installed around the world. And we data mine this to, and associate specific marketing programs to bring these products either under the service contract or upgrade\/replace the product. This is ongoing and in that sense we have already benefit. But it's a long journey. This installed base is so huge, and of course our customers don't instantly replace it just because we send the marketing materials or we send over a salesperson with a dedicated value proposition.","So I see that as one of many initiatives that we have in Spinnaker that help us drive further growth. We see already the benefit. It will continue to benefit us for many more years. And the same is true actually for the second initiative where we generate sales force targets based on big data analytics and this is something we started to pilot early in the year and we have been scaling it up in Q2. We start to see the benefits, but we have many more years to go until we see saturation in the upside of that.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And then just wanted a clarification. For 2017, what's embedded in terms of the interest income expense line?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","So on interest expense we've got $32.6 million built in.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you. Very helpful.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. Can you maybe talk on expectations by segment for 2017, what's embedded in guidance for each of the divisions? And then can you quantify what you are expecting for growth in China as well?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Sure. So let me start with the product areas. So I think something in the mid single-digits for the lab business makes sense, 5%, 6%. I kind of it use now the midpoint of our overall range. In terms of our industrial business, something in the 5% range as well, mid single-digits, but maybe the mix there would be our product inspection business growing faster than our core industrial business. And then a flat or maybe low single-digit growth in retail would kind of get you to the overall picture.","And then if you look at it geographically, we're thinking Europe could be low to mid depending on best case\/worst case. The Americas probably mid single-digits and then both Asia and China overall, we think mid single-digits probably anyway and could be into the high single-digits.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then can you comment on linearity in the quarter? I know you had the question before about kind of your global tour, but I'm actually just wondering how things progressed throughout the quarter and then any commentary on October trends in particular, if things were off trend relative to what you saw? Thank you.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","I mean, we finished with good order entry, which would be an early indicator for us in terms of September. I think the combination of October and November, which is the piece we have the most visibility on remains pretty solid. I think, as you know Tycho, many of us in the peer group have a certain amount of budget flush. I think we made a reasonable assumption in terms of it being a typical year with budget flush. But December is always the hardest one to predict. Things just come that you didn't have on your radar at all and you just hope you got at least as many as last year.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then just lastly on food retail. I know you talked about that being down in 4Q, but just a visibility on kind of orders there. Are there some bigger tenders coming through? Obviously you saw some pull forward in 3Q. Just wondering what the outlook for that business is.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Hey, if you're okay, Tycho, I think we might have a little bit. It tends to be that after Thanksgiving, and people tend to avoid in the holiday season delivering on many big projects. But there is a lot of work done by our customers in terms of thinking about the next year. So maybe when we see it or when we talk again in February, we'd have a bigger or a better way to answer that. At this point, there are a number of big jobs and that are in play, but the way those work out, what percentage of the big job you get, we won't know for a little while, much less the timing on them.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Citigroup.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks. Bill, you touched on service. Do you think service growth outstrips product growth again next year? And if so, how wide do you sort of envision that spread being?","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Actually, this is our strategy. We feel like we can grow service. We want to grow service more than the product growth. And yes, this is part of our plan for next year. If we grow as we guide you, this should actually be possible. We have very good programs in place. And we have seen, actually, different regions with very strong growth year-to-date in service. I would highlight, for example, Asia. So, yeah, I have that expectation for next year.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then maybe just on the margin opportunity next year, if you look at indirect spend, which I think is something that you guys have been targeting, how much of what you see there in percentage terms is what you might call effectively managed or sort of where you want it, versus what's still open for improvement, and do you think that can be a meaningful source of savings next year as we look to 2017? Thanks.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Sure. So, our indirect spend number is actually the base of it, it's a number in excess of our material spend or direct material spend. I think it's the amount we have under control is in the $500 million range. We have \u2013 sorry, the amount of it's in the $500 million range and I think we have more than 50% now being under what we would refer to as category management.","So I think that number will climb a little bit, but I think the way we look at it is we're always trying to come up with new programs that can drive further savings in there. I think we, this year, will save a number in the high single-digit million range and I think we should be able to deliver a number in that range again next year.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Groberg with UBS.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Congratulations for the quarter. Although, I have to say, Bill, it's a sad day to get the press release that we got today that you're leaving although. I've been talking with a few clients, we say only you guys could blow out a quarter and leave yourselves two years for the transition, so I appreciate that.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Sure.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","And I guess just a couple of follow-ups here. Around the quarter itself, it looks like maybe about $0.05 of the quarter you didn't pass on to the full-year. Is that just conservatism, is that some of the pull forward, maybe talk a little bit about that?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yeah, a little bit \u2013 yeah, the movement on the retail is probably the retail projects is probably the biggest piece.","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","I think Mary maybe told me currency got worse by a $0.01 or $0.02 I think as well.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then, Olivier, on the Field Turbo update, I think you said you were going to add 200 people in 2017. Any particular geography or customer segmentation standout in terms of where those are going?","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yeah. Hey. Lab gets quite some attention, and we will add a couple of people for example for our automated chemistry business that we presented to you also in July. We are adding a couple of people for our pH lab business that has a high profitability. And from a geographic standpoint, we have for example Southeast Asia, where we're adding again quite a significant number of people in the context of building up Philippines, Indonesia.","But it's relatively broad-based. I had presented today to the board the annual plan where we're adding turbos and we had a geographic map on it. It was nice to see how well spread it is and that's actually the strength of the program that we are working on many projects in parallel and you have many managers that are also supervising and managing these.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Can you guys hear me this time?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","We can, Steve.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Well, thanks for giving me a second crack at it here. So I'm going to ask just one question, but it's a three part or so that's why I'm going to limit myself to just one. The basic topic is are there any items you might want to flag in terms of the progression over the next year or so from quarter-to-quarter? Specifically, I'm wondering and this is I guess a follow-up to Tim's question, is there any impact from timing items in the third quarter that might actually impact 2017 given you mentioned some of those were actually items that were further out?","The second piece would be selling days. Any selling day abnormalities, either actually in the third quarter or looking forward? And then the third part of my three-parter is, anything next year aside from the tough comp that we should consider as you think about the progression of incremental margins?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Okay. Good questions. I have answers to at least some of them. Let me start with those and I will have Mary flipping me some lines as well as Shawn. So progression for quarter-to-quarter, I think we kind of mentioned in the conference call script that I think Q3 is got to be a tough comp a year from now. I think you can kind of play it out that way.","Not all of it will. If you look at incremental margins it won't be as big an issue there because of the high retail content. You can also assume that we get about a percent or so of sales growth from Troemner in the first two quarters and that stops in Q3 and Q4. In terms of working days, I think the \u2013 it's flat in Q3 of this year and Q4, it's minus 2 working days. And for 2017, I think there is a day difference, that we have a day more in Q1 of 2017 and we catch it back up in Q2. And then it looks like there is one less day in Q3. But I don't think those should be so material.","In terms of other things to think about, I can't think. Another one might be timing of some of our Blue Ocean Go-lives. I \u2013 those don't jump out to me right now in terms of being particularly large units, so I think that that shouldn't be so much of an issue. Yeah, I think all of us are kind of nodding that those would be the key items.","I think the one other item would be in response to like a follow-up to make sure it resonated with people. Ross asked earlier about this new accounting regulations surrounding accounting for the income tax benefits of stock options in excess of actual value and I think that we are working on trying to estimate that impact now for the full-year. But I do think the way the accounting rules are written, it will lead to quite a bit of volatility by quarter, and that's something that I think we're going to almost have to guide you quarter by quarter at this stage. And so, I would maybe suggest people just leave it typical Mettler flat 24% for now, and that's what we've given you in terms of guidance. But it will probably be an improved number when we talk to you in February, but we're still estimating what that will be. Did I get all the parts to your questions, Steve?","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Sorry. Any impact of timing items in the third quarter on revenues in the first half? It sounded like some of the timing items in the third quarter impacted the events that you actually thought would go further out?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","I think it's mostly a retail topic and it's mostly \u2013 will work itself out Q3 to Q4. So, at this stage I don't see anything \u2013 but we'll let you know. I don't see anything happening in the fourth quarter that would push things out to Q1 in particular.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks so much.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Hi, Brandon.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Bill, you may have just answered my question in the context of the number of days in the fourth-quarter. But even if we strip out the pull-forward of the food retail surge in the third quarter, on the two, three, four year stacked comp basis, you still accelerated on each of those metrics pretty materially in the third quarter, which your guidance seems to suggest a step backward in the fourth, is that simply the days' effect?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yeah. It's \u2013 hey, I think the \u2013 if you look kind of the impact of the retail moving between the two quarters is 2%. So if you start by reconciling we grew 9%, 8% organically. You kind of get 2 points off to compare the two quarters and then there is 1 point or 1.5 point left. And some of that could be working days. Some of it's the \u2013 just the forecast of how we see things. Some of it might be we're just underestimating a budget flush.","I think it \u2013 I would acknowledge that it's the quarter for us that we find most difficult to forecast, Brendon. But we had done the same stack analysis you did along with a series of other internal forecasting measures to kind of come up with this number and we think it's realistic, but I guess we'll see when the numbers come through.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then two more. Do you actually give the China growth rate in the third quarter? And then secondly, you've pointed to I think a 1% headwind on EPS next year from currency. Does that include the heads roll-off affect?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yes. That includes the heads roll-off affect and our growth in China in the quarter was 8% and it's 8% for the full \u2013 year-to-date.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Super. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research.","Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Good afternoon, guys. Two quick things for you. Wondering if you could comment at all about what you're seeing in the U.K. over the last few months post-Brexit?","And then secondly just on Field Turbo, now that you're in the third wave of adding people if you could provide any color on how quickly these head count additions are ramping up and how quickly they basically start paying for themselves?","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Good to hear on the first one. So just to put in perspective, the U.K. is about 3% of our revenue. And, yes, our business has slowed down and it certainly also associated with the Brexit discussions that we have. Of course, our customer base is faced with uncertainty and we see it in our business. What we also did, we had significant price increases that we implemented in the U.K. to offset, of course, the weakening of the pound.","Now, just talking about the pound I wanted you to be aware that we have a net short position towards the pound because we have two major manufacturing plants of our product inspection. So, that's at least on the positive side for us. And we will see how it further develops. Typically, when these things happen in a country you have in the short-term an effect and then things rebalance.","The second question about the Field Turbo, so we have different ways. There are so many different projects as I described before, so not all of them have the same payback time, I would for example, Asia-Pac, the investments that we do in Southeast Asia that will have a faster paybacks than for to the investments that I referred to in automated chemistry.","But all in all, we say, we want to have them reach a breakeven after a year and kind of after two years they should cover their initial investments, and that's also the beauty when we do these in ways. But on a regular basis, the older ways also helped fund the new ways. Okay?","Operator","And we have no other questions in queue at this time. And I would like to turn the call back over to our presenters.","Mary T. Finnegan - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Thanks, Jennifer. And, hey, thanks everyone for joining the call tonight. Of course, if you have any questions, as always, don't hesitate to send us an email or give us a call. Take care. Thanks.

I'm the Treasurer and responsible for Investor Relations at Mettler-Toledo, and I'm happy to welcome you to the call. I am joined here today by Olivier Filliol, our CEO; and Bill Donnelly, our Chief Financial Officer. I want to cover just a couple of administrative matters. This call is being webcast and is available on our website. A copy of our press release and the presentation that we refer to on today's call is also available on our website.

I will start with the summary of the quarter and then Bill will provide details on our financial results and our updated guidance. I will then provide an update on some of our growth initiatives in 2012. As always, we will have time for Q&A at the end. ","The highlights for the quarter are on Page 2 of the presentation. We are very pleased with our local currency sales growth of 8%, which was strong and better than expected. We achieved this despite slower growth in our markets and challenging conditions in Europe. In addition, last year's sales growth was particularly strong. Adjusted operating profit increased 10% and adjusted EPS increased 14%. Overall, we are very pleased with these solid results in the start of the year. ","I will have some additional comments on our growth initiatives, but let me turn it to Bill to provide more details on the first quarter results as well as guidance.","William P. Donnelly","Thanks, Olivier, and hello, everybody. Let me start with additional details on sales, which were $535.4 million in the quarter, an increase of 8% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased by 7%, which included a negative impact of 1% due to currency. ","Turning to Page 3 of the presentation, we outlined sales by geography. In the quarter, local currency sales growth increased by 2% in Europe, by 7% in the Americas, and by 17% in Asia\/Rest of World. Acquisitions contributed approximately 2% to total growth with 3% benefit to Europe and a 2% benefit to the United -- to the Americas. ","On Slide #4 of the presentation, we outlined our sales by product area. In local currency, laboratory sales increased by 8% and industrial sales increased by 10%, while food retailing was down 1%. Acquisitions contributed approximately 5% to industrial growth in the quarter. ","Turning to Slide #5 of the presentation, we show the P&L. Let me walk you through some key items. Gross margins were 51.8%, a 60 basis point decline versus last year. We benefited from pricing and reduced material costs in the quarter. However, these benefits were more than offset by mix, especially a significant component of lower margin industrial projects in China, as well as the fact that our mix of sales towards Europe was less than usual and we enjoy high margins on our European sales. Currency was also a drag on margins. ","R&D amounted to $28.7 million, an increase of 8% in local currency. SG&A amounted to 176 -- $167.6 million, an increase of 4% in local currency. The increase was attributable to higher sales and marketing investments, particularly in emerging markets, which was offset partially by lower variable compensation. ","Adjusted operating income amounted to $80.8 million, which represents a 10% increase over the prior-year amount of $73.8 million. Our operating margins amounted to 15.1%, a 30-basis point increase over the prior-year level. We estimate that currencies, largely the impact of the Swiss franc versus the euro, reduced operating profit growth by 1% and our operating margin by 20 basis points in the quarter. ","A few final comments on the P&L. Amortization was $5.2 million, interest expense was $5.8 million, while fully diluted shares for the quarter were 32.4 million. Adjusted EPS was $1.66 per share, a 14% increase over the prior year reported amount of $1.45. The benefit of our lower tax rate offset currency headwinds in the quarter. On a reported basis, earnings per share was $1.62, a 15% increase over the prior-year amount of $1.41. ","Now let me turn to cash flow. The first quarter is typically our lowest cash flow generation quarter, but we're pleased with the solid start to the year. As a reminder, cash flow is seasonally weaker as it includes the payout of prior-year bonuses. Free cash flow amounted to $4.2 million in the quarter versus a negative $7.2 million last year. DSO stands at 43 days, while ITO on an LTM basis stands at 4.3x. ","One final comment on our balance sheet before I turn to guidance. We are currently rated BBB\/Baa2 by S&P and Moody's, respectively. With our December refinancing, our new bank agreement no longer requires ratings as part of the price grid, instead the price grid is based on leverage. The private placement market is our principal source of long tenure debt and private placements don't require ratings. We, therefore, intend to drop our ratings in the coming weeks and eliminate the related costs there. I wanted to just mention this so that you would have some context when I assume Moody's and S&P will communicate that they're dropping our ratings. ","Okay, now let me turn to guidance. Let me start with some general comments and then get into specifics. First, we're pleased with the start to the year. It was a good start. We expect to continue to grow faster in the coming quarters than our underlying markets, but we do remain cautious about the overall economic environment, particularly Europe. ","Second, currencies are modestly worse than the last time we spoke. I'm specifically referring to the currency impact on earnings, not in terms of the sales line. In particular, the Swiss franc-euro exchange rate, as well as the Japanese yen versus the dollar are slightly more negative than the last time we spoke. With this backdrop let me provide some specifics on our guidance. ","For the full-year 2012, we expect local currency sales growth to be in the range of 5.5% to 7.5%, so that's local currency sales growth, 5.5% to 7.5%. This compares to our previous guidance of 5% to 7%. The half-point increase reflects better-than-expected growth in Q1, as well as considerations for our outlook for Q2. Our local currency estimates that I just provided include approximately 50 to 100 basis points of acquisition sales growth. ","We would also expect currencies to reduce our U.S. dollar sales growth by about 2%, so that local currency number should be about 2% less in dollar terms. ","Now, we expect currencies to also reduce EPS growth for the full year by about 1%. The last time, we had expected currencies to have a more modest effect on earnings. Given this, we're not changing our guidance for the year. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $9.20 to $9.50, which represents a growth of between 10% and 14%. For the second quarter, we expect local currency sales growth to be in the range of 5% to 7%, and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.10 per share to $2.15 per share, a growth rate of between 11% and 13%. We would expect currencies to reduce U.S. dollar sales growth by approximately 3% in the quarter. ","Okay, that covers my comments on guidance and the financials, and now I want to turn it back to Olivier.","Olivier A. Filliol","Thank you, Bill. Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Labs did very well in the quarter with an 8% local currency sales growth, which was on top of a 16% growth in prior year. All product lines did well with process analytics and balances particularly strong. Automated chemistry also did well, but their comparisons were a bit easier. We are benefiting from our strong sales and marketing initiatives, as well as good product pipeline. ","Industrial was up mid-single digits on an organic basis, with both product inspection and core industrial in this range. We are quite pleased with these results, particularly given the excellent result in the year-earlier period, when sales were up 21%. Retail was down slightly in the quarter, but had tough comparisons on an organic basis. ","Now looking at the geographies, Europe was down slightly on an organic basis. This was again 16% growth in the prior year. Given the environment and the prior-year comparisons, we were not expecting much growth in this region. We remain cautious on Europe, but would expect to see a bit better growth in Q2 as comparisons will be easier. Americas was up 5% on an organic basis. Lab was up solidly, while industrial was relatively flat. Our core industrial business was up nicely, while product inspection was impacted by very strong sales in the prior year. ","Finally, turning to Asia\/Rest of World, which was up 17% in the quarter, better than we had expected. Labs continues to do very well. Industrial also did well, but a bit lower than what we have experienced over the last several quarters. We expect sales in this region to continue to be good, but expect growth to moderate slightly from the levels we saw in Q1. ","That provides some context on how we view our business today. We believe we can continue to grow faster than our underlying markets and execution of our growth initiatives is key in achieving this. Let me provide some example of recent initiatives. ","With sales and service organizations in 35 countries, our global reach is an important competitive advantage as we have many competitors that are regionally focused. Last month, we extended our worldwide presence with the opening of our own organization in Turkey. We have operated in this region through distributors for some time, but believe we can more aggressively capture growth with our own sales and service organization. This market is attractive for our laboratory products given the importance of the pharmaceutical, chemical and food end markets. By utilizing our Spinnaker marketing techniques, including segment marketing and database development, we can expand our presence in the country. Equally important, we can go out to service opportunities in these region. ","We are also expanding our sales presence in Vietnam, Indonesia and Dubai. New products also continue to be an important driver of our growth. We have many new launches including a new generation of moisture analyzer and related proprietary consumables. Moisture analyzer are used in quality control in a wide variety of industries including food and pharmaceutical. We have incorporated many of the innovative features from our balances and titrators into these new generation instrument. For example, the design includes a hanging weighing pan, this is the first of its kind for moisture analyzers. This design enhances measuring performance since heat, which can interfere with weighing accuracy, can now be isolated from the weighing center. ","We have also incorporated our one-click interface which makes operation simple, error-free and fun, resulting in greater productivity for the customer. We are complementing this instrument launch with the introduction of a disposable reference substance. We refer to it as the SmartCal, that can be used to document the performance of the instrument in a simple 10-minute test. This is by far the fastest and easiest quality control test on the market today and provides a nice consumable stream for this instrument. We believe we are setting a new global standard for moisture determination with this introduction. ","This is just one example of numerous product launches currently underway. In addition to Spinnaker marketing and new product launches, we're also focused on margin improvements. As a reminder our principal levers for margin growth are pricing, supply chain optimization, low-cost country manufacturing and productivity programs centered on Kaizen or Lean initiatives. Today, let me highlight some productivity initiatives that are underway in Asia. ","In China, with the Blue Ocean implementation substantially behind us, we have a continued focus on growth but also renewed attention to productivity gains. The goal is to more than offset inflationary pressure to drive margin improvements. Early in the first quarter, we kicked off a new Lean program with a particular focus to reduce the overall cycle time. That is, we're looking at the entire process from supplier to customer, and have set an ambitious goal to reduce cycle time by 25%. Kaizen is a key tool of the program as we review business processes, such as order entry, service dispatching and others. ","We expect to not only achieve improved cycle times at quality levels but to realize incremental sales growth and higher level of customer satisfaction. Those of you that are familiar with Kaizen methodology know that the fundamental component of it is enhancing employee satisfaction. While turnover in China is higher than in our western countries, compared to other companies in the region, we do quite well. Kaizen events will help us maintain the high level of employee commitment and engagement than we currently have. ","Other smaller organizations are also embracing Kaizen to achieve efficiency. For example, our Thailand marketing organization recently performed the Kaizen on their contract renewal process for service calibration. Not only did they achieve a 40% improvement in productivity, they also noted an increase in revenue opportunities and the a higher level of customer satisfaction. These are just a couple of examples of productivity initiatives we are doing throughout the world to continue to drive margin improvement. ","Whether it is Spinnaker marketing, new product launches, productivity improvement or pricing initiatives, execution is key to achieving these results. Strong execution has been, and remains, a critical component of our culture. ","That concludes our prepared remarks. And I would like to ask the operator to open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jon Groberg with Macquarie.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Can you maybe just, before we talk -- I just had 2 questions, and the first is on margins. I know you mentioned, Bill, specifically on the gross margin front that-- I think you said you got pricing, and you got productivity but it was offset by some mix, both geographically and some of the products in China. Can you -- would you maybe just be able to quantify a little bit more what happened there and kind of how you expect that to play out through the year?","William P. Donnelly","Sure. So we're talking about or trying to explain 60 bps in total, so I give you kind of the big pieces. And the price increases in the quarter, and this now excludes the impact of the China item, but would include like some considerations around all the other businesses, is that, that was 260 bps in the quarter. And that, if you think about what was the impact therefore on gross profit margin, when you do the math, that's about 130 bps, so around half that number. And material costs were down about 30 bps in the quarter. So taken together, that's about 1.6%. The impact of mix, including the impact of these lower margin China jobs, was about minus 2% on the gross profit line. And think about that as roughly half coming from the China piece and the rest coming from other items, the largest of which was European mix. And then what's kind of leftover is Other, which is largely currency.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay, that's helpful. And if you think about the year, and I can always breakdown kind of the operating line, but if you think about the year, how should we think about gross margins kind of on a year-over-year basis given what you're seeing now from a currency standpoint and some of the other mix issues?","William P. Donnelly","I think currency won't have a big impact on gross profit going forward, so let's get maybe the easier one out of the way. I tend to think that price increases won't be worse than this. In fact, I think it's more likely that it could improve from where it is as the year progresses. Material cost, I think that's probably not a bad number. We could probably see that throughout the year. Now on the mix side, I think, we will have some continued negative mix issues in part because of Europe. On the China side, I'd like to think that, that's less impactful as the year progresses. We could still see a little bit of that in the course of Q2.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay. That's helpful. And then, Olivier, if you think about strong quarter here off of tough comps, but if you think about moving out throughout the rest of the year, and you mentioned, in particular, Europe, where you still see some, obviously, some choppiness and some challenges, and can you maybe and also maybe just talk a little bit about China. So maybe what you saw kind of towards the end of the quarter from other companies that we've heard, that have maybe a bit more overlap with you guys, it seems like those 2 markets have been a bit tougher here at the beginning of the year. So can you maybe just talk about what you saw throughout the quarter and kind of what your expectation is kind of for the full year?","Olivier A. Filliol","Yes, when we had the call last time, I was saying I'm looking forward to have Q1 under our belt and would feel more comfortable to have a better view how the whole year would come together. I have to be honest, sitting here today, I feel I need to see how also Q2 comes together to really get a better grasp. There is still quite uncertainty out there and we saw also that the quarter had quite some volatility. You have heard us talking that January, for example, was rough. And then February and March actually came in quite nicely. And we were happy about that. If I look from a geographic standpoint, we would certainly feel today that Europe is probably -- the outlook is a little bit tougher than what we had expected. U.S. has good momentum. And Asia and emerging markets, in general, we observe it quite well. We have seen that China has -- January was tough and we see still China kind of continue to be challenging when we -- when I say challenging, compared to the previous years where we had excellent momentum. So looking forward, I do expect that we're going to see better growth numbers out of Europe in Q2, but mainly because comparisons become easier. I do expect that Americas will be good because of the market environment and then in Asia-Pacific...","William P. Donnelly","I think we would expect growth rates to come down, including China, I think we'll still deliver probably double-digit growth rates. And you'll also see, when you look at our financials and part of the reason we grew a little bit faster this quarter was, we did take down a little bit of backlog in China, so the growth rate on orders was a little bit less than sales and I think we'll more see now kind of a more normalized number in terms of sales in the coming orders. So something, let's say, in the low-double digit levels.","Olivier A. Filliol","What we also saw that Q1, for example in China, our lab business did very well. Core Industrial had a more difficult environment. I wouldn't expect, for example, the lab business to continue as strongly in Q2 as we did in Q1. So kind of, we always said for many quarters that we expect China not to continue with this high-teens growth. Now looking towards Q2, it's certainly going to be on the low teen growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Knight with CLSA.","Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could characterize the end markets a little bit, particularly on the retail side, the industrial side and then perhaps even on the academic side. I know you have a little exposure there.","Olivier A. Filliol","Okay, let me start with our retail view. We talked about food retail. This is, in the meantime, less than 10% of our revenue. And the food retail depends very much on some large projects. And these larger projects are typically lumpy. I do -- we saw that also in Q1. We had a good business momentum in the Americas. I would expect that this is continuing. And I say that basically on the pipeline of the big projects, I would expect Europe continue to be challenging. Again, it's less -- just the end-user in mind is much more based on the big projects that we have see in the pipeline.  When it comes industrial. Here, I want to differentiate between core industrial and product inspection. I would say that core industrial, we have reasonable end-user markets in the U.S., so it would actually be quite favorable. As in Europe and Asia, we're certainly going to feel the uncertainty in the economy in general. Capacity utilization of our customers are certainly not that high and we're going to have an impact on our demand. When it comes to product inspection, there, the end user environment is very attractive for us, particularly in the food industry. This is driven by regulations. There is also good demand for quality control in general in the food industry at this moment across the globe and I would expect us to have good growth throughout the year. When it comes to lab, and here we need to differentiate, we have a good part of our lab business that is driven by the life science industry. The life science industry is less so about big pharma. It's less so about NIH and academia. It's a wide range of end-user industry. I would say here we're going to see more a geographic topic than necessarily an industrial topic or end-user industry topic. Here, I would say, Americas should be healthy, Europe challenging and Asia, good growth but not the same growth that we had in the recent past. You specifically also mentioned academia. We are seeing that academia being, as far as it relates to government funding, is challenging. We see that in U.S. We see that in Europe. Labs came [ph] off. We don't have that much exposure to academia.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And you had mentioned Blue Ocean and the margin improving activity there in China. Have your plans changed at all on China as the source of manufacturing -- moving manufacturing to that market? Is there any change in your strategy there?","Olivier A. Filliol","No. We definitely still perceive China to be a very attractive base for our production. We continue to expand our production in China, not just for the Chinese market but also for the export market. But what would be true it is there is less product line that we are proactively moving to China. Not that we feel any way different about China. It's much more that the big product lines that are really attractive to be manufactured out of China are all behind us. But it's really an attractive market. We have the right skills, we have an excellent team, we have a good supplier base there. And in this essence [ph], we are going to continue to leverage it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Olivier, if I could just ask another question on China, I just want to make sure I understood the nature of your comments there regarding the outlook. It sounds like you're calling for a sort of a nearer-term slowdown but longer-term expectations for that region still remained pretty healthy. So I just wanted to clarify that you, in fact, are saying that this is really sort of a temporary thing or rather -- are you saying that this is more of a product and sort of the investment you've made there in, and that on the longer-term basis we should be thinking about low double-digit growth versus high diluted, or high teens?","Olivier A. Filliol","I think we need to see from where we're coming. We had 7 quarters of growth of more than 20%. Now we had a Q1 which was still very strong. But for quite a while, we were saying that we would rather expect midteens growth out of China. And in that sense, also kind of a coming down versus the historic growth. I would still see it that way, but still very healthy growth. We are still talking about double-digit growth that we feel is very sustainable for many more years. The mix might change a little bit from where the growth is coming. In the recent years, our extraordinary strong growth in China particularly was coming from the core industrial business, partially also infrastructure-related demand, for example vehicle scales but also salmon batching systems and auto weighing solutions. That part we always expect that it will slow down and that's certainly what we saw in Q1. And I would say going forward, that we'll not have the same growth momentum as in the past. But the fundamentals in China remain very healthy, very promising. I would remind ourselves on one very attractive macro trend is, for example, the number of scientists joining the workforce. And since we have many personalized instruments in our lab offering, this is going to be a macro driver that continues to be very healthy for us. Also, this general trend that Chinese companies invest more in quality, point quality measures is going to be good for us as we see that the government is promoting industry sectors that are very relevant for us, and will drive the demand. So healthy macro trends environments and in that sense, I can only confirm what you were alluding to, that we remain very optimistic for both of the medium and long-term growth prospects for us in China.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Great. That's very helpful. If I could just ask a follow-up there. If I understood your comments correctly, it sounded like you were suggesting that the components of growth in your business, well, may be shift a little bit towards the lab side of the franchise, and so if that's the case, as I understand it, I mean, it looks like we're standing in front of a pretty good year when it comes to government funding for research -- and certainly under the 5-year plan, this is the multiyear dynamic. So with that as backdrop, did you look at our portfolio in China for products in lab and say that you could augment that or innovate in a way that's sort of in China, for China and help accelerate the growth that you see relative to the market growth rate?","Olivier A. Filliol","Yes, I think our lab offering today is already very well-suited for the Chinese market. I definitely also feel that we have a very, very strong team. But we talked at the last conference call about investments that we do in the Chinese market like going after additional regions and second-tier cities, for example. These investments continue on and will yield good results. So I think it's about expanding the presence being in China is more in terms of the franchise and the sales and service network that we have. What we are, in addition, leveraging is the second brand. We have a second brand called Ohaus that we clearly leverage in the Chinese market also to be present in indirect channels and fully leverage that opportunity. So, yes. We are going to fully tap in that opportunity. You mentioned, correctly mentioned, the lab business. What I would also add for example, product inspection, which is the other part of our industrial business and clearly, you'll see also very good growth prospects there. That's something that is not related to infrastructure. It is much more related to quality control and in the, for example, food industry in China, very, very good opportunity. Midterm, long-term, this is going to play clearly to our hands. Will we see a short term, maybe a quarter or the other quarter but these microtrends will not be that forceful, could well be and you heard Bill also when he talked about the guidance, in Q1, for example, labs, we might see a little bit less growth, but that doesn't mean that midterm, we have a different perspective on the growth opportunities.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jon Wood with Jefferies.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Did you give the China growth rate in the quarter? I think I missed it.","William P. Donnelly","If I didn't, I can give it to you. We grew by 16% in China in the quarter.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And, Bill, so you mentioned the project business in China. Is that a discrete item, meaning, it doesn't recur in the second quarter? And is that why you think the company, overall, the organic growth rate goes down. Just seems like, why would the organic growth rate decelerate in the second quarter given how much easier the comps are. And so I'm just trying to tease out if that China impact was discrete or not?","William P. Donnelly","I think, first, maybe a comment about the deceleration. I think in terms of looking at multiyear growth rates, I think we feel that the trend is very much kind of on a similar basis. And with regard to the specifics about China, yes, I guess part of the point we're making is that there were certainly more of some of the big jobs pushed through and completed here that of the quarter than maybe we expected. There is actually, our guys have some discussion, there's a belief that some of that was actually done intentionally, with this whole 5-year meeting that they had that they wanted to get some projects done and it seemed like things got wrapped up a little bit on an accelerated basis versus what we had maybe forecasted earlier. So if I look at kind of the mix to backlog right now, there's, of course, still some more profitable jobs and less profitable jobs. But I would say the backlog mix today is a little bit different than when we saw coming out in the first quarter.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then my second question is on the incrementals. And I would like to -- if you could quantify the sales and marketing investment impact in the first quarter, you talked about that in the fourth quarter being somewhere around $2 million, I think, $2.5 million, so could you quantify that?","William P. Donnelly","Give me one second, so if I look at just the -- our SG&A grew by 4% in local currency in the quarter. And about a little more than half of that came from emerging markets.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then Blue Ocean, that obviously impacted you in the second half of last year in China, what is the impact on a year-over-year basis in 2012? I think you're doing that in the U.S. later this year. So we'd love to hear how we should think about the year-over-year impact in 2012?","William P. Donnelly","Okay, I, probably, am not totally prepared on that one, so I apologize if I think out loud a little bit here. So, in China, there were certainly some disruption of the sales force towards the latter part of the year, which maybe wasn't as visible to you, because there was some impact on the -- more on the order side, I would say. Because if you looked at our sales numbers we were quite happy with how that went in during the Go Live period. I think in the U.S. market, we will have some people, sales guys in training and things like that on the fourth quarter. But, to be honest, Jon, at this stage, I think it wasn't very visible to you that we were--or didn't really impact how you guys were seeing the numbers, us implementing Blue Ocean in China and now I'd like to think that we have a similar no-drama situation when we do the U.S. roll in as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Maybe just a couple of points of clarification. On the lab business, if you look sequentially, you had a tougher comp this quarter than in the fourth quarter and you had better growth. So with that in mind and the fact you're maybe calling for the business to slow down a little bit in the second quarter, can you talk about the underlying dynamics. I mean, was this budget flush on the part of pharma or what kind of drove that growth acceleration on a sequential basis for lab and why are you a little bit more cautious, I guess, going into Q2?","William P. Donnelly","I understand. I think maybe a couple of comments to answer that. So one was we certainly saw a acceleration of growth in our pipette business. It grew quite a bit faster in Q1 than it grew in Q4. I don't necessarily expect that to continue. Maybe you're linking now, your question, Tycho, to I think what Paul was asking earlier. It's the business we have that's most exposed to academics, the academic market and from what we hear talking, listening to peer companies and the like, I don't think of that as particularly good. I think we did -- we competed well on the first quarter but I think we grew by 6% in pipettes and that's really a good number and I think, particularly, vis-a-vis other consumable oriented lab bio -- life science- oriented company. So I think that could moderate a little bit. I think that's good to assume. The other thing that we had quite good growth in AutoChem in the quarter. We had mid-to high teens kind of growth rate there, but if I look at the order growth rate, it would maybe be more what you expect on a normalized basis for that business, more in the mid-single digits. And so, those would be my 2 kind of key remarks there.","Olivier A. Filliol","And Tycho, I might add the geographic aspect of it. We had the Q1 actually, in China in particular, very good growth lab. I wouldn't necessarily expect it the same way...","William P. Donnelly","And then, of course, Tycho, I'm also forgetting one other basic thing, I mean, I assume not only us, but other companies. We definitely had a working day benefit in Q1 that you don't have in Q2. In Q2, I'm kind of looking at my guys here, it's flat. In Q1, we had, I think, extra couple of days.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, and then if we think about kind of the pricing dynamic, I know you called that out as a component on the gross margin. Heading into kind of mid-year, should we expect kind of another typical midyear price increase? I think you actually alluded to the fact you may to extract more on price, can you try to elaborate on that?","William P. Donnelly","I think we would like to try do a little bit more on pricing. We hated the gross margin decline even if we could explain it analytically. Mix-wise, we felt like we need to do a little bit more there. I think we're kind of working through that process internally, but when I said that I felt there was more upside than downside on pricing in the second half, that was what we had in mind.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And do you see that as a function of mix trying to drive better product mix or, I mean, what's your strategy, I guess, to try to push through the pricing?","William P. Donnelly","For pricing, I think the biggest single thing is we see win-loss ratios that support our ability to push through more on pricing and I think we're not trying to be greedy there, from a customer perspective, and trying to find the balance there. But our win-loss numbers look good and we think that, certainly, there are inflationary pressures in some parts of the business that we can articulate. But the win-loss implies our customers value highly our products. And therefore, we want to push pricing when we think it can be done in a reasonable way from a customer's eye.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then just last one as we think about kind of your cost structure for the rest of the year. Any change in your thinking about headcount adds? We talked, I think last quarter about kind of some emerging market headcount additions. But any sense that you're kind of maybe dialing back some of the additions in light of the macro environment, or...","William P. Donnelly","I think, one of the things that we talked about was that we committed to this field turbo program in the second half of last year that we felt like it was important to add some more feet-on-the-street, some more front-end personnel. And at the time we made that decision, maybe the -- early last year, mid last year, and committed to those resources, probably economic environment was a little bit better than it was when those people started coming onboard at the end of last year and now the early part of this year. And certainly they've been contributors to what we think is market share gain in the period. Probably from an incremental margin point of view, they may not be as productive as our salesmen, that'll probably take more towards the end of this year and into next year. But we have added a lot of -- not a lot, but for us a good number of front end people and as you've heard in our SG&A analysis, a lot of those were in emerging markets as well.","Olivier A. Filliol","And going forward, our focus will definitely be on the emerging markets. You heard us talking about Turkey today and Vietnam, Indonesia and so on, and that's certainly places we will continue to make investments.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sung Ji Nam with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","So, Olivier or Bill, you guys talked about taking market share, and I'm assuming that's an important driver in this environment. Could you maybe comment on the product segments where you feel like you're especially well-positioned to take share in the competitive dynamics, I guess, in the current environment?","Olivier A. Filliol","I feel actually strong about market share gain pretty much across all the businesses. I would-- maybe on the food retail it's a little bit difficult to say. I would strive to certainly focus on profitable growth, and as mentioned it's a lumpy business in terms of having big projects. But as I look at all the other businesses, being it lab, being it core industrial, product inspection, we have very good marketing position. We are running our Spinnaker marketing programs across all the businesses. And in that sense, I do expect that we are expanding our market share across all these businesses.","Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Great. And then in terms of tax rate, do you still anticipate 24.5%? And then longer term, how should we look at, are there -- is there headroom for potential improvement there in the outer years or if you could comment on that.","William P. Donnelly","At this point, that's our best estimate for full-year rate, excluding discrete tax items. And in terms of looking out forward, of course, it's something that we want to work on to continuously improve. But probably the biggest variable is really government law changes and so that's probably got to be the biggest determinant of whether our tax rates move up or down at this stage in the future.","Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay, and one last quick one. Your cash flow expectation for the year is it still 15% growth, roughly 15% growth year-over-year. And then if you could also comment on if there are any share repurchases. I think you guys had around 700 million remaining. And if there are further opportunities for the remaining year -- for the remainder of the year.","William P. Donnelly","Sure, on the cash flow side, I think we're off to a good start. And I think we'll-- certainly going to hit our targets this year. I would surprised if we didn't. And with regard to our share repurchases, our intention would be to repurchase our free cash flow and estimated option proceeds as well this year. So we'll kind of stick to the normal formula.","Operator","Your next question comes from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Bill, could you just walk -- I'm just kind of playing around a little bit with the incremental margin. And you're trying to -- if I pull out the currency impact, top line and EBIT line, it's not terribly significant. So the incremental looks like maybe 18%, 19% and yet the mix kind of shifted a little bit towards lab. And I think -- I would think that would be beneficial, since price would be helpful there. But is there -- does that number improve and maybe do you just have a quick answer as to why maybe that's a little bit lower here than you'd expect.","William P. Donnelly","Sure. So first, and you're an incremental guy, so I think that's -- so I think one way to refine the calculation is to pull out the impact of acquisitions because, of course, those incremental margins will be, by definition, be different than your core business. So, Rick, if I adjust for incremental margins and the impact of foreign exchange year-on-year, you get to an incremental margin for us in the mid-20s. I do think that, that number will improve and we would have it built into our model that it would improve. And the biggest improvement would be the less mix towards these Chinese projects that we talked about earlier.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, okay, so that will be helpful. All right. And then did you mention that acquisitions added one point to Europe's LC growth.","William P. Donnelly","I thought it was more. I think it was 3 points, let me double check.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","To Europe? Okay.","William P. Donnelly","Yes, 3% to Europe. A rounding, it's 2.5%, but if rounded, it's 3%.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, that's fine. And so when you look at the mix within Europe, industrial and lab and food and beverage, did you see the slowdown, was it much greater on the industrial side. In other words, if you look at industrial, and you assume the whole thing is down a point, organically? What was the differential between industrial and lab in terms of growth or decline?","William P. Donnelly","Sure. So we had more growth in industrial, but that included, of course, acquisition benefits. And if I pull that out, both businesses grew similarly on an organic basis.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Which is similarly is 0?","William P. Donnelly","No, 2% each and retail was down.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, all right. Okay. And then just lastly, the emerging markets' piece of the business, was that -- did that stick around 35% in the quarter? And what was the growth rate, I mean, China's half of it, but how did the other countries do in there? India, Brazil?","William P. Donnelly","Everybody did good. The one exception was Russia. I think Russia had mid-single digits. Everybody else did well. And particularly, we had a really good quarter in Southeast Asia, really a good quarter. India had a good quarter, I think a little bit less so on order side, but still a solid quarter. Yes, I think I mentioned already that we had 16% growth in China. That would be kind of the highlights.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","16%, yes. And then also maybe just the last question, when you do look at the lab piece plus the 8% in LC, we talked a bit about some of these markets that maybe are slowing a little. And I think, Olivier, you'd mentioned Americas was good. But was there -- is there any end markets within this lab piece where you're seeing double-digit growth in terms of end markets like petrochem or chem or any of the applied markets perhaps. I mean can you flag a couple of the stronger markets, if you have that visibility?","Olivier A. Filliol","Yes, it's actually not easy for us to have that exact visibility. It would be hard for us to give you now really an end-user market with precise double digit growth. But what I would say is, in general, academia wasn't so good. And it was clearly offset by all of the other markets, meaning industrial markets. But also life science in general and some of the emerging markets look very, very healthy for us.","William P. Donnelly","And just as a reminder, Rick, why it's difficult because in the U.S. market we're selling the balances through Fisher VWR.","Operator","Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin from Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Could you talk a little bit about the acquisitions? Were those things you did in Q4 or was that something that you did in Q1, because I didn't have anything on my model?","William P. Donnelly","So we did the Eagle -- the old x-ray businesses, Smiths, we did that in Q2 of last year. We did the Vision acquisition in Q3 or Q4 -- Q3 of last year.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. So I'm going back to something that Isaac asked. So it looks like it's about a 6% organic growth in gross numbers that you did in Q1 up against the 17% comp. And if you use your local currency growth guidance, with the high end of the range, it's 7%. And you use of FX and M&A impact, negative 3 and plus 2. You end up at about 5% organic number for Q2. So I'm just a little curious, I mean, even if you just mixed your days, you were certainly were well above 10% in Q1. It seems like it's a rather dramatic slowing off of what I would assume would be a stronger quarter with that. I'm just still a little bit confused.","William P. Donnelly","Okay, maybe-- you got definitely one thing. The only thing that I would clarify with you, Eric, is that acquisitions are 1% in Q2 versus 2% in Q1, which has some impact. And then the other comment would be is that our order entry growth in particular, as it related to our Chinese industrial business, the biggest impact year so our order entry growth was less than our sales growth, largely explained by that item. And the other thing is, of course, we're going through our normal forecasting process and this is a little bit how we see the picture.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Greg Halter with Great Lakes Review.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","There's been a lot of discussion about China and so forth, but I don't know if you've broken down the percentage that is in industrial versus lab and where you see that going, maybe over the next 3 to 5 years?","William P. Donnelly","Today, the ratio is, lab is around 35% to 40%, industrial is approaching 6%, and the remain -- or 60%, sorry. And the remainder is our retailing business. And clearly, we would expect the lab business to increase as of a percent, and that would be at the expense of the industrial business and of the retail business as well, but that's a small piece of it.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","Okay. And I know there was a share repurchase coming off the cash flow statement, but did you mention how many shares were acquired in the quarter?","William P. Donnelly","Sure. We acquired approximately 362,000. To be precise, 361,777.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","And the share count from -- the average share count, I should say, from December's quarter is basically flat. Was that due to timing or option grants, or what?","William P. Donnelly","Actually the biggest impact was exercised options due to retirements. We had 2 executives that have announced their retirement and I think that's probably a guess [ph] -- and they have exercised options. One has already had his last day with the company. One has announced it, it's been filed and he'll leave later in the year. And so we had relatively more option exercises than you normally would have.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","So we could see the decline going forward on the average basis, assuming you continue the repurchase?","William P. Donnelly","Yes, I'm getting Mary's head nod, yes.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","Okay, and what do you envision for capital spending for the full year 2012?","William P. Donnelly","A little bit less than last year. I would assume probably about $5 million less than last year, it could be a little bit even less than that.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

Local currency sales increased 4% in the quarter, with good growth in Americas and solid growth in Europe. We are pleased to have modest sales go in China, and Asia was in line with our expectations. Similar to what we saw in the first quarter, due to the benefit of various cost control and margin initiatives and despite negative currency headwinds, we generated good growth in earnings per share. Let me turn it to Bill to provide more details on the financial results and an update to our guidance for the year.","William P. Donnelly","Thanks, Olivier, and hello, everybody. Let me start with additional details on sales, which were $608.8 million in the quarter, an increase of 4% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased 5% as currency benefited sales by 1% in the quarter.","Turning to Page 3 of the presentation. We outlined sales by geography. In the quarter, local currency sales increased by 5% in the Americas, 3% in Europe and 3% in Asia\/Rest of World, all as compared to last year. Without the impact of exited product lines, sales in Asia\/Rest of World increased by 5% in the quarter. For China specifically, local currency sales increased by 2%. And excluding exited product lines, sales in China increased 6% in the quarter.","The next slide provides details on first half sales, which increased by 4% in local currency. For the 6 months, sales increased 4% in the Americas, 6% in Europe and 2% in Asia\/Rest of World. Asia\/Rest of World had a sales increase of 4% if you exclude the China exited product lines.","Sales growth by product line for the quarter is highlighted on Slide #5. Laboratory increased by 6% in local currency, while Industrial increased by 3%. Adjusting for China product line exits, Industrial sales increased by 5% in the quarter, while food retailing was down 1% in the quarter.","For the 6-month period, which you see on the next slide, Laboratory increased by 6% in local currency and Industrial increased by 2%. Adjusted for China product line exits, Industrials would have increased by 3% in the first 6 months of the year. Food retailing is up 3% year-to-date.","Now I'd like to turn to Slide #7 and walk you through the key items of the P&L. Our gross margins were 53.9%, a 50-basis-point increase over the prior year margin of 53.4%. We benefited from pricing and lower material costs, which were offset somewhat by unfavorable currency as well as mix. R&D amounted to $32.1 million, a 7% increase in local currency. SG&A amounted to $183.1 million, which is an increase of 3% in local currency. Increased sales and marketing costs and higher variable compensation were offset by cost-savings initiatives and lower employee benefit costs.","Adjusted operating income amounted to $112.9 million in the quarter. That represents a 6% increase over the prior year amount of $106.4 million. Our operating margins were 18.6%, an increase of 20 basis points over the prior year. We estimate currency reduced operating profit by $2.3 million in the quarter. Without this impact, operating profit would have increased 8% and operating margins, 80 basis points in the quarter.","A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $7.3 million in the quarter, while interest expense was $6 million-even in the quarter. Our effective tax rate continues to be 24%. Fully diluted shares for quarter were $29.8 million, which is a 3.6% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.57 per share, an increase of 9% over the prior year amount of $2.35. Currency reduced adjusted EPS by approximately 2.5%.","On a reported basis, EPS was $2.49, as compared to $2.24 in the prior year. Reported EPS included pretax restructuring charges of $1.9 million, or $0.05 per share, which is primarily employee-related costs. Reported EPS also includes $0.03 of purchased intangible amortization.","The next slide provides details on our year-to-date results, which are similar to what you had in the quarter. Specifically for the 6 months, local currency sales increased by 4%, operating profit is up by 6% and adjusted EPS increased by 9%. For the 6-month period, currency reduced EPS by about 3.5%.","Now turning to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter amounted to $95.7 million, a 22% increase over the prior year amount of $78.2 million. We are pleased with the strong cash flow, which benefited from good working capital management, offset to a degree by higher tax payments. Working capital statistics were solid in the quarter, with ITO at 5X and DSO at 43 days. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow is $129.7 million versus $87.8 million in the prior year.","One additional comment on our balance sheet before turning to guidance. You saw in our June 8-K filing that we entered into a $250 million worth of fixed rate financing. One half of this financing will be funded later this quarter, and the remainder will be funded next year to coincide with the maturity of an existing fixed rate note. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as attractive rates to increase the percentage of our fixed-rate debt. Although the long-term rates are very attractive, the financing is about $0.025 dilutive to EPS this year.","Now let's turn to guidance. Market conditions are about the same as we compared -- as compared to the last time we spoke. Conditions in the west a relatively solid, although we based tougher comparisons for Europe for the remainder of this year. Asia should continue to improve. Maybe some more about China specifically: We see our business here as generally on track with our previously described expectations. While sales growth in China was a bit better in the quarter than we expected, we still remain cautious on the region given the overhang in certain segments. As economic growth here continues, the overcapacity in certain segments will diminish and we expect to see more investments in new plants and new lines. While we see some signs of an improving investment climate, the return to the strong growth levels of the past is not yet on the immediate horizon.","We expect China sales to be up modestly in Q3 and Q4, principally due to easier comps. As a reminder, we estimate exited product lines will reduce local currency sales by about 2% in China for the full year. So in summary, we're estimating mid-single-digit growth in China in the second half, adjusted for exited product lines. In terms of other emerging markets, microeconomic conditions in China -- or, sorry, in Russia are very weak. Brazil and India had good results in the quarter and are performing well. Given this outlook, we're making no change to our full year expectations of sales growth of approximately 4% for the year.","We are also maintaining our current full year EPS guidance. Specifically, we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $11.45 to $11.60, which is a growth rate of 8% to 10%. This is in the same range as we provided last quarter. For the third quarter, we would expect local currency sales growth to be approximately 4% and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.82 to $2.87, or a growth of 8% to 10%.","As you're updating your models, let me cover some specifics on guidance. First, currency. We would expect currency to have no impact on sales growth in Q2 and reduce sales growth by approximately 1% in Q4. For the full year, we expect to have no impact from currency on sales.","In terms of the impact of currency on earnings, we would expect currency to reduce earnings growth by approximately 1% in the third quarter and be slightly negative in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2014, currency is expected to reduce earnings growth by 2%.","Okay, one final comment regarding models. With our Q3 guidance and full year guidance, you will likely be updating your Q4 numbers too. One question you may have is why we are maintaining our guidance range although we exceeded our guidance for the second quarter. We have 2 factors weighing on this. The first, as already mentioned, is we have this $0.025 headwind in Q4 due to long-term debt to be added via the private placement; and second is that given our expectation of a better growth environment next year, we are investing in some front-end resources in the second half. Our field turbo program, as we refer to it internally, has been discussed with you in the past. As a reminder, these are additional sales and service personnel to capture specific growth opportunities. As I look at the development of these turbo programs, we'll see higher expenses associated with them in the second half of this year, particularly in the fourth quarter. While this will help position us well for next year, we recognize the additional cost, our drag this year, as salesmen take some time to become fully productive. These 2 factors highlight why we didn't increase our guidance despite the beat this quarter. Okay, that's it for my side and I want to turn it back over to Olivier.","Olivier A. Filliol","Thanks, Bill. Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab increased 6% in the quarter, with good growth in balances, Pipettes Analytical Instruments and Process Analytics. Automated Chemistry was down in the quarter due to timing as the order entry was good and the outlook for the remainder of the year is quite positive. Industrial increased 3% in the quarter. Product Inspection had good growth, while Core Industrial was consistent with the prior year. As expected, retail was down slightly in the quarter.","Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Europe had sales growth of 3% and most countries reported growth, with the exception of Russia, which was down double-digits. While we faced more challenging comparisons in Europe for the remainder of the year, I'm pleased with how well we are competing in this region. Our strong product offering combined with our Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives are principal factors contributing to our solid performance.","Americas increased 5% in the quarter. We have good growth in Lab and Product Inspection. Core Industrial was down slightly against strong comparisons from the prior year. Retail was also down in the quarter. Asia\/Rest of the World increased 3% of the quarter.","Let me now make some additional comments on China. Market conditions are developing as expected, and our business continues to be on track with what we outlined last year as expectations for this year. Specifically, our core laboratory instruments and our Product Inspection business continues to do very well, with growth in the double-digits range. Similar to what we experienced in the first quarter, Process Analytics was impacted by new GMP regulations surrounding water purity that went into effect last year and, as a result, was down double-digits. Finally, Core Industrial increased 3%, adjusting for the exited product lines. You heard from Bill that we expect to have growth in China for the remainder of the year. While we will benefit from easier comparisons, we are also making good progress on resource prioritization and reallocation to segments of the market where profitable growth exists. We are leveraging our Spinnaker sales and marketing tools to identify potential customers and then design sales and marketing strategies to penetrate these segments.","We remain convinced about the long-term potential of this market. Our product portfolio is well positioned to benefit from many evolving trends in China, including the increasingly prosperous consumer, the many graduating scientists, the government's efforts to move up the value chain in manufacturing and the increasing focus on product quality and consumer safety throughout the economy. Specifically, our Laboratory, Process Analytics, Product Inspection and certain segments in core industrial all remain very well positioned to capture growth arising from this trend.","One additional comment on our quarterly results before I cover some additional topics is Service. We had good growth in the quarter, with Service revenue up 7% as compared to the prior year. We had good growth in all geographic regions and in most product lines. We continue to benefit from our investments in Service, which I covered with you last quarter.","Now let me turn to some product innovations, which continue to reinforce our market leadership. I have a couple of examples from our laboratory offering, starting with our new family of premium-end pipettes. Under the umbrella name of XLS Plus, these pipettes that's have our proprietary live touch system, which have an ergonomic focus by reducing the force of pipetting. Highly regulated customers who are sensitive to security issues and high throughput labs are prime customers for this instrument. While we already lead the market with our ergonomic technology, we have further enhanced our offerings in several ways. For our single-channel instrument, an improved ceiling system provides greater ergonomics and improved results, particularly, with more delicate experiments. The instrument can also address more customers due to its new sterilization capability. Our new high-volume multichannel instrument is smaller, at 25% lighter, and, therefore, provides greater productivity, accuracy and fewer handling errors.","Finally, we have a new software system for our electronic pipette, which provides easier use, greater accuracy and better security. This allows customers to more easily adhere to their standard operating procedures and good laboratory practices. We now have an entire XLS Plus product offering with an attractive and modern design. Initial customer reception is positive, and we have an extensive marketing campaign that is supporting the launch. In addition to customer benefits, the new product line will also reduce manufacturing cost.","Our pipette business remains very attractive, with solid growth dynamics, good margins and nice Consumable and Service stream. We also have some new offerings at our pH business. For those of you that attended our Investor Day last July, we demonstrated our high-end bench pH meters known as SevenExcellence. We are strengthening our market position with the launch of a new portable pH meter, the Seven to Go (sic) [SevenGo]. The instrument's simple menus and navigation can shorten measurement time and the new status light helps to ensure the quality of the ongoing measurement. The Seven to Go's (sic) [SevenGo's] ergonomic design provides utmost handling comfort and the graphic display allows operation even under difficult lighting conditions. Productivities further enhanced through our proprietary intelligent central management system that reduces overall errors and speed workflows. Finally, we have developed specific kits for several industry segments, which includes a meter, sensor and accessories, making it very easy to use for our customers.","In order to further extend our pH offering, we also recently launched a more basic version of a bench-top instrument to penetrate emerging markets. The product has less features and models and its attractive pricing meets the needs of price-sensitive customers in our emerging markets and indirect distribution channels. The instrument's inherent intuitiveness and the ease-of-use make it an ideal for telesales. To further minimize overall cost, the market introduction, marketing and product training is heavily centered on the vet [ph]. These 2 introductions are examples of how we are leveraging our market positioned in pH to garner more market share. Our business is very solid, with good growth dynamics, attractive consumable stream and strong margins.","We also continue to make great inroads with our Automated Chemistry offering. Over the last few years, we have worked with a large pharmaceutical customer to develop and implement their vision for the lab of the future. The lab is focused on sustainably decreasing time-to-market for new medicines and increasing the overall R&D productivity by automating many elements of process development. This is the step in drug discovery and scale up process in which the pharma company is trying to determine how most efficiently and safely a drug can be mass-produced. Because it is at the end of the entire drug discovery process, the quicker it can be developed, the sooner the drugs can be launched. Although under tremendous time pressure, most pharmaceutical companies lack a standardized automated approach to process development. The lab of the future incorporates our automated lab reactors, in situ probes and a common software platform to standardize and automate the entire process. We have successfully rolled out our solution in the initial pharma company, and several other companies are now introducing it to their organizations. We are very pleased with this development, which reinforces our leadership in this business.","Let me make a couple of concluding remarks before I open it for questions. We remain cautiously optimistic in our Western markets with an acknowledgment of profit comparisons on the horizon in Europe. We're executing well and believe we can continue to capture growth opportunities in these regions. Emerging markets, in particular China, are developing mostly as expected. While certain core industrial segments are weak, we see good growth potentially in our Laboratory and Product Inspection businesses. We expect to see growth in China for the remainder of the year. Overall, we continue to focus on execution and capturing more share. That covers my comments, and I want to ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies.","Sachin Kulkarni - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","This is Sachin in for Brandon. So as gross margins have steadily improved in recent years, what type of initiatives are under way to bolster the productivity of this Service organization? What do you perceive as the incremental opportunity for Service gross margins over the next 2, 3 years?","William P. Donnelly","Okay. So maybe a few comments on what's been going on to date and also what we would expect in the future. So there's a number of different initiatives both on the cost side as well as on the pricing side. And on the pricing side, we are -- as part of our overall pricing program, see the opportunity of good pricing power within Service, particularly on proprietary spare parts. But in general, if we're providing value-added, we can get good pricing benefits. Maybe also on the sales side, we are benefiting from the volume increases, and a lot of that is driven by doing a better job of the point-of-sale selling service and capturing more and more of the Service business via service contracts, which allow us to plan better the service technician. We sometimes refer to reducing the windshield time of the service technicians as a good driver on the productivity side. So on the productivity side, we introduced -- we have invested a lot in IT solutions related to Blue Ocean and otherwise. And those solutions help our service technicians to be more productive, to have higher first-time fixed rates and more standardize the work as well. And then, I would -- in terms of maybe future margin expansion opportunities, I don't have a specific target that I want to give at this point. But if you name -- if you go back to the list that I just gave you, none of them have run out of headroom yet. They're still much like the Spinnaker story. On the sales side, there are many years of operating profit, gross margin expansion opportunities within our Service business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So if -- could you talk a little bit about Russia in the sense that how big a business is that for you? Can you sort of estimate what that drag was on the business?","William P. Donnelly","It's 2% and it's down in the low 20s. So I guess, 40 bps, 45 bps.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So you're -- I mean, it's encouraging to hear that you're beefing up the infrastructure with your turbo program in anticipation of growth for next year. I guess, with that in mind, what -- can you give us a little bit teaser in terms what you're thinking or is it still too early in terms to talk about '15?","Olivier A. Filliol","Derik, actually the way we started out early in the year, we did multiple analysis in terms of where we feel we have penetration gaps. We analyzed this, really, by the different product lines and different geographies. Some -- for bigger geographies, we even went within a territory level to looking and sub-segmenting the countries. And then, we overlaid that with the profitability of the different business lines. And that gave us then a priority, which areas we want to invest in the future. And we are currently working with the countries and the different business leaders to develop concrete plans and business cases. And then, we're going to roll that out throughout the next quarters. We, of course, are not going to do everything in Q4. We try to time it. And what we have seen from previous field turbo ways that have been running is, of course, it takes a little bit of time to onboard the people and then really do the thorough training. And we try to accelerate the payback time by supporting the salespeople with a lot of telemarketing activities, specific segment campaigns so that we can feed them with good leads and, in essence, accelerate the pipeline development.","William P. Donnelly","Maybe in terms of I think you're also getting at the guidance question and we'll -- our intention at this point would be to give guidance in the next call. But sitting here today, our expectation is that we'll grow faster in '15 than we did in '14. But there's a lot of economic data and other things for us to digest before giving specific guidance.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right, I guess that's what -- I guess what is -- you're typically a very conservative company. So the fact that you are doing all of these initiatives is encouraging. That's sort of where I was getting at. I guess on that note, I'll get back in the queue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","On the Southeast Asia part of the world, wondering if you could maybe put a little more color on what your expectations are on the back half of the year.","William P. Donnelly","Okay, so maybe I give you a feeling from year-to-date basis. We're up low single digits. And the -- as you can maybe imagine, the weakest part is coming from Thailand, although Thailand was certainly better in Q2 than they were on a year-to-date basis. I would say, sorry, better in Q2 than they were in Q1. In terms of the comps for the region, we have a comp last -- in Q3 that will similar to the comp we had this past quarter, but I would, expect, actually, our growth rate to be slightly better. I think the one thing I would highlight is that Southeast Asia has quite a tough comp when it comes to Q4. We grew mid-teens in Q4 last year due to a couple of big orders. But our view is that the trend their overall is improving. I think Olivier would probably have more insight. He'll be there next week, but -- so probably no more next time. But other than this tough comp, we would say that things have bottomed out and are generally moving at a pretty good direction and we're making investments in that part of the world.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then just maybe a follow up on the financial side of things. Last quarter, you talked a little bit about the board's decision to raise long-term leverage targets. I know that you had some time to think about investing both in the field turbo and some of the other initiatives, and you mentioned the restructuring on the debt towards the back half. Could you give us a sense of time line to the increased leverage target?","William P. Donnelly","I -- like most things, we'll do it kind of step-by-step. But I think at this stage you could assume absent us surprising ourselves with a bigger than expected acquisition, which I think would be highly unlikely. Maybe add in an extra $100 million or so a year to the base of free cash flow that we already do.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg of Macquarie.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","I think it was mentioned -- sorry, I don't remember if it was Bill or Olivier, but you said you see some improvement in China but don't really see it returning to growth days of the past. Was that just a comment for this year? And I guess I'm trying to think historically, Bill, I think you -- when you kind of laid out kind of the growth scenario for a company like Mettler, it's kind of emerging markets growing at certain rates, then some of the developed markets at slower rates to get your overall growth target. And I'm just wondering is that -- has that model changed at all in your mind? And if so, what other types of things that you're looking at in terms of accelerating the revenue growth?","Olivier A. Filliol","John, I think we definitely see that China will get back to very good growth dynamics, and we talked about the macro trends that are very favorable for us. And we feel that we can outgrow the GDP growth of China. But we all want to be cautious. We have seen many quarters of 20% plus growth for Mettler-Toledo in China in the times where there were huge investments in infrastructure and there was the stimulus money from the Chinese government. And these times will not come back and we don't rely on these kind of times. It's not that we need big stimulus money and big infrastructure projects to have really good growth for us in China. In that sense, we would feel that we're going to see in China a good healthy growth but also a more sustainable growth maybe that we have seen in the last 5 years. When I say sustainable growth, nevertheless, I would recognize that China will remain more volatile than a mature Western market. In terms of timing, we did talk that the second part of the year will gradually get better. Next year should also already get significantly better than this year. And then it will take probably some time that we will see this high-single, low double-digit growth that we expect. But then I really think the growth prospects are very attractive. And being in China this week, and actually I was already here last week, just reconfirmed that there's a lot of things happening here that we don't read in the Western press. And it's been always impressive when you are here and see all the things that the government are driving, new economic zones, then also new industries that they want to develop. And it was great to see how our Chinese team very much aware of that and of shifting all the resourcing to really tap into these opportunities.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay, that's helpful. And I don't think you had any acquisitions contributing to your organic growth. Is that correct? And if so, kind of where do you stand? You made a similar comment Bill about, well, if you did a big acquisition. But would you hope to do some acquisitions this year, even if smaller? Kind of where do you stand on the M&A front?","Olivier A. Filliol","Our M&A strategy is quite a consistent one. I'm very interested in pursuing acquisition opportunities. We have a thorough process where we constantly, actually, monitor tentative targets. We try to really nurture these targets. And we're actually constantly also talking to companies. And you have seen us doing a couple of acquisitions last few years and expect us to continue to do that. And there are a couple of opportunities that we are reviewing also at this stage. So our commitment is definitely here. What Bill was referring to is these big acquisitions adding another lag to the company also. The acquisitions that we do at this stage are typically ones that are in the range of $20 million to $50 million of revenue. And we can definitely finance these kind of acquisitions with our free cash flow.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of from JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just wanted to follow-up on Derik's original question about some of the reinvestment you're going to be making. I was wondering if you can talk by geography or segment where you see the incremental headcount additions.","Olivier A. Filliol","It's going to really be across the globe. We -- for example, next week, I am in Southeast Asia. We're going to review, in particular, investments in the Philippines but also in Indonesia, but I have also projects that are under review that relates to Service in Europe. We are looking at telesales opportunities out of Poland. I think that just gives you a flavor how broad-based it is. And it's really across the different business lines and geographies. I think that's the approach of the field turbo. We do them -- they are relatively small projects. So when I talk about Philippines, I talk about 2 handfuls of people. When I talk about telesales in Russia, I talk about a handful of people. So -- and these are many smaller projects, but the beauty of it is I always have a strong business leaders that can focus on it and really drive it. And it's not a single big bet on one opportunity.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then I guess, as we think about the U.S. market, core industrial, you had a tough comp there, so that was down slightly. But can you talk about some of the gives and takes for the U.S. market in the back half of the year, whether it's an industrial improvement, or maybe the academic market's getting a little bit better?","William P. Donnelly","So we're not as exposed to the academic market maybe as some of the other guys, but our pipette business, which is the one with the biggest exposure, has been doing quite well relative to past periods. It's also got some exposure to government money. And that business has done much better the last couple of quarters than it had in '13 or in '12 and we would expect that to continue. At the high-end instrument side, we're expecting a very good second half, both in our AutoChem product lines as well as some of our analytical instruments. In the Product Inspection area, we'll have an excellent Q3. I think that Q4 maybe has a really tough comp. If I recall correctly, 2013 Q4 had a blowout in the Americas in the food safety area. But that business is rolling very well. On the Industrial side, I think we feel pretty good. It was a little bit hidden in our Industrial numbers in this quarter that it didn't get much project business, for example, like in the T&L area, where you were having big projects with the UPSes, FedExes of the world. That business was actually down quite a bit in North America, but what I would describe as our core standard Industrial products, actually, I think grew mid- or high-single digits in the quarter. So in terms of the second half, maybe absent a tough time here or there, our Americas business looks pretty good. I see no reason it shouldn't grow mid-single digits, maybe a little better.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay and then lastly, Bill, you called out pricing on your gross margin comments. Just anything incrementally -- incremental there to add about your ability to push through pricing increases?","William P. Donnelly","Yes, we -- I'm thinking on of year-to-date basis, we're about a 170 bps or so. No, sorry, I was mixing up material cost. So we're 210 bps. We're actually 240 bps in the quarter. And I would be surprised if that number wasn't a little better in the second half. There are a couple of areas we've been looking at around Service pricing, lab balance pricing. In Europe, in general, we feel like we have good pricing positioning right now, so I think you won't see that or you never know if there's a funny mix or something or a big -- a couple of big projects. But overall, I think you'll see pricing continue to move in a positive direction in the second half. We feel very good about the competitive position of the technology portfolio right now vis-\u00e0-vis competition.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Knight from Janney Capital Markets.","Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Could you talk to the Food Retail business? It was down in the June quarter, it appears, versus Q1. And then could you talk to Europe? Was Europe a little lighter than you had even expected?","Olivier A. Filliol","Okay, on Food Retail, I wouldn't read too much in the numbers. It's are very project-driven business. It's a rather lumpy business. But -- and so we're always going to see ups and downs, but I also to remind ourselves that retail for us -- our focus is not on the top line growth. It's actually really focused on operating profit. It's a business that is below the group average when it comes to profitability and so we have really the strategies and the team focused on margin expansion rather than just the top line. And that means also we remain very disciplined in the project business. As you can imagine, this project business [indiscernible] tenders and pricing is always a key, key topic. While we have in all other businesses excellent positions where we can really enforce some price increases, Food Retail is the one where this is the most difficult and, accordingly, we can't be focused really on the top line growth without looking also at this margin topic. So that will be the reason why we are not alerted at all. And we are okay with that performance. To Europe, actually, I'm very pleased about the European numbers. Q2 was actually good. What you need to realize is that Europe was also impacted by, for example, Russia. Russia was down and, in that sense, had an impact on Europe. But it certainly met my expectations. I would say, even modestly up if I took a look at core Europe.","William P. Donnelly","And maybe to add to Olivier's comments, maybe to give you a sense, Paul. The retail business on a 2-year business actually grew. So we had a very easy comp in Q1, had decent growth against it. We had a tougher comp in Q2 and -- but on a 2-year basis, we actually grew little bit faster. And maybe a couple of comments in more detail on the European position. I think the one business that didn't grow as much as we expected in Europe was our Product Inspection business, and that had a lot to do with just more -- we finished the year with more of a quarter with more backlog than we expected. Actually, order growth was just fine in Product Inspection but, reiterating Olivier's point, that the comps do get tougher. I think we grew our lab business about 10% in Q3 last year. So we'll face a tougher comp as we go into the second half.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Evans from Wells Fargo.","Timothy C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if you could comment on the competitive dynamics in China, particularly with the local competitors over there.","Olivier A. Filliol","So while most of the countries in the world we are facing only a few competitors, we have in China an interesting situation that when it comes to the Industrial division, we face hundreds, if not thousands, of local competitors. These are very small regional players. There are just a few ones that are bigger but then they are typically only competing in very focused business lines. We have been living with that competitive landscape for decades now. And I haven't seen any major changes that alert me. However, we constantly monitor that situation. And we also monitor kind of in which area they experienced growth and at what kind of profitability levels. What we would typically see is that competitors can grow in certain segments like we have seen also in the last 12 months when we walked away from certain deals because of terms and conditions and payments, particular payment terms. These businesses were picked up by competitors but we were then picking it up because, honestly, the projects were just not attractive. And in that sense, we live with it. But strategically, I don't see that any competitor here are making moves that are jeopardizing our position. These were a few comments on Industrial side. If I go to Lab, the situation is actually different. We have mainly global players that compete with us. The local players are competing in a totally different league in terms of quality, but also price. But customers would clearly differentiate that and in my update last week that I got from the local lab team, I was actually too pleased to see that the local Chinese competitors for different product categories, I would say, rather got weaker than stronger in the last 2, 3 years. So we feel actually comfortable with that competitive landscape.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman of Robert W. Baird.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just a couple things. Bill, you had identified price capture in the quarter. And I'm a bit curious, is that pertain -- is it skewed at all on the hardware versus the Service and Consumables side? I mean, is 1 of 5 and the other of 0? Or are you capturing any price in the hardware?","William P. Donnelly","Definitely capturing price in the hardware. I would be surprised if the differences were more than 50 bps.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, okay. And then, also, Olivier, could you provide maybe -- again, just to double-back to China again. But with lab plus double digits in China, I'm curious, are there any of the product lines that are definitely kind of leading? I mean, is Balances or AutoChem? I mean, what's the -- what's your product position within China in the lab market?","Olivier A. Filliol","So when we talked about double-digit, we meant core lab. The core lab is really basic Balances, Analytical Instruments. We actually -- Pipette did also well. So it's these product categories -- actually, if I recall well, Automated Chemistry did also well. So actually, really, our whole core lab portfolio did well. I think that reflects that we are serving here a different customer base than the Industrial division. It reflects also this macro trend that we are benefiting from like the number of scientists joining the workforce. This trends to with more quality control. And then, also the move in more value-added industries. And I would also say that Lab in general is earlier in the cycle than the Industrial products. So for me, seeing this core lab growing double-digit is an early indicator that things should get better.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Is there a -- an emerging Service market for you there or is that still in its infancy as well?","Olivier A. Filliol","So the Service market and also our Service revenue is actually developing well. I'm very happy about the growth rates, but it's coming from a low base. Your statement that it's in an early phase is fair. This -- it's a little bit to be differentiated by different product -- business lines and service types. We have, for example, in China a situation where the government still provides calibration services themselves. And so it's a situation where that is kind of a delicate we don't want to compete and call it compete with the government for money calibration services. But that's a market that will open up in the future and, in essence, still offers great opportunities. There are other product lines and -- where we can offer our full service capability. If I -- for example, in the Automated Chemistry area or in the Product Inspection area as well, where calibration is not so important, then we can offer our full service offering, and that's certainly something we're focused on and will further leverage in the coming years.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I'm a little bit curious again -- staying with China for a second, but I'm a little curious. Your Product Inspection business again was plus double digits and I know your business isn't lab-oriented. It's more production-line oriented, but again, we've heard so much during the first 6 months of the year about just regulatory schemes on the food service side and some compliance issues and kind of a reorder of food safety administration. But again, that all pertains more to the lab than it does to the production side. Is that a fair comment?","Olivier A. Filliol","Regulations. to a far degree, yes. But the awareness is really huge about all food safety topics. And I heard so many examples of retailers in China, Walmart, but also local Chinese companies that are increasing the pressure on their suppliers that they really enforced good food safety practices. And we often also invited to seminars and trainings that these retailers provide to their suppliers, and we can raise the awareness for physical contamination that can be prevented through our metal detectors, X-ray systems. And we certainly also see that the big brands, food-producing brands, are taking actions to protect themselves through better product inspection solutions. So demand is good. The awareness is good for our solutions, but I would also state that while Product Inspection on a global scale is about 16% of our revenue, in China, it's still significantly lower. It's more like the 5%-ish. And so there is a way to go for us to reach the same penetration levels as we have in the West. And that's why I always refer to the fact that China offers not just growth in line with the GDP but, actually, offers additional growth because there are product categories that are still underpenetrated.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I see. Okay. Very good. And then just one last question, Bill, given where you are in the buyback year-to-date through June, anything changed in terms of the targeted dollar amount that you'd like to put to work by the end of the year?","William P. Donnelly","No, same as we talked about last quarter, which...","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Of that towards $400 million?","William P. Donnelly","Yes, about $400 million.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias of Citigroup.","Daniel Anthony Arias - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Bill or Olivier, on the Service side, you guys mentioned trying to bring of the installed base under contract. So just curious where that percentage stands at this point. I think it was 20% or so the last time we talked about it. So has that inched up at all at this point?","William P. Donnelly","So I think, first, it would probably have to be maybe more narrowly defined like, for example, maybe our laboratory instruments might be closer to that level. But if you look at our business in total, we wouldn't yet be at that rate. The fact that our Service business grew 7% or so, if I recall, is -- and our product business of course, if you do the math, grew less than that, is a reflection that that's increasing. But of course our installed base might average high-single-digits numbers of years. If you take everything, it's a small move in terms of percentage terms. But I think both of us feel that there's -- continues to be good mid- to high-single-digit growth opportunities in service for many years to come.","Olivier A. Filliol","I think the interesting part here is that the attachment rate of service differs highly country-by-country. We just talked about China before, where the penetration and attachment rates is significantly lower than in the West. But also within the West, within Europe, we see big differences. And one of the key measures that we are following is really looking at these penetration rates country-by-country, understanding why we have differences and developing plans with the local country management, how we can increase these penetrations. When we were referring to field turbos before, that's, for example, an area where we're also leveraging this field turbo, for example, doing more telesales of service products to attach the attachment rates to the installed base of recent years.","Daniel Anthony Arias - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just quickly, Bill, not sure if I missed it, but did you give the order number for China?","William P. Donnelly","Orders were in line with sales. I think backlog's almost perfectly flat with last year in China.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby of Cleveland Research Company.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","A couple of things for you. First, raw materials. How much were they benefit in the quarter, Bill?","William P. Donnelly","So raw material costs were down about 2%. Of course that's not all a cost of sales. Just to give you a feeling, it's -- on an annualized basis, that's 2% down and maybe $450 million or so.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","Okay, and then, just backlog in general, did you build backlog across the business in total at all?","William P. Donnelly","I think, we're modestly up. Mixed buys have changed with -- I made a reference to, I think, specific to Europe, but in general, Product Inspection grew backlog quite a bit.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","And then just, my final thing is given the past 4 quarters, you've put up pretty good growth in Europe. When you look out going forward, is mid-single-digit growth in Europe still possible? Or is it may be more in like the low single-digit to mid-single-digit range do you think?","William P. Donnelly","I think if we look -- let's talk like a 5-year window, we would say, hey, if Europe grows 3% to 4%, that would be well in line with our overall group targets. If it mid- -- if it grew 5%, we'd be doing better than we would expect.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","And then if I could squeeze one more in for Olivier. Olivier, you made a comment regarding some things you've seen in China that we may not have seen in the Western press so far that you thought were interesting or exciting. Just wonder if you could elaborate on that at all.","Olivier A. Filliol","It starts that when you are here in Shanghai, as well as Jiangsu, you feel that the economy is actually still quite healthy. You see activity. You see new things happening, investments happening. The second thing that I felt really good about is -- from the Chinese team is, you see that there is still also greenfield activities. Maybe less than in the recent past and certainly not yet back to normal, but there is still investments in new production sites. There is also new developments of regions and cities where the government is actually really proactively investing in the future. There are new infrastructure being funded by the government because they want to develop and promote new industrial zones, and some of them are actually really big and promising. These are things that at least I don't hear too much in the European press about. And it gives you a different perspective when you were here and you have the Chinese team showing the different opportunities that are around.","William P. Donnelly","Maybe one other anecdotal one. Sometimes we hear in the press about these empty cities, and I'm sure there are still some there, but in the train ride from Shanghai to Jiangsu now, what was once some empty cities there are now full. And that's over the last couple of years. So it's always better to be here. It's a naturally optimistic place, but I agree with Olivier there. There are maybe more positive signs when you're here on the ground than sometimes what you hear in the news, and I think we saw some good, was it, MPI [ph] numbers or something about this morning. So I feel it was a good sign.","Olivier A. Filliol","Or to give you a fun one, we inaugurated our new plant in Jiangsu 7 years ago. And at the inauguration, we planted trees. And the trees are growing in the side, but on the opposite side of the trees, there was a farmland. And in the meantime, they are starting to build new residential buildings, huge buildings. and I was here, it was more or less last year, and within a year, you see the building coming up. And it's so much faster than the trees are growing. It's actually unbelievable how fast things are still happening here. And of course when you see them being built, they look totally empty. But I picked up actually from my management team that different of our employees have actually bought one of the other things there. And so it seems to be real and, yes, it feels good when you see that.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Sung Ji Nam with Cantor.","Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","So, Olivier, I was wondering, your lab products and AutoChem and Product Inspection businesses are still kind of growing at a high rate and for -- in the developed countries in North America and in Europe, are there opportunities for further market expansion? Or is the growth largely coming from taking share from your competitors?","Olivier A. Filliol","No, actually, I would really say both. I differentiate here maybe by product categories. If I talk about Automated Chemistry, it's definitely not just market share gains. This is about developing also new opportunities and new markets. The lab of the future that referred in my prepared remarks is a classic one. This is not winning against competition. This is actually working together with our customers for new solutions to their problems. So that's really developing the markets. In Product Inspection, we have, in particular, one product category and that's X-ray where the market is still developing. This is not yet a matured market and one that we are just replacing installed base. Not at all actually. It's very much about convincing customers that this is the right technology to deduct more physical contamination that they can do with metal injection. When you think about core labs, if I take, for example, a balance, the balance in the West is more a replacement business. And when it's a replacement business, when we are growing faster than the market, of course, it is about gaining market share.","Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","And then more specifically for your Pipette business, you talked about a lot of innovations there and I believe this is an area where you're still #2 in the marketplace. I was wondering if you are gaining any traction in terms of taking share from your #1 competitor there.","Olivier A. Filliol","So in the Pipette business, our market position differs very much by geography. Actually in U.S., we have an excellent market position. And when we look towards Europe and Asia, we are clearly not the #1, and there are even regions where we are a #3, #4 player. So our emphasis in terms of gaining market share is, of course, in these underpenetrated markets. Now for Pipettes, this is something that doesn't happen overnight. Even if we have superior product, it's a lot of fieldwork convincing customers and converting whole accounts. The Service business plays also an important role in providing a total solution to the customer. So a lot of room for market share gain but, again, this is significant work and the product alone will unfortunately not just make the difference.","Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Got it. And then, Bill, just quickly, when you talk about making incremental investments in anticipation of accelerated growth next year, is this a second half event or will this continue into next year as well?","William P. Donnelly","I think Olivier made the point that it's we have an overall plan of investments that we can make. We're not making them all beginning in the fourth quarter. I think we want to make some beginning here in the third quarter, but a good number in the fourth quarter and then we're going to see how the market plays out a bit. But there are -- I think we -- I think there's maybe 2 comments to it. One is -- or 2 takeaways. One is that we do think '15 can be a better growth year than '14, that we see specific growth opportunities that we think are worth investing in and the ideas go beyond just the short term in terms of what we could absorb investment-wise.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn our presentation over to your hostess, Ms. Mary Finnegan.","Mary T. Finnegan","Thanks, Pete, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today.

I am joined here by Olivier Filliol, our CEO; and Bill Donnelly, our Executive Vice President.","Now, for some administrative matters. This call is being webcast and is available for replay on our website at www.mt.com. A copy of the press release and the presentation that we will refer to on today's call is also available on our website.","Let me summarize the Safe Harbor language, which is outlined on Page 1 of the presentation.

Filliol","Thank you, Mary, and welcome to everyone on the call. I will start with a summary of the quarter and then Bill will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then comment on current business conditions, as well as provide an update on new products launched, as well as some additional investments we are making in emerging markets. As always, we will have time for Q&A at the end.","The highlight for the quarter are on Page 2 of the presentation. Local currency sales increased 1% in the quarter, with the decline in China worse than expected. However, Europe did a little better and the Americas had a solid quarter in line with expectations.","We had another quarter of gross margin improvement which, combined with the benefit of our cost control initiatives, drove a solid increase in operating profit and earnings. I'm pleased with the 8% increase in earnings per share, given the modest sales growth.","While economic indicators have pointed to some improvements, we have not yet seen that translate into our markets. We do expect some modest improvements next year and we are initiating selected investments in anticipation of more growth. Bill will provide additional details for the remainder of 2013 and for 2014, and I will now turn it over to him, to first cover third quarter financial results.","William P. Donnelly","Thanks, Olivier, and hello, everybody. Let me start with some additional details on sales, which were $591.7 million in the quarter, an increase of 1% in local currency. On a U.S.-dollar basis, sales increased by 2%, as currencies benefited us by about 1% in the quarter.","Excluding the impact of exited product lines in China, local currency sales growth was 2% in the third quarter. I'll have some additional comments on China, including the product line exits, later on the call.","One additional comment, in terms of the quarter, order entry was again better than sales with 3% growth, this translated into good backlog growth versus the prior year.","Turning to Page 3 of the presentation. We outlined sales by geography. In the quarter, local currency sales increased by 5% in the Americas and 7% in Europe. Asia\/Rest of World decreased by 8%. China was the main contributor to the Asian decline, with its sales down by 12% in total and 9% excluding the impact of exited product lines. Without the impact of the exited product line, Asia\/Rest of World declined 6% in the quarter.","On Slide #4, we showed year-to-date results by geography. For the 9 months, local currency sales increased by 4% in the Americas, by 1% in Europe, and declined by 5% in Asia\/Rest of World.","On Slide #5, we showed sales by product line for the third quarter. Laboratory Products increased by 3% in local currency, while Industrial declined 3%. Food Retailing increased by 14%. And again, adjusting for Chinese product line exits, the Industrial sales declined by 2% in the quarter.","The next slide shows year-to-date sales by product line. Laboratory Products increased 1% while Industrial declined 2%. Food Retailing has increased 3% year-to-date.","And now let me turn to Slide #7 of the presentation, which shows our full P&L. Let me walk you through the key items. We're very pleased with our gross margins, which were 53.8% in the quarter, a 50-basis-point increase over the prior year. We benefited from pricing and lower material costs, which were offset, in part, by an unfavorable mix and some currency headwinds.","R&D amounted to $29 million, a 2% increase in local currency as compared to the prior year. Growth in R&D is impacted by the timing of new product launches, and we continue to benefit from increased R&D activities in low-cost countries.","SG&A amounted to $173.4 million, which is in -- which in constant current -- which is constant with the prior year in local currency. We benefited from our cost control measures and lower variable compensation, which was offset by higher sales and marketing investments.","Adjusted operating income amounted to $116.1 million in the quarter, and this represents a 6% increase over the prior year amount of $109.2 million.","Our operating margins were 19.6%, an increase of 70 basis points over the prior year. We estimate that currency reduced operating profit growth by 2% in the quarter and reduced operating margins by 60 basis points. We're very pleased with the growth in operating income in the quarter. We were able to overcome the more challenging-than-expected market conditions in China, as well as an adverse currency environment.","Behind the scenes, it was also a quarter where we went live on 2 large projects. Our largest U.S. unit went live on Blue Ocean and we started running European logistics through our new hub structure in The Netherlands. Both of these projects are complex and had their own challenges and a fair amount of management attention. Nevertheless, we were able to drive solid operating profit growth in the quarter.","A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $6.7 million in the quarter. This is higher than last year's and last quarter, as it reflects additional amortization associated with adding more users to Blue Ocean with the previously described Go Lives.","Interest expense was $5.6 million in the quarter, while our effective tax rate continues to be 24%. Fully diluted shares were $30.6 million, which is a 3% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.60, an 8% increase over the prior year amount of $2.40 per share.","On a reported basis, earnings per share was $2.43 per share, as compared to $2.28 in the prior year. Reported earnings per share includes a pretax restructuring charge of $5.5 million or $0.14 per share. This is primarily employee-related charges for cost measures announced last year. Reported EPS also includes $0.03 of purchased intangible amortization.","The next slide highlights our year-to-date results. Let me touch briefly on the key items. Local currency sales were flat as compared to the year-earlier period and the first 9 months. Gross margins have increased by 100 basis points, while our operating profit increased by 6%. Year-to-date, adjusted EPS has increased by 10%.","We're very pleased with the earnings growth achieved in the first 9 months of this year.","Now let me turn to cash flow. We had another strong quarter of cash flow generation. Free cash flow amounted to $107.6 million, a 23% increase over the prior year amount of $87.3 million. On a per-share basis, this represents an increase of 28%.","Year-to-date, our cash flow per share is up 26% over the prior year period. For the full year, we expect free cash flow to be in the $270 million to $275 million range and we're pleased with our working capital ratio during the quarter.","ITO was at 5.2x this quarter, as compared to 4.6x a year ago and our DSO was about 44 days, about 1 day slower than last year.","This is probably a good time to spend a few minutes on our current market conditions as we see them in China, and what we think it means for our business.","Market conditions in China during the quarter were weaker than expected. Last time we spoke, overall, we saw a differentiated demand, with certain sectors investing such as environmental, food safety and auto, but many others are not investing.","On the Lab side, we had challenging comparisons and continue to feel the impact of credit constraints by certain customers such as dealers. We also saw that many Industrial customers who buy our lab equipment spent less. We would expect the overall dynamics on the Lab side to improve in the coming quarters.","Now for the Industrial business in China. We see continued weakness driven by the global -- the government slowdown in infrastructure investment, which is having a direct impact on industries such as steel and cement. We also see a slowdown in investment by many industrial customers, as we see less new plants and plant expansions.","As mentioned earlier, we exited certain businesses in China. Specifically, this relates to project businesses done with smaller regional governments as part of their infrastructure development. We have reviewed these businesses and determined that we see insufficient return opportunities. As a result, we restructured some of our activities in China and are directing resources towards more profitable opportunities. This will allow greater focus of our engineering and marketing resources on segments of the market that are driven by consumer consumption such as food, pharma, testing labs, segments which are more resilient to the economy and the future direction of that economy.","China's sales by destination were down 9% in the quarter without the impact of these product line exits, which reduced sales by a further 3%. In Q4 and in 2014, these exited product lines will reduce sales growth in China by about 2%.","While we expect sales in China to continue to be impacted in 2014 due to these market conditions, we remain bullish about China in the medium term. As their economy moves more towards consumer-driven segments, our Lab and Product Inspection instruments will grow faster and our core Industrial will be reduced as a percentage of total sales. I mentioned this last quarter, but I think it's worth repeating again, we have long believed that the growth in China will not be a smooth line, rather, will face more up and downs than in the developed world. Clearly, we're seeing some of this now.","Now let me cover guidance for Q4 and for 2014. We see dynamics differently by region. Our businesses in the Americas are solid and we see improvement in Europe, but this region remains below historic levels. I've already mentioned China, but clearly, the economic framework is more uncertain in this region that in the developed regions.","Now for the specifics. For the full year 2013, we believe our sales growth in local currency will be approximately 1%, at the lower end of the 1% to 2% range we provided last quarter. This is largely driven by our current view of short-term growth in China.","With this slightly lower revenue estimate, we're narrowing the top end of our 2013 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $10.45 to $10.50, or a growth rate of 8% to 9%.","For the fourth quarter, we'd expect local currency sales growth to be in the range of 2% to 3% and adjusted EPS of $3.70 to $3.75 or a growth of 7% to 8%.","Now for 2014, our current expectation is that local currency sales growth will be in the range of 3% to 4% and adjusted earnings per share will be in the range of $10.35 to $10.55.","Using the midpoint of our 2013 guidance, this applies -- implies an adjusted EPS growth of 8% to 10%.","In terms of how the year plays out, we'll provide more details on quarterly estimates throughout their. However, in general, we expect better growth as the year progresses. Specifically, we expect China to continue to be weak in the first half of next year. Therefore, more EPS growth will come in the later part of the year. I felt it was worth to point this out, as we now have first quarter estimates assuming a 16% EPS growth, which would not be in line with our current thinking.","Before I turn it back to Olivier, let me cover some specifics on the guidance, as I know you'll be updating your models. First, currency. We expect currency to have no impact on sales in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2013. In 2014, we also expect currency to be neutral to sales.","In terms of its impact on earnings, we would expect currency to reduce earnings by approximately 2% in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2013, currency is reducing earnings, overall, again by 2%. For the full year 2014, we expect currency to reduce earnings growth by approximately 1%, with more of the impact in the first half of the year as compared to the second half.","A couple of additional points: we have continued to assume an effective tax rate of 24% for the remainder of 2013 into 2014; and that all free cash flow will be used for share repurchases.","As I already mentioned, we expect free cash flow to be in the $270 million to $275 million range this year and about $290 million next year. This represents a 10% increase on a per share basis for free cash flow next year.","Just one final item for your models. We have assumed amortization expense in Q4 will be similar to the level that we reported in Q3. Amortization in 2014 will amount to approximately $28 million, an increase of $4 million versus 2013, mostly due to more users on Blue Ocean.","Okay. That covers my comments on guidance, and I now want to turn it back to Olivier.","Olivier A. Filliol","Thanks, Bill. Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab increased 3% in the quarter, with good growth in Europe and the Americas and a decline in Asia\/Rest of World. In terms of product area, Balances and Process Analytics had good growth.","Turning now to Industrial, which was down 3% in the quarter, with Product Inspection up low single digit and core Industrial down 5%. The decline in core Industrial is driven principally by Asia, particularly China, although we also had a decline in core Industrial in the Americas. In Europe, core Industrial was roughly flat.","For Product Inspection, we had great growth in orders, but not everything was shipped because of lead times.","Retail was up 14% in the quarter, with growth in all regions, but particularly strong growth in the Americas, due to project activity.","Now let me make some additional comments by geography. We were very pleased with the growth in the developed world in the quarter, with Europe up 7% and Americas up 5%. This compares very favorably against our direct competitors and peer companies and supports that we are continuing to gain share.","I realized that strength of the developed region was a bit overshadowed by China and the dynamics in China that specifically impacts us, given our overweight to the Industrial sector. As a reminder, we are very focused on Industrial in China, which accounts for 60% of our Chinese sales. And even our Lab business in China has a large component of industrial companies. That covers my comments on current market conditions.","While the overall economic framework is not ideal, we continue to see opportunities for growth and share gain. Let me walk you through some of our current focus areas. These are just a couple of the many examples we have.","New product launches continued to be an important driver of growth and capturing share. An example from our laboratory offering addresses a common challenge in high-throughput QC labs, due to the accidental mix-up of sample beakers during weighing and filtration. This type of mix-up can cause inaccurate test results, as well as potential liability issues for our customers.","In conjunction with the launch of our new high-end balance and our new in-motion automated sample changer, we have evolved an innovative RFID chip tag for titration. Since weighing is often the first step in the titration process, the RFID chip tag will capture all relevant data from the balance when the sample is weighed. Once captured, the information does not have to be reentered into the titrator, thereby eliminating any potential for mistakes.","Furthermore, the titration process is more efficient as beakers with different liquids can be loaded quickly onto the automated sample changer without concern about the correct order since the RFID chips have all relevant information to ensure titration is done correctly.","The titration RFID technology is just one of the several intelligent features available in our upgraded Excellence Analytical Balance. This launch provides numerous enhancements that improved productivity, accuracy and security of the weighing process in the lab. For example, an easy-to-see green status light indicates the balance is level and tuning calibration and testing are up-to-date. Another feature ensures results are not compromised by electrostatic charges that can occur with normal handling of beakers. These features help take the worry out of weighing, which is especially important to our pharmaceutical and other weight-related customers.","The balance is also compatible with our laboratory software, LabX, which provides full traceability. We completed the development and launch of this upgrade in less than 12 months, which is -- which demonstrates our agility in quickly responding to our customer needs.","Finally, we are also focused on accelerating the development of new emerging market economies of Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines. Recently, I had the opportunity to discuss the progress in these regions during the annual budget tour. After further review, we are committed to adding additional front-end resources in the emerging markets. This will include an increase in our direct field presence in Indonesia and development steps for the Philippines. We have already established a presence in Vietnam and are now working on our growth strategy for the medium term. Additional resources will also be added in Turkey and Eastern Europe. These are tactical investments, as we want to ensure we have the resources to capture share in these regions that have impressive growth potential.","That concludes our prepared remarks. In summary, we recognize that conditions remain challenging, particularly in China. We have good market positions in this region and will monitor developments closely. Our cost structure is in good shape and we believe that we are strongly positioned to capture growth opportunities and market share.","Now before I turn it to the operator, I want to make a comment on today's organizational announcement that Bill has been promoted to Executive Vice President and that Shawn Vadala will assume the role of Chief Financial Officer, reporting to Bill. The implementation of these roles and related responsibilities has been underway for some time.","I'm very pleased to have such a strong and deep finance team at the company. The finance leadership team, Bill, Shawn and Mary, have been together for more than 15 years and have tremendous level of knowledge and experience in their roles. These promotions are an acknowledgment of the broad role Bill placed within the organization, which has made -- been made possible by the increasingly important contributions Shawn has made in the finance organization. We expect to have Bill, Shawn and Mary together for many years to come.","Bill, I'm sure you would like to make some additional comments as well.","William P. Donnelly","Sure. Thanks, Olivier. Let me just make a couple points. First of all, I want to say that I'm very happy with my role here at Mettler-Toledo and excited about this development. Not only for myself, but of course, for Shawn. Some of you have met Shawn in the past, he's been our group controller, and he's been at Mettler-Toledo for about 16 years. In addition to Shawn's finance responsibilities, he's been the leader of our pricing initiatives that we've been talking about for many years. Shawn is based in Ohio and worked for us in Switzerland for 5 years earlier in his career.","In terms of myself and what this means for me, let me start by saying that I'm generally enjoying my job and I'm happy to come to work every day. I marvel at what the company has accomplished over many years, but I'm just as excited about the future and what we can all accomplish together. I'm grateful to have such a strong finance team with nearly 50 years of combined experience just between myself, Shawn and Mary. Their competence has allowed me to expand my role and to help Olivier to move the company forward.","For you guys, being the investment community, the impact of this organizational change will be limited. Shawn will continue to drive our internal financial processes under my direction; Mary will continue to report to me; and me -- and we, Mary and I, I mean, will continue to be your contacts for Investor Relations purposes. So the bottom line is no big changes from your perspective.","Okay that's it for my side and from Olivier's side, and I suggest we now open the lines for questions.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ross Muken with ISI.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So, I guess, maybe let's start out with Asia Pac and China. You gave some color on some of the specific end markets on the Industrial side that were weak: metals, mining, materials, et cetera. It seems like there are some real structural issues in those parts. As you look at the rest of the Industrial or applied or environmental complex in Asia Pac and China, specifically, were there any pockets where you saw some better order trend over the course of the quarter? Or where you felt like you're going to get a bit better contribution in '14 based on the trajectory change?","William P. Donnelly","Maybe I'd start with the following: I would say that there's an element, and we've talked about it many times in our business about how comparisons go. And I think, on the order entry side, we started seeing some slowing growth in order entry and eventually declines last year. And now, this year, we were talking about let's just compare apples-to-apples. I think, we had a total of 12% decline, including these exited product lines. And on the same basis, I think, order entry was only about a 3% decline. So I do tend to think that the comparisons will become easier starting in the second quarter of next year. So that's just maybe an overall comment. And you made some specific questions in and around segment areas. I think that if we look at these segments that are close to the consumer spending trends, you'd see a lot about consumer confidence in China, where we see nice numbers coming out of. For example, we were talking today with a Chinese leader of a bottling business and reporting super growth recently. And so we do see that the food segment of the market has one example, particularly, food quality topic is going quite well. As you mentioned, environmental, it has gone well, but not as many of our products go into that segment. And I think that Olivier often talks about the impact of capacity utilization. And from a capacity utilization, I think that there's still excess capacity, overall, from a Chinese point of view. But I think it's good that it's starting to be nothing to a little bit. Recently, their manufacturing GDP numbers and leading indicators too, that haven't been too bad. And so we do expect things to improve overall.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","You also, just to sort of stick on the topic, talked about sort of a changing mix, over time. And clearly, Lab, as a percentage of total in some of these applied markets, food, et cetera, will be a bigger part of the exposure. Remind us, where are you now in terms of mix in the region? And then, I guess, the question is how long is it going to take if some of these base markets that have helped you over, I don't know, the last 5 or 10 years, and many other players don't sort of rebound or take some time to rebound, how long will it take for kind of the mix to shift to a favorable-enough level for you to get back to more historical or significant teens or double-digit type growth rates in China and the region?","William P. Donnelly","Maybe the double-digit and mid-teens numbers, I think, we would not expect those for next year. We do expect growth and pretty decent growth in the second half of the year. But probably, our view would be before we see mid-teens again it would be, at a minimum, probably '15.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, on Europe, can you just sort of dissect there just maybe the pacing of the quarter and then I'll bow out?","William P. Donnelly","Okay. Do you want to...","Olivier A. Filliol","Yes. Maybe, Ross, just quickly back on China. I want to stress the point the part it will take longer for us to recover is the part where there is significant overcapacity. And consumer confidence will not really help there, that takes typically multiple quarters. However, there are regions in China that are still developing. And there we see, actually, growth. And I was happy to see that the west, for example, for us, in China, had good growth. And so I am actually confident that next year we'll find segments and we will find multiple territories that will yield good growth for us and that it takes just a little bit more time than for the other segments steel, but also chemical and so on, that will take a couple of quarters to rebalance because they have overcapacity. So yes, that's maybe an additional flavor of why we feel comfortable that later next year, China will show better numbers for us.","William P. Donnelly","In terms of how the pacing went in Europe, order entry growth was, I think, one percentage point less than sales growth in the quarter. But it shows it was not just us eating in the backlog, it was a solid number for Europe. And so I think we'll have a decent growth number coming out in Q4. I would not expect it to be 7% again, but I think we'll see a mid-single digit kind of growth number in Q4 as well.","Operator","The next question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","If I could just maybe spend another minute on China, I'd be interested if you could put some color on what you're seeing in terms of market penetration there? And, specifically, I think there's been some controversy, over the last few years, as to the fact that on the one hand, you've done a great job capturing the opportunity, on the other hand, the marginal customers you were working with are typically in tier 2 and 3 cities. And, I think, in the summertime, when there was a little bit of the spike in the cyborg dynamic, there was some concern about their access to credit and so forth. So I was just wondering, this quarter, if you could maybe put an update on how you feel about your market penetration? And if that was up to your expectations, as you put the greater Chinese kind of performance in context?","Olivier A. Filliol","Okay. I still feel extremely good about our market position. We are certainly the strongest brand. We are perceived as having an excellent quality. We have a very strong team and we have a very good coverage. We are facing a lot of competition there, local competition. As mentioned at previous times, the Chinese market is still very fragmented, in particular, also in Industrial area. But I feel very comfortable that we can maintain this very strong position. I would, however, recognize that the current environment leads to situations where we are walking away because our margins get too low or we are walking away because the payment terms are not attractive to us and these kinds of businesses can go to competition, but that's okay for us. I feel also that our strategy that we are pursuing, of expanding our coverage in China going to second tier, third tier cities, is still a very good one. I have continued evidence that this development will go on and that we can capture additional market share by this strategy. So I really feel the team and the strategy is very solid and we just need now to overcome this economic cycle and these challenges.","It doesn't come fully unexpected. We always said that China is offering very good growth prospects, but it's also more volatile than in the western markets. And we enjoyed excellent growth for many, many quarters, and now we are challenged. And nevertheless, we didn't expect that it would last that many quarters. That's certainly also when we talked last time, I would have expected a better number for this quarter and that's certainly one reason why we remain cautious going forward. But the mid- and long-term prospect of China remains very, very good. We see also that, in particular, for the type of equipment that we are selling in China, we are in a favored position. And the drive towards quality is helping us also relative to competition and we are known for the best quality products. And that positions us well versus international competition, but also versus local competition.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","One follow-up here on the food retail business. I know it's small and less of a driver for the overall, but it looked like a pretty solid print there on growth this quarter. I'm wondering if there's a onetime event we should keep in mind? Or if there's a dynamic here that could persist through the end of the calendar year?","Olivier A. Filliol","It's a lumpy business and, often, it can be driven by large projects, in this case, actually it wasn't a particularly large project, the U.S. actually did well on retail and we had also in Europe that did well.","William P. Donnelly","It's was a relatively easier comp. Actually, the comp getting a little bit tougher but, hey, I think our market position in China remains -- or sorry, in retail remains pretty solid.","Operator","The next question comes from Daniel Brennan with Morgan Stanley.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just maybe you could spend just a little more time on the topic right now China, but in terms of the businesses that you added in the quarter, maybe just a little more color about the decision behind that. I know you gave some quantification of the impact on growth. But any comment what those business have been doing for you? And as we look out, is it something that we should expect going forward? If you could be more tactical on any other parts of the portfolio in China?","Olivier A. Filliol","Hey, Dan, this way of businesses steps, as long as the economy was doing well, were attractive to us. Now when the economy becomes difficult, we certainly face margin pressure there, and then, in particular, the financial terms became difficult, and payment terms that just were not acceptable for us. And that's certainly also driven by the structure, who owns the businesses that is buying the type of equipment, and so we decided to exit it. I would stress the point that this is businesses that we were -- historically, wanted doing it in China, and we don't have that kind of business in U.S. or Europe. And I do not foresee that this becomes, now, a prejudice for more to come. I think that was an exercise that we had to do this summer under this new economic circumstances. And in that sense, I look at it as a onetime effort that we have to do here. But it carries forward into next year.","William P. Donnelly","I would add that, I think, by making that decision to do that, it allowed us to be able to communicate more easily with the Chinese management team about redirecting resources to the better growth opportunities. By making that decision, then, it was easier for us to push for investment in other areas.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then, in terms of -- as you mention, Olivier, like when you look at some of the signs on China manufacturing, PMI or something in that has been grinding kind of steadily, but slowly, up. But yet, certainly, the difficulty for us to watch from the outside, how your industrial business is doing inside, and how much of the benefit lurks from of the build-out, and now maybe the kind of low utilization despite the manufacturing team are increasing, maybe the question is, how -- the visibility that you have and the cushion maybe you put to the -- may have built in for next year, what do we look for to maybe kind of help us get comfort as we watch some macro indicators over there and for the turnaround in your Industrial Business, I mean, anything you can help us there?","Olivier A. Filliol","Yes. I would start with the point that the key challenge that we face in many of the industry segments is that the manufacturing GDP growth came down versus expectations. And so many of our customers have overcapacity. And in that sense, even if manufacturing GDP growth recovers, it first needs to recover so much that the overcapacity is reduced or eliminated. And that's why Bill referred before, that we see fewer new plants being built and there is less plant expansions. Predicting exactly this one is difficult, but having consumer confidence coming back is the first step toward seeing -- having our customers again, getting confidence that they will sell more and, therefore, need to have increased capacity. So these very early trends are going in the right direction. And we are just facing a delay until we are going to see it in our numbers. Of course, it varies also by product lines as well as business segments. For example, for the food industry, I would expect that to see it much faster than, for example, in the chemical industry.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Maybe I sneak one more in. Can you let us know, what's kind of implicit in your guidance next year, Olivier? Like for China, as you look at '13, what's implicit and kind of -- whatever kind of improvement or more gradual decline as kind of built-in your guidance for '14?","William P. Donnelly","We'll have -- we expect kind of mid single-digit growth coming out of Asia and then, China might be a little bit less than that because of the impact of these exited product lines. And then, we would assume that Lab does better than Industrial within that mix. So yes, you probably -- you'll see, even some minus maybe, in Industrial at the early part of the year, but the overall picture would be something like how I described.","Olivier A. Filliol","And within Industrial we would expect product inspection doing better than core industrial..","William P. Donnelly","Product Inspection will do very well, but percentage-wise, it's not that big of a number yet. Not the same ratio as we have in the west.","Operator","The next question comes from John Groberg with Macquarie.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Last quarter, Olivier, you spent much time talking about service revenues. Can you maybe give us an update on what those did in the quarter and maybe geographically?","Olivier A. Filliol","Yes. So service was in the quarter -- Mary is just helping us.","William P. Donnelly","3.5%.","Olivier A. Filliol","3.5% growth. And actually, we did pretty well across the globe. Americas maybe a little bit less. Bill mentioned on the call that we went live with Blue Ocean in U.S. and you can imagine a go-live for Blue Ocean impacts definitely also the service organization. And in that sense, we were a little bit lower there. But overall, Europe and, actually, Asia, including also China, was reasonably well on service.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then, Olivier, I know you mentioned that most of your free cash flows you mean to pile back in the buybacks, as you have historically have done. It's about 3.5% -- for 3%, 3.5% free cash flow yield right now, in terms of where the stock is. I'm just curious, as you think about maybe in China and wanting to diversify a little bit away into outside of the core industrial and to some of the markets are growing faster, and you look at some of the other analytical tools and technologies that are out there that are continuing to grow fairly fast in China, do you think about maybe looking at -- you've done deals in the past, like smaller adjacencies that can give you access to new technologies that might help you to improve that mix of your business in a geography like China more quickly?","Olivier A. Filliol","The main strategy remains really the same. We, as you mentioned, we are interested in adjacent technologies. We are interested in consolidating the markets, but I would not give particular focus on China. And there are not that many opportunities. And to be honest, acquisitions in China are not that easy, there always are complications with would to pick[ph] at this stage, I have also to say, I prefer that our team is focused on the organic opportunities. I really think that with our portfolio, we have many opportunities and we don't need to do acquisitions to regain here a good growth out of China. So it's not a particular focus.","William P. Donnelly","I might add that maybe the start of your question, Jon, might have implied M&A versus share repurchase, and I think we both feel that, to the extent, we identify opportunities that makes sense, there's plenty of room in the balance sheet to absorb acquisitions and that wouldn't hinder our share repurchase plans.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Right. And I was saying so much for trying but I was thinking, you say, for example, your product inspection or food testing, or some of these areas that are less represented in China, maybe as a firm overall, there could be, if you want to move away from having as much exposure in pure industrial, maybe you look at -- there are some pretty clear adjacent technologies that analytical tools that people use in areas like food safety testing and other areas. So that's more what I meant in terms of entry point. Bill, not that you'd have to do one or the other, but I didn't know if that at all more of a focus in terms of looking some at adjacencies that you might get into?","Olivier A. Filliol","We remain very interested in these and you have seen us, for example, by acquiring 2 vision inspection companies in the last 2 years. So these kind of adjacencies, remain of high interest to us. Vision inspection is a technology that has accelerated growth, is very complimentary to the PI portfolio and would definitely also -- or will have a good impact on emerging markets and so on. We are interested and we pursue these acquisition opportunities, but there is nothing that I see here materialize in the coming weeks or that I would have something to announce here.","Operator","The next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I won't ask you on China here. But just I'm thinking about some of the comments for '14. Can you talk a little bit about pricing, what's baked in the guidance for pricing?","William P. Donnelly","Hey, I think we're going to be able to do a number in the 150-basis-point range. That's a little less than we have this year. As a reminder, we did a mid-year price increase in 2012, which benefited us this year. But the way we see the market, at that point in time, we're able to push through a midyear price increase, in part, because of a lot of sense of inflation coming in. We don't see that opportunity now, but a number in 150 basis points, we think is realistic for next year.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then, can you kind of help breakout for this quarter, these margin benefits, that you saw from price material cost and mix?","William P. Donnelly","So in the quarter, price increases were up about 240 bps. And just as a reminder, that had about 120 bps impact on the gross profit margin, just the way the math works.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then, Olivier, you commented on selective reinvestment. You gave us a sense of some of the new products a little bit. Are you able to kind of quantify the extent to which you're stepping up some of the investments for next year?","Olivier A. Filliol","The way we should look at it, we always launch many products every year. And in that sense, I would first say an individual product doesn't make a huge difference to the top line. And the same without however else to say, to the R&D budget. Our R&D budget are relatively stable and I would also expect when make sure that the R&D budget remains about the same what we have had in recent years. I do expect that our productivity continues to increase our R&D, because we are also leveraging low-cost countries in R&D activities. On the investments that I was referring in the prepared remarks, was more towards field resources. The example that I gave on the call was, for example, Indonesia, Vietnam, Philippines, Turkey, Brazil, but many other markets. This is, in essence, less related to product innovation, but making sure that we have really a good coverage in the different markets, in different territories, investing in application specialists. But sometimes, it can be also the expansion of our telesales team or other marketing activities. So again, investment more towards growth, to field activity and field presence.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then, a last one on -- sticking with the cost theme, when things slowed a year ago, you took out incremental costs. How do you think about things in the current environment, given the present set of challenges, in particular, with China that you kind of talk about here?","Olivier A. Filliol","So for China, we are taking measures. We started actually already early in the year. And we saw still underway, we have selective headcount reductions and we are certainly also doing resource shift, Bill referred before, to the business exits that we have that allow us to redirect the attention of the team to more attractive segments and this is associated also with resource shift. Besides that, in the September time frame, Bill or myself were on the global tour to do the budget, reviews with all our operating units. With these operating units, we are assuming a modest improvement of the economic environment and this is reflected in the operational plans. Should the economic environment change for the worse, of course, we would have to go back and rethink some of the assumptions and the related cost base. But it's not that we feel that we already need to initiate here another cost program.","Operator","The next question comes from Dan Arias with UBS.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Unfortunately, I'm going to ask about China, but I only have one question. So with Bill or Olivier, I guess, are you seeing any exits from the markets in China, aside from your own? I think, over the summer, you had talked about may be ending up in a better position, once the smoke had cleared on the cycle we're in, just from some small players deciding not to stick it out, could that still be the case?","Olivier A. Filliol","Yes. We'd still see that. It's a -- hey, I have hard time to give you concrete examples and -- but the fact is, we, in China, the big-named industrial weighing world, we are talking about hundreds of local competitors many of them are family-owned and small regional players. I definitely would observe that they are faced with even more difficulties, and the financial situation makes it also very difficult for them. So yes, I do expect that we will continue to emerge stronger out of that situation. But it's very difficult to quantify what this really means.","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Knight with Janney Securities.","Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","As we've seen this recovery in the economic indicators like PMI, it seems like the recovery has been slow, globally. Why do you think that is? And obviously, you had lower end organic growth, what do you see happening in, I guess, customers\u2019 attitudes creating this kind of slow, shallow recovery?","William P. Donnelly","You're probably wording the question in a way that's a little different than how we think, so it's hesitating a little bit. I think, first of all, I think, we've always been a little bit late cycle would be kind of one comment when it comes to economic recovery. And then the second thing is, if you think about our Western businesses, our Western businesses always have -- are largely replacement in nature, either the replacement of our own products or the replacement of competitor products. And so replacement cycles rely, to a certain extent, on economic stability. I think, right now, we're definitely benefiting in Europe from both of those. I think, for the first time in a while, now, in 2013, Europe is not having a lot of noise, and we see, now, a return to good growth in Europe, as a result of that, combined with easier comparisons because of it. In the Americas, I think we very much see the same. I think our Americas numbers were solid in a quarter with 5% growth. And I think we'll put up something similar in the fourth quarter. I think in terms of what we see in China, it's a combination of things. It's the growth, we're a little bit later cycle of its impact of capacity utilization in the investment in new plants and plant expansions that Olivier talked about, and then, the fact that our business is going through a little bit this transition from some of the older infrastructure-related segments to some of the newer segments and how that evolves over time. So I -- our view is we're going to start to see some modest improvements next year. Certainly, we'll grow more in '14 than we did in '13 on the top line. And China's a little bit the variable. If China goes better, faster, than we think, that could be an upside. But as well, we need to see if there's another, if there could be another bump in the road there or somewhere else as well.","Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And then, the last question would be labor cost in emerging markets, is that an issue? Is it more difficult, less difficult, tone there? And that's the second question.","William P. Donnelly","Yes, I think we have similar type of inflationary pressures on labor and other factors in emerging markets, particularly in China. But a very much in line with what we've had in recent years. I would say that our teams there have always done a good job of productivity gains. We focus on that a lot in China, make investments, whether that be in automation, in Lean processes or whatever, and we expect that to continue. The one thing I might add to it is that vis-\u00e0-vis our pricing initiatives, our emerging market countries are getting better at realizing prices than in the past. And I think that's one additional lever that we have now, going forward, to help us overcome some of this inflation that you talked about.","Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And then last, Olivier, you talked about South Asia. And do you think South Asia has the same opportunity that you saw in China 10 years ago?","Olivier A. Filliol","Yes, I wouldn't too much correlate's it with China, I would say, in general, emerging markets are, actually in China, we have a particular situation because we started extremely early, we were -- we're one of the very first fine companies there. And we, very early on, build up production plants, have local engineering and it's certainly also one of the reasons why we are more skewed with the Industrial business mix. But the order -- emerging markets, don't have the same business mix. And typically, actually, we would even first enter our market through Lab and Product Inspection and then the Industrial would follow. And that's partially now also the case with this new Southeast Asia market. And yes, I have big hopes. We have an excellent team. We have been -- we have a very strong base today already in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, and that strong team is a bridgehead to go into Vietnam, Indonesia and Philippines. And in that sense I would rather see scaling up that presence to these new markets rather than saying it\u2019s out of China or has a connection with China.","Operator","The next question comes from Sung Ji Nam with Cantor.","Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Maybe just another question on emerging markets. If you could talk about some of the -- like India, Brazil and Russia, which I think, in aggregate, are pretty sizable business for you guys and how they performed in the quarter, and what the outlook might be in those areas?","Olivier A. Filliol","Okay. Let me start maybe by saying, while emerging markets, in total, is about 36%, 11% more than half, or about half, is coming from China. And then the remaining countries, all are much smaller. None of the other countries would actually be more than 3%. So it's -- we have important markets like India. We have Brazil. We have Russia. I mentioned Southeast Asia, but also countries like Korea and so on, In general, I have to say, I'm pleased at how they are performing. I would, first, also say, we have very strong teams in all these countries. And we have a very strong market presence. In India, you have heard me talking in the past, we still have some development to do. We, for a couple of years, didn't grow as we wanted. And then we had the leadership change and made some other changes 2 years ago. I feel that the team has actually emerged very strong out of these changes. But I would also recognize that the Indian market, the Indian economy, is a challenging environment right now. But how we do, relative to competition and peers, I'm very pleased by that. So that's -- maybe as a context, I would recognize that several emerging markets are impacted by the Chinese slowdown. We would see that even in Brazil, because Brazil would also export a lot of things to China, and so there are side effects, all we have the neighbor countries of China, of course, that are also impacted.","Operator","The next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So Bill, can we talk a little bit about just sort of expectations for margins in 2014? Just sort of running through my model and assume that you guys do the same general share buyback, it looks like, generally flattish operating margin forecast for next year, is that sort of where you're booking?","William P. Donnelly","No. We're going to do, I think, a little bit better that, I think we'll have 50 basis points.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And in just historically, in Q4, we always have...","William P. Donnelly","Yes. Just to be clear, I was talking about the number. We always talk about that number before amortization, and then you'll have amortization increase, I think, by $4 million or something.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And for Q4, typically you have between Q3 and Q4's in terms of the gross margin number, same trend this year?","William P. Donnelly","Yes. Yes, let's call it, 50 bps versus Q3 and, I think, could be a couple points more than that.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And finally, for interest expense guidance for 2014?","William P. Donnelly","So interest expense will be a modest increase, let's call it something like $1.5 million or something.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Bill, looking back over many, many years, I can't recall you ever guiding such a narrow range for local currency growth for your initial cut. It feels like a lot can happen between now and a year from now. Anything particular message hidden in this dynamic?","William P. Donnelly","No, not really. A, probably because the midpoint that we felt was the most likely number required that we have a narrow range. And I know that sounds kind of funny, but it would've been funny to give guidance of 2.5 to 4.5, so we gave guidance of 3 to 4. I wish I had a more scientific way to give it to you, Brandon.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Fair enough. And then could you give us a sense of what you're anticipating for local currency growth, by geography, and perhaps, by segment? That'd be helpful.","William P. Donnelly","Sure. I think that we're going to have, in '14, we'll have low- to mid-single-digit growth in Europe and the Americas, with the Americas being a little bit better, Europe a little bit worse. And then, the Asia\/Rest of World number, should be in the mid-single-digit range, with China being a little less, largely just because of these product line exits we described and the impact that they'll have for the, let's call it, the first 3 quarters, 2 quarters of next year. Yes, hey, that gives you a feeling, geographically. In terms of the divisional view or product category view, we should get mid-single digits coming out of our Lab business. I think because of the big China mix, our Industrial business, our core industrial business will be flat, but we'll have high single-digit growth in the Product Inspection area, and, hey, let's assume that, that ends up being a low to mid-single-digit kind of growth rate combined. And then, hey retail will be flattish.","Operator","There are no additional questions at this time. I turn the call back to our presenters.","Mary T. Finnegan","Thanks, Jay.

Thank you.","And I would now like to turn the presentation over to your hostess for today's call, Ms. Mary Finnegan. Please proceed, ma'am.","Mary T. Finnegan - Treasurer & Head-Investor Relations","Thanks, Jennifer, and good evening, everyone. I am Mary Finnegan. I am the Treasurer and I'm also responsible for Investor Relations at Mettler-Toledo. I'm happy you're joining us for this call. I am joined tonight by Olivier Filliol, our CEO, and Bill Donnelly, our Executive Vice President. I need to cover just a couple administrative matters. This call is being webcast and is available for replay on our website. A copy of the press release and the presentation is also available on the website.","On page one, we have our Safe Harbor language. Let me just cover it quickly.

More detailed information with respect to non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided in our Form 8-K.","I'll now turn the call over to Olivier.","Olivier A. Filliol - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Mary, and welcome to everyone on the call. I will start with a summary of the quarter and then Bill will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments before we open the lines for Q&A. The highlights for the quarter are on page two of the presentation. We had a solid start to the year with our first quarter results. Local currency sales increased 4%.","We had another quarter of good growth in America, while Europe came in a little weaker than expected. Emerging markets growth was solid, and we are pleased that we had sales growth in China in the quarter. With strong execution and the benefit of productivity initiatives, we achieved good growth in EPS, which increased 9% in the quarter. This equates to 11.5% growth excluding the impact of currency. We are pleased with these results and that the year is off to a good start.","Now let met turn it to Bill to cover the numbers.","William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President","Thanks, Olivier, and hello to everybody. Sales were $539.7 million in the quarter, that's an increase of 4% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased by 1%, as currencies reduced sales by 3% in the quarter.","Turning to page three of the presentation, we'll outline sales by geography. In the quarter, local currency sales increased by 6% in the Americas and 4% in Asia\/Rest of World and were flat in Europe. Regarding the Europe number, we may have underestimated a little the impact of Easter being in March this year versus April last year. Europe should do better in the second quarter. China had sales growth of 6% in the quarter, which is better than we expected.","Turning to slide number four, we outline sales growth by product line. Laboratory had local currency growth of 5%, Industrial increased 2%, and Food Retailing was up 5%. All comparisons are versus the prior-year quarter.","Turning to the next slide, let me walk you through the key items in the P&L for the quarter. Our gross margins were 55.6% as compared to 55.8% in the prior year. We're pleased with the continued good contributions from pricing and from our material cost reduction programs. Offsetting this were negative mix and some targeted investments in our service business.","Currency was neutral to gross margins in the quarter. As a reminder, gross margins had a very tough comp. In Q1 last year, our gross margins were up 270 basis points, of which 170 basis points of the increase was on a constant currency basis. R&D amounted to $29 million. That's a 5% increase in local currency, while SG&A amounted to $168.9 million, and that's an increase of 1% in local currency over the prior year. Investments in our Field Turbo program and higher variable comp were offset in part by cost-saving initiatives.","Adjusted operating income amounted to $102 million in the quarter. That's a 5% increase over the prior-year amount of $97.3 million. Currency reduced operating profit by $2 million. Absent currency headwinds, growth in operating income would have been 7%. Our operating margin was 18.9%, that's a 70 basis point increase over the prior year.","A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $8.4 million in the quarter. Interest expense was $6.6 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate continues to be 24%. Fully diluted shares for the quarter were 27.4 million, which is a 4.7% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.46 per share, a 9% increase over the prior year amount of $2.25 per share. Excluding the impact of currency, adjusted EPS increased by 11.5% in the quarter. On a reported basis, EPS was $2.40 as compared to $2.19 in the prior year. Reported EPS includes $0.04 of purchase intangible amortization and $0.02 of restructuring charges.","Now turning to cash flow. In the quarter, free cash flow amounted to $29.1 million as compared to $41.3 million in the prior year. We're pleased with our working capital management and further improvement in DSO, which was reduced by one day to 43 days as compared to the prior year. ITO was 4.6. The decline in cash flow versus the prior year is due primarily to the timing of working capital items, which was somewhat impacted by Easter falling in March this year as compared to April last year. We are on target for the full-year goal.","Now let me turn to guidance. We're raising our full-year local currency sales guidance to 4% versus the 3% to 4% guidance we provided in February. This reflects a better view on China overall, somewhat offset by an expectation that Europe could be a little weaker than we expected.","Overall, we feel very good about our product offering and our sales execution, in fact, better than we did three months ago. We also have raised our earnings per share guidance and now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.25 per share to $4.35 per share (sic) [$14.25 per share to $14.35 per share] (8:01-8:07), and that's a growth of 10% to 11%. This compares to previous guidance of 9% to 11% or $4.10 (sic) [$14.10 per share] (8:15) to $14.30 per share.","Let me provide some additional background on our guidance for the remainder of the year. We now estimate that currency will have minimum impact on EPS for the full year. Previously, we had estimated that currency would be a headwind to EPS growth for the last three quarters of this year of approximately 1% or about $0.11 per share. Now we estimate a positive $0.04 impact over the last three quarters. We expect to have continued gross margin expansion for the full year, but at a lower rate than we originally assumed. For the coming three quarters, year-over-year gross profit margins should be up about 50 basis points on average.","We also plan to expand our Field Turbo program further in the second half of this year as compared to our original assumption. We like the program's results so far and believe the environment is improving. This will offset some of the productivity gains we have and you saw in our Q1 results.","One final item. Our share count will be a little higher than maybe your models had given our recent stock price performance year-to-date. This is a smaller adjustment to our forecast. It reduces EPS by approximately $0.06, but since you're updating your models, we thought it was worth mentioning. To incorporate these factors, we are raising the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.10. We now assume EPS will increase 10% to 11% as compared to the 9% to 11% previously.","Now let's look at the second quarter. We expect local currency sales growth of approximately 4% and adjusted EPS in the range of $3.09 to $3.14. This reflects a growth rate of 10% to 12%. We do not expect currency to meaningfully impact EPS growth in the second quarter. In terms of currency impact on sales growth, we would expect currency to reduce sales growth by 1.5% in the second quarter and 1% for the full year.","One final miscellaneous item. In the second quarter, we're going to take a non-cash pension accounting charge of approximately $8 million related to a lump sum offering to former employees of our U.S. plan. This plan is frozen, in fact it's been frozen for a long time, and the timing was advantageous to cash out the vested portion of these former employees. There is no cash flow impact to the company, as we use pension plan assets to fund the payments.","Okay, that's it for my side and I now want to turn it back to Olivier.","Olivier A. Filliol - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Bill. Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab had good growth, with 5% local currency sales growth, which is on top of strong growth in the prior year. Pipette and AutoChem had very strong growth, while Balances also had good growth. Good product pipeline, benefit of Field Turbo investments and continued strong sales and marketing programs are well contributing to strong Lab performance. Spending by our biopharma customers was strong.","Industrial increased 2% in the quarter, driven by Product Inspection, which was up 7%. Product Inspection had good growth in most regions and we continued to benefit from solid market conditions and very strong competitive advantages in this market. Core Industrial was down slightly in the quarter. Finally, Retail was up 5% with strong performance in Americas and Asia offset by a decline in Europe.","Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales growth in the Americas increased 6%, with good growth in most product lines. Core Industrial was down modestly, however, it was against strong comparisons in the prior-year period of 8%. We continue to feel good about our growth in the Americas, but they will face tougher comparisons, particularly in the back half of the year.","Europe sales growth was flat in the quarter, a little weaker than we expected. We had good growth in Lab and Product Inspection but declines in Core Industrial and strong decline in Retail. As mentioned earlier, there was some impact of Easter holiday timing.","Asia and Rest of the World had growth of 4% in the quarter. As Bill mentioned, China had growth of 6%. While we are pleased with the good start, overall economic environment remains challenging in China. In particular, overcapacity remains in the industrial sector, which will take time to resolve. However, we are seeing good results in market segments, such as Life Sciences. We've had recent wins in our Process Analytics and Pipette businesses with research organizations such as the CDC and China National Biotec Corporate.","Our technologies centered on Intelligent Sensors in Process Analytics and our LiteTouch systems in Pipettes helped us beat competition. Our Industrial team also had some successes. For example, we received an important order at a new pharmaceutical facility to provide a comprehensive solution to integrate formulation software with their bench and floor scales. These are only a couple of small examples, but I thought worth sharing as they demonstrate that the breadth of our product offering provides us good opportunities to target the growth segments of the Chinese market even when many segments struggle.","I recently visited Southeast Asia and had business reviews with our teams from Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Philippines. I'm impressed with the good growth we are achieving in these regions, despite economic conditions which are challenging. We have strong management teams with proven success capitalizing on Field Turbo investments and our Spinnaker sales, service and marketing initiative.","I am pleased how we continue to create and develop market organizations in new countries. Recent examples include Turkey, Indonesia, Philippines, New Zealand. All of these markets delivered strong results as we benefit from our direct presence. Our intentional customers really value our direct presence in these countries, particularly customers of our Product Inspection, Process Analytics, and Lab businesses.","Those are all my comments on business strengths. I want to spend a few minutes today providing an update on our Automated Chemistry business. AutoChem provides enabling technology and software to develop and transfer bench scale chemistry into commercial processes. We are the clear market leaders in automated lab reactors and associated analytical tools that analyze chemical reactions in real-time. Our solutions provide customers increased R&D productivity, better product and process quality and ensure commercial processes deliver higher yields at lower costs.","Driven by the reality that biopharma and chemical companies are under ever-increasing pressure to bring products to market faster, customers have increased their adoption of our AutoChem technology to increase R&D productivity. AutoChem had excellent sales growth in 2015, driven by increased adoption of our technology by our traditional customers combined with greater penetration in the biopharma large molecule segment.","The prospects for Automated Chemistry remain strong, as we estimate the majority of potential users still use in-house engineered solutions which have fundamental limitations. We're increasingly seeing the general adoption of our EasyMax and OptiMax as the enabling platforms for automated lab reactors and are making great inroads in migrating chemists, engineers and biopharma scientists to adopt this technology to substantially improve productivity.","Expanding our product offering is core to our market leadership in this segment. As our technology gains greater adoption, we see continued opportunity to provide a wider range of solutions. For example, we filled a gap in our offering with a plug-and-play control unit that provides automation for already installed manual high-volume, low-cost reaction systems. RX-10 has an easy-to-use interface that enhances data capture, increases automation and reinforces our automated lab reactors as the tool of choice in chemical development labs. This month, we will also introduce a new software package which reduces process complexity, including for data analysis, which allows a tool to be used by non-experts.","Our market-leading technology combined with the largest service force in this market provides excellent competitive advantages for us. Our Spinnaker sales and marketing programs along with Field Turbo resources are positioning us well for further growth. For those of you that will be attending our Investor Meeting in July, you will have an opportunity to hear a little more about this business and see first hand some of our innovative technology for this market.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Let me make some summary comments before opening it up for questions. We feel good about the start to 2016, but remain cautious on the global economy, given the uncertainties that exist. Our initiatives are well on track, and we expect to continue to benefit from our strong product pipeline, Field Turbo investments, Spinnaker sales and marketing program and our margin and productivity measures. Our focus is on execution and driving above-market growth.","I want now to ask the operator to open the questions for us.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Citigroup.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good afternoon, guys.","William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President","Hi, Dan.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Bill, China during the quarter, to what extent do you feel like the results there relative to your guidance were driven by better market conditions, better demand versus maybe your expectations on sales force or sales manager activities, some internal things?","William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President","So, certainly they did a little bit better than we expected. Just as a reminder, we talked to you a little bit last quarter about how we had done some things in terms of the sales teams to try to get them in the field a little bit more. Often in the early part of the year, we have sales meetings, training sessions, things. And so we did expect to do \u2013 frankly, in our original models, we thought Q1 would be the best quarter of the year.","And at this stage, we feel like we're going to get full-year growth, and that's an improvement. Probably low-single digit growth, maybe a little upside to that, but low-single digit growth for the full year. That compares to a low-single digit decline that we would have guided you to before.","If we look at the different pieces of business, of course our Lab business did particularly well during the quarter. It had solid growth. But even our Industrial business showed some signs of improving. If I were to look at order entry, maybe the Lab numbers were a little bit better than the order entry.","And then the other piece of the surprise was our Retail business did well in China. That's always a little bit lumpy there as it is in other parts of the world as well. So we expect another positive number in China next quarter, maybe not quite as good as what we saw this quarter. And I think maybe in three months we can give guys a better sense of if it's the bottom or if we could see more lumpiness going forward.","There's still a lot of fundamental issues in China around overcapacity and some fragility in some of the financial markets, but it's nice to get some good surprises there in China. We hadn't had them in a long time and we'll take that. And we feel like the team executed real well, particularly vis-\u00e0-vis competition.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, that's really helpful. And if I sort of stick with the geographic view here. I think the comps get a little easier in the back half of the year for Europe. So should we be thinking about sequential improvement through the quarters there? And then maybe in the emerging regions, I'm just curious what the outlook for Russia is in terms of a pick-up and maybe whether Brazil, you're feeling like you might have found a bottom on that?","William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President","Okay, so let's start with Europe. I actually think Q2 will be a solid quarter. We see that already kind of in April. I think it's pretty clear to us that we had a little move in Europe between March and April due to the change in Easter. It impacts some of those European countries, although I look at Olivier, and it didn't have any impact in Switzerland because they were there, they were there throughout.","So Europe, if I look at multi-year growth rates, I think your comment maybe applies on two-year growth rates, but I think a little bit less so if we were to look at three-year growth rates, Dan. So maybe at this point, Q2 might be one of the better quarters for Europe given what moved between March and April.","In terms of Brazil, maybe I'll let Olivier give a couple comments about Brazil.","Olivier A. Filliol - President and Chief Executive Officer","Hey. And maybe in general emerging markets outside of China had actually growth in Q1, but certainly Brazil and Russia are still challenging. Actually, Brazil was down mid-teens, so significantly down. But when I look forward, I would, for example, expect Russia to do better. We had good order entry growth and so I am a bit more optimistic for Russia, And Brazil will continue to be challenging. But it's good to see, and then as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, I also expect Southeast Asia doing well. So for the remainder of the year, emerging markets should do actually okay, probably with the exception of Brazil.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Very good. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And your next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Patrick B. Donnelly - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. It's actually Patrick Donnelly in for Tycho. Just on the Service front, Bill, I think you noted some increased investments there. What went into that decision and is that getting a little more competitive as other companies increase focus in that area where you've always been a strong entrenched player?","Olivier A. Filliol - President and Chief Executive Officer","Services is one of the area where we really want to get stronger and we want to have a growth above a product because it strengthens the franchise, it's good in terms to have customer access and, of course, from a profitably standpoint it's very attractive. Services generates actually above group average profitability. Service is a strategic priority for us. We have given a lot of attention to Service in the recent years and will continue to do so.","In recent years, we had to invest heavily in Service related to harmonizing our Service product offering across the world. We wanted also to streamline our processes, we wanted to prepare Service also to bring into our Blue Ocean platform. And more recently, we started to invest now in Service in the growth area and so also about adding telesales people to sell service contracts and also have better coverage. So the investment goes there.","We see actually good results. We were happy to see that in Q1 Service and Consumables was actually up 6%. So as you can see, higher than what we had on products. And I am optimistic that we will continue to do well in Service. And so the investment and the attention that business gets is well deserved.","Patrick B. Donnelly - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Then on Field Turbo, another place you talked about increasing investments. I think last quarter you talked about adding something around 200 front-end resources for 2016. How much has that number shifted higher now that you're focusing some more investments there?","Olivier A. Filliol - President and Chief Executive Officer","So the 200 that we were talking about last time was across the whole year. What we are doing now is we're doing additional opportunities and funding it and it's also something that goes across my table. And that will be then going into the second half of the year and particularly also impacting next year. So there is always a lag between our commitment to it and until it goes really in effect.","You can imagine the teams are developing these business cases and then we review. We commit to it, fund it, but then it takes a couple of months to recruit the people, train the people, onboard the people. So there is always a lag. So the additional commitment that we have goes to the second part of the year and is a pre-investment also for next year.","Patrick B. Donnelly - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then maybe just one last quick one for Bill on gross margins. I know you said you faced a tough comp. Can you just talk about the contribution, pricing, FX, some of the other factors there? Thank you.","William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President","Sure. So in terms of pricing, net realized prices were up about 180 basis points. That helped gross profit margin itself by about 80 basis points. Our material costs on an apples-to-apples basis were down about 120 basis points and that contributed about 20 basis points to gross profit margin. And then in terms of other \u2013 we had some negative mix and as I mentioned some investments on the Service side that they'll pick up productivity levels in the second half of the year.","Patrick B. Donnelly - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Evans with Wells Fargo Securities.","Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Bill, just wanted to kind of step back and ask a bigger picture philosophical question on share repurchases. The plan that you have this year to repurchase shares at a rate greater than your free cash flow, is that something you see continuing indefinitely, or is that more of a one-year thing?","William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President","Well, I think it's something that we look at all the time. We do an intrinsic value calculation over various scenarios with the board and we monitor how that goes. We're of course looking at what might come up in terms of acquisitions or maybe more significant capital expenditures.","We would say sitting here today I think we're going to repurchase about $0.5 billion this year. And we still have those building investments, that was kind of spread over 2016 and 2017. And I think a number, my best guess at this point would be another number in the $0.5 billion range next year. But that could change and we'll give specific guidance as we get closer. In terms of it being an indefinite thing, I wouldn't think of it as into infinity that we would buy more than the free cash flow.","Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. And I just wanted to come back to Europe really quickly. I heard you that the Lab side of the business was better there, which was the same trend as you're seeing in North America. But I guess....","William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President","Hey, Tim, we struggle to hear the topic there. Could you repeat? Sorry.","Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Oh, Europe, I wanted to focus on Europe. I hear you that the Lab side of the business is doing better than the Industrial. Can you offer any more color there as to just how tough the industrial market is in Europe right now and how much visibility you have to the back of the year in the Industrial piece of the business specifically?","Olivier A. Filliol - President and Chief Executive Officer","I wouldn't read too much into the first quarter. As we also mentioned before, there is a little bit of an Easter impact and so on. And when I look at the project pipeline, I don't think we are expecting a cool down for the Industrial business also. Of course, I do expect Lab to do better than Industrial, but that's not a particular timing aspect of it. It's more the whole environment that we have and the opportunities that we have. So I do actually expect that in the second part of the year, Industrial will actually look different than in the first quarter.","William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. Wanted to spend a minute on China. Appreciate your comments in the script, but hoping you could put a little more color as to the reasons why you're maybe a little bit more optimistic for the balance of the year than you were maybe three months or four months ago when obviously the outlook was a little tougher? If you could maybe highlight a couple fundamental items that you're seeing in the marketplace that are giving you confidence, that would be great.","William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President","Hey. I guess one obvious element, Isaac, is the fact that we have Q1 under our belt and a pretty decent forecast for Q2, so we have half of the year. We'll probably finish the first half of the year with mid-single digit growth and we had predicted for the full year previously a low-single digit decline. So some of it's just the math piece.","The second is, I would comment on the fact that it wasn't that long ago that we were talking to you about we had last year in our China Core Industrial business, we had 20% decline for the full year last year and it varied between minus 17% and minus 23%. And while I'm not sure we're going to get growth in Core Industrial for the full year in China, it's pretty clear to me it won't be that kind of number. And just now that we're this far into the year, we feel a little bit better than that.","In terms of what we see in terms of activity with customers, Olivier commented on some the progress we're making, particularly in the life science area. So we do see money getting awarded there. We see ourselves getting a good share without any kind of government preference things that might hurt people in certain industries. So, overall, mostly good news about China relative to where we were three months ago.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, that's really helpful color. Thank you. Follow-up, Bill, for you on pricing. I think there has been a bit of a run-up year-to-date in steel prices. So from the commodity standpoint, I'm curious how that factors into your plans to drive price. And maybe actually it's part of that, from a cost of goods standpoint, I know that the run-up has been relatively recent and relatively quick. Is that a factor that goes into gross margin for the year?","William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President","So the area that you would see that impact us the most, Isaac, would be in our vehicle business because of the decks. And the way we do pricing in that market is we are quoting based on current market prices for steel. So we would push that price increase through with a little bit of margin. And so while it might look cosmetically like a little bit more price realization, on the gross margin there wouldn't be too big of an impact of that.","In terms of the other pieces of our business, we do buy some fabrications and, of course, we buy a lot of machine parts. But those costs are mostly locked down in terms of annualized pricing, but certainly something we need to think about next year. And let's see how these commodity prices hold out and whether that might provide some opportunity because of what it does to Producer Price Indexes for us to try to do a little bit more pricing in the second half. But I think at this stage, it's probably \u2013 we have nothing definitive.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Fair enough. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America.","Unknown Speaker","It's actually Mike Resk in (34:44) for Derek. I had a couple questions for you. First, you gave some commentary on the Consumables and Services in the quarter. Could you just follow-up with what you saw in terms of Instruments or how that was trending?","William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President","Okay. So in terms of our \u2013 we grew 4%. The Service business grew a little faster than the Product business. And I think our Consumable, because I don't have it in front of me, but Rainin did well, so I just have to assume that our Consumable business, because that's the biggest piece, must have been done at least as well as the rest of the Service business. And then, of course, the Product Inspection business in particular had good Service growth, I would say, among the different divisions.","Unknown Speaker","All right. Thank you for that. And what about operating leverage as your organic growth is improving? With all the restructuring and cost-cutting initiatives, what does it look like in terms of what operating leverage you get as your organic is expanding?","William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President","So I think on a currency-neutral basis, we're looking at contribution margins in the mid-30%s. So for every incremental $1 of sales, we should be able to do something in the mid-30%s. And historically that's a pretty good number off this base of 4% growth for the full year. So not quite that mid-single digit because each extra $1 of sales growth usually has some more. And then I would comment that we're making pretty significant investments in the Field Turbo program that we're still delivering these type of incremental margins despite those investments.","Unknown Speaker","All right. Thank you. And one last point real quick. You mentioned that you remain a little cautious on the global economy. There's some macro uncertainty. But at the same time you've talked a little bit about how China grew 6% in Q1, you saw a strong April so you expect mid-single digits at least through the first half. So what indicators are you looking for until you're able to revise your macro outlook? Are you looking for a longer duration, or is there something else that you're waiting to see an uptick in?","William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President","I think it's really tough to point to one single factor. There's a lot of different data points we get from the market. What are we seeing in terms of our direct business, what are we seeing in terms of the economic data that you guys look at? And it would be really hard to pin it on one or two specific things.","We're always looking at capacity utilization in China, we're looking at how they're doing from an export perspective. Maybe one of the new factors that's come out recently is the new Five-Year Plan probably since the last time we talked, and that certainly was more of the same at least as it related to our piece of the business. So I think just the passage of time and continued positive results there would be one of the factors we'd look to the most.","Let's be honest, we have very much a short-cycle business, including in China, even if China's maybe slightly longer cycle than the rest of the world. But it's tough for us to be the \u2013 maybe the guy to make the first call.","Unknown Speaker","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. Just a couple of quick clarifications. First, on selling days, there was a comment in the prepared remarks around Easter. I wonder if you've thought much about what the impact might have been in basis points, and was that isolated to Europe and were there any other selling day anomalies that you might spike out here?","William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President","So if we look overall for the entire business, we felt reasonably good about that it was flattish for selling days. I think the comment related more to geographically the impact in Europe and that the Easter holidays tend to lead to our sales force as well as customers just being out of the office for that week. And it moving between March and April had a little bit of impact in terms of European sales and a little bit of impact in terms of cash flow collections.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then in the prepared remarks, Bill, I want to say that I caught a comment that suggested that in total there's not much change to the way you're thinking about overall margin expansion for the year, but you seem to think that the operating margin expansion might be a little bit more concentrated in terms of the rate of operating expense spend as opposed to gross margins. Am I interpreting that correctly? And can you give us a sense for what some of the underlying moving parts there? Thanks.","William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President","Sure. And I'm looking at Mary, too, to make sure I quote some of the numbers right. But I think I understand your source. So the first comment is, hey, gross margin came in a little less than our model, probably a little bit less than some of your guys' models in Q1. If we look at now the remaining three quarters of the year, our best estimate at this point would be on a currency-neutral basis or actually I think there's maybe only 10 basis points anyway difference between actual and constant currency, but look at something like 50 basis points on average in the remaining three quarters of the year. It could be a little bit better than that, but something in that range.","That, of course, is a good number and so we're happy with that number, but I think it compares a little bit. And if you look at what that means in terms of our full-year model, it means maybe a little bit less gross profit margin for the full year than most people were expecting. So that's maybe a slight negative. A slight positive is that we took the midpoint of our sales guidance up by 50 basis points.","The next item is that you could see in our operating expenses that our various cost savings, cost reengineering initiatives, continue to go well. Our operating expenses, as we view it internally, were only up about 1% in the quarter despite having I think 250 more field personnel between sales and service than we had in Q1 a year ago. So we feel good about that. And partly because we're happy with how the Field Turbo program is going, Olivier mentioned that we're starting to approve already a few more Field Turbos that'll start to add a little bit of operating expense growth more than we had in the original model in the second half of the year.","And then the final minor thing is that the share price has performed well recently. And that, for most of you guys, will probably have some impact on us spending $0.5 billion on share repurchases. We'll get a few less shares purchased because of that. That impact for us, at least in our model, was about $0.06.","And, of course, one of the bigger impacts, Steve, is that if you look at where currencies are as of yesterday I guess as compared to what we told you in February and you looked at that over the last three quarters of the year \u2013 I say the last three quarters because, of course, the first quarter is already behind us, we estimated about $0.15 per share impact as the delta between those two. And of course, that's a positive delta. So taking all those things together, that's how we got to this $0.10 per share movement in terms of the midpoint of our guidance.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","As always, incredibly helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Groberg with UBS.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Bill, so just to clarify, in the first quarter \u2013 you just answered the question that gross margin was maybe a little less than you were expecting. And can you maybe just say what surprised you in the quarter? Was it mix or was it something else? Did you not get as much price as you maybe thought you were going to?","And then, Olivier, in the U.S., everyone is kind of ignoring the U.S., how strong it's been growing, all these companies. What drove the strength for you? Was it mainly from an end market or a customer standpoint? Was it mainly pharma, or was it broad-based? Thanks.","William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President","Do you want to go first, Olivier? Okay, so in terms of your question on gross profit margin, so maybe I'd give the overall picture. So the overall picture, 180 basis points price realization, that translates to about plus 80 bps on gross margin. Material costs were down 120 bps, that translates to 20 bps in terms of year-on-year movement in gross profit margin.","Then the rest is kind of equally split between a mix topic, a series of little mix things kind of adding up. So maybe some of the highlights ones were a little less sales in terms of the overall composition, a little less European direct sales and a little less Southeast Asian sales. And those are two highly profitable markets. And if I look at within the Lab product categories, titration, for example, is one of our highest gross margin products that some of their sales moved a little bit into the latter part of the year due to some new product introductions.","And then the Service was the other half of the negative. And in Service, Olivier talked about it earlier, we really see Service as an important part of our growth in terms of profit going forward. But also it's just one of the great competitive barriers and advantages that we want to build on and we invested a little bit more in Service technicians. It usually takes service technicians, depends on product category, but two quarters to four quarters to be breakeven. And we added a few more in a couple very targeted areas that are going to help us. And they very much fit in with how we made some of our Field Turbo investments and very much support those.","Olivier A. Filliol - President and Chief Executive Officer","On Americas, so Q1 we had actually a good quarter. We were up 6%. Particularly actually was happy about the performance in Lab, Product Inspection, and Retail. Core Industrials was slightly down, but against a strong comparison in the prior year. So all-in-all, the growth was in line with our expectations and our outlook continues to be generally positive. But I would acknowledge that we start to have a strong comparison in the second part of the year.","And biopharma. When I think about the particular strong end-user markets, it was certainly biopharma. I saw that, for example, very nicely in our results from our Pipette business and Automated Chemistry that are strongly exposed to that market and did extremely well.","And I did mention that Product Inspection did well. That's certainly also because the whole food safety topic is an ongoing hot topic and we see our customer base having a high investment rate on that front. So, all-in-all, actually good and I definitely expect it growing \u2013 continuing to do well, but higher comparisons will also start to kick in.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","All right.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yes, good afternoon.","William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President","Hi, Rick.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hello. Bill, could you just talk, in terms of Europe, I think you explained maybe why that came in flattish here in the first quarter. But you did kind of reference some puts and takes to the 4% core growth rate and you did mention maybe Europe comes in a little bit softer than you thought for the full year. Did I miss which piece of the business in Europe do you expect maybe for the full year to come in a little bit softer? Is that the Core Industrial or Retail?","William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President","Core Industrial. Product Inspection \u2013 actually, Product Inspection in Europe is going to have a tough comp in Q2, but the business overall does well. On a normalized basis, it does well.","We also have tough comps in Retail. And that's one we've been talking about since I think when we gave our original guidance in November that we're not going to have a particularly good year in Retail. We had some large orders I think in the Netherlands and Germany a year ago. But the Lab business looks solid in Europe. And overall our forecast would say we'll do better in Q2 than we did in Q1.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I see. Okay. And then in China, did the Core Industrial business, I mean, it has such weak comps throughout this year. Did the Core Industrial business grow, though, in China in the first quarter?","William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President","It did. It had some bigger orders coming through and that's a little bit I'm unclear if \u2013 some of our hesitancy is we're going to keep getting those, or is that part of it? Rick, I think I remember talking I think even specifically to you a year ago when we were putting up the minus 17%s and minus 20%s in Core Industrial in China. There just was no big projects. And we got a couple of big projects in the backlog, some delivered in Q1, a few more coming in Q2. And we need to see a little bit more of that before it's easy for us to say, okay, now there's a more solid base there.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I see. Okay. Sorry if I missed it, but did you give the number of shares repurchased in Q1?","William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President","390,337.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.

I'm the Treasurer and I'm responsible for Investor Relations at Mettler-Toledo. Happy that you're joining us tonight. I'm joined by Olivier Filliol, our CEO, and Bill Donnelly, our Executive Vice President. I need to cover just a couple of administrative matters. The call is being webcast and is available on our website. Copy of the press release and the presentation is also available on our website.","On page two, we have the safe harbor language.

Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Thank you, Mary, and welcome to everyone on the call. I will start with a summary of the quarter and then Bill will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments before we open the lines for Q&A.","The highlights for the quarter are on page three of the presentation. We had a strong end to the year, reflecting solid market conditions and good execution. Local currency sales growth was 8% in the quarter, better than expected with very good results in Europe and Asia \/ Rest of the World. Americas came in pretty much as expected. We are very pleased with these results and the performance of our teams around the world.","Continued strong margin expansion led to very good growth in EPS in the fourth quarter. As a result of the strong finish, we achieved a 7% local currency sales growth and a 15% EPS growth for the full year. We are very happy with this performance as well our outlook for 2017.","Let me now hand over to Bill to cover the financials.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Thanks, Olivier, and hello, everyone.","Sales were $709.7 million in the quarter, and that's an increase of 8% in local currency. The Troemner acquisition contributed approximately 1% to local currency sales growth in the quarter, and on a dollar basis, our sales increased by 5% as currencies reduced sales by 3% in the quarter.","One slide number four, we show local currency sales growth for the quarter. You can see here that sales grew by 7% in Europe, 15% in Asia \/ Rest of World and 3% in the Americas. The Americas growth, excluding Troemner, was flat with the prior year. As Olivier mentioned, this is pretty much on track with what we expected and was impacted by strong results last year. You guys often ask us about budget flush. I would say that for us, it was a little less than last year, largely related to what we saw with U.S. biopharma.","On the next slide, we provide local currency sales growth for the full year 2016, which was 7%. By region, Europe and the Americas each grew by 5%, while Asia \/ Rest of World increased 10% for the full year. On slide number six we outline sales growth by product line for the quarter. Laboratory had good growth with local currency sales growth of 8%, of which approximately 2% was from Troemner. Our Industrial business increased by 7% and Food Retailing also increased by 7%. All these comparisons are versus the prior year.","The next slide summarizes full year results. Our Lab business had local currency sales growth of 8%. Industrial increased by 5%, while Food Retailing increased by 6%.","Now I'd like to turn to slide number eight, and let me walk you through the key P&L items for the quarter. Our gross margins were a record 59%, 100 basis points improvement over the prior year amount of 58%. Pricing, material costs decreases and currencies contributed to the increase, which was offset in part by additional targeted investments, particularly in our Service business. R&D amounted to $30.2 million, which represents a 1% decline in local currency, driven by the timing of new product launches.","Our SG&A was $188.2 million. That's an increase of 8% in local currency. Variable comp and investments in our Field Turbo contributed to the increase. Adjusted operating income was $200.2 million in the quarter, and that's an increase of 10% over the prior-year amount of $182.2 million. Currency reduced operating profit by $1.2 million in the quarter. We had expected currencies to be neutral the last time we spoke. Adjusted operating margins were 28.2%, a 110 basis point increase over the prior year.","A couple of final comments on the P&L; our amortization amounted to $9.9 million in the quarter, while our interest expense was $7.4 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate was 24%. Fully diluted shares for the quarter were 26.6 million, and that's a 4% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program.","Adjusted earnings per share was $5.28 per share. That's a 14% increase over the prior year amount of $4.65 per share. Currencies reduced EPS growth by approximately 1%. On a reported basis, our earnings per share was $5.17 per share. That compares to $4.44 per share in the prior year. Reported EPS includes $0.05 of restructuring expenses and $0.06 of purchased intangible amortization.","The next slide shows the year-to-date P&L. We had local currency sales growth of 7%, while our operating income increased by 10% and our adjusted earnings per share by 15%. As Olivier mentioned, we're very pleased with these results, and they reflect solid market conditions and strong execution.","Now turning to cash flow, in the quarter free cash flow was $82.9 million, and that compares to $126.4 million in the prior year. Cash flow in the quarter was impacted by our $37 million purchase of our previously leased pipette manufacturing facility in California. Absent this purchase, our full year cash flow amounted to $384 million. And that's on target with what we discussed with you last quarter. We remain pleased with our working capital management and achieved further improvements in DSO, which was reduced by one day to 37 days as compared to the prior year, while our ITO was 4.6, which was consistent with last quarter.","As a reminder, we have some facility expansions underway, which increased our CapEx in 2016 and will also impact 2017. Excluding the pipette facility acquisition and these facility expansions that I just referred to, our free cash flow per share grew by 15% over the prior year.","Now let's turn to our guidance. We're coming off a very strong finish to the year, and our outlook for the first quarter is also strong. We believe we're executing very well, and the foundation is built on a robust product pipeline, our innovative Spinnaker sales and marketing programs, the investments we've made in Field Turbos, and they're all paying dividends. These factors are within our control, and we feel confident about capitalizing on them. However, we remain cautious on the global economy, as we see continued uncertainties, for example in the Chinese end markets, industrial end markets, some questions on Europe, and in general, we face tougher comps, particularly in the second half of the year.","That provides you with some of the background on our assumptions. Now let me cover the specifics, as we see some moving pieces this quarter. First, taking into account the strong finish to the year, and with the assumption that market conditions remain stable, we're increasing our organic, local currency sales growth assumption for 2017 from 4.5% to 5%. We expect local currency sales growth to approximate 5.5%, as Troemner should contribute about 50 basis points to our growth in 2017.","Second, we will implement the new accounting standard associated with the tax impact of stock option deductions. While we're still finalizing our calculation, our current estimate is that this will lower our effective tax rate for the full year from 24% to 22%, but there will also be an increase in fully diluted shares. The option exercises are steady and somewhat predictable on an annual basis, but there will be variability by quarter.","When we report our quarterly numbers for 2017, we will reflect a 22% effective tax rate in reporting our quarterly adjusted earnings per share. We think this will be easier for you to understand. The actual tax rate on a quarterly basis will vary depending on actual exercise, but we expect to be at 22% by the end of the year. We believe this will make comparisons against the prior year and guidance easier for everyone. As always, we will include a reconciliation in our quarterly press release so it'll be transparent for you.","Overall, we expect the impact of the new accounting standard will add approximately $0.31 to earnings per share. This reflects the reduction in the tax rate to 22%, which is offset somewhat by a higher share count as the tax benefit of option exercise is no longer reflected as a reduction to dilution. While the tax accounting is a nice benefit to earnings, it is somewhat offset by currency. The strengthening of the dollar since November has created a greater headwind than we provided in our initial guidance in November. Rates as of November would have reduced 2017 earnings versus 2016 by about 1% while current rates would be a headwind of approximately 2% versus 2016 actuals.","Okay. Taking all these things together, we now expect adjusted EPS in 2017 to be in the range of $16.55 per share to $16.75 per share. That's a growth rate of 12% to 13%. As mentioned already, we expect currency to reduce earnings growth by 2% in 2017 with a greater impact in the second, third and fourth quarters.","Now turning to quarterly guidance, we have a few factors impacting the first quarter. First, we're coming off a strong finish to the year. Second, we'll have our easiest comparison in the first quarter. And third, we expect a benefit in terms of the timing of the Easter holidays. If you'll remember, they were in Q1 last year, but they'll be in Q2 this year, and this impacts mostly our European business.","Taking all these factors together, we expect local currency sales growth in Q1 to be approximately 8%, and this would include a 1% contribution from Troemner. This will result in adjusted earnings per share of $3.05 to $3.10 per share, something in that range, and that's approximately a growth rate of 24% to 26%. We expect currency to reduce EPS growth in the first quarter by about 1%.","As we typically do, we'll provide updated quarterly guidance on future calls. As you update your models, please keep in mind the tougher comparisons in the second half of the year. We've reviewed current quarterly consensus estimates for Q2 through Q4, and we believe that low-double-digit EPS growth in Q2 and Q4 are realistic, while probably a high-single-digit EPS growth in Q3 is our best estimate at this point in time. We thought you would find that information helpful. One additional comment, the impact of currency on sales growth, we expect currencies to reduce sales by about 2.5% in Q1 of 2017 and also for the full year.","Finally, in terms of cash flow this year, as we communicated last quarter, we expect free cash flow to be in the $390 million range this year. Our CapEx will be at a higher level in 2017 due to certain facility expansions related to our Product Inspection businesses, as well as the facility consolidation we're doing in Switzerland. These expansions will amount to approximately $55 million in 2017. Excluding these projects from both 2016 and 2017, this would give us a 15% growth in free cash flow per share. Okay. As a reminder, we will continue to assume we'll repurchase about $500 million worth of shares in 2017, and that's it from my side.","And I'd like to turn it back to Olivier.","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Thank you, Bill. Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. The Lab had very good growth in the quarter. All product lines performed well. We continue to benefit from our strong product pipeline, Field Turbo investments and innovative sales and marketing programs. Spending by our biopharma customers continues to be solid, but we acknowledge we will face tougher comparisons in 2017.","Industrial had good growth in the quarter. As expected, Product Inspection had very good growth in quarter. The market dynamics for this business are favorable, and we have a unique competitive position that allows us to capitalize on the growth potential of this market. We expect to start the year with another good quarter in Product Inspection.","Core Industrial did better than we expected, with growth in low single-digits, driven by strong growth in Asia, including China. Finally, Retail increased 7% in the quarter. This was better than expected and was driven by strong results in Europe and Asia.","Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales growth in Europe was strong, driven by Product Inspection and Retail. Lab also had growth, while Core Industrial was down. Sales growth in the Americas came in pretty much as expected. Lab had growth in most product lines, with the exception of AutoChem, which had very strong comparisons from prior year. Product inspection had modest growth against a very strong quarter in the prior year. Core Industrial and Retail were down in the quarter.","Asia and Rest of the World grew double-digits in the quarter. All product lines had very good growth. China did better than expected with 15% growth in the quarter. Lab in China continued to do very well, and we were very pleased to see strong growth in Industrial in the quarter. One final comment on the business, Service grew 6% in the quarter.","With the strong finish to 2016, we are well positioned to start the new year. We remain cautious on the global economy, and we'll continue to monitor it for risks that could impact customer spending plans. In the meantime, we are focused on those factors within our control and feel confident about them.","Our investments in Field Turbos, Spinnaker sales and marketing programs and new products are yielding tangible results, and we believe we continue to drive share gains. Furthermore, our initiatives surrounding Big Data Analytics for sales growth are doing very well and contributing to share gains. We have made great progress in developing Big Data tools, such as sales project alerts and iBase analytics, and I see Big Data analytics developing into a unique competitive advantage.","In addition to continued share gains, the other part of our strategy is our focus on productivity, which is a core part of our culture and is fundamental to our story. It is these gains in productivity and efficiency which provide resources to fund our growth initiatives. Let me give you a couple of examples. We are launching a new program to improve the productivity and efficiency in our producing organizations and supply chains.","We refer to this program as Stern Drive, which is a form of marine propulsion, which combines inboard power with outboard drive. Stern Drive focuses on operations and the three pillars for its foundation, material cost reductions, shop floor productivity and back office productivity. Our initial priorities are to further challenge material costs as well as variable manufacturing and fixed labor costs.","This program is just getting underway and will complement our Spinnaker and Blue Ocean programs. Similar to those programs, I think we will be talking to you about Stern Drive for many years to come. We have achieved great results over many years in increasing the efficiency of our supply chain and manufacturing operations, but with this program we intend to build on those successes and move to another, higher level of performance.","We have a variety of productivity measures around the company, including a number which leverage our Blue Ocean platform. The platform has allowed us to develop global and regional shared service centers for a variety of activities, which help us better leverage scale and technology. Blue Ocean has also enabled us to enhance our e-commerce capabilities. We are improving transaction efficiency via integrated end-to-end processing across a variety of different channels and their specific needs.","These are just some examples of various productivity and efficiency initiatives we have in place throughout the organization. This productivity focus is part of our DNA and reflects our culture of continuous improvement, which is at the core of all we do.","That concludes our prepared remarks. In summary, we believe that if market conditions remain stable, we are well positioned for sales and earnings growth in 2017 and beyond. We will remain focused on execution of our core strategies, which remain central to our success.","I want to now ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Steven Reiman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. This is Steve Reiman on for Tycho. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to start off, regarding 2017 guidance, can you talk through what your current growth assumptions are by product area? And then are you expecting to see any meaningful pickup in core industrial, because you mentioned it came in a little bit better than expected?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Okay. So maybe I start with how we see things for the lab business. So our lab business should be able to, including with Troemner grow mid-single-digits, a little bit better. And we'll get a similar growth rate from industrial, but with the mix coming, PI actually growing faster than lab, our product inspection business and we expect a little less growth in our industrial business. And then we would expect low single-digit kind of growth coming from our food retailing business.","Steven Reiman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. And then just in terms of pricing, is 150 bps still the right way to think about it for 2017?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","I think so. I think we'll know a little bit more in the quarter. We're taking a close look at some of these currency moves. They were a little stronger a while back. There are some parts of the world that maybe we need to go looking at that. I think that's probably an evaluation point for the next couple of months to see if we should push, but that would be largely aimed at maybe trying to offset any more foreign exchange that comes.","Steven Reiman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. That's all for me. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Evans from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. One quick clarification first. The comment that you made early on about the biopharma budget flush, did you \u2013 were you saying that there was less budget flush this year than last year?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","I think with regard to our stuff, and the way we say it, so if you think about our \u2013 the comment was specific to U.S. You can see our European numbers were a little bit better. And if we look at our two businesses that have the biggest exposure, they were AutoChem, which had a tough comp, but still their sales were down in North America in the fourth quarter.","And in our pipette business, it was the lowest growth rate of the year, still a healthy number, but it was the lowest growth rate of the year that we had. And we think actually both of those guys are going to do a little bit better growth rate in the first quarter, but for AutoChem, the fourth quarter is a more important quarter than the first one.","Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then if you think about the upside surprise relative to your core revenue growth, would you attribute that more to the macro picture? Or do you think that would be more attributable to company-specific things like share gains?","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","I think actually we really executed very well. Our programs materialized well, but we also enjoyed good market environment. We were talking about retail surprised us in Europe. We did execute well, but there was also the markets, how projects came together that we benefited from. So it's a combination. But I certainly also feel that all these growth programs really have good momentum. And that's also why we remain optimistic also in Q1.","Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Derik De Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good afternoon.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Hi, Derik.","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Hi.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, there's a lot of moving parts in terms of the global economy, and obviously, there's a lot of proposed tax changes in Washington going on. Bill, can you just sort of give us a thought on what you're looking at in terms of what's been currently proposed? And how Mettler fits in, given your global infrastructure and everything? Do you have any sort of initial thoughts on what this can mean for the business?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Okay. So we evaluate it a lot, and I would maybe start with we, for example, reviewed some of it with our board today. And one of the things that we highlighted to them was that from \u2013 there's a lot of uncertainty on what might happen and when. I think that the repatriation topic is certainly one that most people think could come because there could be broad consensus with that. That's not a big deal for us in terms of being a benefit. We maybe even would have some one-time taxes to pay there, but if I think about topics like a lower tax rate overall, that can't hurt us. But the U.S. isn't the biggest source of our tax earnings \u2013 or our pre-tax income.","And if I go to topics like border adjustability, which I think generally most people think that would be hard to get through in the short-term, I think that our initial reaction would be, hey, we're a net importer overall. So we would have to do some adjustments in areas like pricing or supply chain strategies. I think that we're a company that understands that we would need to do some things, and we would be able to execute on it. But at this point, it seems so premature from our perspective, Derik, that we're not getting ourselves tied in a knot thinking about that.","I would also highlight that, and you would recognize this from when we talked in the past about when biopharma, for example, or other companies move their facilities, our instruments don't move very good. And so if there was other \u2013 if there were companies bringing things back to the United States, that would create demand beyond our normal share of the replacement market. It would create new demand, and we would win disproportionately to what we would lose in the markets because of the nature of our product categories.","So there could be a positive in that side on an indirect basis. But I think in that area, it's pretty premature at this time to say much more.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And as the growth starts to pick up on the industrial business, do you need to add any incremental sales costs to it, to basically drive the \u2013 any sales support or salesforce behind it? Any cost back to the business?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","I think, Derik, whether the growth comes from industrial or lab, I would say our incremental margins would not be materially different. Maybe they're slightly better on the lab side because of higher gross profit overall, but we do have slightly higher selling costs in the lab side of the business. So I think you could assume in a constant currency environment every extra 1% of sales growth has got to drop something north of $0.30 on a dollar to the bottom line, hopefully a little bit more.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Ross Muken, your line is open.","Matthew John Nicolai - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Yes. Hi. This is Matt Nicolai on for Ross. Thanks for taking the question. Just had a question about your assumptions for 2017 guidance. Just asking if you could provide a little color on the pacing of growth in the U.S. in early January after a mixed fourth quarter?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Hey, I \u2013 if we look at our outlook for Q1 in the Americas, it'll be solid. Better growth rate on a single-year basis than what we saw in the third quarter, to maybe be slightly more specific.","Matthew John Nicolai - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then also was wondering if you could give some color on emerging market demand, excluding China, and whether FX settling down a bit is helping demand?","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","So overall, very pleased about how all Asia did. Also, outside of China we had, for example, Southeast Asia that did very well. We had India that continues, actually to do well. I'm very happy about that performance. I expect that momentum will stay on, and at this stage I don't expect that currency has a significant impact. Of course, if currency would move even more so, it can, but at this stage we see good momentum in the market. And as I did talk in previous calls, we have made important investments also in certain parts of Asia like Philippines, Indonesia and so on, and we see the paybacks on that. So happy about how they are doing.","Matthew John Nicolai - Evercore Group LLC","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Leonard from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Just trying to reconcile some of the moving parts in the guidance. So the $0.50 EPS guide uptick at the mid-point, you said $0.31 of that is the stock comp, offset by how much in foreign currency?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","$0.21, I think.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So something in the $0.20s, so most of the uptick is organic. And, Bill, can you remind me how much EBIT margin expansion you're assuming year-over-year in your 2017 guide?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","So let me answer that in a couple of different ways. So our \u2013 sorry, getting the right columns here in front of me. So on a full year basis, our margins will expand about 100 basis points, on a constant currency basis. Not too much different.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And it does seem, my final question; it does seem like you were trying to hold back a little bit in the guidance from I don't know if exuberance is the right word, but you had a good fourth quarter. If you were to be surprised on the upside in 2017, where do you think the big piece of variability is going to come from market-wise? Or product line-wise?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","I would start with we're always \u2013 Olivier has been pushing a lot of investments on sales and marketing topics and some of the investments in Field Turbos. And I think that there could be upside to that. I think that it's clearly providing some upside right now. And because of, as Olivier mentioned this call and on others, is the product categories such as lab and product inspection, process analytics benefit disproportionately from those investments, as well as certain geographies. And he just mentioned a little while ago Southeast Asia to name one. If I look in even places like Eastern Europe, which was a little bit of a struggle for us when Russia was having its struggles, bounced back for decent growth recently.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. Want to spend a minute on emerging markets, specifically if you could just kind of compare and contrast what you're seeing in South America versus China? I know you have a much bigger business in China, but we don't have a lot of visibility, I think in the last couple of weeks here, in terms of other companies in the space talking about how the year closed out between emerging markets versus \u2013 I mean in China versus South America. I'd appreciate any comparisons you could make.","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Two very different situations in the sense that China, the microenvironment and the macro trends are very favorable for us. We have seen, for example, labs doing very well for us now many quarters. In Q4 we have seen that the industrial business started to pick up also for us in China. Still against easier comparisons, but we see some momentum coming back. So all in all, actually we feel good about it.","When I look at South America, particular actually Brazil, it's still challenging. Brazil, I don't see that the market is really sustainably recovering and in essence, I feel we still are going to have challenges there and I don't see a strong rebound in Brazil coming. At China, it seems to be a more steady opportunity to build. And again, I want to specify that we had different product categories in China that continue to do very well across many quarters. We did not have that situation in Brazil, for example.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. And then I know it's small, but the retail business, if I look at the full year performance there, it was a pretty solid year, above trend if we go back several years. To what extent do you think that's market share and can you talk about the plan this year to try and repeat that performance?","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Absolutely. We are very happy about how retail performed last year, particular Q4 performed better than expected. There were some effects that will not repeat themselves. We had, for example, a change in legislation in Germany that required different labels for customers and that drove some upgrade business that was beneficial and will not repeat. But overall, if I look at the full year, retail did well, and particular also profitability.","You might recall in a couple of years ago, we said retail it's not about growth, it's about profitability. I have seen very steady progress over the last years and last year in particular was another big step. In the meantime, retail has reasonable profitability for us and I do expect that they will have a reasonable year this year. But I want also to specify, retail is a lumpy business, has big projects and so predicting it is more difficult and that's maybe also reflected in our Q4 numbers. We did expect things differently and then somewhat project did materialize. So, of course, that could turn out the other way around this year.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks so much, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Arias from Citibank. Your line is open.","Bryan A. Kipp - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, guys. This is actually Bryan Kipp on behalf of Dan. Just wanted to get some color on the pipette transaction. You guys showed that facility middle of last year and talked about the robotics investments that you guys were doing. In light of the purchase of the facility, does that change anything? Are you guys able to pull forward some investments, expand faster? Just want to get some color there.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","It was \u2013 we \u2013 the property has a bit of a history. It was actually owned by Ken Rainin, the person we bought the business from and we kind of had a right of first refusal in perpetuity. And we felt that there was a unique bargain in the market, based on the company was selling a broader portfolio of assets and valuation-wise we felt like our right of first refusal gave us a good price. And so it was to give you a feeling, the only, at least of significance, I think the only manufacturing facility we had globally that was not owned, again because the history with Ken. And so we saw that it was a good value and we decided to buy it.","Bryan A. Kipp - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Helpful. And then on China. I was just surprised by the strength in 4Q, yet your tepid view going into 2017. Can you talk through the backlog or give us some color on in core industrial in China, where you're continuing to potentially see weakness despite the strong 4Q?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","So in terms of our industrial business in China, I think that you very much see this just the impact of comps getting easier and some of the really difficult markets related to infrastructure have just shrunk as a percentage of total sales for us. And so if you were to, I'm kind of oversimplifying now, if you were to bifurcate our performance the last couple years in China, you would say we had some good markets that were growing mid to high-single-digits and we had some bad markets that in many cases were down more than double-digits.","And so what's happened is the good markets have gotten to be, I don't know, probably I could almost say bigger than the bad markets in terms of our mix and that was different than 2012. And so we feel a little bit better positioned. I would highlight that it's also those are markets that even the good markets are sensitive to credit availability in that part of the world. We probably see more than any other market how when credit availability changes in China, it has a little faster impact on \u2013 it can be more volatile itself, availability, and it tends to have a pretty fast impact in the market.","So when you hear us sometimes talk cautiously about the future in China, it's probably less about our competitive position or what we think can happen long term for China, but more about some of these shorter-term topics.","Bryan A. Kipp - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi, good afternoon.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Rick.","Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Bill, just on the back of that last response to the core China strength, you did touch on credit there and the sensitivity of the core industrial in China to credit. But what's conclusion there? We're hearing the credit is actually tightening at this point in time, but how do you see that as we roll into 2017?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","We in our business don't see credit tightening. And I would say that for example, like there's, help me out, Mary, the notes that are there, what do they call those?","Mary T. Finnegan - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Bank notes.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","There's something called bank notes, and level of use \u2013 usually bank notes are one of the first steps when credit gets tight there, and it's very low. When, I think what you might be referring to a little bit, Rick, is the idea of getting cash out of China. And I think that's a fair statement. But at least to date, that's not tended to trigger changes in how our market activity goes.","Even for ourselves, I think we see it that we aren't changing things because they're a little tighter than they were two years ago. In fact, I would describe the credit tightening that people are talking about now for us, we see this environment as similar to what it was three or four years ago before they did some easing. So it's not, it's really a tightening versus some loosening they did two years ago. It's not much different than what we've had in China for a long period of time. So we could get the cash out of there.","Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I see. So but against the China industrial comps then as we roll into 2017, again, a high-single-digit growth, maybe even double-digit, with that credit background would be a decent assumption?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yes. I think we think a mid-single-digit number is realistic. And I would say that we do put a little bit of a discount factor. We probably internally our guys would think they can do better than that, but we think it's prudent to discount it for these things you hear me constantly bringing up, the risk around overcapacity and credit in China.","Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Sure. And is the product inspection business in China \u2013 where does that stand as a percentage of your China sales?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","More than 5%, less than 10%.","Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Oh, it is. Okay.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yes.","Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Okay. Then just one other question on the core industrial business, I noticed again the weakness here in the U.S., we saw the same thing in the third quarter. And I'm curious, the second half of 2016 for core industrial in the U.S. was pretty soft. Is there a message there? I mean it's maybe a little bit surprising, but how do you feel about that business? And maybe what are the dynamics there that have caused that business to have a negative number in front of it?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Okay. So, Mary, just to make sure I'm looking at the right...","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Let me, first of all, we also have different comparisons in this business. And there were some bigger project activities that impacted the numbers too. So I wouldn't read too much just into two quarters.","Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Okay. That's fine because I...","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Maybe I'd add too, Rick, and you know how we are sometimes. Even though it only looks like the comp was a plus 7%, the comp a plus 7% in Q4 2015, there was actually a plus 9% in Q4 2014. So on a kind of, a multi-year basis it was...","Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Kind of doing the triple stack there. Yeah. Okay. And then just a last question. Around the product inspection business, just maybe a couple quick questions. Is that business \u2013 what is the end market exposure there? I know we talk all the time about packaged foods, but I know you have some pharmaceutical exposure there. Are there any other end markets that are driving the business?","And then maybe the second question is around the service side of product inspection, is there still the growth opportunity in service? Or is that market fairly penetrated from a service, I guess, call it attachment rate?","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Let me start with service. Actually, great momentum that we have there. There is definitely further opportunities. Our customer base is more and more appreciating the value of service up-time, but also making sure that their instrument is really performing up to expectations. It's also about selling spare-part kits, service contracts and so on. So we have a lot of opportunities, we are proactively going after it. The product inspection service business is one of the faster growing service businesses that we have, including in the very mature markets like in U.S. where we have a great installed base. We are growing it very nicely.","To the first part of the questions, in terms of industry segments that we serve, you are right, we serve most of the pharma markets, we serve also the cosmetics market. We have some markets in the chemical, but food is the biggest piece and the food is the one that is particularly going well at this stage. It is really about protecting the brands, and we see many global accounts that are becoming very serious about rolling out standards across the globe, across multiple sites. So it's not just about going after individual sites; it becomes increasingly about upgrading or installing instruments across an account in a country, but sometimes even across whole regions.","Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I see. Okay. Thank you.","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon. Most of my questions have been answered, but a quick one, Bill. It looks like I think you said free cash flow guidance for the year is unchanged, about $390 million. For some particular reason, that's the case relative to the better, I guess, EPS outlook?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","So sorry, I just want to make sure I followed the question. So your question was, EPS guidance went up and but we didn't raise our...","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","The free cash flow was the same. Right.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","So one piece is that the tax one doesn't change taxes paid. There is some higher guidance number, but I think there's also a revision in our detailed CapEx assumption, slightly. So at this stage, too, Brandon, I acknowledge that the estimates on free cash flow and the timing there can be fluid.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Gotcha. Makes sense. And then could you give us the pricing contribution in the fourth quarter?","William P.

Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yes. Actually, integration continues to progress well from an employee standpoint, but as well as from a customer viewpoint, so happy about that. Our current focus is introducing our sales and marketing activities, initiatives and Spinnaker approaches. So we, for example, work on improving leads generation, bringing database marketing to them.

I will start with a summary of the quarter, and then Bill will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments before we open the lines for Q&A.","The highlights for the quarter are on Page 3 of the presentation. We had another quarter of excellent results, sales growth was very strong with great growth in Asia\/Rest of World including China as well as the America. Europe also had a solid quarter specially when adjusting for the Easter impact.","We are pleased with our ability to capitalize on our growth initiatives, we continue to expand margin and EPS growth in the quarter was excellent. We are very pleased with the second quarter and first half results. Our outlook for the remainder of the year is also very positive, although we will face more challenging comparisons. We continue to be optimistic that we can further our share gains and delivered strong performance in 2017.","Let me handle it over to Bill now to cover the financials.","William Donnelly","Hi, everybody. Sales were $653.7 million in the quarter as an increase of 10% in local currency. Excluding the impact of the Troemner acquisition our organic global currency sales growth was approximately 8.5% on an U.S. dollar basis sales increased by 7% as currency has reduced sales by 3% in the quarter.","On Slide 4, we show local currency sales growth by region, sales grew by 10% in Americas, 4% in Europe and 15% in Asia\/Rest of World. China sales growth was 22% in the quarter. growth in the Americas benefited by approximately 3% from the Troemner acquisition.","On the next slide we show year-to-date results, sales grew year-to-date by 12% in the Americas, 8% in Europe and 12% in Asia\/Rest of World. China sales growth was 17% in the first six months, for the first six months growth in the Americas benefited by 3% due to Troemner.","On Slide 6 we outlined sales growth by product line, laboratory sales grew by 9%, industrial sales increased by 12% and food retailing increased by 2%. Troemner benefited the lab growth by about 3%. All comparisons are in local currency and versus the prior year.","The next slide shows year-to-date growth by product lines. Laboratory sales grew by 11% industrial sales increased by 12% while food retailing increased by 5%. Similar to what we had in the quarter sorry, Troemner benefited lab growth by 3% for the first half. All comparisons are in local currency and versus the prior year.","Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 8, and let me walk you through the key items on our P&L. gross margins were at 57.4% and that\u2019s a 30 basis points improvement over the prior year on 57.1%. we had a little tougher comparison last year as we had a 160 basis point increase in gross margins during the second quarter of 2016.","We continue to benefit from pricing and also had productivity gains in the quarter, offsetting this was negative mix, material costs were down slightly as we obtained savings in certain material categories, but they are being largely offset by higher commodity prices. R&D amounted to $32.9 million that\u2019s a 10% increase in local currency, growth in R&D in the quarter was driven by increase investment in new product development.","SG&A was a $193.5 million that\u2019s an increase of 5% in local currency. Variable comp investments in Field Turbo programs as well as employee advantage cost contributed to that increase. Our adjusted operating income reached $148.5 million in the quarter and that\u2019s 15% increase over the prior year amount of $129.1 million.","Currency reduced operating profit by $2.6 million in the quarter or about a 2% impact to our growth rate. Adjusted operating margins were 22.7% and that\u2019s a 150 basis points increase over the prior year. A couple of final comments on the P&L, our amortization was $10.2 million in the quarter while our interest expense was $8.2 million in the quarter.","In terms of taxes, for purposes of adjusted EPS, we are reflecting our estimated annual effective tax rate of 0.2%. For the quarter, our actual tax rate was 20%, as a reminder the difference is due to the timing of stock option exercises and the impact of the new accounting policy that went into effect this year with respect to the excess tax benefit of these exercises. We remain comfortable with our estimated full-year tax rate of 22%, which is before non-recurring discrete tax items.","Moving now to diluted shares, fully diluted shares, they amounted to $26.4 million in the, which is 2.6% decline from the prior year reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program offset impart by higher shares outstanding due to the accounting change we just mentioned.","Adjusted earnings per share was $3.92 per share and that\u2019s a 22% increase over the prior year amount of $2.22 per share. On a reported basis, EPS was $3.84 per share as compared to $2.93 per share in the prior year, reported EPS includes $0.12 of restructuring in $0.06 of purchase intangible amortization. In addition as already mentioned, reported EPS includes $0.10 due to the lower reported tax rate.","On the next slide we show results for the first half of the year, which is excellent. We have a local currency sales growth of 11%, our operating income increased by 19% and our adjusted EPS increased by 28%. That\u2019s it for the P&L, and I would like to turn to cash flow.","In the quarter, free cash flow was $130.2 million and that compares to $108.9 million in the prior year. We remain pleased with our working capital management, DSO was 38 days similar to the prior year. ITO was also consistent with the prior year at 4.6 times. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $172.4 million as compared to $138 million in the prior year.","For the full-year, we now expect free cash flow to be in the $400 million range, on a per share basis excluding the large facility programs we previously discussed, this is a 15% increase over 2016. One additional comment, principally due to the timing of facility CapEx, we expect cash flow to be down in Q3 but will be up in Q4.","Now, let\u2019s turn to guidance. We have had an excellent results over the last four quarters achieving approximately 9% local currency sales growth and 21% earnings per share growth. We have benefitted from a relatively stable global economy and we executed our strategies effectively. Going forward, we believe we will continue to execute well, but also acknowledge that market conditions can change and comparisons -.","Looking to the second half of 2017, we see tougher comps than in the first half. In the back half of 2016, our local currency organic sales growth was approximately 7.5% as compared to 5% in the first half of 2016. Secondly, we expect our retail business to be down double-digits in the second quarter of 2017.","As we have discussed with you in the past our retail sales can be volatile due to the timing of projects that provide you some background on our assumption on when we cover the specifics. Assuming that market conditions remained stable, we are increased in our local currency, sales growth assumption for 2017 from 7% to 8%.","Based on the sales guidance range, we now expect adjusted EPS for the full-year to be in the range of $17.25 to $17.35 per share and that\u2019s a growth rate of 17%. This incorporates our Q2 B a higher sales growth assumptions as well as the impact of currency, which had improved. Offsetting these positives higher variable compensation for the back half of the year given our better than expected results for the full-year.","Now turning to Q3, we expect local currency sales growth to be approximately 5%, if you exclude retail, we would expect our growth to be in the 7% in Q3. This will give us an adjusted EPS of $4.25 to $4.30 per share and that\u2019s a growth of 9% to 11%. One final comment in terms of the impact of currency on sales growth, we expect currency to be neutral to sales in Q3, and reduce sales by about 50 basis points for the full-year.","Okay. That\u2019s it from my side. And I now want to turn it back to Olivier","Olivier Filliol","Thanks, Bill. Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab had good growth in the quarter particularly given very strong results in the prior year. We had a very good growth balances, analytical instruments and pipettes. New product launches, Field Turbo investments, and Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives are all contributing to growth inline. We expect to see continued good growth in line.","Industrial also had a very good growth in the quarter, product inspection had another great quarter of growth. I will provide some additional comments on this business shortly. Core industrial also did very well in the quarter driven by an excellent results in China. Finally, retail was up modestly in the quarter.","Now, let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales growth in Europe was good, especially [indiscernible] were impacting by timing of to Easter in Q2 and this year versus Q1 last year. Lab had grown against very strong results in the prior year, product inspection did very well, while core industrial was down slightly although up on a year-to-date basis.","In the Americas, lab did very well in most product lines, product inspection had another quarter of excellent growth, core industrial was down against very strong results in the prior year period. Retail was also down in the quarter. Asia\/Rest of the World grew double-digit in lab, industrial and retail as Bill already mentioned, China had excellent growth overall with lab, industrial and retail showing very good results.","We benefited in China into the quarter from completion of some industrial project activities. As we look to the second half of the year, we expect to have very good growth in China in Q3, plus we will face tougher comparison in the fourth quarter."," Before I call the products inspection, let me make some additional comments on services which have grown 7% in the first half. As a reminder, service represents almost 25% of total sales and is a unique competitive advantage for us as well as an important platform for revenue growth. We have service cost of approximately 2,700 personnel which is by far larger than any direct competitor and have invested significantly in training of tools to support the daily activity.","Core to our service growth strategy is increasing percentage of our install based of the service contract. We have talked about this objective in the past, and today we can reported that over the last four years, we have seen our service contract business grow by approximately 40% through these efforts.","We are emphasizing service contracts versus service in general, because we see the importance of moving our service business to be more contract base. We have much better plan on our technician when the work is contract base and we delete the value received by customers [indiscernible] when our work can be pre-planned and that drives healthy flight up time and prevented maintenance.","One of our core beliefs is at the quality of our service has been at least as important as the quality of our product in impacting the customer experience. It helps us maintain very high rate of customer retention and therefore reduces our selling cost in the loss term.","The intangible asset represented by our installed base of product is along with our CRM data the most valuable intangible that we have. We use as data collected on our installed base to promote the growth both our product and service business and to identify ways to bring value to customer.","Our service business and our installed base are critical important to our future. We expect to continue to grow our service contract business at higher rate as the corporate average. And with the high profitability of our service business, this would provide a very rise mid impact to profit.","Another strong performer has been our product inspection business, which had sales growth of 80% in the first six months. Let me provide a short update of this business, which represents slightly less than 20% of total sales or almost 45% of our industrial segment.","Product inspection is more weighted to the west and customers are principally food as well as pharmaceutical and consumer goods company. Our offline consists of checkweighing, metal detectors, X-rays, vision and sterilization solution to help ensure the integrity and quality of packaged items. We have the broader product offering in the markets and are clear market leader in every major region except Japan.","Our extensive service network is a very important competitive advantage for us. Manufacturing productivity and up time is critical to food and pharma companies. For global customers the tie and reach of service capabilities is a key consideration or no competitors comes close to matching our global reach.","We are generally recognized as leader in innovation, which we reinforced earlier in this year with the launch of our C-Series checkweighing. the C series is an truly global product platform covering the entire markets of simple to high complex applications on the production line.","All products are available worldwide and complying with global sound and regulations. Furthermore they are scalable with a flexible combination of mechanical and software option that can be tailored to individual customer requirement.","The series set standard for weighing technology and it\u2019s what we refer to as future proof, that is it has a modular design making it easy computer upgrades. While offering significant value to our customers the C series benefits us in terms of manufacturing, spare parts and service knowhow in the form of reduced complexity.","We have significantly reduced the number of product lines for more than 50 to 10 while at the same time filling products down to the markets and serving the full value per need with solution for both dry and wet environment.","This series has the same software, man machine is a based and communication capabilities across all product lines allowing for easy intuitive operation for our customers and more efficient production and supply chain requirements for us. [indiscernible] equipment design among the product lines, greatly reduces the number of spare parts.","Growth drivers for product inspection are attractive, principally driven by concerns product safety, plus brand protection and manufacturing productivity. We continue to see global food companies looking to standardize global leader product inspection instrument. Our global presence and service network provides us with a unique advantage here.","Finally as product inspection is heavily weighted to food and food follows population overtime, we believe that in the future emerging markets will provide various active growth opportunity for product inspection. Product inspection should grow above the company average of over the medium term, we are currently expanding our manufacturing facility to product inspection in both in U.S. and in UK. to accommodate this growth potential.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We are very pleased with our excellent results in the first half of the year. Our outlook for the remainder of the year is positive, although we will face more challenging comparison in the back half of the year. With continued good execution, we believe we can gain share and generate good sales and earnings growth.","I want to now ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Ross Muken","Good afternoon, guys. So, maybe as we think about the end markets for second and maybe geographies. Where are you seeing the biggest inflections where you are seeing growth kind of take off continue to sort of accelerate and even when you look at your order book or you are steering at third quarter. You sort of surprise that the trajectory or it\u2019s noticeably different than maybe a more smoother trend. And then is there anything where you have seen that happen and is leveled off or in general have you seen most of the markets kind of stay elevated that have sort of done that so far. Just trying to get a feel for maybe this slope some of these businesses that have been improving for you?","William Donnelly","So, interesting question, I think one of the reasons that I wanted to call out in our guidance for Q3, Ross is the impact of retail is that when you kind of look at a three year growth rate including retail and two year growth rate including retail you kind of see Q1, Q2, Q3 all kind of at the same level. But when you start to pull out the impact of retail actually, you see that there is just a modest little pick up.","And I\u2019m not sure this the impact of certain part of the global economy, I mean our general view is there is not too any [indiscernible] parts of the world right now. But I think it\u2019s the fact that we got a little bit more Field Turbo in there. And so we feel good about what we see globally, there is some markets like China that we would say hey, China is not going to say at that kind of rate and we will start to face much tougher comps later in the year.","But, overall we don\u2019t see a slowdown, we see this 5% as more a little bit \u201cartificial impact\u201d due to retail which is kind of lumpy and just as a reminder for everybody tends to be a little less profitable particularly in the contribution line than some of the business, and also in the quarter.","Ross Muken","And on the emerging market side, that\u2019s what I\u2019m more thinking about where you are seeing now this slope of recovery and obviously China as you mentioned was riding pretty hard. I mean is that consistent across sort of all the subgroups within there or some of the earlier cycle stuff looking at a different than mid or late cycle or some of the healthcare businesses. Just kind of steady stages. Give us a little bit of a picture in some of the emerging market pieces. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for maybe trajectories?","Olivier Filliol","So, we felt good about also the other emerging markets beside China, we have parts of Southeast Asia that have a strong quarter and even the Russia and Brazil also did quite well. You might recall on the last call we did also talk about India, we have in India mid single-digit growth against very good growth last year.","India is a little bit impacted by some new tax regulations, so maybe for the second part we\u2019re going to see a little bit of an impact. But overall, actually really good results across all the emerging markets and we stay confident that we are going continue to see good momentum there.","Ross Muken","Thank you, guys.","You next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Tycho Peterson","Hey, thanks. Just wondering if you can provide little more granularity on growth expectations by segment for the back half of the year. I know you kind of touched a little bit on that to Ross\u2019 question. But in particular on the lab market, I\u2019m wondering what your expectations are given the funding environment getting a little bit better?","William Donnelly","Yes, we had high single-digit growth in lab for the second half of the year. And the Product Inspection business should continue to do quite well although they had a very tough comps in the fourth quarter and our core industrial business should be in that mid single-digit. It\u2019s the retail business that\u2019s we are looking at probably a double-digit decline there in the second half.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then, Olivier On service, can you give us the sense as to how much of the services are under these broader Service contracts and how much of emphasis you are placing now is on emerging market service tax rates versus a more developed market?","Oliveri Filliol","Okay so the contract based business is about half of our total service business or close to half. And has obviously been growing much faster like the rest of the service, the other parts of the service would be then spare parts and break fix and that piece has not being growing that well in the past.","For New York region have seen declined and particularly reflection that the quality of our products becomes much better. And we have been successful to migrate customers to preventive maintenance that also helps to reduce the break fix aspect. So overall it\u2019s a very healthy change of mix, it\u2019s as I mentioned improved the customer satisfaction and it helps us to maintain a tight contact with the new customer base.","Now in terms of attachment rates of service contract, we still have a significant differences country-by-country that\u2019s a question maturity of our whole service development and it reflects also maturity of the country, obviously in the West we have a much bigger installed base than in the East.","We bring more and more good service programs also to the East in particular also to China where we have experience very nice growth rate and increasing it also in contract base and services. But in terms of - we are clearly huge towards the West when it comes to service contract business today.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then last one for Bill. Can you just give us that the margin component how much price and material cost, I know you said that moved around a little bit and what do you expect in the back half of the year for those two components?","William Donnelly","Okay. So the price were up 230 basis points in the quarter and that\u2019s 2010 year-to-date and so that contributed about 1%, then we had productivity gains including material component and labor component that was about 30 bps for the quarter, 60 bps year-to-date. And then the mix and let\u2019s call it other would be then the reconciling items.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Steve Beuchaw","Well thanks for bringing the midnight early in Switzerland first of all. I really appreciate it if you could spend a minute on Field Turbo, I very much appreciate Bill\u2019s comments that there is an increasing and I mean it\u2019s in a good way disconnect between growth and the underlying markets, because the Field Turbo. Now that you have a few years experience, I mean how do you think about the sustainability that the growth rate of the sales force and how do you want to refine the Field Turbo program going forward.","Olivier Filliol","The field turbo is really inspiring us as long-term initiatives like statistical [indiscernible] approaches, every year we get a little more sophisticated plus we don\u2019t see an end to the story, you are not going to necessarily see us to the same amount every year, we will certainly address that to the market conditions, but in general we see opportunities really around the world and we are prioritizing however the business is with the best profitability and certainly also the best opportunity for us to win market share.","We the reason why I say the program has many more years to go is our average market shares are still giving us plenty room and for many, many years to grow here to additional resources and the additional resources help us to serve the customer better way and to have a better geographic coverage. So yes, if I look this year we are for example planning to add another 200 people roughly and we are certainly going to investigate for opportunities later this year and from today\u2019s perspective there is no reason why we wouldn\u2019t do something similar again next year.","Steve Beuchaw","Really appreciate that. Just two quick modeling questions for me. One is now that you have seen 2Q you still thing Easter was two or three points swing factor between the first quarter second quarter in Europe and then a quick one for Mary or Bill any chance you can give us a view on want the tax looks like beyond this year given this year we had a bit of an accounting transition.","William Donnelly","Let me answer the last part first. So the tax rates sitting here today we would say same point 22% rate next year. In terms of Europe I tend to look at the year-to-date numbers and say that our lab business is up 8.5% year-to-date and our industrial and [TI] (Ph) business is up about 5% year-to-date and kind a looking at the details I would say that 2% to 3% for the Easter impact on Europe is probably still realistic number particularly if I\u2019m looking at the multi year growth rates too and if I adjust for that I think that is a reasonable assumption Steve.","Steve Beuchaw","Okay great. Thanks for the help.","William Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Isaac Ro","Good afternoon guys, thank you. question was on market share be interested maybe at a high level if you could talk a little bit about where you think you are getting share most effectively. And then maybe as a counter to that where you think the opportunities from here are going forward are most compelling for you to do better on the share front?","Olivier Filliol","Because the data is not so easily available from our competitors. We can\u2019t exactly quantify the numbers on a quarterly base or business-by-business or country. But in general, I definitely feel very strong about our product inspection business how we do there, really very strong, the whole lot portfolio does also extremely well. And I also feel like we do well on the remaining businesses and when you think about geographies and feel strong across the world. And so I wouldn\u2019t highlight particular country or so and yeah.","Isaac Ro","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe on the services side of the business. Can you talk a little bit about the types of investments you need to make at this point to drive continued growth there about corporate average. I mean just is that business grows as a percentage of total what that means through incremental margin profile of the total company. I\u2019m wondering if that will have a tangible effect. Thank you.","Olivier Filliol","So, in terms of investments this has been something going on for years, we have heavily invested in having better data on our installed based. We make sure that we have an understanding where all our installed based is with respect to decision makers or users behind it and having an understanding how the equipment is used. And then running marketing programs behind it and that\u2019s actually very diligent work, detailed work for developing service contract business you need to do micro complains and that something that we have been really developing over the years.","And we have invested accordingly in telesales resources, but also service development people. And then when you have the business of course we need to add more service technicians and heavily invest in training for this service technicians, we are proud of having a very well trained, but also very specialized service force around the world. And so these are multiple investments and of course we always talk about our [indiscernible] program, so in essence there is also IT tools that support our service organization across the world.","Isaac Ro","Understood. Thanks so much guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Dan Leonard","Thank you. First off, I was hoping you could you could elaborate further on what drove the acceleration in China whether by end-market customer class or anything you could offer color on?","William Donnelly","Okay. I think the thing that\u2019s really changed the last couple of quarters is the industrial business. So, we\u2019re doing well on industrial. I think there is multiple factors contributing it to that. One is we going back couple of years redirected our sale resources to go to more selected industrial markets.","And I think it\u2019s fair to say that that process happen all at once. So, when you are approaching new segments, trying to gain share with customers et cetera it took a while to grow that up and I think that still improving.","Second factor is, we clearly believe that there was pent up demand in recent years coming from China, it\u2019s hard to quantify, but we certainly have seen in another parts of the global economy, gets weak and there is let\u2019s say something of a financial limitation on credit availability that we tend to get eventually bounce backs in our replacement cycles.","And then maybe the third thing that is another tough one to quantify and it\u2019s probably a little bit into the coming quarters, but there is probably something to be said with the end of the five year conference coming up that the government likes to talk about this program or that program that they have gotten finished for the benefit of the \u201cpeople\u201d and we are today much less a direct beneficiary of such programs than we were in the past but we are certainly an indirect beneficiary of the pushing you get some of those projects done.","Dan Leonard","And just lastly, you can quantify growth rate between your industrial business in China and your lab business in China?","William Donnelly","Okay, sure. So year-to-date basis our lab business is up and mid teens let\u2019s call it and industrial business is up around 20%.","Dan Leonard","Great. Thank you, Bill.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Daniel Arias","Yes, good afternoon, guys. Bill, just following up on retail how much visibility you have into 2018 at this point, but do you expect the project works as you move to the beginning of next year and I guess along those lines, I think what is the normalized growth rate for that business in the out years?","William Donnelly","So maybe I just start by trying to persuade with the idea that I want to answer your question, but I don\u2019t want us to get distracted on that question too. If you look at what is going to drive our EPS growth for the long-term it\u2019s how we are doing in those core product categories.","Retail is by definition lumpy, it represents today Mary help me, probably by the end of this year somewhere around 8% sort of 8.5% and it\u2019s meaningfully less profitable than any other businesses. So certainly we need to help you guys with expectations for it, but if you think about your long-term model it\u2019s not going to be a key value driver.","With that being said, sitting here today we don\u2019t know that much, as you guys remember our budget tour is coming up, but we will know a lot more on the next call and probably to give you some better insights. But you know sitting here today we will always say our next three to five year expectations for retail is also [indiscernible] and sitting here today we would see a different number for 2018 and that.","William Donnelly","As you might recall that\u2019s in recent quarters we were surprised actually by better retail numbers than expected, some of that was driven also by the European regulation for label, so we had a little bit of a spike of business that we are facing now tougher comparison and that business doesn\u2019t repeat. So again, this is lumpiness of that business and we just should accept it, because I feel that it\u2019s kind of not the core that we want to focus on driving cost.","Daniel Arias","Yes, certainly understand. Okay. Thanks. And then maybe just within lab, I\u2019m just curious about the pipettes business that was one that was up last year more than I kind of would have thought it would be. So I mean at the halfway point of this year, how do you think that looks in 2017 compared to the growth that you saw in 2016.","William Donnelly","That\u2019s our growing last year it grew around 10% and this year 150 basis points less.","Daniel Arias","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Evans with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Tim Evans","Thank you. Maybe I\u2019ll just turn to the balance sheet, over the past three years you have taken your leverage ratio up materially to return capital and I was just wondering if that\u2019s something we should expect to continue should we think about that leverage rate remaining stable or perhaps even going down maybe any comments on that. thanks.","William Donnelly","Okay. So Tim I\u2019m going to try to be persuasive against. And I\u2019m having fun with your comment materially. I think you have got average for the last couple of years buying about a $100 million a year over our free cash flow and very much reflecting the fact that our balance sheet is pretty conservative and still is at the end of today.","Sitting here today we are expecting that in 2018 we will get to buy just equal to our free cash flow which just as a reminder assuming things as they are today we will buy about a $0.5 billion this year, we bought about a $0.5 billion last year or we buy about a $0.5 billion again next year.","And maybe not to get too much in the reach here just one other thing is, you guys will remember that our free cash flow in 2016, 2017 and probably a little bit early 2018 will be impacted by all these building projects that we undertook and this is reminder that the two main categories that fall into are one is the campus consolidation that we did as part of our efforts to reduce our Swiss Franc cost base eliminated a number of facilities and are consolidating that in to one this year and then finishing that up next year.","And then second one is two plant pure expansions that we\u2019re doing one in the United States and one in the United Kingdom, because our product inspection business as you guys hear from the numbers has just been growing really well particularly in the X-ray side and we just needed more facility then.","So with that kind of behind us, we lack of a better expression somewhat artificial deflating of our cash flow for couple years here we made up for that with some extra share repurchases and get back to a more normalized free cash flow level in 2018. [indiscernible] understand that I answered your question fully?","Tim Evans","You did. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Derik de Bruin","Hi, good afternoon. Hey, so can you talk a little bit about the pharma and biotech markets and also pretty big bio production. In your [indiscernible] business you sell dissolved oxygen sensors and other tools that look at basically - they are using tool like bio production campaigns, bio manufacturing campaigns. Some of your competitors have commented about flowing in the bio production market. I\u2019m just wondering if you notice anything weird in terms of production scale and from your perspective in that market.","Olivier Filliol","Okay, so life science in general is about 25% to 30% we will include [indiscernible] so have bio-pharma, we have pharma on skills and so on. this is a market that we serve in particular with the high tech business but also auto lab business and with the degree of which the process analytics business. You heard us just talking about high tech how well we have been doing so very happy with that.","And if I look at the process analytics business, we had excellent growth last year, this year a little bit less so, but in terms of two year growth actually remains really strong and I think I feel like we saw a little a weaker now but that\u2019s because the comparison were really so difficult.","But in terms of market momentum, I definitely feel good and we\u2019re reviewing that business early in the week and the outlook actually remains strong. So, I feel actually good about the end user prospect and particular also in the area bio production and bio stimulus and all the related markets.","Derik de Bruin","Great. Thank you. And Bill, can you talk to us a little bit about the gross margin progression in the second half of 2017. Your second quarter numbers were a bit lower than what we have modeled? Thanks.","William Donnelly","Yes. Sure. So, it\u2019s correct, we are up about 30 bps in the second quarter and that 1largely was explained because we\u2019re up a 160 bps in the prior year. In the second half of the year, I think you can assume our gross profit margins will be up about 50 bps.","Derik de Bruin","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Steve Willoughby","Hi. Good evening. Bill or Mary, I was wondering and I apologize in case I missed it. If you could just give us a quantify some of the like an EPS bridge between your old guidance and your new guidance. I know you called out a number of things [indiscernible] OpEx as well as some higher variable comps. So I just wonder if you can help us to put some numbers around how you are thinking between your EPS guidance and your new EPS guidance?","William Donnelly","Hi. I struggle to be overly precise, because each one was independently bottoms up, if you know what I mean Steve. So, but that being said on the EPS side we certainly built in some additional upside due to higher sales expectations. We built in some impact due to higher bonuses to be paid. And you might know that has a little bit of weird impact that if I can explain it clearly in the second half of the year, because the first half of the year was so strong it\u2019s got mean, we finish very, very well on our bonus plans for the full-year.","But with this kind of more mid single-digit growth in the second half of the year has a little bit of a disproportionate impact on the cost structure in the second half. And incremental margins would otherwise be even better in the second half.","And then we updated ForEx, ForEx is still a slight headwind for the full-year, but certainly less than the headwind than it was last time and then we added in the impact of what we would be this quarter. So, that kind of gives you hopefully the flavor of how we are thinking about it.","Steve Willoughby","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just one quick follow-up and just on tax rate. [indiscernible] the simple math, I just want to make sure we\u2019re looking at the right, 22% for the year we\u2019re thinking something in somewhere in 24%, 25% range in the back half of the year?","William Donnelly","Yes. I guess that it certainly got it over the only hesitation on the amount remember our pre-tax earnings are larger in the second half of the year than the first. So you might not be that much of an impact to get there but it\u2019s something north of 22, 24 probably.","Steve Willoughby","Perfect. Thanks very much.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your final question comes from the line of David Stratton with Great Lakes Review. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","David Stratton","Hi, thank you for taking the question. Really quick, would you go over what you are seeing in raw material cost and any benefit from this Stern Drive program at this point in procurement?","William Donnelly","Yes, so maybe we kicked off some projects that will layer in over time, but I think we kicked off projects that have a total value savings about $9 million again it won\u2019t be all realized at once related to the Stern Drive program. We were relatively flat in terms of material cost and year-to-date basis and I believe that commodity prices were negative about a $1 million with offsets in other categories and then another one that was negative if I recall correctly was electronic components. So electronic components in commodity prices are up and other categories are down, I think we got 2 millions are negatives and 2 million of positives if I remember correctly.","David Stratton","All right. And then really quick to the service revenue, how much is Troemner benefitting that category?","William Donnelly","So yes it could be 1% or something like that, I think their pure service business is certainly less than $10 million.","David Stratton","Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions in queue. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Mettler-Toledo management.","Mary Finnegan","Thanks Devin and thanks everyone for joining then call tonight. As always if you have any questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to contact us. Given that we are in Switzerland probably the best way is through e-mail. Hope everyone have a good night and take care. Bye-bye.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."],"15017":["Mettler Toledo International Inc.

After the speaker's remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn our presentation over to your hostess for today's call, Ms. Mary Finnegan. Please proceed, ma'am.","Mary Finnegan","Thanks, Catherine, and good evening everyone. I'm Mary Finnegan. I'm Treasurer and responsible for Investor Relations at Mettler Toledo. I'm happy that you're joining us this evening. I am joined by Olivier Filliol our CEO and Shawn Vadala our Chief Financial Officer.","I need to cover just a couple of administrative matters. This call is being webcast and is available for replay on our Web site. A copy of the press release and the presentation that we refer to is also available on the Web site.","Let me summarize the safe harbor language which you see on Page 2 of the presentation.

More detailed information with respect to the use of and the differences between the non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in our Form 8-K.","I will now turn the call over to Olivier.","Olivier Filliol","Thank you, Mary, and welcome to everyone on the call which we are doing from Switzerland this quarter, which is why we started a little earlier than we normally do. I will start with a summary of the quarter and then Shawn will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments, and we will open the lines for Q&A.","The highlights for the quarter are on page three of the presentation. We are very pleased with the strong finish to the year with our fourth quarter results. Local currency sales growth was better than expected as demand in our markets remained favorable and we continued to execute very well. Total local currency sales grew 8% in the quarter. We had strong broad-based growth in most of our laboratory and industrial product lines.","China had another quarter of excellent growth. Our sales growth combined with results from our margin and productivity measures drove very strong improvements in operating margins. And despite a 5% headwind due to adverse currency and high tariff costs, we achieved a 15% increase in adjusted EPS in the quarter. All around, these are strong results.","Our outlook for 2019 remains positive, but similar to our comments to you last quarter, we remain concerned about the global economy. We do not see evidence of a downturn in our markets today, but Marko [ph] data and rhetoric surrounding international trade disputes make us cautious. We remain focused on execution of our growth initiatives and believe we are well-positioned to continue to gain share regardless of market conditions. Assuming market conditions remained favorable we believe we can generate good earnings growth in 2019.","Let me now turn it to Shawn to cover the financials and guidance and I will come back later with additional comments on our business.","Shawn Vadala","Thanks, Olivier, and hello everybody. Sales were $817.9 million in the quarter, an increase of 8% in local currency. All growth is organic and we have owned Biotix for more than a year now. On a U.S. dollar basis total sales increased 5% as currencies reduced sales growth by approximately 3% in the quarter.","On slide number four, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales grew 7% in the Americas, 6% in Europe and 10% in Asia\/Rest of World. Sales growth in China increased 12% in the quarter and strong in both laboratory and industrial products. Slide number 5 shows sales growth for the full-year. Local currency sales increased 5% in the Americas, 4% in Europe, and 10% in Asia\/Rest of the world. Biotix benefited Americas' growth by approximately 1% for the full-year.","On slide number six, we outlined local currency sales growth by product line. In the quarter, Laboratory sales grew 7%, Industrial increased 10%, while Retail decreased 6%. Within Industrial, product inspection increased 7%, while core industrial grew 13%.","Turning to the next slide, we show sales growth for the full-year by product line. Laboratory sales grew 9%, Industrial grew 3% and Retail grew 3% in 2018. Biotix benefited lab sales by approximately 2%. All sales growth is in local currency.","Slide number 8 provides the P&L for the quarter. Gross margin in the quarter was 58.4% as compared to 58.6% in the prior year. Pricing continues to be a strong contributor to gross margins but we had headwinds from tariffs mix and some additional costs associated with our product inspection business and new product launches.","R&D amounted to $36.2 million, which represents a 15% increase in local currency. SG&A amounted to $201.7 million, a decrease of 1% in local currency over the prior year. Increased investments in our field force were offset by cost savings and productivity initiatives as well as lower variable compensation.","Adjusted operating income amounted to $239.7 million in the quarter, which represents an 11% increase over the prior year amount of $216.9 million. We estimate currency reduced operating profit by approximately $5 million. We also estimate tariffs where gross headwind to operating income by an estimated $5 million. Despite these meaningful headwinds, our operating margin was 29.3% which is a 140 basis point improvement over the prior year.","A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $12 million in the quarter. Interest expense was $8.8 million in the quarter. Other income, excluding the onetime items I will cover shortly amounted to $340,000 compared to income of $1.2 million last year.","Our effective tax rate was approximately 21.5% in the quarter, moving to fully diluted shares which amounted to $25.5 million in the quarter and is 3% decline from the prior year reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $6.85, a 15% increase over the prior year amount of $5.97. On a reported basis in the quarter, EPS was $7.11 as compared to $2.93 in the prior year.","Reported EPS included a $0.75 acquisition gain related to our earn-out accrual with Biotix. As background, when recording an acquisition with an earn-out provision, the initial amount accrued in goodwill is recorded is based upon a Monte Carlo simulation of all possible outcomes. The Biotix acquisition was structured with the large potential earn-out component, while we are very pleased with the Biotix acquisition and expect their operating profit to grow by more than 35% in the first two years they fall short of the earn-out level. As a result, we recorded a onetime non-cash gain to reverse a significant portion of the original amount.","Other one-time items in EPS include $0.10 of purchased intangible amortization, $0.14 of restructuring, $0.14 of a true up of the transition tax associated with last year's new tax regulations related to the most current guidance that was published in December, $0.09 of litigation cost and a $0.02 difference between our quarterly and annual rate due to timing of stock option exercises.","The next slide provides full-year results for 2018. Local currency sales increased 6%, operating profit increased 12%, operating margins improved 100 basis points and adjusted EPS was up 16%. We are very pleased with these results. That is it for the P&L.","Now I will cover cash flow. In the quarter, adjusted free cash flow was $157.2 million as compared with $130.7 million in the prior year period. Our working capital statistics remain solid with DSO at 39 days and ITO of 4.5 times. For the full-year, our free cash flow was $455.9 million which represents a 12% increase on a per share basis. We are very happy with this achievement.","Let me now turn to guidance. First, we continue to feel very good about the things we can control namely our growth and productivity initiatives, we have spoken to you often about our spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives, our new product launches and our stern drive productivity programs.","We're confident in the effectiveness of these initiatives and our ability to execute them. Our guidance for 2019 assumes market conditions remain unchanged while we ended the year on a strong note as Olivier mentioned we are cautious on the global economy, some economic data points have further moderated over the past few months but we have not seen an impact on our business today.","We also continue to acknowledge risks associated with the potential impact on the Chinese in overall global economy due to trade and tariff disputes. We will continue to monitor the global economy closely and remain agile to adapt to conditions necessitate.","Next tariffs, based on the situation today, we expect a gross negative impact of tariffs of approximately $25 million on an annual basis. This assumes the full 25% tariff rates which we assume will be fully implemented in March. We estimate tariffs will be a gross headwind to EPS of approximately 3% in 2019 and will have a greater impact in the first half of the year versus the second half.","We expect to be able to negate much of the impact of tariffs through price increases and some internal supply chain adjustments, one question you may ask is what happens if the tariffs go away, we would estimate a positive impact to full-year EPS growth of approximately 1% if the tariffs were eliminated and this would be on a full-year basis. We would not recoup the entire 3% as some pricing in the internal supply chain process changes are tied directly to the tariffs and therefore would go away if the tariffs are eliminated.","In addition to tariffs, currency also continues to be a headwind to earnings in 2019 particularly in the first half of the year, for the full-year we would have - we would expect adverse currency to reduce EPS growth by approximately 1.4%. However in the first half, it will reduce EPS growth by approximately 3%.","Finally, our tax rate, when we provided guidance in November, we had assumed a tax rate of 21% for 2019. Based on our current expected mix of income, we now expect the effective tax rate for 2019 will be 20% to 25%.","Let me now cover the specifics, we continue to expect local currency sales growth in 2019 to be approximately 5%. We are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance to $22.50 to $22.70 which is a growth rate of 11% to 12%. This compares to previous adjusted EPS guidance of $22.40 to $22.60. With respect to the first quarter, we would expect local currency sales growth to be approximately 5.5% and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4 to $4.05, a growth rate of approximately 7% to 8%. We would expect the headwind from tariffs and currency to approximate 7% in the first quarter and the first half of the year.","Let me also comment on cash flow for 2019, we expect cash flow of approximately $510 million in 2019, this represents a growth of 16% per share. In terms of share repurchases as we mentioned on our last call, we intend to modestly increase our leverage over the next two years through share repurchases and our acquisitions. We currently expect share repurchases to be approximately $745 million in 2019, some final comments on guidance as you update your models.","Other income, which is below adjusted operating profit will be approximately $3.5 million, as compared to income of $6 million last year. This line includes pension income which we expect will be lower this year, we would expect shares outstanding to be approximately $24.9 million, interest expense is expected to be approximately $40 million, total amortization will be approximately $52 million which includes approximately $13 million of purchased intangible and amortization or $0.40 per share which we exclude from adjusted EPS.","In terms of currency and sales, we expect currency to reduce sales growth by approximately 2.5% in 2019. For the first quarter, we expect currency to reduce sales growth by approximately 4.5%. We will provide Q2 guidance on our next call, but wanted to point out given the expected impact of tariffs and currency in the first half of the year as compared to the second half, we would expect EPS growth in the second quarter to be high single digits.","That is it from my side. I'll now turn it back to Olivier.","Olivier Filliol","Thanks, Shawn. Let me start by providing some additional comments on our operating results, Our lot business continues to perform very well with 7% sales growth in the quarter, which was again excellent growth in the prior year, almost all product lines have good growth with analytical instruments, pipettes, and process analytics particularly strong.","We are executing well in this business as we've benefited from a robust product portfolio, continued investments in field resources and our spin on sales and marketing initiatives. Last we will have tougher comparisons in 2019, but we expect good growth nonetheless. I will have some additional comments on lab shortly but let me cover other business.","With respect to industrial, we ended the year with strong sales growth in both core industrial and product inspection. Core industrial had an impressive growth of 13% with all three regions and most product lines showing very good growth. These results reflect solid market demand and good execution. Product inspection had good growth in the fourth quarter with 7% local currency growth. This business have been under some pressure for most of 2018 due to very tough comparisons and reduced spending by large package food companies.","We expect growth in 2019 in the mid-single-digit range which is below our long-term outlook for this business as we think it will take some additional time for packaged food companies to return to full investment mode. The final piece of our company is the retail business which was down 6% in the quarter based up on the timing of customer activity. Although negative we are not overly concerned given that we manage this business profitability not sales growth. We also expect a sales decline in the first quarter but expect for the full-year that this business is relatively flat.","Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Europe ended the year with strong local currency sales despite the declining food retailing. Lab had solid growth while industrial both core industrial and product inspection were up strongly. In the Americas lab had excellent growth product inspection was flat while core industrial was up strongly. Retail was flat.","Finally Asia and rest of the world had another quarter of excellent growth. Lab and industrial did very well while retail down. China had very strong growth in lab and industrial. One final comment on the business in the fourth quarter is service which was up 9% for the quarter. We had a growth in both lab and industrial reflecting traction on our growth initiatives surrounding service. That concludes my comments on different pieces of the business for the fourth quarter. We are very pleased with how we ended the year.","Let me comment in some more detail on our lab business, which have had strong organic growth over the last three years. And now we present just over 50% of our business we are benefiting from a very robust product pipeline. Lab received a disproportionate amount of our R&D and our recent and upcoming launches are yielding very tangible results. Our Spinnaker sales and marketing approach has worked particular well for this business as we very much leverage cross and value selling and innovative marketing that drives leads growth. There are also some market dynamics of our base table to our offering to the market.","One example in the area of data integrity and specifically how our instrument control software LabX is helping customers ensure compliance and data integrity. Data integrity is one of the most critical topics in the pharmaceutical industry today and has become a hot button issue with the FDA. In particular the focus is on bench-top instruments such as balances, Ph meters and typewriter that do not store data electronically. Such instruments typically use printout as data records which of course can be subject to manipulation y. This risk has gotten the attention of the FDA.","Our answer to this challenge is LabX our instrument control and data management software to control bench-top instruments. LabX supports all of our lab instruments, which represents approximately 40% of the instrument on a typical chemist bench-top. LabX through well-designed workflows, standardization of validation methodologies and strong data management capabilities can help customers achieve the data integrity objectives. LabX can also be fully integrated in a lymph system.","LabX as a fully compliant FDA 21 CFR Part 11 platform addresses the FDA concerns for providing controlled user access, for data traceability and secure data handling across all of these very commonly used product line in the analytical testing and QA\/QC in the pharmaceutical industry. In addition customers enjoy significant productivity improvement as a training burden is reduced as LabX can be standardized across many of these critical bench-top instruments. Most of our balance and analytical instruments are used routinely in the QA\/QC or testing lab. With LabX data analysis and management are seamlessly integrated into one compliant software solution.","One additional market dynamic is productivity and efficiency in the lab and on our one-click approach that allows customers to simplify lab processes and ensure they are being done correctly all with a simple click. The one click technology incorporates short cuts methodologies and sophisticated analytics into an instrument so workflows can be executed easily and effectively by combining our one-click approach with our LabX software our regulated customers can ensure proper method operation and data integrity.","Over the last three years, we have expanded our one-click concept to all of our analytical instruments. We are now taking the concept to our AutoChem instruments. By pairing one-click analytics with our IC software we are able to use artificial intelligence to provide high quality information from large amounts of data with limited user interaction. One benefit is a customer can analyze a reaction in approximately two minutes instead of the two hours it traditionally would have taken.","LabX and One Click are just two examples of the value that our lab offering provides to customers. We believe our laboratory business is well positioned and we will continue to focus on five key customers values, safe result, solid compliance, simple operation, sustainable value and seamless integrated processes. We have been incorporating these values into our products for sometimes and while these are simple concepts we believe they resonate well with customers and provide a compass for our development teams to ensure they bring real value not just technology to customers. That concludes my comments on the lab business.","In summary, we feel very good about how we finished 2018 and our outlook for this year. Assuming market conditions remain stable we believe are well-positioned to generate good sales growth, capital market share and deliver strong earnings growth.","That concludes our prepared remarks, and I want to ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.","Ross Muken","Hi. Good afternoon, guys. So, maybe just turning to sort of the industrial piece, obviously a fantastic quarter, China put that in sort of the context of what we've seen on the PMI side. I'm sure you're watching as well, as well as maybe some of peers in China, I guess how are you thinking about kind of that core industrial market, and it doesn't seem from the reports we've seen for many companies so far at least in this space this quarter did anyone see any change, but I guess as you look at sort of what's happening on the macro, particularly in Europe, maybe lesser in China, how are you sort of putting that full picture together to kind of get a feel for how that business will play out over the year?","Olivier Filliol","If I look we did in Q4, we really saw very good growth across all the regions. It reflects still good market conditions, but very much also the strong execution of the team. We have invested quite some effort to go off to the attractive segments of the markets. We have done some resource shifting in certain counties, but if I also look at our marketing spending, our sales force guidance, we really support that our focus goes to the industrial segments that are most promising, and here I would name pharma, chemical, and food, and less so the more discrete by factoring kind of the material plastic electronics components markets, and that gives me also confidence that in 2019 we still will have good growth, even that maybe there is a certain slowdown in the global economy. Our business today is a different one than that we had in the downturn - in the last downturn, and that's particularly also true for industrial.","Ross Muken","That's helpful. And maybe specifically on China, obviously some noise today out of the government, but feels like there's still just a lot of posturing, but we'll eventually sort of get the tariff issue behind us. I guess, as you look at your business there, any discernable change in sort of growth rates for any of the sub segments in the region? And how are you thinking about sort of the comps in that business over the balance of the year?","Olivier Filliol","So far we don't see a slowdown in China. We delivered very strong results in Q4. We have great momentum in most of the industry segments. But what I said before for industrial worldwide applies also to China. There are industrial segments that do better than others. Again, pharma, for example, would do very well. But we would have the material - or the discrete manufacturing sectors that are certainly impacted in China, and that - at market that today is less relevant for us than it was 10 years ago. We talked a lot about our Chinese market business mix that changed. We have today a situation where the lab business is significantly bigger than it was a couple of years ago. And even within the industrial business we succeeded to grow the PI business to become more significant.","So, I feel like we have a more healthy business mix. We have a team very focused on capturing the growth that comes from the industry segments that are growing in China, and that are benefiting from the five-year plans of the Chinese government. Looking forward, I don't expect the same growth rates out of China as we had, rather would see a mid to high single-digit growth in China. Here I would see lab to be particular strong. Kind of expect from lab in China high single-digit, as probably on the industry it's more the low single-digit range, and then reflecting basically also a slowdown of the Chinese economy, not the same in every segment.","Ross Muken","Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Donnelly","Great, thanks guys. Maybe just on the service side, another nice quarter of high single-digit growth there, can you just help us think about the durability of the growth? I know it's been a big focus internally around things like driving higher attach rate. Can you just help us think where we are on that progression, how much room is left on that front?","Olivier Filliol","Indeed, I was very pleased about the Q4 results here on service. It's a good reflection of what we did. I want to highlight maybe also for the full-year I was very happy with service because we did talk to you at the investor conference that our products become better and better, and therefore we sell less spare parts, we have less break\/fix. And the decline in the break\/fix we compensate with higher penetrations for contract business. And we have seen that happening throughout the year, definitely also in Q4. I see also that for some lab service business is doing particularly well, all these things. So, the trends in our service business are all point to the right direction, and it's a result of the many initiatives that we have.","I would also highlight that the service in percentage of total business has been grown over all these years. As I include consumables to it, it's today almost a third of our total business, so a very attractive mix and I'm happy to see that our internal initiatives are actually delivering this.","Patrick Donnelly","Okay. And then you mentioned the investor day, obviously you guys spent a lot of time there on the product inspection business, nice to see that bounce back to the kind of high single-digit growth. I guess on the go-forward mid single-digit growth in 2019 why couldn't there be upside there? I know you guys talked a lot about the competitive advantages you have, the opportunity in front of you at the investor day. So, is it just the market slowing on the food segment, could you just talk through the growth outlook, again a little lower than we've seen historically?","Olivier Filliol","It's also related to timing of projects. The process inspection business has also deals that are bigger. And then it's a timing question of things how they come together. Then the second factor is the packaged foods industry overall and their investment commitments. We had seen in 2017, for example, very good large orders, global rollouts. '18 was then slower on that one, and we had certainly also a comparison challenge. And in '19, I just don't see it yet that the large packaged food companies are coming back in the same degree with the large global rollouts. And that's the reason why we are here a little bit more cautious for the year, but when I think about mid to long-term, I certainly the product inspection business to come back with very good growth numbers.","Particularly we have a very good competitive position. We have the leading positions. And so I really see this as a very attractive business in the long-term. But then short-term, and again 2019 it will be a little bit more challenging. And yes, in that sense I'm happy how we delivered in Q4, but just because we had a good Q4 doesn't make the 2019 an easy year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.","Steve Beuchaw","Hi. Thanks for the time here. Just a few cleanup questions, I guess one, I wonder if you could just spike out or maybe tell us that you have no need to spike out anything in the quarter as it relates to timing items or projects, anything that affected the revenue progression 3Q, 4Q, 1Q?","Shawn Vadala","No, I mean - Steve, this is Shawn. No, I mean the question first of all was - we're particularly happy to see broad based growth throughout most of the businesses, not only by products but by regions. Probably the two things that stood out on the positive side from the trend perspective is we had a strong finish to the year in product inspection that Olivier was just talking about. And then we also had a very strong year in core industrial, which was especially nice to see in each region of the world. I mean, each region really ended the year on a strong note there. And then on the other side of that, our retail business, as expected, was down in the quarter based upon the timing of project activity.","Steve Beuchaw","Okay, got it. And then just a couple of housekeeping ones, one is, any change to the way you're thinking about the margin impact in '19 from the work that you guys have done on the facility consolidations in Switzerland and around Tampa. And then - and sorry, just I wonder if you could give me a sense for how to think about one other issue and it's, you mentioned in the prepared remarks, and thank you for the detail, in a scenario where the tariffs are resolved that the guidance would change, it would go higher. And again, thank you for the granularity. But I'm just a little confused about how to think about that when at the same time you mentioned that you assume that the end market conditions are very stable relative to what you've seen in 4Q. And exiting 2018, at least so far, we haven't seen an impact to the tariffs.","So I wonder if you could just help me sort of parse that out. Is there potentially some impact from the tariffs that you found ways to offset, and so those kind of net out? Thanks a bunch.","Shawn Vadala","Yes, maybe I'll start with the second part of your question, Steve. So, just to be clear, when we talk about the impact with the tariffs, we're not talking about the potential impact on the global economy. And so that's yes that's what we're referring to when we talked about in the prepared comments that the gross impact is about 3% of direct costs, but if that went away the net benefit of going away would be more like 1%.","In the first part of your question in terms of product inspection were you referring to operating margins or gross margin I wasn't sure what you meant by that.","Steve Beuchaw","I was actually more focused on operating margins, but both would be well? Thank you.","Olivier Filliol","Yes, sure. So, on the operating margin side we're looking at a 100 basis point improvement for 2019. I think that's a strong guide from our perspective that certainly factors in some of the benefits we would see from some of the synergies and benefits we would have from the new facility in consolidating the plants. Similar story on 2019 gross margin we would see gross margin increasing in the range of about 50 basis points. Of course there's different puts and takes to that with favorable benefit from currency I mean I'm sorry from pricing which we would expect to be similar to what I guided last quarter in the 2%ish kind of arrange. Offset by the cost of the tariffs and kind of the rest is probably noise at that point.","Steve Beuchaw","Thanks so much.","Olivier Filliol","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard","Thanks good afternoon or evening. Olivier just back on the core industrial business the 13% feels a lot more early cycle then base cycle, were there any specific discrete sort of projects that happened to fall in the fourth quarter that sort of contributed to that?","Olivier Filliol","No, no, particular, and it was broad-based, it was across geographies and so nothing particular that I would highlight and that would explain it.","Brandon Couillard","Fair enough and then just one on the R&D line the 15% spike in R&D spending in the fourth quarter so a bit of jump. Just curious how you think about the new product pipeline for 2019 and what segments do you feel like you got sort of the strongest lineup? Thank you.","Olivier Filliol","Yes hey so yes we are investing heavily in the business. There's a lot of different great projects that we're excited about. How we see stuff in each area of the business but if we probably disproportionally in the laboratory side we have some really exciting things on the analytical instrument business as an example, but nothing I would highlight in particular. As we have a pretty diversified portfolio so no one new product introduction or upgrade moves the needle in isolation. It's just kind of our constant DNA of continuously having these things coming out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho Peterson","Hey, thanks, a couple follow-ups on margin, I appreciate the commentary on some of the facility initiatives. As we think about some of other things you've talk about supply chain adjustment and then also Blue Ocean kind of being harvest mode. Can you maybe just talk about the impact from those two dynamics over the course of the year?","Olivier Filliol","For 2019, you mean, Tycho?","Tycho Peterson","Correct yes.","Shawn Vadala","Yes. Hey, I mean it's not like we have a model that says this basis point is for one thing versus the other, but as we have a lot of really I'd say exciting initiatives to expand the margins. The pipeline of initiatives is strong as ever as Olivier mentioned before we feel really good about the execution in terms of our teams on the different programs. But I would say all areas whether its pricing had a particularly good fourth quarter and I feel good about the program entering the year. Stern Drive, as you heard at the Investor Day over 300 projects with lots of good things going on there. And then on the Blue Ocean program has a lot of really interesting things that we're working on at the moment that I think also positions us even better for the longer term.","Tycho Peterson","All right, and then I guess going back to the industrial commentary I appreciate the fact you didn't have any meaningful projects in the fourth quarter Olivier are you able to talk it all about kind of order book actually in January or actually in the quarter and then January trends at all?","Olivier Filliol","Not particular about January I think the guidance that we provided you before reflects different early indicators that we have and you heard Shawn talk about those are the business mix that we expect in Q1 and I think remains very healthy across all the businesses. So I think that supports the strong industrial number in Q4 wasn't just a spike. We in general feel good about that momentum. But of course we recognized that industrial overall is more exposed to an economic environment and that's also the reason that for the full-year I expect a better performance than from lab then I would say from industrial, but industrial will continue to do well.","Shawn Vadala","Yes, and just to be clear, we start the year with a good backlog in industrial and expect a good first quarter there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin","Hi, good evening everyone.","Olivier Filliol","Hi, Derik.","Derik De Bruin","So, I have to ask another Q4 question on this one just because some of the other industrial focus companies have mentioned it. Did you see any sort of pull forward in demand in Q4 just from customers in the industrial side you were potentially worried about tariffs and trade issues?","Olivier Filliol","No, actually you have a transaction size for us is not that high that customers would change their behavior just because of tariffs or anticipated price increases. Also we did communicate special price increases early on now I don't see a connection between the two things and as Shawn highlighted did the backlog indications for Q1 remain solid so.","Derik De Bruin","Great, and so, just one follow-up on this one, one of your life sciences tools peers when they gave 2019 guidance they basically said the same thing everything looks good. They flagged actually in their comments some concerns over potential Europe can you also talk about the European market and what's going on I mean obviously there is some political uncertainty and the point might now and just would love some of your feedback since your local there?","Olivier Filliol","Yes. Yes, hey, yes of course Europe is certainly a region that we look at in more cautious way they are certain countries where the economic forecast were downgraded in the last couple of weeks. But that doesn't always mean that it's going to directly impact us and I strongly feel that for example the pharma-chem industry is still doing very well. We have a very big share of replacement business that is not directly linked to the economic environment. I always say to our team we don't need that strong of a GDP growth that we can actually deliver good growth ourselves. And we are very much in that mode we are still in an investment mode, we are in an offensive mode across the world including Europe and it's up to us to compensate maybe some slowdown in the economy and still deliver good results and so far all the indications support the statement.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Arias with Citigroup.","Daniel Arias","Good afternoon guys, thanks, Olivier, maybe on the other side, can you just expand on the Americas in a bit it sounds like things are pretty good there. And I think Shawn's previous outlook was for growth in the low to mid-singles. How likely do you think a 3% or 4% scenario is at this point you did five of an 8% year so coming back to five is a comp seems fairly favorable?","Olivier Filliol","First of all, the environment looks healthy for us good, I am very happy with the results the team has been delivering. I'm very optimistic that we will continue to execute very well. We have some comparisons topics where we need to be a little realistic and we have the retail business that we already called out before we expect a decline. But absent of that I actually really feel good about the Americas and I expect again particular lab to do very well also in Americas.","Daniel Arias","Okay, retail was actually my second question I mean I certainly understand your point and what you're trying to do there in terms of profitability. I am just curious if you do have a view on when you think that business might return to growth?","Olivier Filliol","Ooh, I am not going to focus too much on that one, because I will focus really on the profitability, and with that we remain very selective with projects we pursue. It's also a lumpy business, and that's why we feel actually that we should deliver flat sales for the full-year, but for example, earlier in the year, we expect we're going to be down. And it's not a business that I'm going to say, okay, we're going to drive it to low to mid-single growth. As long as we grow profitability I'm fine. You need also to know we shift resources. We try to shift resources towards the lab business and industrial business because we see there sustainable long-term growth opportunity, we see good profitability and when you shift resources away from a business like the retail business, I want to be cautious and to expect growth mid or long-term. So yes, I hope this is giving you the necessary flavor.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays.","Jack Meehan","Thanks, good evening. I was hoping if you could start just within the Lab segment if you could give us an update on the pharma customer class. You know, 2018 was a strong funding year, so what the outlook there is for that customer group and how - historically how quickly some of the funding gets deployed within that group?","Olivier Filliol","So let me - if I take the big picture, I would split pharma and biopharma. Biopharma goes very well. We see a lot of investment in biopharma that benefits our core lab, but also process analytics very much. We have, for example, the pipette business that is very much also in biopharma. We see very, very good momentum there.","If we look at the other pharma business, so small molecules business for example, we still have very good momentum, we grow very nicely, but I would also recognize that maybe the investments are not in the same degree as biopharma, but here we need also to differentiate by geography, you for example, have to fill in the emerging markets, China in particular a good underlying growth rate in pharma very much so. And so, on a global scale, I feel good about pharma and biopharma going forward.","Jack Meehan","And you know just was hoping you could also give us an update on the deal landscape given some of the macro uncertainty that you talked about. Has there been any change in activity in the funnel and as it comes to leverage just the size of things that you would entertain?","Shawn Vadala","Yes, hey, there's no change in our status. I mean, our pipeline is the same as it's been. We still continue to look at things, but things also have to be available but no change in our status or our approach.","Jack Meehan","Thank you, Shawn.","Shawn Vadala","Yes, you're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank.","Dan Leonard","Thank you. Just a couple of quick ones for Shaw; Shawn, first off, on gross margins in the fourth quarter, they were a little lighter than we were expecting given the outperformance on the revenue line, I know foreign currency and tariffs were the headwinds. Was there anything else to explain the bridge on why gross margins were lighter year-on-year, was there a mix issue or anything else?","Shawn Vadala","Yes, I mean, we still - you know, there's a couple of things Dan. So we're still experiencing some of these initial startup costs in the product inspection business that we've talked to you about over the last couple of quarters as well as some related new product introductions that we've also spoke to you about as well. But one thing that stood out a little bit more in the fourth quarter is we did have some negative mix as we kind of dug into that one. And it was kind of just a mix that was granular within businesses. It wasn't like this division versus that division. It was really something at a more micro level, but as you kind of look at some of those topics, maybe the silver lining is that at the operating margin level, those product categories or those businesses actually performed quite well.","Dan Leonard","Okay. And then just a clarification, for the tax rate in 2019, did you say 20.5 or 21.5?","Shawn Vadala","20.5.","Dan Leonard","20.5, thank you.","Shawn Vadala","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Brennan with UBS.","Daniel Brennan","Great. Thank you for taking the question here. I guess, I wanted to go back to China if you would and with this - I think 17% of revenues - and I'm just wondering, given the exposure you have core industrial in China could you just help us think about like what's in that business in China and what the economic sensitivity of it is, because I think so far Lab's doing great and mostly your peers have discussed really not seeing any impact from slowing economic growth there, but I think the uncertainty, if you will, is just kind of that core industrial business. So if you can help us think about the exposure there and the sensitivity that you're baking into that business? Thank you.","Olivier Filliol","Yes. So, if I look at the mix today, in China we have about 45% that comes from Lab, and then you have Industrial which is roughly 47%, but interestingly that's quite a change versus 10 years ago, particularly if I look at core industrial. Core industrial 10 years ago would have been more like 60%, as today it is about 40%. And if I look at this 40% of core industrial, the end-user segment would also be different to what we had in the past. Namely today pharma, chemical, and food are really dominant end-user industries that we are serving. And as you can imagine these are the industries that are more sustainable. They should offer very good mid and long-term growth. And I would expect them to be much less exposed to any tariffs or trade impact.","And that's actually one of the reasons why we feel actually more comfortable that whatever the Chinese economy will do we will not see the same volatility as we have seen, for example, in 2015 [ph] where there was a significant downturn in China and we were heavily impacted in our industrial business. Lab had reasonable growth at that time, but the Industrial was very impacted, but as I described before our Industrial businesses today different, and feel more comfortable going forward on this.","Shawn Vadala","Yes. And if you were to take our Laboratory business in China and add the faster growth segments of Industrial, it's about two thirds of our total Chinese business.","Dan Leonard","Great. And then this is a follow-up, I'm sorry, it's another kind of macro question if you don't mind, but just given your comments, Olivier, they haven't seen any impact to date, but you know continuing to look at a lot of the tea leaves that are out there and kind of highlight the cautiousness that potentially could occur so are we to take that your guidance for mid single-digit growth this year and look at what IMF is forecasting, who knows if the economists can even come close to being right, but I think IMF and even our firm is forecasting that maybe 0.2, 0.3 percentage point decline in economic growth - is that what's kind of baked in? I know it's probably not that granular, but is that the level of what's baked in through mid single-digit, or is your cautiousness you know saying something even potentially worse? Thank you.","Olivier Filliol","No, it doesn't imply something abruptly worse. It is rather a steady situation and it implies that we continue to execute well in this steady environment and we continue to take market shares. If the economy would take a downturn from the current steady state, I would still expect us to gain market share, but we would probably have a hard time to deliver this kind of growth that we are guiding you. But we don't see, in our numbers, any early negative indicators and with what forecasts are out, right now, from the economists we feel comfortable with our guidance.","Operator","So, our final question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research.","Steve Willoughby","Hi, good evening, thanks for taking my questions. I think two things for you, first, Shawn, you commented about tariffs earlier, can you just walk us through some of the moving pieces if tariffs stay at 10%? I know you're assuming that they'll go to 25%, but you talked about if they want to weigh, what happens in terms of the impact or flow-through if they stay at the current 10%?","Shawn Vadala","Yes. Thanks Steve for the question. And just to clarify, there's two tranches of tariffs, the first tranche is at 25%, it's the second tranche that started at 10, and is still at 10. If we look at that and kind of model out what if it stays at 10, the benefit to EPS on a full-year basis would be approximately half a percent of EPS as opposed to the 1% if they all went away.","Steve Willoughby","Okay. So following up on that, and just trying to think through the changes in your EPS guidance, based on my math it looks like less worse FX is about $0.10. You're guiding to slightly lower tax rate, which is about maybe $0.15. And then you previously assumed that the tariffs would jump to 25% as of January 1, which obviously hasn't happened yet. So that's some extra earnings here in the first quarter versus what you might have been thinking three months ago, so just trying to put those pieces together and then get to the only $0.10 increase in the full-year guidance?","Shawn Vadala","Yes, sure. No. I understand the question. Probably I mean maybe I'll start with maybe the simplest way to think about the guide, and then I'll kind of acknowledge some of the puts and takes. So probably the easiest way to look at it is we maintained our growth rate of 11% to 12%. In terms of like kind of some of the puts and takes, we had our beat for Q4. Yes, we had the tax benefit that you mentioned. On the other side, we also had less pension income for 2019. That's largely related to the lower asset return that was impacted by global equity markets in the fourth quarter, particularly in the month of December that kind of went the other way on us.","In terms of your comment on tariff delay, I mean keep in mind that is only January and February that's maybe two to three pennies, so it wasn't a significant consideration for us. And then in terms of currency, the currency, you're right, there's probably modest benefit today if we looked at where currencies were three months ago, but a lot of that has been volatility that's evolved over the last couple of weeks, and at this point in time we just think it's prudent to be a little bit cautious on that one, and we just kind of see how the currencies play out here and then we kind of update accordingly as we kind of get into the first - after we get into the first quarter.","Steve Willoughby","Okay, thank you very much.","Shawn Vadala","Thank you.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.","Mary Finnegan","Thanks, Catherine, and thanks everyone for joining us tonight. As usual, if you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out. We are in Switzerland. So please send us an e-mail, we're happy to get back to you. Take care. Bye-bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"14734":["Mettler-Toledo International Inc.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn our presentation over to your hostess for today's call, Ms. Mary Finnegan.","Mary Finnegan","Good day, everyone. I'm Mary Finnegan, Treasurer and responsible for Investor Relations at Mettler-Toledo, and I'm happy to welcome you to the call. I am joined by Olivier Filliol, our CEO; and Bill Donnelly, our CFO.","I want to cover just a couple of administrative matters. This call is being webcast and is available for replay on our website at www.mt.com. A copy of the press release and the presentation that we will refer to on today's call is also available on our website. Let me summarize the Safe Harbor language, which is outlined on Page 1 of the presentation.","Statements in this presentation, which are not historical facts, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 and the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

More detailed information with respect to the use of and differences between the non-GAAP financial measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided in the 8-K.","Let me now turn the call over to Olivier.","Olivier Filliol","Thank you, Mary, and good evening, everyone. I am pleased to welcome you to the call. I will start with a summary of the quarter, and then Bill will provide details on our financial results and our updated guidance. I will then discuss our end-markets and outlook for 2012. As always, we will have time for Q&A at the end.","We are very pleased with the results for the fourth quarter. The highlights for the quarter are on Page 2 of the presentation. Local currency sales growth of 8% was very strong, better than expected in almost all regions. Asia and particularly China, continues to be very robust.","Despite challenging currency headwinds, we achieved a 5% increase in adjusted operating profit. Adjusted EPS was up 13% in the quarter, as the impact of a lower effective tax rate helps to offset negative currency headwind. We are pleased with the lower tax rate, which we will further comment on in a moment.","We are very pleased with our full year results. With local currency sales up 13%, operating profit up 13% and adjusted EPS up 20%. These exceptional results for the full year were driven by healthy end-markets and diligent execution.","The lower tax rate for the full year did not completely offset currency headwinds. While we are cautious for 2012, given the uncertainty in the economy, we believe we can continue to grow and we are well-positioned to grow faster than our underlying markets and capture share.","Let me now turn it to Bill to provide more details on the fourth quarter results as well as guidance.","Bill Donnelly","Thanks, Olivier, and hello, everybody. Let me start with additional details on sales, which were $648.4 million in the quarter, an increase of 8% in local currency, a level as Olivier already said we're very pleased with. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased by 9% in the quarter, which included a positive 1% impact from currency.","Turning to Page 3 of the presentation, we outlined sales by geography. In the quarter, local currency sales increased by 6% in Europe, 5% in the Americas, 16% in Asia\/Rest of World. Net acquisitions had no impact on our overall sales level, but did add 1% to Europe sales growth in the quarter.","The next slide shows our full year local currency sales growth, which amounted to 13%. For the year sales increased by 11% in Europe, 9% in the Americas and 20% in Asia\/Rest of World. Acquisitions contributed 1% to overall sales growth for the year and 1% to Europe's growth.","On Slide 5 of the presentation, we outlined our sales by product area for the quarter. Laboratory sales increased by 5%, industrial sales increased by 14% and food retailing increased by 2%. Acquisitions contributed 3% to industrial growth in the quarter, while divestitures reduced food retailing by 5% in the quarter.","The next slide provides our full year results. Laboratory sales increased by 9%. Industrial was up 19% and food retailing was up 1%. For the year, acquisitions increased industrial sales by 3% and divestitures reduced food retailing sales by 6%.","Now turning to Slide 7 of the presentation, we show the P&L. Let me walk you through the key items. Gross margins, profit margins were 53.4% in the quarter, consistent with the prior year. We benefited from pricing in the quarter; however, offsetting this was higher raw material cost and currency headwinds.","R&D amounted to $30.1 million, an increase of 9% in local currency. SG&A amounted to $184.4 million, an increase of 10% in local currency. The increase was attributable to higher sales and marketing investments, particularly in emerging markets. And as we mentioned last quarter, we had incremental costs associated with the go-live of Blue Ocean in China.","Adjusted operating income amounted to $131.7 million, which represents a 5% increase over the prior year amount of $125.3 million. Without the impact of currency, largely the Swiss franc strengthening versus the euro, our operating profit would have increased by 8% in the quarter. Our operating margins amounted to 20.3%. Without the impact of currencies, our operating margins were down slightly 10 basis points from the record levels of Q4 2010.","A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $5.1 million. Interest expense was $5.9 million. And our fully diluted shares were 32.4 million.","Now let me make some comments on taxes. We lowered our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and full year 2011 to 24%. This is the result of some tax planning strategies resulting in a more favorable country income mix.","Going forward for the medium term, based on our assumption of foreign tax credit utilization, we would expect slightly higher rate than what we achieved in 2011, specifically 24.5%. So a slight increase. We would expect our cash tax rate to remain in the 20% range. That's for cash flow purposes.","Turning back to the quarter, our adjusted EPS was $2.88, a 13% increase over the prior year amount of $2.56. We estimate that currency headwinds reduced earnings per share growth by approximately 3%, while the benefit of the lower tax rate increased EPS by 3%. On a reported basis, earnings per shares were $2.91 for the quarter. As outlined to you last quarter, we have taken some cost reduction actions and incurred some restructuring costs in the quarter amounting to $0.07.","We also refinanced our bank facility and entered into a new agreement which will provide us ample financing flexibility for the next five years. We thought it was prudent at this time to lock in our financing given the level of uncertainty in credit markets due to the European sovereign debt situation. We incurred $0.01 of debt extinguishment cost with the refinancing.","We also had a discrete tax item of $0.14 representing the benefit of the lower effective tax rate of 24% as it related to the first three quarters of the year. And then finally, we had $0.03 of purchase intangible amortization in the quarter.","On the next slide, we summarized our full year results. You can see that 2011 was an exceptional year for us. Local currency sales grew 13%. Adjusted operating income increased 13%. Adjusted earnings per share grew 20%. We estimate currency headwinds reduced adjusted EPS by 6%, while the benefit of the lower tax rate increased EPS by 3%. We are very pleased with these results and we think this reflects strong momentum in our markets and very good execution.","Now let me turn to cash flow. In the quarter, free cash flow amounted to $77.9 million as compared to $35.6 million in the prior year, a significant increase. DSO amounted 40 days, while our inventory turns on an LTM basis was 4.2 times. While we are pleased with our cash flow generation in the quarter, our full year amount of $203.8 million was slightly below our target.","The two principle factors were higher levels of CapEx and higher inventory levels. Both of these relate to our Blue Ocean program. First, CapEx was higher than expected principally due to the strengthening of the Swiss franc as most of our Blue Ocean expenditures take place centrally in Switzerland.","Second, we reached a critical milestone in 2011 with the go-live of the rest of our Swiss operations and all of our Chinese operations. These implementations went very well. But given the magnitude of operations impacted, we felt it appropriate to carry additional buffer stack and inventory to ensure no disruption to our customers.","We expect to work these inventories down over the course of this year, although we will hold some buffer stack for our U.S. go-live which is planned for Q4. As we look to 2012, we would expect cash flow to grow by something in the 15% range. ","Now let me turn to guidance. I'll start with some general comments and then get into specifics. First, our business momentum is good. You can see it in our sales growth in the quarter, which was better than expected. We are particularly pleased that the growth was so broad-based and that we can continue to grow faster than the underlying markets.","Second, while we are quite pleased with the strength of our business, we also know that we're not immune to economic weakness. We're alert to further weaknesses in our market but to date have not seen signs of a downturn.","As we discussed last quarter, we have planned some savings initiatives to come back market weakness and would deploy additional programs if the recession impacted Europe or the globe. With that as a backdrop, let me provide some details.","For the full year 2012, we expect local currency sales growth to be in the range of 5% to 7%. Currency will impact us a little in the first part of the year assuming current exchange rates remain in place particularly this was franc-euro and I'm referring of course to earnings per share here.","For the full year, we would expect the currency to have a modest impact on EPS. As mentioned earlier, we have assumed an effective tax rate of 24.5% for the full year. This will reduce EPS growth compared to last year by approximately 1% for the full year. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $9.20 to $9.50 which represents a growth of approximately 10% to 14%.","For the first quarter we would expect local currency sales growth to be in the range of 5% to 6% with adjusted EPS in the range of $1.59 to $1.63, a growth rate of 10% to 12%.","Our adjusted EPS guidance for the first quarter and full year before nonrecurring charges in conjunction with some of these restructuring activities I described we may incur additional charges but cannot estimate them at this time.","One final comment. Many of you asked us about the foreign exchange impact we expect on sales. If I use rates today for Q1, we're estimating a negative impact of about 1.5% on sales and for the full year about 2%.","That covers my comments on guidance, and I now want to turn it back to Olivier.","Olivier Filliol","Thank you, Bill. Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. We are pleased with the solid 5% sales growth in laboratory in the quarter, particularly given the exceptional sales levels in the prior-year period when organic sales were up 15%. And analytical instruments, automated chemistry and processed analytics had particular good results while pipettes have their strongest quarter for the year.","For 2011, lab sales increased 9% which reflects the benefit of our Spinnaker marketing programs, allow a strong product offering. We feel very good about our competitive position and believe we have strengthened it over the last few years.","Industrial had excellent growth in the fourth quarter and for the full year. In core industrial, we had good market conditions as we benefited throughout 2011 from the pent-up demand in the Americas and Europe. Core industrial growth in Asia, particularly China continues to exceed our expectation. As a reminder, our industrial market is more heavily weighted toward emerging markets particularly China. In fact, China always present approximately one-third of our total core industrial business.","Product Inspection also had been very well in the quarter and for the full year. Our solid leadership position, comprehensive product offering and a favorable market dynamics are driving these very strong results for Product Inspection.","Finally our food retailing was up mid-single digit in the quarter and full year on an organic basis. We have discussed in the past, we continue to focus this business on a breaking profit growth, rather than sales growth.","In terms of sales by geography, both the Americas and Europe had solid growth in the quarter and excellent growth for the full year. Market conditions remains solid in both areas but are better in North America was Europe which is impacted by a great level of uncertainty given the best issues of this region.","In Asia\/Rest of World particularly China growth has exceeded expectations. I'm particularly proud of the Chinese team that achieved this result despite going live with the Blue Ocean implementation. We expect good growth in 2012 but do not anticipate the same level of growth we have seen over the last two years. ","That provides some context on how we view our business today. Let me also provide some overall context to 2012. ","We had exceptional growth in 2011, driven by healthy end markets and very solid execution. Our end markets were surprisingly strong in 2011 given the uncertainty in financial markets. As we sit here today, there is more uncertainty in the economy versus last year and as compared to the last time we spoke. We will recognize this and remain alert for signs of a downturn.","While we remain cautious on the economy, we feel positive about our growth prospects for 2012. We expect solid growth however, it will be lower than what we have achieved in 2011 given the uncertainty in the market, cost of comparisons and we no longer have the benefit of pent-up demand from the 2009 downturn. We believe we will continue to grow faster than our underlined markets and continue to capture share.","The investments we are making to achieve this growth centers around sales and marketing in emerging markets. Let me provide some more insights into these two areas. We continue to take our Spinnaker marketing programs to the next level. We are currently on the third evolution of Spinnaker marketing and recently identified a new round of ideas by enhancing sales and marketing excellence.","These best practices includes tools to identify and penetrate the most promising target accounts, strategies to better manage and accelerate project pipelines, processes to manage telesales and increase cross-selling. By sharing ideas, tools and training throughout the organization, I am convinced we are continuing to move our sales from marketing efforts to higher levels of excellence.","At the same time, we're also adding salespeople. A program we refer internally as our field turbo program. We have not added this money front and people in some time. But given the strength of our lead generation efforts and database expansion, we felt that leads per salesperson in some areas, we're getting beyond optimal and believe it is an opportune time to invest for more share gain.","We acknowledge we're making this investment at a time of some market uncertainty, but we're convinced that this can lead to further share gains in our key product categories and targeted segments.","In emerging market, we're also expanding our field personnel, particularly in second-tier cities. In China, for example, we currently have two main locations and 36 regional offices throughout the country. We are now expanding into second-tier cities. These are cities with populations between 5 million and 7 million, so quite large in and of themselves.","We expect to open eight to 10 new branches over the coming years. We have relied more in this region and are now moving to expand our direct presence beyond the traditional coastal markets. We're also expanding our product portfolio for emerging markets, particularly in the area such as product inspection.","We see great potential in this product line as these economies further develop and packaged food becomes more commonplace and concerns about food safety remains. Field Turbo and Spinnaker marketing programs are key driving forces behind these investments in emerging markets.","While China continues to be our largest emerging market, we continue to expand our product lines in Brazil, most recently with our product inspection offering. We're also making direct investments in Turkey, Vietnam and Indonesia given the strong potential in these regions. Our investments in Spinnaker in emerging markets will continue to help us capture share in the near term and further strengthen our franchise.","On the pricing front, we continue to invest in training and support to our sales organization. We have a very analytical approach to our pricing initiatives and want to ensure that our sales force has the right knowledge and tools to articulate it to customers.","It will be another important year for our Blue Ocean program. I'm very pleased with our accomplishments in 2011, particular the go-live in China, given the importance of that organization to us. We are already starting to see the Blue Ocean benefit in China of having more transparency on our supply chain. We're also seeing improved invested capital performance.","In the near-term, our Chinese operations expect further improvement in the inventory management, procurement and pricing by leveraging the improved tool. It is also worth mentioning that Blue Ocean system provides a better platform to enable growth in fast growing markets such as China as compared to our foremost, fragmented, heterogeneous IT environment.","We also continue to put greater focus on the investment and training and management development. Over the last few years, we have expanded our Kaizen activities beyond manufacturing to people-intensive business processes in the organization. In addition to gains in productivity and customer satisfaction, we see significant benefit in the employee engagement. Our employees at all levels of the company want to help make our business stronger, and our Kaizen program gives them the opportunity.","In summary, we're very pleased with our exceptional 2011 results and the strength of our franchise. We believe our competitive position is strong and we can continue to outdistance ourselves from our competition. We have the growth strategy, management team and focus on execution to continue our strong track record. We remain confident in our initiatives and ability to execute, but remain very cautious about the economic environment.","That concludes our prepared remarks, and I would like to ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Paul Knight, CLSA.","Paul Knight - CLSA","Bill, could you go over the margin just a little bit in terms of the impacts that you're seeing on it?","Bill Donnelly","Just to be clear, Paul, I guess you're asking me about gross profit margin?","Paul Knight - CLSA","Well, op margin year-over-year, EBITDA.","Bill Donnelly","So we had some currency headwinds. And if you're just for currency headwinds, they were relatively flat in terms of operating margins. That was something we kind of pointed to a little bit on the last call when we said we expected to have some Blue Ocean excess costs in the quarter we went live in China. And then as well, we also made a few investments in terms of front-end topics in the fourth quarter, especially in emerging markets.","With regard to gross profit margin, we in the quarter had good price increases. I think we mentioned to you guys on a previous call, we started to push through some extra price increases in the middle of the year, so kind of a midyear price increase. So we did have some acceleration. We did get more than 200 bps of price increases during the course of 2011. And that was one of the better items.","We did have some material cost increases, but the impact of that on gross profit margin was less than the benefits that we had of price increases.","In terms of currency, the currency for the full year brought down margins by about 1% and about 25 bps in the quarter.","Paul Knight - CLSA","And then lastly, Olivier, could you highlight some of the industrial products that are key behind this growth we're seeing in that product area?","Olivier Filliol","When we talk about industrial, we have about 30% coming from core industrial and 15% coming from product inspection. Core industrial is skewed towards emerging markets, particularly China. We had tremendous growth in these areas, but we actually also experienced a very solid growth for core industrial in Europe as well as in Americas. So it was a broad-based across all the regions.","In the West, meaning Europe and Americas, we certainly had some pent-up effect that was helping us. But I would say also the end user industries were in a solid stage with good momentum.","When we talk about product inspection here, experienced very good growth, excellent growth also in West. This has been ongoing for quite a while. It's not dependent on that pent-up demand. I think that very solid growth is coming from an excellent market position. We are clearly the leader in terms of market share, in terms of having an excellent sales and service network, having leading products.","And what certainly also plays in product inspection, you still have a good growth in a market that comes from expanded demand and not all product lines are today already equipped with all the necessary product inspection technology. We have also new technologies like x-ray vision inspection that have accelerated growth. So slightly a different drivers for the growth, core industrial 30% of our business and product inspection 15%.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jon Wood from Jefferies.","Jon Wood - Jefferies","So, Olivier, you kind of talked about some sales and marketing headcount additions in your prepared remarks. Can you go into a bit more detail in terms of the magnitude there? And I'm specifically interested geographically and how you're thinking about headcount adds there?","Olivier Filliol","See it's a program that we started last summer. And we did is, we analyzed where we had growth opportunities really across the globe. When we look at business lines, we focused on the business lines with the best profitability. Then, we looked at across the globe, analyze different territories, looked at how many leads we were generating by sales people into different territories and looked at penetration as well.","So it was very targeted. But at the end of the day, most of the additions came into emerging markets and were driven also by the underlying market growth that we see in the countries like Brazil, India, China also Eastern Europe, were all good examples where we added people.","When it comes to the West, we added also people, but then it was very targeted to business lines where we have very good growth momentum and good profitability, for example, Process Analytics, Product Inspection. But also for example, analytical instruments like titration, where we felt we could gain extra market share by having additional field people.","Bill Donnelly","A lot of figures we added in the course of last year, we added about 800 people, more than 500 were in emerging markets, and about 400 of the 500 were in China. And as Olivier said, the western adds were very technical in nature, key product categories, some IT guys because of Blue Ocean and some R&D guys in a couple of critical areas.","Jon Wood - Jefferies","And then, Bill, when I look at the local currency incremental margins, this quarter they looked to be about 20% or so. How much was kind of extraneous in Blue Ocean and you mentioned front-end investments, I'm not sure of what that means, but I'd love some color on that?","Bill Donnelly","In terms of Blue Ocean related topics, if we kind of pulled out so, we have extra people in back-office areas and things like that. And most of those people are actually or for many of those people are being pulled out even by the time you see our first quarter numbers. But the impact of what's I think you'd push too, high 20%s, almost 30% just for Blue Ocean.","And then some of the front-end people that, Olivier, is talking about that we added is sales guys, it usually takes about four quarters for them to get productive. And I guess maybe putting that additional amount and you're talking a number of incremental margins in local or on a constant currency basis somewhere in the low to mid-30s I guess.","Jon Wood - Jefferies","Did you guys give the China growth, if not would you? And also talk about if you're expectation there for 2012 has changed at all?","Bill Donnelly","I maybe start with that, our expectations have not changed. We grew by 20% in the fourth quarter. That was the most modest growth of 2011, kind of as we had guided you guys too. We do expect the overall growth rate for emerging markets to be, let's call it low double-digit, kind of rate somewhere between 10% and 15% with maybe China being a little higher than the group on average. We're guessing in particular, the Eastern European guys are probably going to have more modest growth next year, because we expect lower growth in Europe as well and that will be impacted by that.","Olivier Filliol","And, Jon, we are trying to wrap out eight quarters in a row, where we had growth of more than 20%. You have heard me saying that, now for quite a while as I say, we do not expect that we can just maintain these kind of growth rates. Also for the last quarter, I did not expect that China would again reach this kind of growth rate. We're very, very happy about that result. But ultimately, China will deliver more kind of mid-teens growth and we have just exception circumstances.","And I would also say that the GDP forecast for China a little bit more modest than what the actual results was for 2011. So I think they are different reasons why the forecast that, Bill, was just sharing before reflects really our thinking of today.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Groberg from Macquarie Capital.","John Groberg - Macquarie Capital","On the free cash flow, I know you went through it in some detail, but obviously one of the weaker conversions here than you've had. Can you maybe just talk a bit more detail, again, about exactly what happened there and what you would expect from that a conversion standpoint in 2012?","Bill Donnelly","So we would expect free cash flow for 2012 to be in the range of, let's say at the low-end probably 225 and maybe if things went a little better than expected, it could reach close to 250. But I think that that's kind of the range, as you know sometimes timing on cash flow can be a little bit more fluctuating than let's say earnings frankly.","Now in terms of the conversion rate, I think our conversion rate as we look at it was like 78%. I think if I kind of lookout over the next couple of years, I think our conversion rate will improve from that level. I think that in 2011, we certainly continued to invest in inventory in an effort to reduce risk associated with Blue Ocean, Go Live, to give you a feeling over the last, I don't know, 18 months or so about 50% of our manufacturing now maybe even 60% is up on Blue Ocean.","And you guys have heard of many companies that have struggled with SAP or similar Oracle implementations. And one of our things was Mettler does, we have sticky customers and we are reluctant to give any excuse for them to try other people's products. And we felt that that was a prudent investment. And in the details within what I can see in the fourth quarter, I can see already, for example, our inventory levels in China starting to reduce. So I think the working capital impacts that we saw in 2011 will certainly improve in terms of 2012.","Now, with our investments in Blue Ocean, we certainly are going to have more CapEx than amortization and depreciation for the next couple of years. I think that's just the nature of the build-up of that program. We are certainly doing it, because we believe we can extract value from this investment. But the nature of these type of project is maybe the payback a little bit slower. So at some point we're going to cross over the hill and our conversion rate should move north of a 100. But to be honest we have at least three more years to get the project up to that level of completion, where we can expect that.","In terms of maybe the last topic would be tax rates. We've provided guidance here based on 24.5% tax rate. I think that that could be a tax rate now for the next few years. Our cash tax rate should be in the area of let's say 20% or so over that medium term, maybe slightly up or slightly down depending on the year. But that's what I would estimate as the mid-term one. So conversion rates will improve, but I think the only thing maybe that won't be as good is this ratio of CapEx to depreciation and amortization.","John Groberg - Macquarie Capital","And just following up on that. It seems like your buybacks are a little bit lower in the fourth quarter now as well. Was any of it tied to just some of the investment that was going there from a cash standpoint or any other reasons why the buyback's full?","Bill Donnelly","We target our free cash flow plus action proceeds. You're correct, John, that we had a little bit less. I think that that was kind of we're truing up a little bit and frankly we took down inventory faster in the fourth quarter than I had projected. And so you can assume that we're buying toward that free cash flow level plus the action proceeds for 2012.","John Groberg - Macquarie Capital","Olivier, if I can, just one last one. Would you mind kind of talking one of the things that continues to mystify a lot of people, given everything that we hear out of Europe? Is the business there still seems to be doing pretty well? and maybe just talk about some of the different geographies and what you're seeing in Europe currently over the last couple of months?","Olivier Filliol","When you were reading the newspapers in last two, three quarters, you definitely could get depressed. And repeatedly I was mentioning on these calls that we didn't see this in our numbers. And our Q4 was definitely a lot of such example, where we had very good results.","Nevertheless, I don't want to pretend that we're immune to what's going there. I ultimately think that we got to see lower growth rates, this is certainly also reflected in our guidance that we expect of about a low single-digit growth out of Europe. And what's also important to say, Europe represents about 37% of our revenue.","But if I look at the weakest countries like Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece, these countries together represent only about 5% of our sales. And that certainly is one of the reasons, why our growth rates have been still reasonable last year, and why I'm not that concerned for this year. But I'm certainly going to expect that Americas will do better than Europe for us.","Bill Donnelly","And maybe one other interesting thing that you might see, I was just looking at our kind of forecast by country for Q1. And as Olivier mentioned, we're looking at kind of flat low single-digit growth in Europe is built into our guidance. And it's tough to see really much of a pattern, on one hand Spain looks like it will do okay in the first quarter, while Italy looks relatively weaker. Germany versus Austria there's not necessarily, I think on average we're going to have certainly less growth in Europe in the first part of 2012 than what we saw here in the fourth quarter. But it's tough to pick a pattern as it relates to maybe this famous PIIGS countries versus Northern Europe at this stage.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tycho Peterson, JPMorgan.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Just wondering relative to kind of your commentary coming out of the third quarter where you saw the biggest delta in the fourth quarter relative to your own expectations. Was it all Asia and industrial or were there other pockets of strength that you had really anticipated?","Olivier Filliol","I think we were positively surprised across the globe. And I would say we were mostly positively surprised about the December results. When we entered the quarter, we had seen that October was actually strong. We felt good about November. But December, we were kind of nervous, because we knew that in the previous year we had an exceptional results.","We had a lot of budget flush benefit and we were not so sure how this would turn out in Q4 this year. So that was actually the positive surprise. It was more the months than the businesses, again all of regions actually outperformed and I would say all businesses more or less outperformed our expectations.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","And then you were talking at third quarter about the replacement cycle in the U.S. and Europe. I mean does that still have legs, you're still seeing that pickup?","Olivier Filliol","I would phrase it may be differently. I think what we were talking about was that we saw some pent-up demand, particular at the beginning of the year. We still benefited from that. The recycle business seems to be quite stable one.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","And then as we think about Blue Ocean, I mean you've gone live in China now. I mean how do we think about starting to see some of the benefits, I mean you mentioned inventory management procurement pricing, do we start to see some of these benefits to be captured in the first half of the year?","Olivier Filliol","I think in the details, we get to see some in a place like China. The hard part for you guys is of course we're still in the half-fragment stage of the project with Go Live cost in our U.S. operations and then in '13 in our German operations. Those are the two final really big roll-ins we have. After that, it goes into smaller countries with probably less upfront cost on them, and I think then you'll start to see.","So we would point already to some benefits in certain areas that we started to see here in the fourth quarter. And we definitely expect some in our existing operations in Switzerland and China in 2012, but probably from at the level you guys see the numbers will see some masking, because of the startup cost in the U.S. and Germany.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","And then just lastly on the cost piece. I mean you've talked about kind of trying to move more cost out of Switzerland. Can you just remind us how you are thinking about that process over the next couple of years and where you hope to be eventually?","Bill Donnelly","As mentioned we want to look at the Swiss franc has become an expensive currency over the last couple of years. We're looking at in terms of our supplier base, many of our lab suppliers are Swiss bank based we're moving over the next couple of years away from some of them and trying to reduce that cost. And that could be over a several year period, lets say $3 to $5 million in terms of savings.","There are certain functions that we think we can do more cost effectively outside that, hit some of the lower value functions that we performed and that one we could get maybe again $3 million to $5 million probably this year in that area and more that that over the medium term.","I think the point there is we want to be depending on how the growth environment evolves. Anytime you have those transition costs I think or transition activities, there are some operation risk associated with it. We're careful and how we're dealing with that particularly if volumes continue to be at the levels that we've seen recently. We expect them to moderate, so that we will be able to implement over the original plan and if things got worse we could accelerate some of those as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the Isaac Ro, Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs","On the business specific, I wondered if you could comment on the pipette business this quarter, how do you feel about the performance there and than maybe if we look at the full year. Would you care to sort of offer some growth kind of ballpark on how products inspection did for the year?","Bill Donnelly","In terms of our products inspection business, we grew organically that business in the mid-teens and as mentioned we are quite happy with that. The growth rate was a little bit less in the quarter, as comp started to get up. But that's a business now that's put up in '10 and '11 mid-teens type of growth rates. So we're quite pleased with that organically.","On top of that we've made some good growth from acquisitions. In terms of the pipette business, I'm happy to report that we did. And this is something that we had expected and told you guys about, we did see the best growth of the year here in the fourth quarter. I wish some of that had been maybe in our U.S. franchise, but I think as expected with NIH funding, government spending that was not as good a growth as we'd like to see in the U.S. But we did have a modest growth for the full year and almost, but just short of mid-single digits in terms of the fourth quarter growth for pipette.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs","And then for India, I know you guys have had some changes in management there recently. Maybe you'd update on the performance there and what's in your key goals out for 2012 in that region?","Olivier Filliol","We had some changes in management early last year and we have the new team complete. I'm very happy how that is evolving. Actually, the person is or the General Manager that we have is very much focused on building up a long-term oriented franchise. Great work on people development and working on customer satisfaction, and building up the regions, going very, very well.","In terms of results, we have very good results in India. I think some of the stuff that we're investing and focusing on will take more time to fully materialize.","Bill Donnelly","India grew for us more than 20%, between 20% and 25% for the full year. A little bit less than the fourth quarter and again kind of reflecting the global economic cycle but we're happy with the growth rates there overall. And that's now a couple of years in a row of this mid-20s kind of growth rates. And so that's where we're quite pleased.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman, Robert W. Baird.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird","Olivier, could you just mention again from a pricing perspective, what you're expecting for '12, we stay at kind of 2 point of price capture?","Olivier Filliol","Let's quickly talk about 2011. We had 2011 the normal annual price increase and then we did a second one mid-year. And of course, the mid-year price increase will also benefit us into 2012. And then we execute more normalized January price increase that in the order of magnitude we had in previous year.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird","So we'll still benefit from the mid-year '11 and then we bump prices a little bit here again in January '12. And does that result in maybe 1 point of price capture or 2 point potentially for '12?","Bill Donnelly","We'd like to get the 2 by the end of the year. I think that that just put that up again on top of this what might be a bit of stress target, but we certainly will get more than 150.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird","And then, I just want to circle back for a second, given what we've seen with the China PMI kind of hovering at least above 50, and certainly what we've seen out of Eurozone is dropping well below 50. All of that really has occurred kind of late in the year, fourth quarterish of '11. And so when I look at those PMIs and I look at the industrial business, I would think your industrial business would lag that would be typical.","And so as you gave kind of LC growth guidance for '12, you kind of picked up the low-end, just a point, I mean this is kind of marginal. But are there any expectations within the three major geographies that have moved around? You referenced Europe plus low single-digits, is that down? And Asia\/Rest of World up a little bit to offset or are we kind of waiting and seeing what occurs here?","Bill Donnelly","Yes, and maybe give you a couple of numbers. So of course we gave guidance as you've correctly said in November last year. And it's interesting I happen to have global PMI numbers in front of me. And if I look at the U.S., the U.S. has gone from in November 52.7% to 53.9% and then 54.1%, now is the January number.","China has gone from 49% in November to 50.3% in the December to 50.5% in January. Even the Eurozone went from 46.4% to 46.9% to 48.8%. So I think that the positive comment would be maybe PMI in the last few months started to do a little bit better. And as we mentioned here, we think that certainly we ourselves track manufacturing GDP and therefore PMI tends to be a good indicator from it.","At the same time, Rich, we're on the same page that the business is not immune to economic downturns. We do tend to be a little late cycled. If I compare our guidance right now, we probably feel a little worst about Europe and maybe a little bit better about the rest of the world.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird","And then I just had question on the Product Inspection business, given the gains you've seen there, that's the one business where it's probably easy as to at least identify maybe an extension of the product line inorganically at least x-ray, but also on the vision side. And when you see business coming in the door today, are you seeing a benefit competitively from being able to deliver a seamless system. And everything from the check weighing all the way through to vision, and if so, are you seeing your order size there improve, because of that?","Bill Donnelly","Clearly a value to our customer base to have the combination of the different technologies and it is of a value to the customer from different angles. It can be user interface, it can be seamless integration of the material handling part. But I would say even most of more important it's probably the sales relationship and marketing topic and having a trusted partner over the long term. It's not so often that the customer is buying all the technologies at the same time.","So that's actually the reason why I would not pretend that the average transaction value is going up in a very significant way just because we're having the technology. But the synergy is still very much here. And we clearly benefit from a competitor standpoint to have all these different technologies.","Now I want also mainly to stress the point here that there are limits to how many new technologies we would add to this portfolio. And we feel that with the addition of vision inspection, we have now one that we added at the right time. It's an emerging technology, but it's also maturing in terms of the applications that we have in the market. And it's not that we are eager to add that many new additional technologies to the franchise in the coming years.","Bill Donnelly","And one other thing I might to add to what Olivier has said is that this is a service-intensive business. These gangs don't want their lines down and need their inspection technology up and running. And a big benefit to our customers is we have huge advantages in particularly Western markets about the number of service technicians, the density of our service technicians. And therefore, they're trying to service as compared to competition, especially if you talk broadly.","Of course it's possible for competitors to locate the service technician in highly dense areas. But if you think about the food industry, which is a large part of product inspection, as you know, Rick, it's relatively well spread out and we have a little advantage there by just having so much of this larger business that we can get service technicians there much closer, and our service technicians know the products quite well too.","Operator","Your next question comes from Derik de Bruin from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","It's been about a year since they put the Food Safety Modernization Act into play. People were certainly expecting to see a little bit of a boost to companies that sell into the food inspection market. And here we are a year into it, have you actually seen any tailwinds that you're going to actually attribute to this new legislation?","Olivier Filliol","We have an indirect benefit. What's important is the legislation does not specify that our type of instruments needs to be used, but the legislation defines or makes it even more costly if a producer needs to do a product recall. And so there is an increased awareness for the benefits of doing end offline packaging controls, and that benefit we clearly see.","That's one of the reasons why the underlying market dynamics front products inspection remains very favorable. And I would not just reduce our focused at on the U.S. markets. We are clearly seeing also that this regulation and this awareness for food inspection is a global phenomena.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","And I love the fact that you referred to 20% growth is moderating in China. Forgive me this has been asked, but I guess what's your target for the percentage of sales that you're going to be manufacturing in emerging market locations? Do you have that where this currently we are targeted like that? I guess what's the implied cost savings given that, I think in the old days you said, you got maybe a 35% savings if you move something from Switzerland to emerging markets. And clearly there has been wage inflation. So I guess you told about, what's your incremental is in terms of seeing moving additional product to emerging market lower cost manufacturing area?","Olivier Filliol","Yes. So I think there are two numbers of relevance here. The first one is how much we produce in particular in our case its China. Today, it's 37% of our worldwide product sales that we produce in China. And the second number that is of relevance is how much of our sourcing is done in local country. This is today roughly 40%. And I definitely expect both numbers to go up. Now the first number will go up, because we continue to increase our sales in emerging markets. And when we sell to emerging markets, more of the products are sourced from China than what is, it's the case in the Western market.","But just from that fact, this percentage will go up. And we do still have product transfers to China. But we're talking at, we'd say a little bit less and big numbers then we had in the past. We have one that is still taking effect that is in the product inspection area, where we have a product transfer going on. But it's again less than what we had seen in the past.","Where I am getting to is, I expect that at year we have maybe few points where that's going to go up. When it comes to the sourcing then I would say 2012 should experience again step-up. We talked about Switzerland, where we are trying to find a more supply as outside of the Swiss franc. And a part of that is going to go to low cost countries.","Bill Donnelly","And maybe to add one thing. We probably would say the next few years the bigger impact is we think we can get even more productive than in China. And I would put that two and three years. We were running eight different factory ERP systems in China until we went on to Blue Ocean. Now we're on a single platform. It's allowed us to consolidate our supply chain activities and areas like procurement. And we're a lot more focused on lean topics in China.","So we really think our Chinese operations over the next couple of years are going to make a big step forward in the productivity level. A few of you have visited our Chinese plants, they are not the typical Chinese plants. They were already quite modern in that sense. But we think we can make another breakthrough there in terms of productivity levels. And that might be a bigger impact than what we do in terms of transfer over the next couple of years.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Arias from UBS.","Dan Arias - UBS","Just two quick ones. Bill or Olivier following up on the question on pipettes, back in August you talked about improving the position of the reigning business outside the U.S. I guess where your share isn't this high as it is in U.S. Is that something that you think could impact the growth rate of the lab business in the near term?","Bill Donnelly","It's certainly not a negative. I'm not sure if that basis is big enough to move the needle in a meaningful way. It just to give you a feeling certainly our growth rates in pipette business was better outside the United States and it was inside the United States. And we would expect that to continue, but in terms of moving the needle for the whole lab businesses that won't be meaningful.","Dan Arias - UBS","And then just quickly on M&A. At this point how are you viewing the role of inorganic growth in '12 and are you seeing any assets at this point that are interesting for you guys?","Bill Donnelly","It's going to be very similar to what you have seen us doing in the last two, three years. We continued to be very focused on Bolton acquisitions where we have good synergies and where it's close to our core business. We have systematic screening approach. We have always on our radar a couple of dozens companies that we are observing. And we always hope one or the other becomes available. And we stay very disciplined about what we're going to offer for the opportunities. And yes, I think the pipeline looks similar as it did in the last two, three years. And let's hope that one or the other will material us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the Sung Ji Nam from Cantor Fitzgerald.","Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald","I just had one question. As for the lab business particularly in the emerging markets, I think you had previously talked about potentially the lab business really driving the growth there at longer term, given that in the emerging market especially in China lab business is weighted towards the industrial side of things. Do you expect any of that to play out in the near-term? And particularly given that you're expanding into some of the second tier cities in China as well?","Olivier Filliol","The strategy, it's still very valid and I do expect that this is going to happen. What we had last year, we had such a good growth in our industrial business that the mix didn't change towards a lot. But that was really because the industrial business did exceptionally well. But ultimately the fundamental drivers are more favorable for our lab business. The number of scientists for example joining the workforce is one of this macro trends that is very, very favorable for us. And I do expect that the lab business will ultimately outperformed industrial business, but of course when we have big opportunities like last year to enjoy this great growth in industrial wins we take it.","Bill Donnelly","We certainly saw this in 2011 that the lab business grew faster than the core industrial business and the other one we often talked about in the long-term growth prospects is our product inspection business in emerging markets. And that also had a faster growth rate than the core industrial business in that part of the world, again off a small base like last but the pattern that you described at the beginning of your question, I think we expect to carry forward.","Operator","Your last question comes from Greg Halter from Great Lakes Review.","Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review","I wonder if you could breakout your business between products and then service parts as a percentage of sales and what they each may have been up either for the quarter or for the year.","Bill Donnelly","Our product business and service business, you can imagine when we have a little bit outsized growth, Greg, that usually need that their product business is growing faster. So for the full year our product business grew mid-teen while our service business grew more mid single-digits. In the fourth quarter, the growth rate for service was stable with what we saw in the first three quarters of years. So that's mid-single digit kind of growth rate. And the product business grew more like 9%.","In terms of organic versus total, I would just knowing the businesses that are on the acquisition by the various products focus to. So probably the delta is even a little stronger. It would takeaway most of the acquisition impact from the product businesses.","Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review","And the service parts, is that still about a third of the total?","Bill Donnelly","Service and consumables, because the product grew so fast, they're 27% of the total. I think that's down from like 29% last year.","Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review","You spoke about India a little earlier with the growth there. If you could do the same with Brazil and maybe you give a range of the size of each of those businesses for Mettler-Toledo.","Bill Donnelly","Okay. So Brazil and India, I think they're both about $40 million.","Olivier Filliol","Yes, they're kind of in the 2% range of our total revenue.","Bill Donnelly","And in terms of the growth rate for Brazil, Brazil grew north of 20% for the year for us.","Olivier Filliol","We talked about India also being 20-plus. So actually both countries are about 20-plus, both countries about the same order of magnitude in terms of size. I think the difference that we have is in India we have the full product portfolio and we have a very good network of regional offices.","When it comes to Brazil, we started with a strong nucleus a couple of years ago in purchase analytics and then added different product lines over the years. One of the last product lines that we added to Brazil actually last year was product inspection. In the previous year, we added the RAININ business.","So it has some expansion activities in Brazil that is different to India, but again, very good growth momentum, strong teams in both countries and I'm actually really happy also with kind of the sizes that they are and the good base to grow further.","Bill Donnelly","So India is a little more than 40 and Brazil is a little less than 40.","Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review","Your capital spending was up about $25 million. Obviously, Blue Ocean had an impact there. Two things: wondering, number one, how much Blue Ocean was of the total; and then also how much FX may have impacted that CapEx number?","Bill Donnelly","The full year impact on CapEx I think is $10 million, $12 million. And the impact of let's call it in a typical year for us IT spend usually represents about 50% of the total. That's not just Blue Ocean, but total IT spend.","Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review","What are your expectations for 2012 given your currency comments as well in terms of spending?","Bill Donnelly","In terms of CapEx spending, it'll be a little less than what we spent in 2011 at today's exchange rates.","Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review","So like $95 million area?","Bill Donnelly","Yes, it looks like between $90 million and $95 million.","Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review","How many shares that you repurchased in the quarter are maybe for the full year?","Bill Donnelly","For the full year, we repurchased $1.285 million.","Operator","There are no further questions. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters.","Mary Finnegan","Thanks everyone for joining us tonight. As always, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to give us a call.

Please proceed, ma'am.","Mary Finnegan","Thanks, Alan, and good evening everyone. I am Mary Finnegan, I am the Treasurer and responsible for Investor Relations at Mettler-Toledo, and I\u2019m happy to welcome you to the call. I am joined here today by Olivier Filliol, our CEO; and Bill Donnelly, our Chief Financial Officer.","I want to cover just a couple of administrative matters. This call is being webcast and is available for replay on our website at www.mt.com.

I will start with a summary of the quarter and then Bill will provide details on our financial results and our updated guidance for 2013. I will then update you on our execution focus in this challenging macro environment. As always, we will have time for Q&A at the end. The highlights for the quarter are on page two of the presentation. Local currency sales increased 2% in the quarter, similar to what we experienced in the third quarter, we had solid growth in Americas and Asia, rest of the world with a sales decline in Europe.","Our earnings benefited from pro-active cost measures. Specifically, our actions in pricing and cost control benefitted margin and drove a strong 20% increase in adjusted EPS in the quarter. I am pleased with our execution in the quarter and the continued progress on our strategic initiatives. Uncertainty remains in the global economy today and we expect conditions to remain challenging in the first half of this year. However, with the benefit of the cost control actions and our margin initiative, we expect to have solid EPS growth in 2013.","Let me now turn it to Bill who will provide an update on our guidance for 2013, as well as cover the financial results.","William Donnelly","Thank, Olivier, and hello everybody. Let me start with additional details and sales which were $657.3 million in the quarter, an increase of 2% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased by 1% in the quarter which included a negative 1% impact due to currencies. Turning to page three of the presentation, we outlined sales by geography. In the quarter, local currency sales increased by 5% in the Americas and 6% in Asia\/Rest of the world, while sales declined by 4% in Europe.","On the next slide, you will see that for the full year 2012, sales increased by 4% in local currency. Breaking that down by region for the full year, sales increased by 5% in the Americas and 10% in Asia\/Rest of the world, sales declined by 2% in Europe. Acquisitions contributed approximately 2% to European sales growth for the full year and approximately 1% to total sales as well.","On slide number five of the presentation, we outlined our sales by product area. In the fourth quarter, lab sales increased by 4% and industrial sales increased by 1%, while food retailing was down 1%. The next slide provides full year sales by product area. In 2012, laboratory sales increased 5%, industrial sales increased by 4%, and food retailing declined by 4%. The acquisitions contributed approximately 1% to industrial sales growth for the year.","I am now turning to slide number seven of the presentation where we show our P&L. Let me walk you through the key items. We are very pleased with our gross margins which were 54.3% in the quarter, a 90 basis point increase over the prior year. We benefited from pricing and lower material costs. These benefits were offset somewhat by a negative mix, both geographic and by product. While mix was slightly negative overall, it was better than the mix we saw in the first half of this year. R&D amounted to $28 million, a decrease of 6% in local currency. SG&A amounted to $175.4 million, a 4% decrease in local currency as compared to the prior year quarter.","Lower variable compensation was the principal driver which accounted for approximately a 6% decline in SG&A as compared to the prior year quarter. We also benefitted from our cost measures implemented earlier in the year. Partially offsetting the decline in expenses were additional investments made in emerging markets as well our field turbo program which we spoke about earlier in the year. Adjusted operating income amounted to $153.4 million, which represents 17% increase over the prior year amount of $131.7 million. Our operating margins reached 23.3%, a 300 basis point increase over the prior year level.","Given the environment we are very pleased with our operating income growth and margin improvement. A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization was $5.6 million in the quarter. Interest expense was $5.7 million. We lowered our annual effective tax rate for discrete items to 24% for the quarter and for the full year. This is comparable to the 24% effective tax rate we had in Q4 of 2011 and the full year 2011. However, it was below our guidance of 24.5% and the rate we used or recognized during the first three quarters of the year.","Fully diluted shares for the quarter were $31.3 million. Adjusted earnings per share was $3.47, a 20% increase over the prior year reported amount of $2.88 per share. We are very pleased with this strong earnings growth, particularly given the modest sales growth. On a reported basis, earnings per share was $3.35 per share, as compared to $2.91 in the prior year. Reported earnings per share included pre-tax restructuring charges of $5.4 million or $0.13 per share. Reported EPS also includes $0.03 of purchase intangible amortization, and a $0.04 benefit from the catch-up of the reduced tax rate for the first three quarters of the year.","The next slide summarizes our full year P&L. As I mentioned, local currency sales increased by 4% for the year. Our gross margins reached 53% while our operating margins increased 170 basis points to 19%. Adjusted earnings per share was $9.67 per share, a 16% increase over the prior year amount of $8.36 per share. Given the challenging operating environment we encountered during 2012, we are very pleased with these results.","Now let me turn to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter amounted to $93.7 million as compared to $77.9 million in the prior year. On a per share basis, this is an increase of 25%. Our DSO was 43 days while our ITO was 4.9 times on an LTM basis. In particular we are pleased with this improvement in our inventory turns. For the year, free cash flow was $254.5 million or $8 per share which is a 29% increase over the prior year.","During the quarter we repurchased 396,500 shares for a total amount of -- for a total dollar value of $70.8 million. For the full year 2012, we repurchased 1.6 million shares for a total dollar amount of $278.7 million. We remain on track with regard to our cost control measures that we announced in the second quarter. As a reminder those measures include the transfer of certain functions to lower cost countries, workforce reductions and rationalizations of certain operations. We expect total restructuring charges to reach the $20 million to $25 million range, and it is primarily made up of severance costs.","In 2012, we incurred $16.7 million of restructuring charges. We remain comfortable with our target to reduce operating costs by approximately $40 million annually when the program is completed. However because some of these initiatives will take time to complete we will not get the full benefits until the end of the next year. The economic environment is playing out pretty much how we anticipated when we spoke during our third quarter call. We continue to believe that the first half of this year will be challenging with sales growth below normal levels. As we look to the second half with the benefits of improving economic conditions, if in most if not all regions, as well as easier comparisons we would expect to show better sales growth levels.","We recognize that economic data released since our last call has been relatively positive. The PMI numbers from China are just one example. We are not surprised with this improving data and we believe that we will eventually benefit from it. However, our business does tend to be late cycle and therefore we will likely see better results in the second half of this year. Given this all as a backdrop, let me cover the specifics of our guidance. We now expect full year local currency sales growth to be in the range of 1% to 3%. We have slightly lowered the top end of our previous range which had assumed previously a growth of 1% to 4%.","This is principally driven by how we see the first quarter coming out, which I will cover in a moment. For the full year 2013, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $10.30 to $10.55. This compares to previous guidance of $10.00 to $10.30. For the first quarter, we would expect constant currency sales growth to be in line with the prior year. I realize that this is lower than we achieved in Q4. However, the guidance reflects the late cycle and short cycle nature of our business. Perhaps most importantly, the guidance reflects the fact that we began this year with a lower level of backlog than last year.","Many of you will remember that when we commented on the first quarter of last year, we said that sales growth was greater than order growth. I expect the opposite in Q1 this year. Sales in constant currency will likely be flat but I expect order growth -- orders will grow modestly. Given the sales assumption, we would expect adjusted earnings per share to be between $1.75 and $1.80 during the first quarter. A couple of comments to cover -- a couple of additional points to cover with regard to the guidance.","First currencies. We would expect currencies to reduce sales growth by approximately 1% in the quarter. For the rest of the year we would expect no impact in Q2, a slight positive impact in Q3 and a slight negative impact in Q4. For the full year, we do not expect currencies to impact sales growth overall. Now looking at the impact of currencies on operating profit, we are facing as of today a little headwind for the full year. In terms of the Swiss Franc\/euro, we are relatively neutral given the hedges we have put in place. As a reminder we have hedged approximately 75% of our $100 million Swiss Franc to euro exposure. However, we are getting a little hurt with the Japanese Yen and Swiss Franc versus the dollar.","In total, currencies will reduce earnings per share growth by about 1% for the full year. This is based on current exchange rates. A couple of additional points. We have assumed an effective tax rate of 24% for 2013 and that all free cash flow will be used for share repurchases. One last comment, some of you have said that it\u2019s difficult for you to judge how earnings per share growth will be by quarter this year. Specifically, you wanted to know how will the stronger sales growth in the second half of this year versus the first half, interplay with the timing of our cost measures, the impact of higher incentive comp and various other factors.","It\u2019s also difficult for us to forecast precisely by quarter but our expectation is that earnings per share growth during the period from Q2 through Q4, will likely be in the 8% range, that being the mid-point of our full year guidance. So while sales will be back-loaded in the year, I think EPS growth will be relatively consistent throughout. We will provide of course more specific guidance in upcoming calls but I thought these general thoughts may be helpful to you, as I know many of you will be updating your models.","Okay. That covers my comments on guidance and I want to now turn it back to Olivier.","Olivier Filliol","Thank you, Bill. Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab grew 4% in the quarter with good growth in balances, analytical instruments and strong growth in process analytics. Pipettes also had growth while automated chemistry was down. For the year, lab sales were up 5% and I continue to feel good about our market position. Industrial was up 1% in the quarter with product inspection up low single digit and core industrial flat with prior year.","Core industrial was down in Europe and the Americas and up modestly in Asia and Rest of the world. Product inspection is very well in Asia and Rest of the world and have growth in the Americas but was down in Europe. I also point out that industrial had strong comparison from the prior year. As expected, retail was down in the quarter with strong project activity in the United States offset by declines in Europe and Asia\/Rest of the world.","Now, looking at geographies. Europe was down 4% in the quarter, a little better than we expected the last time we spoke. Retail was down double-digit with modest declines in lab and industrial. Americas was up 5% in the quarter, a little better than expected, driven by strong project activity in retail. We have good growth in the lab and industrial was up slightly in the Americas in the quarter. Finally, Asia and rest of the world was up 6% in the quarter pretty much on track with what we expected. Lab had double-digit growth while industrial had mid-single digit growth and retail was down. That covers my comments on the business.","Although market conditions are challenging, we believe we can continue to grow faster than our underlying markets. Execution is key to achieving continued share gains. Let me provide some examples of our focus areas for 2013. Our sales and marketing programs reflect the continuous improvement mentality of our Spinnaker philosophy. Through this, we are able to move sales and marketing to higher levels of excellence. As you saw in 2012, we have shown our ability that our programs through a more challenging macro environment and ensure that our front-end resources are directed to best opportunities in the markets. As we move into our fourth wade of Spinnaker marketing initiative, we expect to continue to innovate and expand our sales and marketing efforts. Service tends to do better in terms of economic weakness and have the additional behind of keeping us in close contact with our customers, especially in regulated environment such as food and pharma.","In 2013, in conjunction with our Blue Ocean program we will continue to globalize our service business, which will further our efforts to increase service productivity and efficiency. We are also focused on increasing the sales of services at the point of instrument sales. For example, providing standardized \u2018service\u2019 with \u2018product\u2019 and continuing our efforts to globalize our service offering are important to increase the service attachment rate.","Launching innovative new product is critical to expanding our market leadership. Important as well are the integrated marketing campaigns for product launches. We have a strong product pipeline including an enhanced offering for basic weighing in laboratory, new entry level type (weights), robust solutions for industrial hazardous applications and a new platform for x-ray, to name just a few. We believe these products will allow us to continue to gain share.","2012, marked our 25th year of manufacturing operations in China. We have an excellent market position in China as well as our other emerging market countries. We consider this leading position a competitive advantage given the growth expectations for these markets in the years to come. We will continue to extend our presence in China as well as we move into more second tier cities. Our emerging markets presence is much broader than just China. We will continue to grow our presence in these other emerging markets as well.","As you heard from Bill, we made great improvements in our margins in the fourth quarter. We believe we have additional levers to pull to continue our strong track record. Pricing is one lever, and execution is key to our accomplishments in this area. While our price increase for 2013 will be lower than 2012, it will still be an important contributor to margins. Supply chain initiatives surrounding low cost country sourcing, supplier consolidation, and various product de-proliferation efforts will also be important contributors in 2013. Our margin initiatives also include an increasing number of lean initiatives to improve productivity and manufacturing and other processes.","Finally, we believe that our Blue Ocean program will provide the foundation for further margin improvements at Mettler-Toledo. We have begun to see initial benefits in our Chinese and Swiss operations in terms of more transparency and integration in our supply chain, an improvement in inventory turnover and benefits in other areas. While we won't gain full benefits of our Blue Ocean program until more worldwide operations have completed implementation, we are pleased with the progress to date.","In 2013 we are very focused operational initiative and will continue to make significant investment for the long-term. We continue to make important investments in employee training and leadership development, product development and front-end resources in emerging markets. We will also achieve another milestone with our Blue Ocean program as the majority of our operations in U.S. will go live in the first half of the year.","In summary, our markets are challenging but we believe we can continue to execute well. Our cost structure is in good shape today but we will continue to closely monitor the environment for signs of further slowing. We expect business conditions in China and our other emerging markets to improve later in the year. The west is primarily a replacement business. We know a customer can defer but ultimately they will need to replace their instruments. It is important that we stay in front of them so we have the opportunity when they do purchase. While we are concerned with the global environment, we feel good about our market position and ability to execute our strategic initiatives. We believe we grow faster than our underlying market and continue to gain share. We also believe we are making the necessary strategic investment for our long-term growth.","That concludes my prepared remarks and I want to ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your line is open for you now.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Maybe just the first question on the guidance adjustment. Bill, I understand your comment on the first quarter about sales being flat but orders growing a little bit modestly. Just talk about how much of that varies by geography? Is this kind of an assumption that Europe is going to get a little bit worse in the first quarter here?","William Donnelly","Actually, I think it's probably as much China as anything. The reduced backlog we have is almost completely attributable to Chinese industrial. And if you kind of go back to our Q1 call a year ago, we talked about that impact that that had in terms of last year's Q1 sales being a little bit more than orders. We would expect to have actually half way decent order growth -- better order growth in China, but relatively flat sales growth. Let's say mid-single digit, low to mid-single digit order growth in China but sales growth to be flat and we will end up with more backlog than we had before.","So, I think we kind of feel that China is for us pretty much bottoming out. We'll see what happens more broadly economically, but with our late cycle industrial stuff we now see in terms of lead generation and other topics that things are already going better. Some of the things that you guys see in external economic factors we start to see internally in the business, but it won't necessarily translate to sales growth we think, until the second quarter.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","And then maybe just rounding out the geographic commentary. U.S. trends, some of your peers have baked in sequestration assumptions. Can you just talk about what you're assuming in the U.S. market here for the year?","William Donnelly","In terms of the first, our business in total is maybe not as exposed as some of the peer group companies in terms of that topic. The exception would be our pipette business and we would expect to have modest growth in our non-government funded related pipette business pretty much offsetting what we see in the rest. And we're not looking at double-digit decline but modest declines in some of the academia and government funded areas.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Wood from Jefferies. Your line is open for you now.","Jon Wood - Jefferies","So, Olivier or Bill, could you call out the China numbers in the quarter. And Bill from your last comment, it just sounds like what's changed is China inflects a little bit later in 2013 than you might have thought last quarter, do you still expect double-digit growth in the second half of '13 in China?","Olivier Filliol","So, let's quickly go and look at the China number in the quarter. So, China grew 3%. This was a little lower than what we expected when we spoke last time. Lab continued to do well with double digit growth, while industrial growth was low single-digit, and retail was down. We do expect that Q1 will be in a similar situation and maybe even a little bit worse and then Q2 becoming better, as Bill highlighted before. It\u2019s going to certainly take into the latter part of the year that things improve. We see early indicators like productivity and lead generation that support this, but being late cycle will certainly depend on that. What we also see that government changes that we had in China takes a while until we benefit from this. We also expect now another round end of the first quarter where government will confirm their mid-term five year plans that will also give us more clarity where we have our growth opportunities. I feel the team is reacting very well but fact is, the rebound of China for us takes a little bit longer than we expected, for example what we expected last summer.","William Donnelly","I think one other thing I'd add and maybe this is as much, Jon, in response to Tycho\u2019s questions as yours is, the other thing and I hadn't focused on much that between Q1 and Q2 at least the way we measure working days, you have about 2% less working days in Q1, about 2% more in Q2 and it is balanced for the full year. And I think that little bit impacts it. But in terms of the adjustment on the top line it has more to do with how we see backlog here as we enter the year.","Jon Wood - Jefferies","Good color. And then, Bill, could you go through the major gross margin buckets, obviously pretty good in the fourth quarter, and then any changes you see in that raw material pricing mix bucket for '13 at this point?","William Donnelly","Sure. On, again, a weighted average basis across the business, we finished the fourth quarter at 2.9% net realized price increases. That helped the gross margin about 140 basis points. And then material costs were down 2.4% for the quarter which was just short of 2% for the full year and that translated in the quarter to about a 60 basis point improvement. And of course that adds up to more than what we showed and kind of what's left over is what I would describe as mix and other, to get to the 90 basis points. Now in terms of the trend, we would expect maybe not 90 basis points in Q1 but we've built in to get to the EPS growth we described. I think we built in about 70 bps of gross margin improvement in the first quarter.","So, continued good trend. I think that the first couple of quarters of the year should continue to have, let's call it, outsized versus our long-term trend on gross profit margin, closer to the second half trend than the first half of last year because I think there is some comp to OpEx as well and then that will more moderate in the second half. On material costs, we feel pretty good about material costs at least for the first half of the year. I think what will be interesting to see is as with these PMI numbers and other topics improving in China, I think you could start to see raw material inflation starting in the summer time. But we feel like we are on top of the cost structure currently and top of the margin topic and that should be good for the next couple of quarters while we have some more modest sales growth.","Operator","Your next question is queue comes from the line of Dan Arias from UBS. Your line is open for you now.","Daniel Arias - UBS","Bill, you guys look like you're seeing the benefit of the cost actions here. I'm curious whether what you've done so far has been more focused on shifting operations to different regions or more taking down headcount and rationalizing some of the business?","Olivier Filliol","To maybe recall, end of Q2 last year we recognized that things will get more difficult and so we initiated two programs in parallel. One program was expanding on something that we had started already earlier to respond to the strengthening of the Swiss franc where we addressed more structural and fundamental things in our business. Where we also looked at ways to move certain positions in lower cost countries, outsourcing certain functions and go a little bit more fundamental at these things. But of course these are demanding projects, need very good preparation and accordingly also take multiple quarters until we have the full benefit.","In parallel, we launched also in Q2, broader cost management initiatives that went pretty much across the world, across all the units, and basically reflecting also the lower expectations in revenue growth for the remainder of last year and certainly also for this year. And these programs that we launched with the second program were faster to be implemented most of that is done, it\u2019s performance based topics. It has (affected) certain headcounts, but it\u2019s very much across units across the world. More focused, of course, to the western units. It is actually dominantly into western units, certainly also Europe.","So these two programs, I definitely feel that we are benefiting from them, not just in the short term also in the long term. It\u2019s making us more cost competitive and allows us to afterwards reinvest in the business when the markets pick up again that allows us to do strategic resource shifting. For example, if business picks up again, we are going to invest in emerging markets in more thoughtful way as the western market, of course, we are going to continue to be very cost conscious.","William Donnelly","I think the bigger, maybe two Dan, some of the bigger projects, they take longer to implement. So some of things we work on this year, even into next year, are some of the more complex ones as well. So, there is still work to do in the program.","Daniel Arias - UBS","Thanks for that detail. I guess, going back to the gross margins, just given the disparity that we are seeing here between Europe and the rest of the world, are you thinking any differently about the way that that dynamic impacts margins in '13 than you did last time or is the outlook for that generally the same as it was in 3Q?","William Donnelly","I think in the first half of the year we will probably see a trend that's somewhat similar to -- I mean we clearly parted them, the price increase and the material cost numbers impacts on margins add up to more than the total margin. So a big part of that negative mix is actually European related. Our European business as we spoke to you many times is largely replacement in nature and so we'll see the benefits of easier comps in due course and get a better mix there. But I think we still have a couple of quarters yet of that mix topic.","The other area where we sometime have mix topics is as emerging markets pick up, so China is -- our lab products have higher gross profit margins than our industrial products and China has a bigger mix of industrial. So as that starts to pick up, that will be a little bit of a -- it will have some impact on the second half as well. But I think at least for the next couple quarters, we think long-term margin is going to be a good story but maybe in the next couple quarters it will be especially good.","Operator","Your next question in queue comes from the line of Paul Knight from CLSA. Your line is open for you now.","Paul Knight - CLSA","You had talked about the emerging markets outside of China being a priority. Which are the most important to you?","Olivier Filliol","So, if we look at the emerging markets, half of it comes from China and then the other half comes from multiple countries. And actually we have a whole group of countries including India, Brazil, Russia, Southeast Asia. They are all in the range of 1% to 3% but all actually very nicely contributing to the overall mix. But none of the other ones would particularly dominate. And to give you a little bit of flavor about how we performed on these ones. We had Brazil, for example, that did very well in Q4. We had Southeast Asia that continues to do very well. Eastern Europe was up modestly. Russia was, however, down.","Paul Knight - CLSA","And could you, Bill, quantify the currency impact of last year and what you expect this year in total?","William Donnelly","So, let me start with the top line. So for the top line on a full year basis, currencies reduced sales by, let's call it 2.6%, and then in terms of 2013, it's practically zero but with some headwind in the first quarter basically offset by a benefit in the third quarter. 1% each.","Paul Knight - CLSA","And the EPS total, I\u2019m sorry?","William Donnelly","So on the EPS, on a full year basis, we had about $0.5 million. So, think about that as $0.015 for the full year. And a reminder, we had a big plus in Q3 and the rest of the quarters we had relatively smaller minuses. It's actually a bigger number next year. It's a headwind of about $5 million before tax. If you want to put a tax rate on that, that's maybe something in the area of $0.12 per share. One of the bigger changes that you guys know is related to the yen but it's a few other factors as well.","Operator","Your next question in queue comes from the line of Jon Groberg from Macquarie. Your line is open for you now.","Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie","So, Olivier, you mentioned that you thought the price increase would be a little bit less in '13. Sorry, I didn't hear the quantification. I think, Bill, you quantified what it was in '12, but what do you expect it to be in '13?","Olivier Filliol","We expect 100 to 150 basis points for 2013. This is less because as talked on it last year with you guys, we had a lot of attention to it. We did media price increases before and we certainly benefited from an environment that has a certain inflation and that allowed us to go for higher increases. This year, we feel that the environment is more challenging to go with too high price increases because it is not a real inflation on a worldwide basis and material costs are not necessarily going up. So, that's why we feel this year it\u2019s going to be more modest.","Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie","And, Bill, from your comments on the materials cost for the year you expect them to be kind of flattish. Is that what you are currently expecting?","William Donnelly","I think we will even do a little bit better than flattish unless the impact of material like steel into the China is really strong in the second half. I would like to think that maybe not the 2% benefit we got this year, but I think a 1% benefit is realistic.","Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie","Okay. And then just if you kind of -- the operating margin line or EBITDA line if you want to, what are you expecting, I am just trying to see from -- kind of playing with the numbers here -- but what are you expecting at the EBITDA line in terms of margin expansion. And if I can briefly, what is your expectation for share counts given your stock keeps going up?","William Donnelly","Sure. So, we should get about 50 basis point increase in our operating margins, kind of the way Mettler measures them. And if you think about that in terms of incremental margins, you're talking about 46%, let's call it, mid-40s or so. And then actually on a currency adjusted basis it's probably even 10% more than that. In terms of outstanding shares, by the end of the year we should be around this level of 30.9 million shares or so, and that's about a 3% decline versus the average of this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from ISI Group. There line is open for you now.","Ross Muken - ISI Group","I just want to get back to the revenue line in sort of the order trends or at least what you saw in terms of the pacing throughout the quarter. Given the macro backdrop you sort of laid out what most figures are looking like, and with a lot of broad customers across even the industrial complex are talking about it, it's clearly a better picture there. I know you are sort of later cycled but did you see something with the orders? Was it the chunkiness, was it certain parts where maybe there was very specific kind of lack of visibility? I am just trying to get a sense for sort of what's changed over the last two-three months since the original take and how that's kind of trended directionally through the end of 4Q and then the very early part of 1Q, although I know it's not a great indicator because it's January?","William Donnelly","I think I'm going to get to the different pieces of your question, Ross, but come back to me if you think I kind of missed it. So, from our point of view we finished the year with less backlog than we expected. Sales as you know in Q4 came in a little bit biter. Orders may be modestly worse but the combination when we kind of looked at things, I think we're starting this year with, let's call it $25 million to $30 million less backlog than we had a year ago. And if you translate that into a sales number, you're talking a little bit more than 1%. And if we look at actually our lead numbers, we actually feel relatively good about the recent trend, particularly the one place we're most anxious on was China. We do think that we're going to have, what we saw in January was excellent, but I think we shouldn't jump to too many conclusions I guess.","I'm sure you guys heard from other people that the Chinese New Year is moved to February, last year it was January but our order growth was very good. But I think even adjusting for that impact what we saw in January was probably not so bad, and I think kind of pointing to this trend that we would expect order growth to be better in Q1 in China than sales growth and actually that's really a statement for the whole company but in particular driven by what we expect to see in China. So I think really the thing that triggered it mostly for us is that we finished with a little bit less backlog, we recognized what, despite maybe having some modest order growth in the first quarter, that the sales growth has realistically got to be flattish. And when we kind of translated that out for the full year, we decided to move the midpoint of our guidance down by about 50 basis points for the full year.","Ross Muken - ISI Group","So I guess just on the full year, which is what I was more referring to versus Q1 because I understand the dynamics there. I mean, where are sort of the puts and takes in that level of assumptions because again I realize what the near term trajectory looks like but one would think given the macro there is probably some upside optionality, I guess, in the back half forecast. And so if I paint a picture where China continues to kind of gradually improve at the rate we've seen and the U.S. sort of holds in there and Europe gets no worst, where do you see the most sensitivity in the business to where, if we look back nine months from now we were like, wow, that ended up being a lot better than we thought?","William Donnelly","I think you could make a bull-bear case for pretty much every region. And I think in the case of let's say the western world the different governmental risks that are out in both sides of the pond go away and that, or let's say, don't come to the forefront and investment cycle improves. And as a late cycle company we benefit from that more in the second half and our customers, because our business there is a lot replacement cycle, that they return more quickly to their normal replacement cycles, then that would the upside in that part of the world. I think in China it\u2019s very much that things pick up a little bit faster than we anticipate that us thinking that we are mostly not going to see this till the second half we start seeing more in the second quarter than we expected to and it\u2019s a little stronger in the second half.","If you think about like if we start out flat, Ross, in Q2, one way to get to the full year high end of the guidance would be 0%, 2%, 4%, 6% kind of progression by quarter. And to us that seems sitting here today, that would be a good accomplishment from where we are now. So, yeah, I guess kind of sitting here today and Mettler is the way it is on guidance maybe with our relatively small backlog where we have a tough time projecting that optionality you described although we certainly understand the point. And sitting here today, we think that that's probably a reasonable expectation.","Operator","Our next question in queue comes from the line of Sung Ji Nam from Cantor. And there line is open for you now.","Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald","So, I guess going back to Ross's question, in terms of your better outlook for the second half or the latter part of the year, is that really largely driven by China essentially or I'm just trying to get a sense of.\u2026?","William Donnelly","No, we think the comps get easier in the west. So we think we'll be reporting better growth rates in the second half in every region. I think really I apologize and sometimes these calls, if our explanations got off-track. The adjustment to show zero sales growth in Q1 which somehow translate a little bit to us, moving the midpoint of our revenue guidance down by 50 basis points. China was maybe the biggest impact on that. In general, we see that the second half will be better in all regions. We think that the comps get easier in all regions. We think that generally the economy will be improving in all regions and we think in China there is the additional impact that some of the government related projects we expect to see more benefits in the second half of the year.","Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald","And then in the past you talked about roughly 30% of manufacturing coming from low cost regions and 40% of sourcing from low cost regions. I was wondering after the current cost control measures, after that's been completed, would that change those numbers significantly or?","Olivier Filliol","Not that significantly. What you see is that every year the number goes up by a few points. This is a continuous and a gradual thing. It's not that we are moving a whole plant or so through these restructurings to a low cost country. Actually, in contrary, we are a little bit more focused now on certain services, to move services we do software development more out of low cost countries. So, it doesn't necessarily impact the manufacturing and the sourcing ratio. By a few points, yes, but it's not a big way for a big trip.","Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay. And then if I could squeeze in one more, Olivier, I think you talked about, that you had identified, you guys had identified some cross-selling opportunities within your pharma end markets. So I was wondering if you could maybe talk about that end market. I think it's roughly a quarter of your sales and I know it crosses both the lab and the industrial businesses but just curious as to how that segment and market is performing.","Olivier Filliol","Yeah. When we look at this market we look at relatively broad but often the question is referring to pharma, and when we think about pharma often we think big pharma. The big pharma market is not particularly robust and has certainly challenges, but the way we need to look at it is account by account. Certain accounts continue to invest, certainly also invest in automation solutions. There is also good demand for compliance related upgrades and investments. But then again it\u2019s target or account specific. So then there is this other life science accounts like CROs, biotech, smaller pharma. And their growth is actually in general, okay, and particularly if we look on a global scale. And then within this life science market of course, there's also NIH and academia. However, that's not really significant for us. This is a market that is challenging but again not very significant. So, if I take the whole life science market, big pharma depending on the different accounts then the others CROs, biotech and (inaudible) actually solid for us.","Operator","Your next question in queue comes from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. And there line is open for you now.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs","Just wondering if you could maybe give us any updated views on free cash flow and CapEx this year. Trying to scrape around here for any leftover questions.","William Donnelly","We expect a solid improvement in terms of our free cash flow. We should be, let's call it in this $270 million range, something like that. And in terms of our CapEx, we should even be modestly down off of 2012 levels, something more like $92 million versus $95 million-$96 million last year. And maybe the one variable in that area, Isaac, would be how currency plays out. A lot of our CapEx as you know is outside the United States. In terms of the share repurchase program -- in terms of use of cash flows, we would expect to continue to repurchase shares equal to our free cash flow and estimated option proceeds.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs","Great. And maybe just a follow-up on the CapEx side. I mean, if I look over the last, I don't know, five or six years, it's been a relatively modest trend upward but as you pointed out, maybe down this year. Is this kind of a new run rate or are there other maybe special items like Blue Ocean in the next couple of years that we should keep in mind for '14 and '15?","William Donnelly","I think Blue Ocean is incrementally a, I struggle to remember what the 2013 number would be, but it's a number of at least $20 million I would say in terms of incremental CapEx related to Blue Ocean. And maybe it could be $25 million. And so if you pull that out, we right now are half pregnant on Blue Ocean in the sense that we have incremental operating costs and incremental CapEx. And sometime after 2016, I think you'll start to see both of those coming down as well as each year than a little bit more on the benefit side in terms of the business case behind Blue Ocean. So, there is like both of those effects going forward after that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird. There line is open for you now.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird","Bill, the cost take out that you identified for the full year like, I think it was $17 million, is where you're at against the $40 million, ultimate $40 million number?","William Donnelly","Yeah, I think we're estimating $15 million to $20 million in previous calls, correct.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird","Do you put some of that back to work in '13? In other words, are we, looking at this year-over-year, that number should continue to grow by $5 million a quarter. But shouldn't that generate more to your incremental margin than what you identified?","William Donnelly","I think that there are three things to think about in terms of the, let's call it the cost structure piece. So, first of all, Rick, we're going to go from that, let's call it 17 number, up to eventually $40 million. But the $40 million will gradually get there and we don't get the full benefit till the end of '14, so let's assume you're seeing that in '15. So, it's not exactly $5 million per quarter. Then the second impact that you have is that our variable compensation. So we budget a certain level of variable comp bonuses, commissions, these type of topics. And part of our cost gains in 2012 was that we didn't hit our targets so we paid out less than budget. So now in 2013, we go reset back the budget on these plans and that's an increase of about $15 million, so you largely have the incremental cost savings of 2013 being offset by higher variable compensation. Now, did you have another part to that question or did I kind of get the whole thing?","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird","No, I think you got the whole thing right there. I mean, that was quite frankly, it was kind of $15 million missing, I mean just from the straightaway calculation. Then could I just ask, Olivier, you gave kind of some nice commentary on the services side of the business but could you identify the service piece. I think, you discussed service and consumables being about 27% of sales, but how big is the service piece? How did it end the year and what's the targeted growth rate there for '13?","Olivier Filliol","So, if we take purely the service business excluding consumables, it\u2019s about 21% of total sales, and in the quarter we grew about 4%. In general, I expect service to outpace product sales, so we should rate better. And this is particularly also true in environments like we have right now, service is a more steady business, more resilient to the economy. And the other factor I would add to services, it\u2019s a very important competitive advantage that we have. None of our competitors have the breadth and the depth of our service force and it allows us to be really in close contact with customers whenever they plan to have replacements of an installed base at all. So, it\u2019s a good business to have.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird","And that\u2019s, if I remember right from previous comments that you made, that provides an upward bias to the EBIT margin as well, doesn't it? Service that comes in higher than the consolidated EBIT?","Olivier Filliol","Yes, it has an above group average profitability.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird","Could you just -- what's the starting spot on the attachment rate for service to the hardware or the product sales. I mean is it 40% or, I have no idea?","Olivier Filliol","It varies heavily by country, also by business but in particular also by country. You have big differences there. We have actually certain countries that do exceptionally well to have service under contract. We do it at the point of sales initially and then really put it on the contract in other cases. There is a mentality in a country where it's more break-fix and we have more of a challenge to really bring it under contract. So, I can't give you a global number but--","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird","Is it a low number, 20% or what's like a outlier?","William Donnelly","20% would be a number, but remember that's the percentage we have under service contract. We would actually service a larger percentage of our installed base.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird","Okay, so that's under contract. Okay, that's fine, I was just trying to get a reference point. And then just the last question, I know you guys are right. I wouldn't doubt, Mary, but I'm surprised that with the euro at 1.35 that we're going to still take kind of a negative currency sales hit for the full year or flat, because by July or so, I think we're comping against a 1.26 something number. So the yen has that much impact, the strength in the yen?","William Donnelly","Rick, even I am scared to challenge any of Mary's currency analysis. So, I think, we could probably take it offline when we talk later. I think of course there's yen and a few others there. I think it's the other currency that's driving. It's the little guys that are driving it more than the euro. But I\u2019d have to take it offline.","Operator","Next in queue, we have the line of Derik de Bruin from Bank of America. There line is open for you now.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a couple of clean up questions. I guess, if, Bill, your model says that you sort of get the -- let's say we do get this acceleration that to get to that high end of your organic revenue growth guidance, that 0%, 2%, 4%, 6%. So we go into 2014 sort of with that 6% organic revenue growth number. So, now that you've taken all these costs out of it, how does that sort of impact your operating model? You previously hit the 5%, 10%, 15% kind of growth model. Now, as you're taking other cost out, what is the -- I mean you did 2% organic revenue growth quarter you did 20% earnings growth. I'm just curious, how does that translate when you look back and do you have to add any incremental cost back to the business?","William Donnelly","I think the way to look at it kind of a good guidance is, hey, if we're growing mid-single digits we should be able to still deliver incremental operating margins north of 30%, relatively consistently. Maybe one quarter or another that could be a mixed topic that puts it up or down, but if we can push that number in periods of time to, let's call it, high single-digits, I think you'll see more than that drop to the bottom-line. But I think in terms of this balancing of investment, I think Olivier could speak to this maybe more, but I think we try to find the balance in how we do it, but we want to invest for growth because we think over the long-term our ability to improve our long-term organic growth number is probably the biggest way in which we can generate shareholder value.","Olivier Filliol","It's lesser than we need to add the cost back to the franchise, I think it's more than we want to do the strategic investment. And, of course, we are holding back with certain investments for several -- adding a lot of sales force in growing, emerging countries. At this stage we are more cautious. If we see that business momentum comes back we would certainly redo programs like we did a year ago with our filed turbos where we strategically add headcounts, where we feel we can accelerate the growth, gain market shares in an accelerated way.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And I guess under, like a normal business environment, do you sort of envision the business is sort of like a 4% to 6%, 5% to 7% consistent organic revenue growth there?","Olivier Filliol","Yeah, the 4% to 6% is a reasonable assumption. That's what we exactly kind of predict across an economic cycle. So at this stage the economic cycle is certainly more in a difficult stage so we expect less, and if things improve we have a good chance to have succeeded. But across the economic cycle 4% to 6% is the number that we work with.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then just two quick questions for Bill. Bill, guidance for interest income expense for 2013 and if I missed it, forgive me, but expectations for gross margin improvement year-over-year?","William Donnelly","Okay. So, let me start with the gross margin. We should have 30 basis points, maybe a little bit more for the full year and that would be more weighted though to the first half of the year. And so it will be better than that in the first a little less in the second half. And then in terms of the interest expense, we should be somewhere in the $22 million range. And then interest income for us is a really small number so I think it's few hundred thousand.","Operator","Next in queue, you have the line of Greg Halter from Great Lakes Review. That line is open for you now.","Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review","I noticed that the research and development expense was down in the quarter. I wonder what your thoughts are there in '13 and whether or not that impacts or what kind of impact that can have on new product innovation?","Olivier Filliol","Let me quickly take the second part so that Bill can look up the number for 2013 assumption. R&D expenses varies by quarter and it depends on product launch, major product launches that we have. And certainly also kind of depends on the overall pipeline. This is not a reflection that we are reducing the investments or slowing down our R&D efforts at all. There's another effect that plays here that we are increasingly also leveraging low cost countries for R&D efforts. China in the meantime actually is very important for us to give our product, but India plays also an increasing role. We have leverage in India very much for software development and so we reduce the costs in terms of output level. We certainly don\u2019t compromise on that one.","William Donnelly","So maybe a couple of things. We'll get some modest growth, let's look at a couple of percentage points in 2013. And maybe one other thing that I would add to what Olivier said is that, as you guys know the biggest chunk, the biggest center we have for R&D is Switzerland and we're always giving you guys local currency numbers. And in Switzerland, hey, there's just not been much of an environment for inflation. Whether that be salary or other types of inflation and so a big piece of our, even though we have the same number of people producing arguably at higher productivity levels because we've invested a lot in tools for R&D, software tools and other tools for R&D the last couple of years, we don't think that in those core, particularly lab area, that we're losing anything there.","Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review","Okay. And that leads into my next and final question is, what percentage of your revenues for 2012, the full, year came from new products? If you have that.","Olivier Filliol","It's actually a number that we don't talk about specifically. It's actually also difficult to measure. But a good indication is in the range of 20%. I don't think that it changed too much from one year to another, but it's actually a good indication.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your next question in queue comes from the line of Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Their line is open for you now.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research","There has been a lot of great detail on the call so far and you may have covered this already sort of in pieces, but I was wondering where on the expense side with the high-end or the midpoint of the organic growth coming down a little bit but EPS going up, what has kind of changed in your thinking as it relates to expenses?","William Donnelly","I think we have a little bit more confidence on the gross margin side in part due to the second quarter now. Q3 and Q4 both had very good gross margin expansions we expect to report that again in Q1. So, I think that's one factor. And then on the operating expense side we are assessing also where we are in terms of the different cost management programs we have. So, we have a little bit more information in that regard as well.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research","Okay. And then just a final thing was on, you mentioned a little bit of an uptick in the U.S. retail business. Is that something that has multiple quarters behind it do you think?","Olivier Filliol","No, it was rather specific to Q4, had also some previous year comparison topics in it. But, no, I wouldn't read too much into that.","Operator","And presenters at this time there are no further questions in queue. I'll turn the call back over to you.","Mary Finnegan","Thanks, Alan, and thanks everyone for joining us tonight.

Hello, everybody. Sales were $778 million in the quarter, that\u2019s an increase of 6% in local currency. Our acquisition of Biotix, which we completed in Q3, contributed about 1% to sales growth. On a dollar basis, sales increased by 10% as currencies increased sales growth by 4% in the quarter.","On slide number four, we show local currency sales growth by region; sales grew 9% in the Americas, 1% in Europe and 7% in Asia Rest of the World;.

Local currency sales grew by 8% in 2017, of which 1% was due to acquisitions. In the Americas, we grew by 8%, in Europe 5%, in the Asia Asia\/Rest of World, grew by 11% in 2017. Americas growth benefited by about 2% from acquisitions.","On slide six, we outline sales growth by product line. In the quarter, Lab grew 11%, of which 9% is organic. Industrial sales growth was 1%, as solid growth in core industrial was offset as expected by the decline in our product inspection business, which had a strong prior year quarter. Food Retailing declined 3% in the quarter.","The next slide shows full year sales growth by product line. Laboratory grew by 10%, Industrial increased 8%, and Food Retailing declined by 4% for the full year. Acquisitions benefited Lab by about 2%. All comparisons again were in local currency and all were versus the prior year.","Now let's turn to slide number eight, let me walk you through the key items on our P&L for the quarter. Gross margins were 58.5%, that's a 50-basis-point decline from the prior quarter. On a constant currency basis, however, our gross margin is actually increased by 20%, reflecting a 70 basis points headwind from currencies. We continue to benefit from good pricing, while mix was a headwind in the quarter.","R&D amounted to $32.5 million, that's a 5% increase in local currency, while SG&A amounted to $204.9 million and that was an increase of 6% in local currency. Variable compensation investments in Field Resources and employee benefit cost contributed to the increase.","Our adjusted operating income amounted to $217.8 million in the quarter, and that's 9% increase over the prior year amount of $200.2 million. Adjusted operating margins were 28%, a 20 basis points decline from the prior year. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating margins were up by 20 basis points over the prior year amount. A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization was $11.7 million in the quarter, interest expense was $8.6 million.","Let me now cover taxes. First, for purposes of adjusted EPS in Q4, we\u2019re excluding the impact of the new tax legislation, which I'll cover shortly. Also, as we\u2019ve done in prior quarters, we reflect our annual effective tax rate of 22% in our adjusted EPS number. In Q4, our reported tax rate for the quarter was 23% with the difference due to the timing of stock option exercises.","Moving to fully diluted shares, they were $26.2 million in the quarter, which is 1.5% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of the share repurchase program, offset in part by higher shares outstanding due to the accounting change related to the stock option exercises. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $5.97 per share, that\u2019s a 13% increase over the prior year amount of $5.28 per share.","Now, let me make some comments on the new tax legislation that was finalized at the end of last year. A couple of factors are important for us. First, as expected, we do not foresee a meaningful change in our effective tax rate of 22% in the near term. While we benefit from the lower U.S. statutory rate, this is offset by limitations on certain deductions. Second, we view the legislation favorably as it will reduce the complexity of repatriating cash to the United States. It\u2019s along been our strategy to move cash to United States to fund our share repurchase program, and this legislation will make that process easier.","Third, we are subject to a onetime tax in conjunction with this new legislation. We\u2019ve incurred a charge of $72 million in the fourth quarter, of which $59 million represents taxes on un-repatriated foreign earnings that will need to be paid over an eight year period and the remaining $13 million is a non-cash charge.","On a reported basis, our EPS was $2.93 as compared to $5.17 in the prior year. Reported EPS included the $2.74 charge related to tax legislation we described above, $0.12 of restructuring and $0.09 of purchase intangibles and finally, $0.9 of higher reported tax due to timing of stock option exercises.","On the next slide, we show our full year results. We\u2019re very happy with the year in which we achieved local currency sales growth of 8%, our operating income increase of 13% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 19%.","Okay, that\u2019s it for the P&L and now we\u2019ll cover cash flow. In the quarter, free cash flow was $130.7 million. Our working capital statistics remain solid with DSO with 41 days and ITO at 0.5 times. Full year free cash flow was $415 million, this compares to $346.5 million in the prior period. We have some nonrecurring facility expansions going on in last year, including the purchase of our pipette manufacturing facility. Excluding these items, free cash flow per share increased by 14% over the prior year.","Now let me turn to guidance, a few comments here. First, the economic environment continues to be favorable with good conditions in the Americas, in Europe and a positive environment in China as well. I would say we don\u2019t see a change in economic conditions as compared to last time we spoke. As in the past, our guidance assumes market conditions remain consistent to the present environment.","Now second, we feel very good about our growth strategies and our ability to execute them. We\u2019re pleased with our performance in 2017 and we believe we have good initiatives in place to gain further share, as well as continued margin and productivity enhancement initiatives, which should help us to drive solid operating profit growth. Third and final point, comparisons matter, we\u2019ll have some tough comparisons this year in China and our product inspection business, particularly in the early part of the year.","And with this backdrop, let me cover some specifics. We continue to believe that local currency sales growth in 2018 will be approximately 6%. Principally driven by a more favorable currency environment, we now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $19.95 per share to $20.15 per share, it\u2019s a growth rate in the 14% to 15% range. This compares to previous guidance of $19.65 to $19.85.","As we look at the first quarter, we would expect local currency sales growth to be in the 5% range. As a reminder, in Q1 of last year, we had 11% organic growth so it was our most challenging comparison. Based on this sales growth, we would expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of 365 to 370, a growth rate of 9% to 11%. This is modestly higher than what we discussed last quarter, principally due to a more favorable currency environment.","In terms of currency impacts on sales growth, we would expect currencies to increase sales by approximately 3.5% for the full year 2018. And in the first quarter, we would expect that benefit to be about 5.5%. In terms of cash flow, our free cash flow should be approximately $450 million and we will repurchase approximately $475 million of shares.","Just two final comments on our 2018 financial results. There are two new accounting rules being implemented; the first is on revenue recognition, which we do not expect to impact our results; the second is related to pension accounting, which will move approximately $6.5 million of pension income from operating profit to other income. As we report our quarterly results, we will restate the prior-year, so it's apples-to-apples comparisons but want to mention it now.","Okay, that\u2019s it from my side. And let me turn back to Olivier.","Olivier Filliol","Thank you, Bill. Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab had a great quarter and great year overall. Virtually all product lines performed well. Our investments in new product development Field Turbo resources and our Spinnaker sales marketing program are yielding tangible results. We expect current market conditions to remain but acknowledge that we will face tougher comparisons this year in Lab.","Turning to industrial. Core industrial business was up a very solid mid-single-digit in the quarter and high single-digit for the full year. The fourth quarter growth in core industrial was broad-based across all major regions of the world. As expected, in the fourth quarter, product inspection was down modestly but ended the year with a high single-digit growth. We continue to be very well positioned in product inspection in terms of product offering, market presence and marketing strategies. We are coming off to strong use of growth so we\u2019ll face tougher comparisons in 2018.","Finally, retail was down 3% in the quarter and 4% for the year. Although, they have sales decline, we are satisfied with this business as we continue to prioritize profit growth and return on invested capital rather than sales growth.","Now, let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales growth in the Americas was very good with strong growth in Laboratory and solid growth in the Industrial. Retail was down slightly. Sales growth in Europe was impacted by declines in retail and product inspection. Both of which had challenging comparisons with the prior-year. Lab had good growth and core industrial solid growth. Asia\/Rest of the World had solid growth driven by very strong growth in China. For the year, China sales grew 19%. We expect China to have a solid first quarter that they will then face more challenging comparisons in the second and third quarters. Finally, service increased 7% for the year. That concludes my comments on the business.","Supported by favorable global economy but driven by diligent execution of our growth initiative, we had an excellent performance in 2017. We are also benefiting from our growth investments in the recent years. As we look to this year, we believe we're well-positioned for further growth and share gain.","Let me remind you all the key drivers of our growth initiatives, starting with our long-running Spinnaker sales marketing platform and our big base of techniques. You have heard about Spinnaker for many years and it is a great reflection of our continuous improvement mentality within the organization. We are continually strengthening Spinnaker with new techniques and adjusting priorities based on potential.","A current focus area is key account management, which allows us to capitalize on our broad product and service offering to further penetrate customers. We are using data and analytics to optimize our sales force activities by identifying and prioritizing sales opportunities and helping us to customize value messages that can best resonate with customers.","Our Field Turbo additions to the sales force represent our largest investment for growth to-date. As a reminder, we are leader in the vast majority of our markets, yet our average market share is in 25% range. We believe additional front-end investments can accelerate share gains and plan to add another 150 resources in the current wave.","Service is a growth contributor and key competitive advantage for us. We are focused on increasing the percentage of our installed base on the service contract and continue to make investments in training and tools for our 2,700 service technicians. We are also mining our installed base data to identify more service sales opportunities and increasing telesales resources to pursue these opportunities.","Underpinning our sales and service growth initiative is our excellent product pipeline. We continue to distance ourselves from competition, which helps to accelerate the replacement cycles. We are also expanding our solutions by adding software, measurement parameters and automation to provide more benefit to customers. For example, in the Lab, we are further automating the Lab bench by connecting our high powered automated sampler to key analytical instruments, such as our typewriters and UEV. This is driving quicker analysis and increased throughput in the Lab.","We are also increasing our offerings to support data integrity, which is important to customers in the regulated industry, such as pharma. We have also expanded our LabX software to encompass more analytical instruments and added predictive or smart analysis, such as our IC software suite for our AutoChem offering. The IC software fully controls critical chemical and biological process development workflows, while capturing critical analytical information. It is generally recognized as the standard in the industry.","In addition to our initiatives to drive sales growth, we are also focused on margin and productivity measures to drive operating profit growth and also provide us with capacity for investments for future growth. We continue to use sophisticated data analytical tools to give us insights to further refine our pricing strategies and processes. We have identified many improvement projects with the launch of the Stern Drive program last year. Stern Drive encompasses continuous improvement efforts with our supply chain, manufacturing and back-office operations. We have also introduced a new e-shop portal to increase the efficiency of our automated sales transactions.","The success of these various productivity programs are depended on strong execution, which I'm confident that the organization will continue to deliver.","One final comment on 2018. We will soon open our new product inspection facility in Tampa, Florida. This facility provides for the growth in this business and allows us to consolidate all our U.S. tracking, metal detection and x-ray businesses in one location. You will have an opportunity to see these locations and learn more about our leadership and capabilities in product inspection at an investor meeting we are planning to hold in Tampa on Monday, November 12. I know this is ways off, but wanted to mention it now. Mark it in your calendars and we will be back with additional details in due time.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We are very pleased with the excellent results generated in 2017. Assuming market conditions remain stable, our outlook for 2018 remains positive and we believe we're well-positioned to continue to gain share and deliver strong operating results.","I want to now ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.","Ross Muken","How would you tease out, as you would have expected, the order trend? I mean, there is a lot of moving parts there and you\u2019ve got some tough comps and thesis. But given all of the economic data is quite good. Are there some segments or some industries where you are seeing any differential or is it pretty uniform and is really just a product inspection question just in terms of like industrial overall?","Bill Donnelly","So couple of thoughts there. So as you've correctly point out, Ross, comps matter so -- and the toughest comps we have coming in food. I think, we do see good order trends in industrial pretty globally and we do see good order trends with our industrial customers that buy lab instruments. The one area I think it's always tough to dissect come, which is tough comps. You also read that some of the food companies, packaged food companies, have some topics and it will be interesting to see what type of growth we can do.","We've been conservative I think relative to past growth rates for that in 2018, but I think it will take a little bit of time to observe that. Absent maybe this food's comment about packaging where we might be a little cautious, I think we see great economic environment. We're talking it about today with our Board where it's part for Olivier and I remember a point in time where so many parts of the world were performing well. And we see that across our industrial customer base.","Ross Muken","I guess just building off on that Bill. Just as you think about the growth cadence for the year, like what proportion of the business in terms of thinking we've got this unique synchronized global expansion. What proportion of the business do you feel like highly confident as we think about the second half of '18 versus where do you think we have maybe a little bit of wiggle room or macro just given how elevated we are and maybe some of the geographies that historically have and always been this sustainably strong, I guess?","Bill Donnelly","Again I\u2019ll try to answer your question Ross, but maybe come back if you don't think I understood it completely. So we would tend to say historically that many parts of the business, particularly industrial piece, might be a little late cycle. So we tend to do okay in the later part of that cycle. I think where we feel too unusual things is in China, in 2017. We clearly benefited from some of the pent up demand for hold backs in that part of the world on capital investment in that '15-'16 timeframe. And then in the product inspection business, there is we're currently the Q4, 2017, we're going up against 15% comp, which led to what we had here in the fourth quarter. And I think we have another double digit comp in Q1. So we would tend to think that if the economy stays relatively at this level even with maybe some modest leveling off here and there, the second half would seem pretty solid relative to our current guidance.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jack Jack Meehan from Barclays.","Jack Meehan","I think versus our model, look like Lab was the greatest area of the strength in the quarter. Could you maybe just tease out what's performing better there? And sounded like it was pretty broad based, but just the outlook for 2018.","Olivier Filliol","It was actually really broad based. Indeed, very happy how the Lab team performed. It's across the geographies. Certainly, China contributed very nicely. Just real estate in China, we have the seventh quarter here in a row where we have very good double digit growth in Lab. But we saw really good momentum also in Europe and U.S. I think it\u2019s a reflection of the economy, but also very much that we had very strong product pipelines. We did highlight that about a year ago where I shared with you that I said I never had so much confidence in our new products and the differentiation of the [indiscernible], that certainly translates in good results.","And then all the sales and marketing initiatives certainly contribute nicely in Lab, where the Field Turbo contributing as well as all the additional innovations that we have to engage new customers. So it\u2019s a combination but definitely happy and I expect also '18 to continue to be good.","Jack Meehan","Could you give us an update just in terms of pricing growth in the quarter? And it seems some big moves on the FX front. Are there any opportunities or risks you are looking at there?","Bill Donnelly","So on the pricing, we were up about 280 bps in the fourth quarter, which was modestly above and we did push in one or two areas a little bit some of this inflationary pressure that you here described. So some of that -- and we did experienced some of that inflation by the way in material cost structure. So it\u2019s not that all 280 bps fell to the bottom line. But we had another good quarter and really a good year and feel pretty good about our pricing process entering '18 as well.","Operator","And your next question comes from Paul Knight from Janney.","Paul Knight","Can you talk a little geographic on the European market up 1% in4Q, what's going on there? Obviously, a great year in Asia, China specifically. Can you talk about your thoughts on China in 2018?","Olivier Filliol","Let me start with Europe. Overall, pleased with the numbers and generally in line with our expectations. As expected, region was down double digit, but were very much impacted also by previous year comparisons. It\u2019s absent of retail, Europe grew 3% in the quarter. Again, solid growth already in the previous year. So that\u2019s why we said it came out as expected, but actually also in a good way. In terms of counties, we have France and the Nordic region that did, for example, particularly well and we had also good growth in Eastern Europe. Lab had also particularly good growth in Europe.","So all-in-all actually a good picture. If we go to Asia and then particular China, China certainly had a very strong quarter, as well as the full 2017, and expected -- also clearly my expectation, we did not expect that China would develop so well, when we entered the year. And certainly -- also when we end this Q4, we didn\u2019t expect these results, very happy. The market environment is very strong, very good. And we benefit also from these pent-up demands that Bill mentioned that was certainly the case last year, Q4 maybe a little bit less so.","This was particularly true for industry. Lab, we experienced multiple quarters as mentioned before seven quarters in a row with double-digit growth. I expect that to continue. As for several industries, we will now continue to experience the same growth rate. Here we're going to face tougher comparisons that will certainly play than in the second quarters of this year.","Paul Knight","And Bill, could I ask last question, would be the net tax effect seems to be a little higher on your tax rate in '17. And what are all the moving parts mean for share repurchase? Any change in plan there?","Bill Donnelly","So we might need to take it offline. So our tax rate of 22% came right in where we are, so our adjusted EPS is in line with what we expected for the full year. The tax rate or adjusted EPS, we did take a charge related to the new law. The charge was round figures about 80% cash related 20% non-cash. And we would expect that we can maintain this 22% rate going forward and probably longer term, we have actually a much easier repatriation process than we would have otherwise.","In terms of the share repurchase plan, I would expect us to purchase 475 next year, which is our current -- this year, which is our current estimate for free cash flow plus option proceeds.","Operator","And your next question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.","Tycho Peterson","Olivier, just curious, I know you've talked about China in fair amount. Can you maybe talk on what drove the upside in the quarter for you guys in China? I mean, last quarter guided for high-single digit growth for the year. Obviously, you're trending above that. So where you seeing upside from a demand side?","Bill Donnelly","So I think the main thing was we were a little cautious about how much orders got pulled from Q4 into Q3 in connection with the party conference. So we finished -- we probably just did a little bit better in that regard or a little bit too conservative. And I would say the order trend was good, the start to the year was pretty good. I think that's one thing we're monitoring is the timing of the Chinese New Year was a little different. So while January was very strong, I think we'll have to see how that plays out by the time we get to the end of the first quarter.","But I was down there last week, Olivier was down there in the fourth quarter and I think both of us feel very good about how the business is positioned there. And the Chinese team is pretty optimistic about their growth prospects and share gain prospects there. But it is realistically a tough comp, because the pent up demand topic we keep referring to.","Tycho Peterson","And then back to the Lab's strength. Just curious are you willing to comment on and January trends just wondering to what degree there was a little bit of a budget plus dynamic in the fourth quarter.","Bill Donnelly","I would say the best one to look at is you guys are usually asking that question in terms of biopharma. And we clearly had a very nice growth in pipettes, as well as in our AutoChem business in the fourth quarter. But they are going to have a decent first quarter as well. So I would have said that we had a nice budget flush, but not a huge surprise either.","Tycho Peterson","And then lastly on Stern Drive. Can you quantify -- I know you\u2019ve talked in past about where you expect in terms of benefit from that. Can you just remind us what you're expecting for the year in Stern Drive?","Olivier Filliol","The Stern Drive is really a program that allows us to continue to expand the margins similar to what we had in the past. It touches different topics. It touches productivity topics. It touches on material cost savings. And in essence, you shouldn't look at it as being an incremental program. It\u2019s more supporting the margin expansion that we have also pursued in the past. But it makes it more sophisticated now, it makes it more global and it\u2019s basically the next wave of excellence that we bring to operations.","Operator","And your next question comes from Dan Arias from Citigroup.","Dan Arias","Bill, just an outlook question. What are you looking for at this point for growth in Asia\/Rest of World, if you exclude China?","Bill Donnelly","High single digits in that 7%.","Dan Arias","And then maybe just on the margin. Can you talk about the impact of mix on margins this year in the context of both your European business and then also what you do in the retail business? I know those are two things that can move the number around a little bit.","Bill Donnelly","So the decline in retail certainly helped. What probably hurt a bit was the decline in our European business. You'll remember that Europe is the part of the world where we have the highest percentage of direct sales. So in terms of the gross profit margin that makes a difference. We also had, because of the strong growth coming out of china and the disproportionate amount of industrial business we have there versus lab as compared to the rest of world. While China is accretive at the OP line it tends to be a little bit dilutive at the gross profit margin line.","So if I look out at our growth rates next year, we certainly have the retail business growing below the corporate average, but pretty solid growth in all product categories, maybe a slightly less in Europe than the rest of the world. But of course we\u2019ll get some benefit from Stern Drive.","I think in terms of looking towards maybe recent trends and what we might expect to see in '18, I think the biggest difference is that currencies got to tend to inflate sales and inflate cost in a way that will reduce our gross margin as a percent, but actually benefited in terms of dollars of gross profit we\u2019ll be able to deliver. So currency will help us, help us more in '18 than it did in '17 and way more than it did in the previous 10 years. So in that sense, it\u2019s helpful but it will tend to dilute a little bit the percent.","Operator","And your next question comes from Patrick Donnelly from Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Donnelly","Bill, maybe one on industrial. How should we be thinking about core industrial and products inspection growth rates to trend in 2018 here? And then specifically on core industrial, any geography still lagging on that front that you expect to maybe show some turnaround in the near term?","Bill Donnelly","So we should be able to put up a mid single-digit growth in our core industrial business. And we did a little bit better than that in '17, but that\u2019s largely due to the China industrial business it grew so much in 2017. And we see that one area now how good we are in measuring that pent up demand impact could be upside or downside to our guidance in this regard. But maybe connecting to our answer to our first question from Ross, I think we feel pretty good about the industrial environment in the western world. We feel actually good about it globally with maybe some comparison concerns when it comes to China. Was there -- I think I forgot this. I think you had a second part, Patrick, and I apologize I forgot.","Patrick Donnelly","It was just about if any geographies are still lagging on the core industrial side, but it doesn't sound like.","Bill Donnelly","I think it's just this question of how well are we estimating the impact of pent up demand on the China numbers. That's the hardest one to predict.","Patrick Donnelly","And then maybe one on the Field Turbo side. Obviously, investments there have been at elevated levels for a couple of years here. Could you just talk through how long it may take to turn profitable and if there is any inflection point expected in 2018 from some of those early investments?","Olivier Filliol","What's important to know is every Field Turbo is different and it's the payback period can make it change radically by geography and by type of business that we are focused on. So to illustrate it on a telesales person that telesales person might have reached breakeven point of the six months. But if we -- as a person for automated chemistry, it might take two years to build up the pipeline. So it varies. And the different ways that we are pursuing here have sometimes different entities, like two years ago we have strong entities on telesales.","At this point, we have more emphasis on more sophisticated instrument sales people. And so we might have a little bit of longer payback period. But a good assumption is that of the one to two years, they reach to breakeven point. And so we definitely have a situation now where we are benefitting in terms of growth but also on profitability from the investments that we did one-two years ago.","Operator","Your next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin","Couple of questions. First one, what's the pacing in terms of the FX on the top line benefit over the next couple of quarters?","Olivier Filliol","I'll let Mary give the answer on that one.","Mary Finnegan","So Derik, we're assuming for the top line about 3.5% benefit for the full year, and you're going to see it start off about 5.5% in the first quarter and then about 4% and then down to 2% for the second half of the year.","Derik De Bruin","And I'm just curious, are you seeing any -- your business was uniquely positioned within the life sciences market that we cover. And I'm just wondering if you\u2019ve seen any signs or any indication from any of your customers in the U.S. that they're going to reinvest any money from tax reform into their businesses and doing it through CapEx projects, i. e. any of food retailers planned using the windfall for investing in new equipment, or they all typically getting to Amazon?","Olivier Filliol","I think I would start and say our instruments typically are not that expensive and not so CapEx relevant. And so I would be cautious to see a direct impact here from the tax changes in the U.S. I think what we might see more medium to long term that there might be more investments in new labs, for example, in U.S. and we might benefit from that. But on a short basis, I don't think so.","And if you talk about retail, actually retail is probably more impacted about the overall nervousness on the profit pool, and that actually would rather impact or slowdown their commitment to new investments in store upgrades and so on. So in a nutshell, I don\u2019t see a big impact here.","Derik De Bruin","And then just one final question. You did a couple of acquisitions last year or the last couple of years. Can you talk about how those were trending if there is anything else that is catching around the horizon?","Olivier Filliol","So the two acquisitions that you referred to one is Troemner that we did about a year ago and Biotix that we did a few months ago, happy on both. Actually Troemner had its first full year and exceeded our expectations, really happy. And Biotix had the first -- last quarter here, a very good performance too. So from a financial standpoint, happy about how things are growing. And in terms of integration or accumulation, also very happy good retention of the teams, good commitments of the teams. And Biotix team, which is a little bit new to us, we are very pleased by talent pool that we have seeing there, and there how we are talking about shared strategies going forward how we can leverage the global franchise and so on, so a promising start.","When you refer to about the pipeline for further deals, the strategy remains the same. Of course, I'm happy that we could close here two attractive deals in the last 12 months. We had a period where we were not closing any deals. This is unpredictable and going forward, we\u2019re going to pursue the same approaches both on acquisitions with good synergy potential. But the availability of deals is difficult to predict. But hopefully, one or the other deal will materialize.","Derik De Bruin","And just one final one, just Bill on the op margin target for 2018. How much are you embedding your model for expansion?","Bill Donnelly","So plus 50 bps, and currency adjusted a little bit more.","Derik De Bruin","And the currency hit is basically on the gross margin line?","Bill Donnelly","Yes, I guess if we look at our table, I'm struggling to give you -- I think through the logic of why that is. But yes, if we look at our model, which is bottoms-up, the short answer is yes.","Operator","And your next question comes from Brandon Couillard from Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard","Olivier, did you get the service growth rate for the fourth quarter? And then at a high level, do you have any difference in the growth between the core contract business versus the parts business?","Olivier Filliol","Service co growth in the quarter was 5% and yes -- for the full year it was 7%. And the contract business is doing actually really well. I don't know the number for Q4 separate, but I would be surprised if it wouldn\u2019t be actually double-digit, because early in the year we looked at as we talked about it for you guys and we have really very good numbers, and the part that we also most focused on.","The contract business is also outgrowing this past business because the quality of our products get better and better. And we shared with you that this is one of the things why we push the contract business the fixed business, including spares, we are not going to have the same growth dynamic and that\u2019s certainly region wise.

I'm glad that you're joining us this evening. I'm joined by Olivier Filliol our CEO and Bill Donnelly our Executive Vice President.","I need to cover just a couple administrative matters before we start.

A copy of the press release and the presentation we refer to are also on our website.","Let me summarize the safe harbor language that you see on page 2.

Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Thank you Mary and welcome to everyone on the call. I will start with a summary of the quarter and then Bill will provide details on our financial results and an update to our guidance. I will then have some additional comments and we will then open the lines for Q&A.","The highlights for the quarter are on page three of the presentation. Local currency sales growth of 5% came in pretty much as we expected and was impacted by the excellent growth in the prior year. As a reminder in the first quarter of 2017, we had local currency sales growth of 12%. China did very well in the quarter with a strong base sales growth. Our overall solid top line growth rose another quarter of strong adjusted EPS growth. Demand in our markets remains solid and we believe we are well positioned for further market share gains.","Let me turn it over Bill to provide additional details on the financial and our updated guidance for the year. Bill?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Thanks Olivier and hello everybody.","Sales were $660.8 million in the quarter and that's a 5% increase in local currency. The Biotix acquisition contributed approximately 1.5% sales growth. On a U.S. dollar basis total sales increased 11% as currencies increased sales growth by 6% in the quarter.","On slide number 4, we show local currency sales growth by region. Sales grew 5% in the Americas, 10% in Asia\/Rest of World. Sales growth in China was specifically up 15% in the quarter, while sales declined by 1% in Europe. Sales in Europe were impacted by the timing of the Easter holiday and as a reminder, we had local currency sales growth of 13% in the same period last year.","On slide number 5, we outlined local currency sales growth by product lines. In the quarter our lab business grew by 10%, industrial sales declined by 1% as growth in core industrial was offset by a decline in our product inspection business. Olivier will have some additional comments on product inspection later in the quarter. Our food retailing business was flat in the quarter.","I know some of you have questions on the Q1 organic sales growth and the impact of Easter and other one-time topics. One way I gain confidence is by looking at our April year-to-date organic sales growth. Through April organic sales growth is a healthy mid-single-digit despite a very strong prior year comparison.","Now turning to slide number 6, let me walk you through the key items in our P&L for the quarter. One comment to start, as we mentioned last quarter there's a new accounting rule that went into effect at the beginning of the year, which moves a portion of our pension income from operating profit to other expense. This is actually different for Mettler-Toledo than it is for other companies, who actually improved their operating profit due to the re-class that's because our pension plan in Switzerland is overfunded. Although it's not a huge impact to us, you'll note that we restated last year's results so that they're on a comparable basis.","Gross margins were 56.7% in the quarter and that compares to 57.8% in the prior year. We have a couple of factors impacting gross margins this quarter. First, pricing continues to be a strong contributor. However, this was offset by the impact of currency, some negative mix and initial costs associated with the consolidation of the product inspection facilities currently underway in the United States.","R&D amounted to $34.7 million and that's a 5% increase in local currency. SG&A amounted to $200.7 million. That's an increase of 2% in local currency. Investment in field resources were somewhat offset by a decline in variable comp. Adjusted operating income amounted to $139.5 million in the quarter, which represents a 10% increase over the prior year amount of $126.5 million. Adjusted operating margin was 21.1% and on constant currency our margins were up by 10 basis points (sic) [10%] (00:06:51).","A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization was $11.7 million in the quarter, while interest expense was $8.4 million in the quarter. Other income amounted to $2.4 million and this includes the $1.6 million of pension income that re-class that I previously described. As you adjust your models for the year, you want to reflect this quarterly amount for the remainder of this year. Our tax rate was 22% in our adjusted EPS in the quarter. Our reported effective tax rate is 21% with the difference due to the timing of stock option exercises.","Moving to fully diluted shares, they were 26.1 million in the quarter that's a 2% decline from the prior year reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $3.74 that's a 12% increase over the prior year amount of $3.34 per share. I think it's interesting to note on a two-year basis that's more than a 50% increase about as good as I've ever seen us do. And as a reminder, it's basically organic EPS growth.","On a reported basis in the quarter EPS was $3.58 and that compares to $3.48 in the prior year. Reported EPS includes $0.13 of restructuring and $0.10 of purchased intangible amortization. It also excludes $0.07 benefit of the low reported tax rate which is already mentioned, is due to the timing of stock option exercises.","Okay. That's it for the P&L. And now I want to cover cash flow and the cash. In the quarter, cash flow was $56.5 million in line with the prior year. Our working capital statistics remains solid with DSO at 43.5 days and ITO at 4.5 times.","Now let me make a couple of comments on the potential tariff situation as it relates to our business and manufacturing in China. One upfront comment, we do not have any greater insight than you with respect to what ultimately will play out. However, we're preparing diligently so we can be ready to react if necessary. We're looking at the tariffs in two ways.","First, with respect to our business in China, we don't envision a significant impact as we import into China from the U.S. only a very small percentage of our product sales in China. We do import into China many higher end products from Switzerland, Germany and the UK, but we don't expect these countries to be involved at this stage.","With respect to the possible slowdown in our Chinese business because of tariffs impacting our customers there, it's hard to determine at this point. Our exposure to raw materials and industries likely to be most impacted has declined over the last several years, but the remaining business may have some impact. We'll monitor the environment in China closely, but at this point see no change to demand.","In terms of our exports out of China and the United States, we have limited steel and aluminum imports. But we already see some commodity price increases, due to the proposed Section 232 legislation. The impact before any corresponding actions from our side to mitigate is in the range of $2 million to $3 million. We also import some instruments and parts for instruments from China. Based on the current list of possible tariffs under Section 301 we estimate the potential impact to be something in the area of $8 million.","For both of these items, we've prepared supply chain and pricing strategy initiatives which would largely impact the mitigate \u2013 sorry largely mitigate the impact should the tariffs be implemented. We fully acknowledge there's a lot of unknowns and uncertainty with respect to how this might work out. We're monitoring it closely and we'll react quickly, if necessary.","Now let me turn to guidance, a few comments. First, the economic environment continues to be favorable with good conditions in the Americas and Europe and a very positive environment in China. However, we do acknowledge there is more uncertainty in global economy versus the last time we spoke. In particular, uncertainty surrounding for example, the impact of tariffs which I mentioned earlier. Our guidance assumes that market conditions remain largely consistent with the current environment.","Second, we feel very good about our growth strategy and execution right now, and we think that can continue into second half of the year. Third, and I know, I've said this before but it's important to highlight, comparisons do matter. In particular, we face some challenging comparisons in China and in our product inspection business during the next two quarters.","With this as a backdrop let me cover the specifics. We continue to believe that local currency sales growth in 2018 will be approximately 6%. With this sales assumption we now assume an adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.10 per share to $2.25 per share (sic) [$20.10 per share to $20.25 per share] (00:12:08) which reflects the growth rate of 14% to 15% and this compares to our previous guidance of $19.95 to $20.15.","With respect to the second quarter we would expect local currency sales growth to be in the 6% range. Based on this sales growth we would expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.55 per share to $4.60 per share and that's a growth rate of 16% to 17%.","In terms of currency and sales growth, we would expect currency to increase sales by approximately 2.5% for the quarter \u2013 sorry, for the full year. And for the second quarter, we expect it to benefit sales by approximately 3%. In terms of cash flow, we expect free cash flow to be approximately $450 million this year and our share repurchases estimate remains in the $475 million range.","Okay. That's it from my side. And I now want to turn it back to Olivier.","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Thank you, Bill. I will cover the business in some more detail this quarter. Let me start with our lab business which continues to perform well despite strong growth in the prior year.","Lab benefited from some acquisition revenue from Biotix. However, our organic growth in lab was up nicely over the prior year. All product categories continue to do well. Balances, auto-chem and process analytics have particular strong growth in the quarter. Analytical instruments and pipettes had good growth, but faced tougher comparisons due to excellent growth in the same period last year.","For lab in general, we continue to lead the market with technology. We have many examples throughout the business. One recent example is our new unique handheld density meters. It can provide automatic digital measurements in an easy to use portable instrument and its proprietary software assists with data management. It has the look and the feel of our Rainin electronic pipettes, which reinforces our commitment to provide reliable, but simple to operate lab instruments. This is a small product line, but I thought it was a good example to share with you to highlight the focus on technology that we are making throughout our product portfolio.","We combine this strong product pipeline with our proven Spinnaker sales and marketing strategies and investments in the field resources via our Field Turbo program. Lab receives a disproportionate share of both R&D, marketing and field investment resources. I'm optimistic about the lab business for the rest of the year and into the future. I'm convinced, we are well positioned and can continue to incrementally gain market share.","One last comment on lab and this is looking at it from a geographic focus. Asia, in particular China did very well in lab. Europe's lab growth was more moderate principally due to the very strong growth in the same prior year and was impacted by Easter. Americas' organic growth in lab was solid.","Now turning to industrial, as you heard from Bill, the overall industrial business declined 1% in the quarter. Our industrial includes two pieces: core industrial; and product inspection. We have factors impacting both businesses this quarter. I will start with product inspection which represents 42% of the total industrial business or a little less than 20% of total sales.","Product inspection is focused principally on food manufacturers and also pharmaceutical and consumer goods companies. Our offering consists of checkweighers, metal detectors, x-ray, vision and sterilization solutions to help ensure the integrity and quality of packaged items. We have the broadest product offering in the market and are a clear market leader in every major region except for Japan. Our extensive service network is a very important competitive advantage for us as manufacturing productivity and uptime is critical for our customers.","Growth drivers for product inspection are attractive, principally driven by concerns on product safety, brand protection and manufacturing productivity. We have seen a trend over the last few years of global food companies looking to standardize globally their product inspection instruments. Our global presence and service network provides us a unique advantage here. We achieved high-single-digit growth in both 2016 and 2017 in product inspection, in part due to these trends, I just mentioned. Given these comparisons our outlook for 2018 is for more moderate growth.","In Q1, product inspection was down mid-single digit. There are a number of factors that impacted these results primary of which is tough comparisons as local currency sales were up 15% in the prior period.","A couple other factors also impacted the results to a lesser degree. These included the move of our largest U.S. product inspection unit in Tampa, Florida at the end of the quarter. We will have some additional smaller ones in the coming months as we consolidate all the U.S. product inspection operations into this new state-of-the-art facility. As I mentioned last quarter, you will have a chance to see this facility later this year when we hold an Investor Meeting there on November 12.","In addition to the move, the German product inspection operations were implementing the new ERP system in the first quarter. The investments coming from our facility consolidation and new ERP system will have a very good return in the coming years as they will further strengthen our franchise.","Similar to Bill's comments on the group, through to April, our product inspection business is close to flat with double digit two-year growth rate. We will have a solid second quarter for product inspection. Longer term, this remains one of our strongest franchises with attractive growth prospects.","The other piece of our industrial business is core industrial, which was up low-single digits in the quarter. We had strong growth in China in core industrial as we are benefiting from improved economic conditions. Growth in Europe and Americas in core industrial was solid on a two-year basis. The business was also impacted in Q1 by our transportation and logistics business, which is project-based and often lumpy. Last year, we had a couple larger T&L orders in the first quarter, which impacted comparisons for this year. Sales were also impacted by Easter, because of our large core industrial service business in the West.","The final piece of our company is the retail business, which was basically flat in the quarter. This business is also project-based and relatively lumpy. This quarter we had a large increase in U.S., which was offset by a large decrease in Europe. Our focus for this business is profitability over growth. I would expect low-single-digit sales growth for the second quarter and [Technical Difficulty] (00:19:57) year.","I think that gives you some more insights into our business both, the first quarter results, as well as the outlook.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We are pleased with the solid results for the first quarter. Assuming market conditions remain stable, we are well positioned to deliver a year of strong sales and earnings growth.","I want to now ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good afternoon guys. Thanks. Bill, on China when you talk about the uncertainty that exists there, does that at all refer to what you're seeing in the order book or the visibility that you have, or you kind of just calling out what you're seeing in terms of the headlines? Just trying to understand, the relative confidence that you have in that region, at this point, just given the quarter.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yeah. So I think the \u2013 for us, I think one of the uncertainties is the less the Chinese market and more of the impact of tariffs potentially leading towards downturn in the global economy. As we've mentioned, on several occasions the global economy is great, right? There's a lot of good stuff going around in the world and so we're more concerned, if there could be disruption to that and that's what I meant by uncertainty. I think this \u2013 the heightened uncertainty comes largely from the current tariff discussions going back and forth.","With regard to our current Chinese business, it's performing great. Everything we've seen through April look great. But I would comment that it's a tough comp. They grew quite a bit in the second third quarter of last year; I'm just pulling up some numbers now, so China was up as a reminder 22% in Q2 of last year and 28% in Q3. So I \u2013 us putting growth numbers on top of that would be \u2013 is a sign that things are really going pretty well down there.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Do you have a full year outlook for China at this point that's updated? Is it any different than what we are looking at last quarter? I think it was 5% to 10%?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yeah. It's still in that range but probably creeped up closer to the top of that range than the bottom.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then if I could just ask one more. How are you feeling about Europe at this point? I mean it looks like some of the macro data points are sliding a bit, but they're still pretty good at relative levels. And it sounds like there was a bit of seasonality for you this quarter with Easter. So, what does the outlook for Europe look like? I think the comp next quarter gets much easier for you.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","So, it does get easier. Just as a reminder, Q1 last year we had a big benefit due to the legislation around that retail labeling topic as well as Easter timing benefited us in Q1 last year. So if I look just to give you a feeling the whole, just looking at year-to-date through April for Europe, the number is, looks already much better just adjusting for the Easter timing. I think we're more in kind of the range we would expect for the full year and that's despite having the tough comp anyways. So just adjusting for Easter and we're looking much better April year-to-date.","So, we are well positioned there strategically. We've made some investments in Olivier's Field Turbo programs and other topics so our growth rate will be much better in Europe the coming three quarters.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard, Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. I guess, first off, on the new Tampa facility is it possible to quantify the savings you expect to achieve by consolidating your product IT business \u2013 I'm sorry, your product ramification business down in Tampa?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","So it's a single-digit million would be the first comment, but maybe Dan, the bigger thing we needed to do there and that's just how much infrastructure we're taking out less building cost, things like that. But I think the biggest benefit we have there is we just outgrew our Tampa facility. So, I think I've mentioned it on calls in the past; our team would literally have to move inventory in and out of the plant in the morning just to make room for production to take place.","We are one of the best stories inside the company in the last five years has been the growth of our x-ray and metal detection business in Tampa. So they will \u2013 it's a little bit more difficult to quantify, but you can imagine ,if you think about a lean supply chain layout in a new facility where we're not doing silly things like having to move inventory around just to do production is going to help. And we've never really been able to try to quantify but we knew it was the right answer to make that investment.","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","And maybe on top of that beyond just the operations benefit we're bringing the teams here together, so we're going to have to check weighing business, with the x-ray with the metal detection business and the latest decision is also to add the vision inspection business all into the Tampa facility. This brings the teams together, cross-selling is supported, but you can imagine also for customers this is very attractive.","The new facility offers great ways for us for demo programs, for tests, customer test programs. I think this is going to be extremely powerful going forward for us to further grow the business and totally underline that we have here a leadership position that we can further leverage.","So, that's a powerful investment in the future, and it's certainly not just about cost savings opportunities. In contrary, I expect that this is \u2013 preliminarily an investment in the franchise.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And Olivier, I think you commented that you like the long-term trends in product inspection during your prepared remarks. Could you talk once you lap these difficult comparisons, how do you look at the growth rate of the product inspection business? Is it something that grows faster than the corporate average, at the corporate average? And what would be some of the macros that would drive that?","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","So it's definitely one of the businesses that should grow above the group average. The market offers these opportunities and certainly the way how we are managing, allocating resources, again, all that stuff supports that approach.","There are different factors. So first of all, I would stress the point that we have the most attractive portfolio of the different technologies and we have leadership positions in the different technologies. We \u2013 this plays very well also to the needs of our customers. Then we have an excellent service network that is very much appreciated by our customers. And then for certain technologies there is still an adoption rate opportunity. This is particularly true for x-ray and that's another driver for additional growth.","This \u2013 what I just said applies across the world, but then you can imagine there is, on top of that the emerging markets opportunities. Packaged foods consumption is growing over proportionally in emerging markets and brand protection quality is a key driver. And so the combination of that offers additional growth opportunities.","So yeah, all-in-all, I definitely expect to have above group average. But do also recognize that within product inspection we have a certain project-based aspect of certain lumpiness. If you have a global key account that is rolling out a big project across the world this can have an impact on a quarter-to-quarter comparisons. But, all-in-all, it should be very nice growth.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Appreciate all the color. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, good afternoon. Bill, just if you can break down within China the lab versus industrial growth rate in the first quarter? And could you sort of talk about the sustainability of the lab business being double-digit there, I think that's eight straight quarters on a row it's growing over 10% give us some details on that.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yes. And so first comment on lab is that \u2013 it is eight straight quarters, it's probably the average is around kind of eyeballing it's probably 20% during that period. We were in the 20% range again this past quarter in lab. Our industrial business was up low-double digits and retail was actually flat. So, the business is performing well. We are doing quite well with this new focus that we implemented a couple of years ago on priority segments and we are very happy with the performance.","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","I was actually visiting the team just three weeks ago, I had a chance to visit also the new facilities and I do have a very broad-based business review. And one thing that I really particularly liked is the resource shifting that we have done over the years to follow the market opportunities really play very well. And Bill just shared with you, the lab growth and this is not a coincidence. We really recognized early on the lab has promising end user markets. We continue to invest in these.","As on the Industrial part, we did actually reduce resources to certain industry segments that we felt have no long-term or attractive long-term prospects. And seeing how that played out was really powerful. I could say similar thing also about the regional presence. So, we for example in the times where China wasn't growing so well we did \u2013 we visit our local office setup that we have. We had in the all-time many local offices across China and we recognize today that there is not the same necessity for that because you have just much better infrastructure.","Mobility is better, phones are better, education of people are better. We have ERP system that is better and so on. So, the team really leveraged these opportunities and we allocated resources to drive more growth and that's what we see in our current numbers. And I certainly expect that this will continue to help us to outgrow this market.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","That's helpful. And then one more for you, Olivier, I think in your prepared comments with respect to the product inspection business, I think you mentioned an ERP roll-out in the first quarter that may have been disruptive. What exactly was that? And then at a higher level on Blue Ocean could you remind us where you are in terms of the status of the roll-out and implementation? And what the magnitude of the CapEx roll-off is which I think should fall in 2019, if I'm right Bill?","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","I'll take the first part and then hand over to Bill. So the first part is the Blue Ocean ERP rollout was for our checkweighing business in Germany. That was quite an important, but also demanding roll-out because in the product inspection business we have a lot of engineered solutions and that requires some new functionality in our template. And in essence our checkweighing business was here to start for it.","And as you can imagine such a roll-in takes always a lot of attention of the management. You have always in the first few weeks, sometimes also months, and some learning curve to go down and some fine-tuning and that's the impact that we saw in first quarter. I have already seen that we are \u2013 we called up most of it already in April and the remainder will happen in the next few months.","So feel good about that. And in that sense not different to what we experienced in all the other roll-ins that we have. I think that's just a natural thing. We highlighted here on the call because it had a certain impact within one quarter.","In terms of where we stand, we have rolled, or we have implemented Blue Ocean pretty much on all the significant producing organization. And there is one important one left that it is actually in Tampa. So the one that we just moved facility this is something that will follow, but otherwise we are very advanced. And when it comes to the market organization we are also very advanced. But there are more countries to come. And so we will continue on that journey certainly for a couple of more quarters. But if I look for the whole group, I think in the meantime we are far beyond 80% of the users that are already on the system. And I think that gives you the flavor that we are very, very advanced on the whole program.","Bill maybe on the CapEx one?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yeah. I think you'll see CapEx maybe to not get it confused between maybe CapEx in total you'll see going down already some next year and in 2020 further. I think that you'll see our cash flow conversion which is already pretty good, get even better in the coming years.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions, everyone.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","You're welcome.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Bill, in your prepared remarks on gross margins you called out a few considerations there for the year-on-year trend. I think there was mix the PI issue that we've touched on here a little bit. Can you quantify any of those?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Sure. And maybe I cover the biggest topics and then kind of maybe in a quantitative way and give you some qualitative on the other item. So, I think the biggest single item was actually a benefit from our price increases. So, our price increases in the quarter were about 230 basis points and that translated to about 100-basis-point benefit to our gross margin.","The biggest negative item was that we had currencies going against us by about 60 basis points, okay. And then there were a series of kind of smaller items that added up a little bit. I would say one is of course, there were some volume effect partly explained by the Easter movement between the years, so a little bit of volume.","In the product inspection business, we had as Olivier mentioned this, on the one hand the startup of the Tampa facility. So they weren't running at full capacity I think for two to three week period there and when we ramped up the engineered-to-order part of the Garvens business in Germany that Olivier referred to there was that first month there, I think their output was roughly 60% of what a normal thing was. That's frankly a planned startup when we were doing that business.","So, the other interesting item that didn't really have an impact, but I think it's good for you guys to focus on a bit is, material costs were basically flat in the quarter. And I do expect that that's going to get tougher as the rest of the year plays out. I think we'll be able to address that with better price increases, but I think if you look that material line, our current index kind of an inflation index that we measure our year-on-year buying is running almost exactly 100 right now. And I would expect that by the end of the year that'll probably be closer to 101. Did I answer your question?","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. It's a lot of moving parts Bill, but you did it. I really appreciate that. And then the follow-up that I wanted to...","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Hey, Steve, if I could interrupt you maybe \u2013 when you say a lot of moving parts, I realize I could easily be confusing. Maybe kind of get into the bottom line because I think one thing is to analyze the pieces of what happened this quarter, but maybe if I could give you some comments about the remainder of the year.","So sitting here today, I continue to think that on a constant currency basis our gross margins will be up 40 basis points to 50 basis points for the full year which actually in this most recent quarter, the right sheet in front of me on a constant currency basis our gross profit was down by 42 basis points for some of these reasons we covered. And so you can imagine then it gets better going forward.","And then because of currency you'll continue to see headwind down the line but that's a little bit cosmetic. I think the best way to look at it is in constant currency to measure from a performance point of view. But by the time we get through the full year, I think what you'll see is the constant currency improvement in our gross margin will be offset by currency. So year-on-year for the full year I think our gross profit margin will be pretty close to flat.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's perfect. Thank you very much.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Hopefully I think [Technical Difficulty] (00:39:32) more moving parts, Steve. So what was your second question?","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","The second was actually on China and in a scenario where the tariff issue does become real. I can appreciate that \u2013 for the team, be a pretty substantial operational challenge. But given that you guys have mitigation plans maybe it would just be helpful to understand those mitigation plans a little bit more deeply alternative sourcing import\/export dynamics there.","What I'm wondering is while I really appreciate the quantification of the potential impacts of a tariff scenario, what I'm wondering is given the implementation or offset programs that you have in mind is there a scenario where this does become real in terms of the financial impact or can we really work around it very effectively? Thanks.","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","So let me take the first part. Operationally, it wouldn't be too disruptive to us in a sense that one of the key mitigation factor is pricing. And we have already started to do all this analysis. We know how to implement these things and that would certainly work well.","And then on the supply chain itself, yeah, there is some parts that are supplier related, where you do a sampling and all that stuff, but it's not that major. And in that sense we feel this is absolutely manageable. I think the part that would be much bigger for us in terms of the impact is if it's -- if it influences the world economy. That's really the bigger part.","But the other part as Bill described in the prepared remarks in terms of million dollars it's not so huge. And we have this mitigating factor that we feel actually our plans are already quite solid and we would know how to do it.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yeah, maybe one additional to Olivier's comments would be is that I think in the course of a full year, we probably could largely offset what would happen. But maybe in the first quarter or two quarters, Steve there might be a little bit of catch up work.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Exactly, what we needed. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks. Bill, I appreciate all the color you gave on margins. Just as we think about the sequential progression here should we expect 2Q margins to be up or down I guess in light of the facility consolidation and ERP and some of these other transit issues?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Let me get my favorite cheat sheet in front of me so in Q2 we would say margin should be flattish which would be approaching 30 basis point or 40 basis point improvement in a constant currency basis.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. And then on guidance you're raising by $0.10 you beat by $0.01. Can you maybe just obviously you touched on margins earlier, but is the rest of that from buybacks?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","I think the biggest thing what we're kind of looking at what would be appropriate guidance. I think for us is if we look at where we expect to be at the midpoint of the year, we're ahead of where we thought we would be three months ago. And so we adjusted our guidance accordingly. There's always a little bit of speculation Tycho for what the second half of the year can bring. But at this stage we see no reason to change our assumptions for the second half of the year.","So it's kind of this combination of the beat which we described here in the current quarter. And then how we view the full first half of the year compared to maybe what we felt three months ago.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. And then I guess lastly on lab. Obviously that's continued to perform well early days on NIH increase but are you starting to see any benefit from that yet here in the U.S.?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","I mean as part of our business that has the most impact from NIH budgets would be our pipette businesses. What I can tell you that given everything kind of going on in those two businesses right now we're very happy with their performance but it would be tough for us to specifically link it to NIH and I didn't really look at April year-to-date by segment.","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yeah. I would say our whole bio life science business in U.S. did very well. Typically that's the Rainin and the auto-chem business that has particular exposure to that. Both businesses did very well on that one. But the NIH we are not so much exposed, the pipette business is really one of the most. So that's so why I answer yes bio life science in general.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Charles Steinman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey guys. This is Charlie on for Patrick. Just curious as we kind of trend through the year putting into our models kind of for the lab and industrial business looks like lab was probably the toughest comp of the year. So, are we in a position to think that that business might actually accelerate as we actually go throughout the rest of the year?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","So, understood the question. I think at this point we're largely seeing maybe next quarter not as much, but it could be in Q3 and Q4 we see some modest increases there, yes.","Charles Steinman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it, makes sense. And then just on pricing I think when you were answering Steve's question you said that pricing in the quarter was up 230 bps. I think that was probably a little above where we were modeling, so just kind of any update on pricing expectations for the year?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Well some of that reflects Charlie that we started to see some inflation so we did see some moves there and started to implement some things in response to it. We do see higher wage growth for example in some other areas.","What I would say is that Shawn Vadala and his team are working on some mid-year pricing topics. I think we haven't finalized what that's going to be in part because we want to see how the tariff situation plays out. But I feel reasonably confident that we can do something that brings net dollars hopefully to the second half of the year.","Charles Steinman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","You're next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Baird. Your line is open.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good afternoon. Olivier could you kind of speak maybe for a minute or two just to when we talk about China industrial I'm curious how developed and how much scale there is to the PI business versus the core industrial business?","And maybe we could just start there, but I'm curious how each of those two pieces did relative to Bill's low-double-digit growth rate for the quarter.","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yeah. So I will start to say that we \u2013 our mix that we have in China is different to the global mix that we have. If I look to the West and then in particular in the U.S., we have a very high share of product inspection, versus core industrial, and in China, it's still the reverse, core industrial is much bigger than product inspection. And that is historically driven.","You will always see that more mature markets have more demand for product inspection equipment, because it's very much quality driven, it's very much about automated packaging and even the industry structure is different. We, in that sense, have benefited heavily in the past for this industrial business.","Our product inspection business in China has been growing nicely in the last couple of years, but it is still underrepresented. And then in that sense, I do expect that product inspection is outgrowing our core industrial business, in particular also China. This has not always been the case every quarter, but in the long-term should be that way.","To be specific on a group level, product inspection is roughly 17%. As in China, it is 5% of total sales. That alone gives you a clear indication how much upside we have when China starts to further mature and has an industry structure similar to what we have in the West.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I get you. And then, can I just back the question up and when I look at industrial for the full year in 2018, for calendar 2018, is both PI and core industrial, are both of those businesses expected to be kind of plus mid-singles? I mean, is that kind of order of magnitude should they both grow about, in parity?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Sorry. Just to make sure I got your question. We weren't sure if you were asking what China industrial or total industrial?","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I left China. Sorry. I left China. I backed up to the corporate level. Just curious, given the start here in the first quarter and I realized the comps and things, but I'm curious, do both pieces of industrial kind of grow at that, maybe Mettler average core growth rate?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","I think you'll see them both finish the year at about the same growth rate. But I think you'll see the product inspection business growing faster on average for the remainder of this year.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, okay. And then just, maybe the last question. It may not direct us back. Olivier, could you just kind of update us a little bit on the Field Turbo program? And maybe, are we on track through April here for full year investments there, and maybe where they're slanted, where they're weighted?","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yeah. So the program is very much ongoing. We do these in waves. And I always said, I would continue with the programs as long as I feel the market offers growth opportunities and I definitely feel that way. And I see \u2013 continue to see very good results on it. I have seen that last year when I had detailed business reviews with the countries. I mentioned before I was in China, but I also spent quite some time in Southeast Asia was particularly excited about seeing the impact of Field Turbos in Indonesia, Vietnam and so on. So, my commitments to continue with the program is ongoing.","In terms of waves, we certainly had an important wave, review wave end of the year where I committed to quite a lot of additional head count. And there's another one upcoming here or more in the summer.","And from a regional perspective that might be \u2013 the last one that I expect \u2013 also the next one is certainly more weighted now to the emerging markets. As when I looked a few years ago, we were more focused also in Western markets. So that changes a little bit in terms of business mix. That's kind of unchanged still very much laboratory and product inspection business that benefits from it.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great. Thank you much.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Thank you Rick.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi good afternoon.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Hi Derik.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","It's the \u2013 a lot of my questions have been asked but just some cleanup. Can you \u2013 anything that we need to watch out on like the interest income line? Obviously rates are moving up and just sort of wondering what sort of -- how do you look at net interest expense for the full year?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Mary has got everything locked down. Derik would be the short answer.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","We're highly fixed right now, and have been for a few quarters.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I think we're modeling about $36 million for the year in net interest expense. Is that about right?","Mary T. Finnegan - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yeah see that \u2013 hey Derik I think closer to about $33 million, $34 million for interest. And then of course we have other income is income of about $6.5 million. Does that make sense?","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it.","Mary T. Finnegan - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Okay.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. And the $1.6 million for the pension continues on in the other income line?","Mary T. Finnegan - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","That's correct.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Correct.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And for the full year for the Biotix acquisition, is that still tracking at about 1%? It looks it was a little bit \u2013 CAD below where we had modeled it for the quarter, is that still a good way to look at it somewhere in the 0.5% to 1% range?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","It'll be 1% for the full year, but without really any impact on fourth quarter. So that's somewhat above 1% for the first three quarters of the year.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it, okay. Thanks.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Hi, good afternoon guys. Just trying to put together the picture here in sort of interesting economic environment, right? You talked about inflation taking up and pricing being maybe a bit better or accelerating and the material cost accelerating and yet we've got industrial here, it's tough comps that were sort of flat to down. And growth in general seems good but then PMIs have ticked down. I guess just trying to think through like this environment versus environments you've seen in the past. I guess it seems like an odd picture a bit comparative to what we would sort of expect at this part of the cycle.","And so as you just start planning and thinking, I mean, what are the sorts of things you're keyed in on or looking at? And do you sort of agree with the idea that the PMIs while they're slower are still kind of elevated and suggesting that growth will be quite good for a while? Is it really just a question then in your mind of duration given how long we're sort of into this cycle?","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Hey, Ross. Actually yes. But I would also say that when I look at our early indicators lead generation and so on, we have no signals of slowdown at all. And we still feel that the world economy is very strong. We know that we are facing these comparisons topics and that's certainly true for China, but there are no clouds out there that worry us. But of course, we want to stay agile if something happens.","But you hear me talking before about Field Turbo the same is true (00:56:20) investments in marketing, investments overall. We are very much in the growth mode and we will adjust our plans if need be, but at this stage we are all in growth models.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","I would kind of add to that. We've talked about it in the past Ross that, I mean, yes, we prefer higher GDP growth than lower, but we don't need a huge GDP growth. We need people to stick to their replacement cycles. When they do that we take our piece of that, we take a little bit of share and we can do well in that type of environment. So, yeah, that would be my addition.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Hi. Good evening. Couple of quick questions for you. Bill, I was just wondering first if you could comment on the product inspection business here in the quarter. I mean I apologize if you had already commented on this, as I'm jumping on late. But, how much of the software trends were related to the internal disruptions you referenced versus what you think is going on in the market? And then I have a follow-up.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Okay. So \u2013 hey, so we were down 5% in the quarter to put one number on it. And if you look at the prior year comp we were plus 15%. And so the biggest single reason is we had a tough comp.","The second we had two then kind of what I would describe as operational issues where we had expected reductions in our capacity capability for lack of a better expression. One related to we were moving a very large facility in Tampa and are \u2013 it took a few weeks for our guys to get fully ramped up there.","And then the second was we went live with the new ERP system in the middle of the quarter in our German checkweighing business. That business in April its output was back to normal, but in the month of February when they went live it was \u2013 they were producing at a lower than historical levels. So those two items were probably the \u2013 maybe had a little bit of an additional impact. And I guess to a certain extent there was probably some Easter impact for our European PI business but it would be tough to quantify the last three.","The biggest item is the tough comp. And by the way we also have a tough comp in product inspection next quarter. But I think if I remember right Olivier commented about if you look already at April year-to-date, I believe our business was already caught up to flattish or something.","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","I mean in essence the quarter came in as expected. You might recall that a lot of time on the call we did already anticipate that this will be a tough quarter because the comparisons and the operational topics we did anticipate that. This wasn't a surprise.","Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you and then as a follow-up for Olivier, I saw in your press release you made a reference to new products, which I know historically new products have not been a major driver to overall reported growth, so I was just wonder if there's anything different with new products overall?","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","No, no. It's the constant enhancement of new products, so not at all. In the prepared remarks I had one example but throughout the quarter we have multiple new products but none that would really move the needle.","Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay, very good. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Hi.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I was hoping you could just update us on growth in aftermarket revenue, service consumables and where some of the initiatives you're working on there to drive growth?","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Okay. Let me take \u2013 so first of all, we continue to experience here good progress, operational progress but also all the sales and marketing programs that we have around service. I'm very happy how that goes. This is true particularly also for the contract, service contract business (01:00:50) of service. When you look at our numbers, we always need to outgrow with service contracts because our break\/fix business is more challenged. Our products last longer, they're better. And so we compensate that actually with having more labor content in our service offering, more pre-emptive maintenance programs and so on. So that's all going well.","When Bill afterward shares with you the Q1 numbers, please keep in mind that for service actually Eastern has a much bigger impact, and in that sense we report to you the Q numbers really have a good picture of how the momentum is for the year. But, Bill, maybe quickly comment on the numbers?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","So we grew 3% in the quarter. Just as a reminder, last year for the full year we grew 7%, or just shy of 7%. And in the first quarter of last year, we grew by just short of 11%. So if you look at it on a two-year basis in Q1, we're just north of 7% and that's kind of in line with what we grew last year. So, we feel service business, as Olivier mentioned, key strategic focus and execution seems to go well there.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. That's great. And sorry if I missed it but did you quantify how much specifically you thought Easter impacted the overall results? And the European results specifically?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","I think it's tough to do specifically, but I think if you look for example at service, last year we grew 7%. In the first quarter we grew 11% of that 7%, and then if I look at the Q1 of this year we grew 3%. So our two-year growth rate is basically right in line with our \u2013 what we achieved last year. So somehow in the area of service because it's labor intensive, it's a bigger impact than it is on product but you see it also on our product business.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Very helpful. Thank you.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","And I guess Jack maybe one more thing. I made a point in the script to say that April year-to-date we were a healthy mid-single-digit which of course speaks to kind of where we are if you throw out Easter effects.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Make sense. Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. Your line is open.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","Yes, pretty much everything's been asked. But I do want to ask about Stern Drive and some of the progress you're making with initiatives there?","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yeah. Very happy about how that's going. To recall we launched that last year and one of the countries that actually is the pilot for here and most advanced is China. And when I was down there, I could visit our four facilities there and I was really very, very happy to see how this caused momentum. We see it on the floor. We see it in all the training communication and activities of our teams. And I start to clearly see it also in the numbers in the KPIs that we have. So, very pleased.","The program proves that it's scalable. That's always the key success factor. And I definitely compare Stern Drive also to Spinnaker in the sense that we recognize that it's a journey. And we get more sophisticated every year, every way.","And one of the key success factor is that we are doing that with our teams, with our employees. This is not just top down toolboxes or methodologies, no, this is very much with an inclusion of the teams and that helps us actually to get this continuous improvement. So bottom line, very happy.","In terms of quantification, the way you need to look at it, this is feeding our margin expansion. You see Stern Drive impacting material costs but it definitely also impacts productivity and so the whole margin expansion program.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","All right. That sounds good. And Bill, do you happen to have the number of shares that were purchased in the quarter?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Mary's going to look that up for you.","Mary T. Finnegan - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Sure. Jason, we repurchased 187,900 shares in the quarter.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","All right. Thanks very much.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

I will start with a summary of the quarter and then Bill will provide details on our financial results. We will also provide an overview of our guidance for the fourth quarter and next year. I will have some additional comments and we will then open the lines for Q&A.","The highlights for the quarter are on page 3 of the presentation. We are pleased with our sales growth in the quarter, particularly in light of the very strong sales in the prior year. In the third quarter of this year, sales growth in Asia\/Rest of World was excellent, driven by growth in China. In the Americas and Europe, sales growth in Laboratory and Industrial was good but, as expected, we had a meaningful decline in Food Retailing sales.","Overall, demand in our markets remains good and we are pleased with our strong execution. Our productivity and margin initiatives continue to yield results which drove strong growth in EPS in the quarter. Our outlook for the remainder of the year and for 2018 is quite positive. We are also pleased to have completed the acquisition of Biotix. I will cover that in some more details later in the call. For now, let me turn it over to Bill to cover the financials.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Thanks, Olivier, and hello, everybody. Sales were $698.8 million in the quarter, an increase of 6% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, our sales increased by 7% as currencies helped sales growth by about 1% in the quarter. There are two considerations in evaluating our local currency sales growth for the quarter. First, we had a significant decline in our U.S. and European Retail businesses and, second, acquisitions benefited growth in our U.S. Lab business. Excluding Retail and the impact of M&A, the rest of our business grew organically by 8% in local currency during the third quarter.","On slide 4, we show local currency sales growth by region. Sales grew 2% in the Americas and Europe. As I just mentioned, growth in both of these regions were impacted by the significant decline in Food Retailing sales, which was driven by a number of factors including strong prior year results. Excluding Food Retailing, local currency sales growth was approximately 5% in the Americas and 4% in Europe.","Turning to Asia\/Rest of World, we had 15% growth, driven by terrific results in China, which had local currency sales growth of 28% in the quarter. Retail did not impact Asia\/Rest of World or our China growth rates.","On the next slide, we show the results on a year-to-date basis. Sales grew by 9% in the first nine months of the year. In the Americas, sales grew by 8%. In Europe, sales were up 6%, while in Asia\/Rest of World, sales increased by 13% year-to-date. On a year-to-date basis, sales growth benefited by approximately 1% from acquisitions, while growth in the Americas benefited by 2%.","On slide number 6, we outlined sales growth by product line. In Laboratory sales, we grew 9%, 7% of which was organic, while our Industrial business increased by 8%, very much driven by our China growth, and our Food Retailing business declined by 18%.","The next slide shows year-to-date growth by product line. Laboratory sales grew by 10%, Industrial increased 11% , while Food Retailing has declined 4%. Acquisitions benefited Lab growth by about 2% on a year-to-date basis. All the comparisons in this page are on local currency and versus the prior year.","All right. Now I'd like to turn to slide number 8 and let me walk you through some key items in our P&L. Our gross margins reached 57.3%. That's a 50-basis-point improvement over the prior year amount of 56.8%. We continue to benefit from pricing and we also had productivity gains in the quarter. Offsetting this was mix and foreign exchange.","R&D amounted to $32.5 million in the quarter, that's a 6% increase in local currency. Our growth in the quarter for R&D was very much a result of investments in various product development programs. SG&A was $204.9 million in the quarter, that's an increase of 8% in local currency versus the prior year. Variable comp and investments in our Field Turbo program as well as some new marketing programs contributed to the increase.","Adjusted operating income was $162.9 million in the quarter, and that's a 7% increase over the prior year amount of $151.7 million. Adjusted operating margins reached 23.3%. A couple of final items on the P&L. Amortization was $10.7 million in the quarter, while our interest expense was $8.2 million.","In terms of taxes, for purposes of adjusted EPS, we are reflecting our estimated annual effective tax rate of 22%. For the quarter, our actual tax rate was 25%. As a reminder, the difference is due to the timing of stock option exercises and the impact of the new policy that went into effect at the beginning of the year with respect to the excess tax benefit of these exercises. We remain comfortable with our full year estimated tax rate of 22% which is before non-recurring discrete tax items.","Moving to fully diluted shares. This amounted to $26.3 million in the quarter, and that's a 2.2% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program offset in part by higher shares outstanding due to the accounting change I just mentioned. Adjusted EPS reached $4.36 per share, which was a 12% increase over the prior year amount of $3.89 per share.","On a reported basis, EPS in the quarter was $3.99, and that compared to $3.77 in the prior year. Reported EPS includes $0.10 of restructuring and $0.07 of purchased intangible amortization and also $0.05 of acquisition costs related to Biotix. In addition, and as already mentioned, reported EPS includes $0.15 of higher reported taxes due to the timing of stock option exercises.","On the next slide, we show our year-to-date results which were very strong. We achieved local currency sales growth of 9%. Our operating income has increased by 15% and our adjusted earnings per share have increased by 21%.","That's it for the P&L and I now want to talk about cash flow. In the quarter, as expected, free cash flow was down versus the prior year due to the timing of capital expenditures related to our previously discussed facilities expansion program. Free cash flow amounted to $111.9 million in Q3, and that compares to $125.6 million in the prior year. Our working capital statistics remain solid, our DSO is at 40 days while our ITO is at 4.5 times. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $284.3 million, and that compares to $263.7 million in the prior year.","On a per share basis, this is an increase of 11%. For the full year, we now expect cash flow to be in the $410 million range. On a per share basis, excluding the large facilities expansion program, this represents a 15% increase over our 2016 level.","Let me now make a few comments on the acquisition of Biotix, which we completed in the third quarter. Biotix manufactures and distributes plastic consumables associated with pipettes including tips, tubes and reagent reservoirs used in the life science market. Biotix's annual sales of approximately $35 million, we paid $105 million or approximately 10 times EBITDA for the business.","Based on the results over the next two years, we could also have the potential earnout payment beyond base purchase price. Biotix is a unique strategic fit with our reigning pipettes business on several fronts, and we're very pleased to have acquired it. Olivier will provide additional background on Biotix shortly. With this acquisition, we have adjusted our share repurchases in 2007, and estimate that we would repurchase $400 million in total, which is in line with our estimate of free cash flow for this year.","Now, let's turn to guidance. We continue to believe that our full year 2017 local currency sales growth will be approximately 8%. However, we're raising our EPS guidance and now expect to achieve EPS of approximately $17.50 per share for the full year 2017. This compares to $17.25 to $17.35 per share we previously disclosed. The improvement is principally due to our Q3 B (11:58), as well as a more favorable FX environment. With respect to the fourth quarter, we expect local currency sales growth of approximately 5.5%. This includes approximately 1% growth from Biotix. We assume adjusted EPS would be approximately $5.90, which reflects a growth rate of 12%.","One final comment in 2017. The impact of more favorable currency environment on earnings in the second half of this year is largely offset by bonus expense due to the very strong results we had in the first two quarters.","Now, let's turn to 2018. We're very pleased with our strong performance, particularly in the second half of 2016 and for the first three quarters of this year. The economic environment in the Americas and Europe is good. Market conditions have recovered in China, and we are currently benefiting from some pent-up demand, especially in our industrial business.","Similar to how we have developed full-year guidance in the past, we are assuming market conditions remain largely consistent with the current environment. We're not assuming changes in the global economy nor are we assuming changes in the currency rates versus current levels. That being said, we want to acknowledge that we see very limited opportunity for improvements in the global economy or the foreign exchange environment.","In terms of things we can't control, we feel very good. We are confident in our growth strategies, which are yielding good results based on strong execution. We should continue to gain share in our productivity, and margin enhancement initiatives should deliver further operating profit growth.","One final comment, and as I've mentioned this to you in the past, comparisons matter. We'll have some challenging comparisons in 2018. I specifically refer here to our growth in China, as well as in our product inspection business, and this will especially be so in the early part of the year.","Taking all of these factors into account, we expect local currency sales growth to be approximately 6% in 2018. This will include approximately 1% from Biotix. We expect this to result in adjusted EPS in the range of $19.65 per share to $19.85 per share, and that's a growth rate of between 12% and 13%.","In terms of our quarterly guidance for 2018, as usual, we will provide that on our upcoming calls. However, I know you will be updating your models, and I want to point out that we'll have some very tough comparisons in the first half of next year, but particularly in the first quarter.","As a reminder, we had 11% organic sales growth and 36% EPS growth in Q1 of this year. With these comparisons, we would estimate that sales growth in Q1 2018 would be in the 4% range and EPS growth will likely be in the mid to high single-digits.","In terms of currency impacts on sales growth, we expect currency to increase sales by about 2% in the fourth quarter of 2017. This will result in basically a flat currency impact for the full year on sales. In 2018, we expect currencies to increase sales by approximately 75 basis points.","Finally, in terms of cash flow next year, we would expect free cash flow to be approximately $450 million. We would expect our capital expenditures to again be higher than normal due to the completion of our facilities expansion program. As we've discussed in the past, we're currently expanding and consolidating our product inspection business in the U.S. into a new facility in Tampa. We're also expanding our production inspection manufacturing in the UK. And finally, to reduce our Swiss cost exposure, we're consolidating certain of our Swiss operations into an expanded facility at our headquarters in Greifensee.","The timing of these expenditures has been delayed since we first spoke to you about them, and we've also modestly expanded the UK and Swiss projects, given the level of expected business at these locations. We estimate CapEx at $130 million dollars in 2018 and expect to complete the expansion projects late next year or the early part of 2019. Thereafter, we would expect our CapEx as a percentage of sales to be in the 3% range. Excluding these facility CapEx on a per share basis, we expect to increase NCO by approximately 11% in 2018, which is in line with our EPS growth. In terms of share repurchases, we'd expect them to be in the $500 million range in 2018.","Okay. That's it from my side. And I'd now like to turn it over to Olivier.","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Thank you, Bill.","Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab had a very good growth in the quarter. Almost all product lines performed very well. Our strong product pipeline, Field Turbo investments, and continued strong Spinnaker sales and marketing program are all contributing to favorable results and position us well for 2018.","We expect good growth in 2018 in Lab, but acknowledge spending by our biopharma customers won't be as favorable as we have seen these last few years. Industrial also had good growth in the quarter, with core-industrial up high single-digits. Core-industrial was particularly strong in China, but Europe had solid growth as did Americas if we adjust for some challenging comparisons in transportation and logistics in the prior year. We would expect solid growth in core-industrial as we finish 2017 and look to 2018.","Product inspection was up 7% in the quarter and 14% year-to-date. We are well-positioned in this business, which we have discussed with you in the past. Given timing of project and prior year comparisons, we would expect this business to be down in Q4, but expect mid-single-digit growth in 2018.","Finally, Retail was down 18% in the quarter. As Bill mentioned, this was expected given prior year strong growth and timing of project. We would expect Retail to be flat in the fourth quarter and low single-digit growth in 2018. We continue to manage this business for profit growth and return on invested capital.","Now let me make some additional comments by geography.","Sales growth in the Americas was solid in laboratory and product inspection. Core Industrial also did well if we exclude the impact of some project business in transportation and logistics.","Europe also had good growth across products \u2013 most product lines, except Food Retailing, which was down. Asia, Rest of the World grew double digits driven by excellent growth in China. We had very strong growth in both Lab and Industrial in China with almost all product lines showing excellent growth. The performance reflects good economic environment, which benefited in part with additional activity in advance of the start of their five-year Congress meeting. We are also benefiting from our initiative to shift resources to faster growing markets, in Industrial and Lab business.","Our outlook for China is good, but they will face tougher comparisons beginning in the fourth quarter. We would expect sales growth to be in the mid-single-digit range for remainder of this year as we look to 2018.","Finally, service grew 7% in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis.","That concludes my comments on the business. I now want to provide some context to our acquisition of Biotix, which we completed in September. Headquartered in San Diego with manufacturing in Mexico, Biotix manufactures and distributes plastic consumables associated with liquid handling, specifically pipette tips, tubes and reagent reservoirs primarily used in the life science market.","As most of you know, we are a leader in liquid handling through our Rainin subsidiary, which manufactures and sells pipettes and tips. Rainin is the leader in U.S. in pipettes and is widely recognized for its innovation, particularly in terms of ergonomic and electronic pipettes.","Many of you saw this firsthand at our Investor Meeting at Rainin last summer. Rainin is somewhat unique in the pipette market in that it sells direct through its own sales force, which we believe provides us a key competitive advantage, particularly around our ability to leverage our Spinnaker sales and marketing program.","This acquisition is a great complement to Rainin as we will gain access to indirect distribution channels with strong secondary brands. Our strategy is to run a dual-channel, dual-brand strategy, with Rainin focused on direct sales and service and Biotix focused on indirect distribution channels and OEMs. We have successfully implemented this strategy with balances, where we used Mettler-Toledo brands on a direct basis and all-house (21:37) on an indirect basis.","Biotix will also lead our efforts to support large OEM customers in this market, like the companies who offer robotic liquid handling solutions. Overall, they have been more successful than Rainin in this niche, and with access to Rainin's technology should be even more successful going forward.","Biotix has a strong technology focus, and over time we expect to achieve synergies between Rainin and Biotix in the R&D and supply chain. We also expect to leverage our international presence to expand their footprint at presently almost 70% of sales are in the Americas.","In the near term, Biotix will be run as a separate entity with management team intact. Biotix should add approximately 1% to our sales growth and is modestly accretive over the next year. We believe Biotix is a strong strategic fit and are excited about the potential and our further expansion in the attractive pipette consumable market.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We are very pleased with strong results year-to-date. Our outlook for the remainder of the year and for 2018 is positive, and we believe we are well-positioned to continue to gain share and deliver strong results.","I want now to ask the operator to open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from Dan Arias with Citi.","Bryan A. Kipp - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, guys. This is Bryan Kipp on behalf of Dan. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess for me just to start with Biotix, just because we kind of ended on that, when we were out at the Rainin facility, you guys highlighted a lot of the automation manufacturing that you guys were doing for pipette tips and how gross margin expansion has accelerated from those efforts. How should we think about Biotix's manufacturing facilities and whether that's an incremental opportunity for them as well?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Okay. So first, as mentioned, they're in Mexico. So the labor costs are meaningfully lower, I think, in the area of 20% of what we have up in the Oakland area. But I do think there are opportunities for more automation than they have today. I don't think you'll see it looking exactly like the Rainin facility in that sense because of labor costs, but also because of a little bit of their business mix. It's smaller, so they probably have \u2013 let's call it shorter runs on the injection molding equipment than we might have at the Rainin facility.","What I would say is that we're certainly hoping to work with Biotix to raise their growth profile. They should be able to grow faster than Rainin in the coming years. And there will be a lot of leverage in, and a big part of the synergies will be some of the leverage that will come in their manufacturing facilities from that additional growth.","Bryan A. Kipp - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, helpful. Thank you. And a quick follow-up, Bill, I guess I was surprised by your comment that you said that you see little opportunity for improving the economy plus FX environment. Just given the macro data we've seen out of the Europe lately and continued strength in China, can you give any order commentary around that? Is there any anecdotal comments you can give as to why you think there's not a lot of further upside room from here?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","So you have to look at it first maybe on the currency side in the context of we've had a currency headwind as a company for 10 years, and this is our first year of having one. So I don't know, maybe we feel like we finally got a present instead of coal in our Christmas stocking. I can't imagine that this will happen two years in a row or further improve from here.","And I think the other comment is and we've been saying it for a while is since the end of 2016, just a global economy for our kind of company has been going really well. On the one hand, we're not trying to say that we see clouds on the horizon, but if I look back at my 20 years, I'd struggle to name a point in time where you had so many parts of the globe acting at a good level. And so, that would tend to tell me this has \u2013 we'll have some hiccups over time. I hope there are hiccups in the smaller economies that impact us or smaller sectors of the economy.","So I think that my comment should be read in that way. It's not that we see a big cloud on the horizon, it's more of the, hey, it's really good out there and it's hard to imagine it getting better.","Bryan A. Kipp - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And order commentary here or order trends are in line with kind of what you've stated to date on expectations, right, for 4Q and...","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yeah. For 4Q, but I would just comment that we're a short-cycle business, so yes, October orders were good, but Mettler-Toledo in total has, I don't know, a month and a half of backlog, so I wouldn't read too much into orders.","Bryan A. Kipp - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Awesome. All right, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Unknown Speaker","Hey, guys. This is actually Julie (27:07) on for Tycho. Thanks for taking my question. My first one is regarding Americas. So this quarter, I know you called out a slowdown in Food Retail, but even excluding that, Americas still grew 4%, which is a slowdown from last quarter of 10%. So, could you guys just give a little bit of color on what might be causing as a slowdown there?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Okay. So first, I just want to clarify a little bit on our numbers, so what we're saying is our organic growth in the Americas was about 5%. And I think as we had talked about a little bit on our last call, we do see tougher comps in a number of our U.S. businesses. So, for example, our product inspection business had a very strong second half last year and that would \u2013 to maybe just mention one, kind of pulling out my sheets now in front of me. In 2016, yeah, we had a good quarter, but particularly a good quarter in product inspection at 10% growth.","So, yeah. And then if you \u2013 our T&L business had \u2013 grew by \u2013 I think the number was 62% in the third quarter and that made for a little bit of tougher comp on the Industrial side.","Unknown Speaker","Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And then a follow-up on the Biotix acquisition. Just wondering if you could shed a little bit more color on the rationale given that the pipette business is tailored for the biopharma industry. And I think you mentioned that you expect a continued \u2013 a deceleration in the biopharma end market. So what's behind your rationale there? And then, specifically, if you could quantify the kind of growth that you're modeling for Biotix? And I think you mentioned it will be modestly margin accretive, but exactly how much, if you could quantify? Thank you.","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","So, let me take the first part of the strategic rationale, and then Bill can fill you in on the model. First, I want to say the biopharma markets remain still very attractive for us. We are more talking about that we are coming out of a period with very high growth rates and growth rates become a little bit more moderate. But we like the biopharma market very much. It's one of our key focus, and especially if we look on that globe, that's going to be a core market for us going forward. And I'd like actually when the mix goes up for us with the whole life science market is attractive.","Biotix is very synergistic. It strengthens the franchise. And there are synergies in the back-end that we talked about before. In terms of operations, there is a synergy in terms of R&D. And then, we feel we can play an interesting strategic card here by having two brands and two channels to the market. There is good growth potential for us here. And Biotix is clearly more focused to the U.S. market today, and we feel Mettler-Toledo can add value to also leverage the international presence that we have.","So, in some way, I would say it fits very well into our core strategy about the markets that we want to serve. And the second point is, we clearly see synergies, and I think we are the perfect home to develop that business.","In terms of the model, Bill?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yeah. So, maybe two comments on the model. So, their market share is relatively slow, but we think by teaming up there's a couple of specific opportunities that we can work with them on that we're pretty confident there'll be a double-digit growth business for the next three years; and that if we run that kind of through the model with some of the synergies that Olivier mentioned, we could move their operating profit or EBITDA kind of margins up well into the 20s from where they are today and that would mean even almost double the profit growth, pre-tax profit growth for the business that we have as compared to sales growth.","So, I think the return on invested capital, if we hit our model, which I think is pretty realistic, would be quite good in terms of returns here. But there \u2013 but just to be clear, and I maybe misheard you, the margins today at Biotix are meaningfully less than what we achieved at Rainin.","Unknown Speaker","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. Maybe just one on China. You obviously saw a big 3Q with high 20% growth there. Can you just talk through what areas were outsized growth, and then also why it's been slow so dramatically? And I think you're calling for mid single-digits even this quarter. I mean, was there a timing element in 3Q, pull forward, or maybe just kind of talk through that?","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yeah. Hey. So, China definitely exceeded our own expectations too, really, really happy. The market environment is very favorable. No question about that one, but our team also execute extremely well. All these growth programs that we have placed are paying dividends here. However, we need to realize we are benefiting also from pent-up demand, so this is very much true for the Industrial business.","For Industrial, we have seen that a couple of quarters where we had a difficult performance, and now we see customers coming back. And so, there's definitely a timing topic in this and that's also the reason why we caution going forward about expectations, we're talking about high single-digit growth rates here for Q4 and certainly next year This is partially because of comparisons, but also because we don't expect to continue to benefit from this pent-up demand as we did. We did also mention on the call there was a timing question around the congress that they have, that could have modestly also benefited us.","So, all in all, I think the situation that we have is \u2013 on the Lab, it continues to be very strong. Industrial, in particular, was an acceleration of growth, but not that specific one that will just stay that way. I think there we're going to see a more normalized growth going forward.","Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Then maybe one for Bill. So, on the margins next year, could you talk through pricing, raw material pricing, just the impact with gross profit margins for next year?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yeah. So, in terms of our gross profit margin, we've assumed that within pricing we should be able to do 150 bps that \u2013 and that on the material cost side that we'll see some of this continued increasing commodities, but that we ought to be able to offset it. So, we kind of assumed a neutral material cost environment. And I would say though if it gets a little bit worse on the material cost side, we probably could push pricing a little bit more to compensate for that. So, I think that combination is a realistic one.","And then, in terms of mix effects, I don't think that there's a big assumption one way or another. In terms of the overall gross profit margin, I think 50 bps is probably a good starting point based on today's currency. I think currency, just \u2013 because we have some top line benefit, the currency \u2013 I assume the currency might somewhat dilute the gross profit margin percentage even if it didn't hurt the dollars.","Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. And maybe just one last one if I could sneak it in. How are you thinking about the geographic breakdown in terms of growth for next year? Thank you.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Okay. So, in terms of geographic breakdown, we see that Asia\/Rest of World, we've built in something in that mid to high single-digit range assuming that China is a little bit of a tougher comp. For the Americas, we should grow mid single-digit organically and benefit \u2013 move up to high single-digits when you take in the impact of Biotix. And then, we're looking somewhere in that 2% to 4% range for Europe.","Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.","Zachary R. Wachter - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi .This is actually Zach Wachter, on for Steve. On the Food Retail line, your 2018 guide for a low single-digit growth sounds very much in line with the long-term model. I'm wondering if that assumes any sort of impact from new food regulations in Europe?","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Hey there. It's still a little bit benefit of this fiscalization, particularly actually France is adopting it; in Germany, it's pretty much implemented and the benefit over for us; but in France, we will still have some. But I wouldn't attribute too much upside from that. I think more it's a question of timing of projects. Typically, in retail we have bigger projects and we do see that things should be more normal next year. This year, we faced, first, comparisons topics, and then a few things that got postponed.","Zachary R. Wachter - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And given the draft of the tax reform that was passed around today, I'm wondering if you had any initial thoughts on that and potential impact from that?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","So \u2013 hey. There was a few pages to digest there, so we didn't quite get the model fully fired up. We actually had our board meeting today, so all the senior guys were tied up as well. So, I think, in terms of impact on our effective rate, a few highlights would tend to make me think there's no big upside, but no big downside either. I think the one that we were worried about when we first started talking about this was the border adjustability topic. And I guess, for a while now, we've known that won't be part of it.","We're not a big beneficiary of cash parked overseas and trying to repatriate that. As you guys know, our tax rate already reflects full repatriation. I think one of the things we found interesting was that the rules around CapEx expensing would be retroactive to the end of September, I guess, or sometime in September. And that's probably helpful in terms of we wouldn't want people deferring purchases into next year, that would make the fourth quarter more complicated. So we assume that's a good thing, but that's more a sales topic than in terms of our income tax rate.","Zachary R. Wachter - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And just one last quick one for context on Biotix. Could you give us what was the historical growth rate for the business maybe for the last two or three years?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","I would say it was in the 10% to 12% range. I think, if you count year-to-date through, let's say, last 12 month, the LTM ended September 30, and 2016, you probably get numbers in that range.","Zachary R. Wachter - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America.","Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks for taking the call. It's actually Mike Ryskin on for Derik. Solid quarter, guys. Congrats again. A lot of the questions have been asked. So I just want to follow up with some more fine points. On the China front, you recalled that you're seeing some pent-up demand and that's benefiting you. I'm wondering if you could sort of talk a bit more about that, what's the pipeline there, expectations for how long it will take to work through that demand, just trying to parse apart what you see is the sort of underlying growth rate versus a little bit more of a temporary boost as people work through back orders essentially?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","And maybe just a few context so I think I'm answering your question, but if you want further clarification, let me know. You guys will remember back in 2015, our Industrial business was down by 20% in China, and then last year it had started to \u2013 it was pretty much flat for the first three quarters of the year and then started growing 12% in the fourth quarter. And then the first three quarters of this year, it's been coming up from that level.","And I clearly \u2013 I think we all clearly think part of that growth rate in 2017 is the things that got deferred from 2015, this is what we referred to as pent-up demand. Now, we also had a pretty nice spike in our Lab business here in the third quarter and maybe some of that could be the result of the Communist Congress or People's Congress taking place. And in terms of what we \u2013 when we see this starting to get a little bit tougher as we already see now coming here in the fourth quarter, the fourth quarter was really a strong quarter for China. Last year, we grew by 15%, that was by far the strongest quarter we had in 2016 in China. Now we're saying that, hey, the comps will get tougher, we'll probably grow between 5% and 10% in the fourth quarter of this year. And I guess that's kind of the start of some of these tougher comps.","Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks. And then looking at sort of the 3Q performance vis-\u00e0-vis the 2018 guide, 6% local currency in both but without equivalent contribution from M&A, and yet in 3Q you had a pretty substantial headwind both in U.S. and Europe from Retail. So, for the 2018 guide, is it safe to say that the majority of the sort of conservatism in the guide related to the tough comps you're facing from 2017 or is there anything else in terms of you're seeing from the individual markets, whether it is a little bit of slowdown in the Lab or by geography?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yeah. So, I guess, the way we're looking at it is, you're right, the numbers for Q3, Q4 and 2018, if you look at the organic numbers, they're all kind of getting around to the same level. I think that if you pull out the Retail piece particularly, and I guess, if you look at our Q3 piece, we have quite a bit of growth coming out of China. We think that's got to go to a somewhat lower level. But we'll have \u2013 we see some pickups in other parts of the business.","I think we're happy with our mix kind of globally as well as by product category. We're getting the growth in the right places and we're optimistic for 2018.","Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. One last, and if I could squeeze it in, the last two years, some nice tuck-in M&A between Troemner and Biotix in areas where you really have a dominant position for both, can you talk a little bit about the deal pipeline going forward? Is this sort of we should expect about a 1% contribution from deals moving forward once these annualized?","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yeah. The strategy that we pursue on M&A has been very consistent for many years. We always have a couple of opportunities that we are working on. We have quite a sophisticated approach to identify targets and we nurture them. And the availability for these targets is very difficult to predict. You have seen us, as you mentioned, doing the Biotix and Troemner, these were two acquisition in the Lab space. Before that, we did a few ones in the product inspection area, and process analytics would be the third business line where we are focused on opportunities.","The fee (44:38) businesses offers additional acquisitions, they will certainly be all bolt-on. But it's not that I would feel like, oh, the track record of the last 12 months can be just extrapolated to the next 12 months. It's not \u2013 yeah, we'll see what comes, but again, I don't want to suggest that we will have every six months such a nice fate and such an attractive target as the last two that we could materialize here. But we will quite focus on opportunities, no question.","Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","Yes. What was the impact from price on revenue and gross margin in the quarter?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","So, about 2.5 points of price gain in the quarter and about half that was the impact on gross profit margin.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","And as far as 2018 guidance, what are you modeling for share repurchase?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","About 475 million, I think we said on the call about 0.5 billion. So, I think precisely it's about 475 million, I think, today.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","And then, finally, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what you're expecting from any kind of productivity improvements including Stern Drive (46:16) looking at 2018? Thanks.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Sure. So, we've built in an assumption around incremental operating margins with our typical something north of 30% on a currency-neutral basis. And if you look into what are the details that make that up, you would see that we've built in productivity assumptions in both our SG&A area as well as in our factory supply chain.","Those numbers would approach probably high-single-digit millions, but we're also making investments in Field Turbos and other activities, so not all of that's falling to the bottom line. So, maybe that gives you some sense of what's in there. I think in terms of modeling purposes, you can assume this typical Mettler incremental operating margins in the mid-30s, high-30s depending on currency.","Jason A.

I'm Mary Finnegan, I'm the Treasurer and I'm responsible for Investor Relations at Mettler-Toledo. I'm happy that you're joining us this evening. I'm joined by Olivier Filliol, our CEO; Bill Donnelly, our Executive Vice President; and Shawn Vadala, our Chief Financial Officer.","I need to cover just a couple administrative matters. The call is being webcast and is available on our website. A copy of the press release and the presentation we refer to is also available on the website.","Let me summarize the safe harbor language, which is outlined on page 2 of the presentation.

Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Thank you, Mary, and welcome to everyone on the call which we are doing from Switzerland this evening, which is why we started earlier than usual. I will start with the summary of the quarter, Bill will provide details on our second quarter results and Shawn will provide an update to our guidance. I will then have some additional comments and we will then open the lines for Q&A.","The highlights for the quarter are on page 3 of the presentation. Sales growth in the quarter was 7% in local currency, which is very good given the excellent 10% growth in the prior year period. China had particular strong growth in the quarter. This strong sales growth, combined with our continued focus on margin and cost savings measures, drove a 19% increase in adjusted EPS. This is particularly impressive given the 22% adjusted EPS growth we achieved in the second quarter of last year.","All in all, we are quite pleased with the second quarter and our first half results this year. Demand in our markets continue to remain solid and assuming no change in the market conditions, we believe we are well positioned to continue to gain share and drive further earnings growth in the remainder of 2018 and beyond.","Let me now turn it to Bill to provide additional details on the quarter. Bill?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Thanks, Olivier, and hello, everybody. Sales were $722 million in the quarter, that's an increase of 7% in local currency. The Biotix acquisition contributed approximately 1.5% to sales growth. On a U.S. dollar basis, total sales growth increased 10% as currencies increased sales growth by 3% in the quarter.","On slide number 4, we show our sales growth by region. Local currency sales grew 4% in the Americas, 7% in Europe, and 9% in Asia\/Rest of World. Sales growth in China increased 15% in the quarter and our sales growth there was broad based.","Slide number 5 shows sales growth for the first half of the year. Local currency sales growth has increased by 5% in the Americas, 3% in Europe, and 10% in Asia\/Rest of World for the six month.","Slide number 6, we outlined local currency sales growth by product line. In the quarter, laboratory sales grew 10%; industrial sales increased by 3%; and retail grew 6%. Within industrial, our core industrial business had good growth of 7%, offset in part by a 3% decline in product inspection. As a reminder, product inspection had an excellent growth of 20% in the year earlier period.","Turning to the next slide, we have year-to-date sales growth by product line. Laboratory sales grew by 10%, industrial grew 1% and retail 3% for the six-month period. All these numbers again are in local currency.","On side number 8, we've got a P&L for the quarter. Our gross margins were 57.2% that compared to 57.5% in the prior year. Pricing continued to be a strong contributor to gross margin. Pricing was offset by the impact of currency, some negative mix and lower margin on our product inspection business in part explained by the U.S. facility consolidation we described last quarter. On a constant currency basis and adjusted for acquisitions, margins were up about 30 basis points in the quarter.","R&D amounted to $35.3 million and that's a 6% increase in local currency. SG&A was $208 million and that's a 3% increase in local currency versus the prior year. Increase principally related to additional investments in our field resources offset to a certain degree by cost saving initiatives.","Our adjusted operating income was $169.3 million in the quarter, which represents a 15% increase over the prior year amount of $147.4 million. Adjusted operating margin was 23.4% and that's an 80 basis point improvement over the prior year. Currencies did not impact our operating margin in the quarter.","A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $12 million in the quarter, while interest expense was $8.3 million in the quarter. Our other income was $1.9 million and it includes $1.5 million of pension income. As a reminder and as we mentioned last quarter, the new accounting rules require us to show this below operating profit we restated last year to make it comparable. Our projected annual effective tax rate is 22%, which we reflect in our quarterly adjusted EPS. In the second quarter, our reported effective tax rate is 22.4% with the difference due to the timing of stock option exercises.","Moving to fully diluted shares, they amount to $25.9 million (sic) [25.9 million] in the quarter, which is a 2% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program.","Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $4.65 and that was 19% increase over the prior year amount of $3.92. On a two-year combined basis, adjusted EPS has increased by more than 40%. We are very pleased with this growth level, which I remind you is organic. On a reported basis in the quarter, EPS was $4.31 as compared to $3.84 in the prior year. Reported EPS included $0.22 of restructuring, principally related to the consolidation of our product inspection facilities in the United States. It also includes $0.10 of purchased intangibles and $0.02 related to the higher reported tax rate.","The next slide provides results for the first half of the year. As Olivier mentioned, we're very pleased with these results. Local currency sales have increased by 6%, our operating profit by 13% and our EPS is up 16% in the six-month period. That's it for the P&L.","And now a little about cash flow. In the quarter, adjusted free cash flow was $120.8 million which compared to $113.2 million in the prior period. Our working capital statistics remain solid with DSO at 39 days and ITO at 4.5 times. For the first half, adjusted free cash flow was $177.3 million and we remain comfortable with our full year target of $450 million.","Now, let me turn it over to Shawn to provide an update on our guidance.","Shawn P. Vadala - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Thanks, Bill, and hello, everyone. Let me start with a couple of upfront comments on our guidance before covering the specifics. First, the China tariff situation. On our last call, we estimated the potential negative impact to operating profit from the tariffs was approximately $10 million or $0.30 per share on a full year basis. We believe we can largely offset this impact with price increases and some supply chain adjustments.","For the second half of this year, we will not be able to fully offset the estimated 2018 headwind of $0.15 to $0.20 per share. We estimate the net headwind during the second half of the year is in the range of $0.05 to $0.10 per share.","In mid-July, another round of tariffs were announced. We estimate that if these additional tariffs are implemented, the negative impact on operating profit would be another $6 million. We have not built this into our guidance at this time as they are still under review and timing has not been finalized. Similar to the first round, we would seek to offset over time, but could face some headwind in the short-term if they are implemented. We will continue to monitor the situation closely.","Second, foreign exchange has moved against us since the last time we provided guidance, principally from being driven by the weakening of the Chinese renminbi versus the dollar and the strengthening of the Swiss franc versus the euro. Specifically, currencies in the second half have deteriorated $0.25 to $0.30 per share since our last call. It is also worth pointing out that currency will also be a bit of a headwind during the first half of 2019, if rates stay where they are.","On the positive side, we feel very good about our business. Underlying demand is solid and we believe we are executing extremely well. Our growth strategies continue to yield tangible results and we believe we can continue to gain share and drive earnings growth.","With that as a backdrop, let me cover the details. We continue to believe that local currency sales growth in 2018 will be approximately 6%. As a reminder, this includes approximately 1% from the Biotix acquisition. We are leaving our adjusted EPS guidance range unchanged from $20.10 to $20.25, which represents a growth rate of 14% to 15%. We have the benefit of the Q2B, but some work to do to offset the nearly $0.50 per share headwind from tariffs and unfavorable currency just mentioned.","With respect to the third quarter, we expect local currency sales growth to be in the 6% range, which includes approximately 1% from Biotix. Based on this sales growth, we would expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.97 to $5.02, a growth rate of 14% to 15%. Our EPS estimate includes the Q3 impact of the announced tariffs and currency headwind. In terms of currency on sales growth, we expect currency to decrease sales growth by approximately 1.5% in the third quarter. For the full year, we expect currency to benefit sales growth by just under 2%.","That is it from my side. I now want to turn it to Olivier.","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Thanks, Shawn. Let me start by providing some additional comment on the second quarter. Our lab business continues to perform well. Lab benefited from some acquisition revenue from Biotix. However, our organic growth in lab had good growth over the prior year. Balances continue to do quite well and analytical instruments and pipettes also had good growth, particularly if you look at it on a two-year basis. Process analytics had excellent growth in the quarter and I will provide an update on this business shortly. The continued strong lab growth reflects our excellent product portfolio, investment in field resources and our Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives.","Turning now to industrial, let me cover this in two parts starting with core industrial, which had sales growth of 7% in the quarter, very good growth, particularly given the very solid growth in the prior year period. Asia had a strong growth driven by excellent results in China. Europe also had strong growth in core industrial while Americas also had growth.","The other part of industrial is product inspection, which was down modestly in the quarter. The results were principally driven by the very strong 20% sales growth achieved in the second quarter of last year, which Bill mentioned earlier.","The final piece of our company is the retail business, which was up 6% in the quarter, a little better than we expected given some project activity in the United States.","Now, let me make some additional comments by geography. Europe had good growth in the quarter with industrial particularly strong, but also good growth in lab. Retail was down in Europe. In the Americas, lab, core industrial had solid growth. As anticipated, product inspection was down against excellent growth in the year earlier period. Retail in the Americas was strong due to profit activity just mentioned. Finally, Asia\/Rest of the World had strong growth with excellent growth in lab and good growth in industrial. Retail was up modestly in Asia\/Rest of the World. China had very strong growth across most product lines. That concludes my comments on the business.","Let me also provide an update to our service business, which had growth of 6% in the first half and 10% in the second quarter. As a reminder, service represents approximately 23% of total sales, and is a unique competitive advantage for us as well as an important platform for revenue growth. We have a service force of approximately 2,800 people, which is by far larger than any direct competitor.","Central to our service growth strategy is increasing the percentage of our installed base and the service contract. With more service contract business, we can enhance the productivity of our technicians and create more customer value through supporting regulatory compliance and enhancing equipment uptime through preventive maintenance.","Our current service growth initiatives are centered on our installed base of instruments. With more than 10 million installed instruments, our i-base provides ample opportunities to further penetrate existing accounts for service opportunities. We have prioritized biopharma and packaged food as our global service offering has the highest value to customers in regulated industries. Of utmost importance to them is ensuring they are in compliance with their standard operating procedures as well as ensuring uptime in their manufacturing operations.","Big data analytics is giving us tools to identify service opportunities within our installed base. We can isolate potential opportunities by the age of the instrument, and by top instrument performance. This allows us to do specific targeted marketing, most appropriate for that part of the product lifecycle. Big data is also allowing us to further penetrate existing accounts by identifying cross-selling opportunities within large global key accounts where service decisions are made at the local level. We have invested in service telesales resources to follow up on leads and develop specific targeted sales messages based on customers' actual data. We are encouraged by the results and believe this will allow us to continue to grow the service contract revenue above the company average.","In addition to growth initiatives in service, we also have initiatives to further improve operating margins. Although these margins are well above the company average, we see further opportunities to increase our field force efficiency and improve pricing realization.","One additional update I want to provide today is on our process analytics business, which had a strong first half and has a great track record of technology innovation. It has a sizable percentage of its revenue from consumables and service, approximately 40%, and has achieved above market growth for numerous years. It represents about 10% of total sales, and generates above group average profitability.","Process analytics provides in line and real time measurement of key analytical parameters for industrial liquids, which helps pharma, biotech and chemical companies to monitor and optimize their production processes. While the total market is large, we are a leader in industrial applications for pH, TOC, conductivity and dissolved oxygen measurement in production processes as well as auxiliary processes like ultrapure water monitoring.","Our solutions combine sensor technologies for specific measurements, transmitters and services. The sensors must be calibrated, maintained and replaced on a timely basis, which creates an attractive consumable stream. Over the last several years, we have further solidified our leadership position by expanding our portfolio into gas analytics with lasers, power generation analyzers, and bacterial detection in ultrapure water analysis.","We continue to enhance our technology leadership in this market. We recently launched a new portable dissolved oxygen meter that can automatically calibrate installed in-line oxygen sensors. We also launched a new turbidity sensor, which significantly expands performance levels. Both of these products are targeted to the growing beer production segment. With our expanded portfolio, we can now provide a comprehensive solution package, which provides great opportunities in the larger breweries. Another attractive aspect to the turbidity launch is that we moved the production of these sensors to China as a first step to build up sensor knowledge. Over time, we expect to move the entire turbidity parameter to China, which will help to achieve meaningful cost savings in this product category.","Very soon we will launch our pH sensor called InPro X1, which is based on a breakthrough technology and represents a leapfrog over any other pH sensor in the markets today. Key benefit of the new sensor is the unbreakable design of the sensing element, thereby ensuring no release of contaminants or debris. It has cutting edge measurement performance and no calibration is needed at installation due to our Intelligent Sensor Management technology that allows pre-calibration of sensors.","One additional example of our technology is the upcoming introduction of our new TOC sensor, featuring performance enhancement and Intelligent Sensor Management. It will have significant enhanced measurement performance as well as provide superior features to help customers comply with regulation. In particular, we offer new proprietary services based on full traceable tools that ensure compliance for customers.","These are only a few of the many product launches taking place in Process Analytics. But I thought they were good examples of our technology know-how and leadership. In addition to technology, Process Analytics is a great example of our continuous improvement philosophy with respect of sales and marketing. This business was the original pilot of our Spinnaker approach, and for 15 years now, they have been working to continuously refine and enhance the sales and marketing programs. Process Analytics' excellent product portfolio, combined with the leading edge sales and marketing initiatives, should continue to yield share gains for this business.","That concludes our prepared remarks. And I want to ask the operator to now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And your first question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, first off on the Q3 guidance, it looks like you had a good growth rate against a very difficult comparison and the outlook is strong. So, why wouldn't Q3 organic revenue guidance be a little bit better given that the comp is easier?","Shawn P. Vadala - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, Dan. This is Shawn. Thanks for the question. I think when we look at it, we're actually looking at it more on a three-year comp basis, because I think it's important to look at that we started to have accelerated growth in the second half of 2016. So, if you look at it on a three-year basis, it actually makes a lot more sense to us.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That makes sense, Shawn. And then my follow-up on, you mentioned that currency at current rates will be a headwind in the first half of 2019. Would you be willing to offer up \u2013 will tariffs still be a headwind in the first half of 2019, as they stand today, or would you expect your remediation programs will have caught up to the tariff impact by then? Thank you.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","This is Bill. I think with regard to the first program, we should have caught up with our initiation. I think it depends a little if this additional $6 million or what other activities could come to make a judgment on the second round of tariffs and what might follow after that.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Good afternoon, guys. So maybe on China, obviously, it sounds like another fantastic quarter. Can you just maybe give us some color on like the cadence of how business is kind of ebbed and flowed there? The macro has been quite strong, but there's some worry just given all the trade noise that you start to see, maybe on the industrial side a little bit, the indecision on purchasing. Like, what are you seeing on different parts of the business in terms of cadence? And then, do you expect to see any different behavior between sort of lab versus industrial there, given maybe some of this question?","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","In general, we don't see any early signs of things changing. We have very solid environment. The team is still very upbeat and the only thing that impact us is of course this previous year comparisons, and that's a little bit different quarter-by-quarter, but otherwise, we feel \u2013 and visibility that we have is good across all the product lines. You specifically asked about last, we have now many, many quarters of very solid growth, and I expect that to continue.","But I would of course also say that we need to very carefully monitor things. For example, we have certainly seen that the stock market in China reacted to all these tariff announcements, and so we certainly wouldn't exclude that this will also impact the demand. But it's too early for us to see it. And the only reason why we are here a little bit more cautious with our outlook is again related to comparisons, and we certainly had also some pent-up demand benefits in the last couple of quarters that will not go up, and the pent-up demand is particularly relevant in the context of our industrial business; for last, this wasn't impacting us.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","That's helpful. And maybe, Bill, I know, you always get excited about inflation. It feels like pricing should probably be a tailwind to you guys or at least be more favorable that is typical just given the overall environment. How are you thinking about inflation in pricing right now for you, and how that trends into maybe next year?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","So first, we generally do like a little bit of inflation, Ross, and I think it helps us with pricing, messaging with our sales force, customers are more tolerant. What's maybe a little bit more nuanced about what we're seeing now is the inflation-related tariffs. So, if you look at where we're maybe getting some tariffs applied to us, it could be in product categories that maybe competition doesn't have the same challenge and tariffs are also something that's, let's call it, less easy to talk to customers than general material costs or what's going on with wages.","So, if I think about the profitability impact of what we do in pricing, I think that we should have continued to execute well on pricing, probably do better than average overall on a net basis, but some of the higher price increases you'll see in the coming quarters will be offset by some of these inflationary impacts due to the tariffs.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thank you. Good afternoon, good night. I was hoping you could just talk a little bit more on the product inspection business. I think you started out the year looking at mid-single digit growth there, certainly kind of appreciate the comps in the first half, but can you just help us with a little bit of the conviction in the back half ramp to hit the target for the full year?","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","If you look at our numbers, a part of the challenge has been self-created in the sense that we did talk on the last call that we have some facility consolidation. We moved our biggest facility in the U.S. to a new location. But at the same time, we also closed two facilities, one in Chicago and one in Ithaca and moved these product lines to this new bigger facility down in Florida. And that's certainly absorbed a lot of energy internally. We had certainly also some challenges in the supply chain.","And then we had the other part, which is related to our checkweighing business where we went live with our Blue Ocean system. And so often when we go live, it takes a couple of months to be back in the smooth operations. So, that was one effect. The other effect that we certainly also see is a certain slowdown from our packaged food customers. We had in previous year excellent big orders with global roll outs and this year, we don't see them materializing in the same way and that makes it very difficult previous year comparisons on top of these things that I described before and that makes us a little bit cautious to the remainder of the year. The fundamentals remain very solid and mid-term, we are very excited about this business but again it might well take a while until we see solid growth coming back and certainly these comments of before we want to see that the packaged food companies reengage in global roll outs and increase their spending in protecting their brands and all the value propositions that we offer.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. And I appreciate all the color on the new product pipeline, just the breadth of the things that you're bringing to market now. Can you just help us put it in context of in terms of what you think the contribution from some of these new products could be relative to prior periods just as we start to think about what the trajectory could look like going into next year?","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yes. As often, when we talk about new products, we share these with you to highlight how we continuously invest in our technology leadership that helps us to differentiate versus competition that allows us to increase prices and so on. But we have so many products in our portfolio that a new product really doesn't change the needle. It doesn't make that big of a difference. And to put it in perspective, process analytics we talk about, roughly 10% of our revenue and all these products that I mentioned will add to the growth, but you heard us also saying process analytics had very good growth already and we benefit from previous product launches. So, I don't want to suggest here that process analytics will further accelerate, but it gives us actually good confidence that process analytics will continue this kind of growth with this excellent profitability that we have. And it's, in that sense, representative of what we do for the whole group. We have many, many product launches across all the product businesses that we have.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks for all the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hello and good afternoon.","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Hello, sir.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, just could you just give a little bit more of a breakout on what the headwinds that you're seeing from the tariffs? I mean, is it supply chain? Is it COGS? Is it end market demand? I'm just sort of curious in terms of like what you're feeling and what you're doing to sort of offset some of these?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","The comments of Shawn before were really focused on the direct impact that it will have. So, it impacts our material costs, basically the cost of goods. We try to offset that as far as possible through price increases and a few supply chain adjustment, and that's the piece that we have under control.","There is a tentative significant indirect impact on our customer base that we talked before about the food industry, for example, the meat industry in the U.S. is certainly impacted and that can have ripple effect, but it's sometimes actually difficult to say if it's good or bad for us. So, we always need to anticipate. And then, there is the overall impact on the economy that of course, we have \u2013 it's difficult to anticipate and we don't really control. So, all our comments before was really focused on the direct impact and there we feel actually, we have good measures in place to mitigate the impact but Shawn highlighted that maybe from a timing perspective, it might not always be in the same quarter that the cost is coming and the benefits, for example, of pricing that offsets it.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks. And if the second round of \u2013 or the latest round of stuff that is in discussion goes through, I mean, with that in mind that you can't do things immediately, it's like, how long would it take you to sort of implement if you do get another hit?","Shawn P. Vadala - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yeah, we would \u2013 given the \u2013 this is Shawn, Derik, given the timing of this one, we kind of leverage largely our annual price increase process. So, it really could be dragged into the first quarter a little bit, but I would say some point during the first quarter.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. All right, great. Thank you.","Operator","Next, we have Mr. Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Bill, maybe just a little bigger picture when we look at Europe, can you just talk through the trends there, I mean, a little bit of mixed macro data points, PMI is still healthy, but not accelerating. Just wondering your outlook there, how things are going?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","So, I think overall, our European business is performing well. If I look our lab business, it's growing mid-single digits; our industrial business growing mid-single digits; and we're down in retail and the retail is just purely lumpiness. If we were to look out to the second half of the year, I would say that's the type of numbers that we would expect to put up. So, we don't at this point see any significant changes. There's probably some swings between individual countries but the overall picture for Europe I think would largely stay similar to what we saw in the first half. And we were happy with what we saw in the first half.","Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And then can you just talk through the transition of the Tampa facility, how the new facility is tracking and then also any other future moves this year we need to think about? I know you guys discussed moving the Chicago vision business in the second half. Just wondering anything we should look out from a disruption point of view?","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yeah. So, the Chicago facility that's done that's including the Ithaca. So, the U.S. relocation is completed and it's more a question of fully digesting it. The other facility relocation that we have is in Switzerland. That impacts the laboratory balance business here in the coming few weeks. However that I expect this actually to be much smoother and, at this stage, really don't expect any impact on our supply chain. I just got the update yesterday that basically, I think, except one person, all the employees will actually join us at the new location, and that gives you an indication that it should be really much smoother. And it's also much more standardized product, makes it also simpler. And then the other relocations that will take place later in the year are office jobs. And so I don't expect any impact from that.","Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. I'm going to stick with some of the themes here. But Bill, can you actually clarify your comment on pricing? I mean, basically, were you implying that if competitors source their products outside the U.S. and are not subject to tariffs inflation, it may be harder to pass through the price increases? I just want to get clarification on that.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yeah. So, Ross' question was, hey, you guys normally like a little bit of inflation and you can usually do better than inflation. Do we realize even better pricing with a little bit of inflation and with a low inflation environment? And the distinction \u2013 and I wanted to \u2013 I agree with that statement. I just wanted to make a distinction with regard to tariffs, that's not as straightforward, because we could be going against a competitor in that product category. We have a tariff and he doesn't because where he imports his product from versus where we do.","I think that's a statement specific about pricing and inflation. I would think about in terms of what the impact is on our operating profit of tariffs, I then would defer to what Shawn said, and that is that we expect to largely offset them. We might have a little bit of a delay, but that we can largely offset them between what we do in pricing and what we do in supply chain.","Now, in the details of that answer on pricing, Tycho, it might be that we're raising prices on some other products that are not tariff-impacted, but we view it as an effort to, in our mind, offset that $10 million of headwind that we have. And so, yeah, that's a little bit how we tackled it.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then, separately, you guys have a SternDrive program, I mean that's separate from the facility consolidation and the like, I mean anything notable there, is that something you can potentially expand?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","We just had a review with it in the recent days and the number of projects have increased this year versus last year that will increase again next year. So, we're very happy with how SternDrive is going. And as Olivier mentioned, some of the things we're doing to offset tariffs do relate to supply chain and is reflected as part of the SternDrive program.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then last one, just rounding out the geographic discussion, you touched on Europe and China. I guess here in the Americas lab and core industrial, you called that a solid. On the lab side, we've seen some good numbers from other life science companies. Are you starting to see some benefit of the NIH budget?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","NIH is not a huge piece for us, but if we look at how we performed in pipettes, for example, which would be the product category that has the best, the largest exposure, we certainly had a solid demand from that sector the last couple of quarters and have a good outlook for the second half.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Citigroup.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks. Olivier, just going back to your comment on pent-up spending in industrial, I'm curious whether you're able to give a sense of how much of the existing Mettler customer base you've seen just participate in the replacement cycle at this point versus those that sort of haven't come back to you yet. Is that a reasonable way of looking at things?","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","So, the pent-up demand was specific to China. This is not a topic for the rest of the world. In China, we had a situation where it, for the industrial business, really had a very difficult environment about three years ago. And then, there were some factors that hardly recovered. And honestly, we also kind of shifted resources away from that sectors, and then focused much more efforts on the chemical industry, pharma industry, food industry that we feel is more sustainable and more core to us. And there, we have certainly a good customer base, where we had this pent-up demand because they have slowdown in the replacement cycle, but also they have not invested in additional capacity in the same way. And now, where the growth is coming back, we have the pent-up demand. Quantifying it is, however, difficult, but I certainly have three groups this exceptional growth that we have, apart to this.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then, Bill, maybe on food, obviously, that's a lumpy one. I think you're up against a pretty favorable comp there next quarter. So, are you expecting a rebound there in growth or is that sort of similar to PI in that the project timing is just going to have that business needing a little bit to get back up.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","I'll let Shawn take that one.","Shawn P. Vadala - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yeah, you're right, Dan. So, we have an easier comparison going into the third quarter and we would expect high-single-digit growth in the third quarter.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good evening. Just a couple of housekeeping of questions...","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Hi.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","...Bill or Shawn. Within China, could you breakout the lab versus the core industrial? And then what exactly is rewarding that ASPs in the second quarter, I guess?","Shawn P. Vadala - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yeah. So, lab in China was up over 20% in the quarter and industrial was up by 10%. And then in terms of pricing, we had a quarter very similar to the first quarter, strong momentum in the program north of 2%.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Very good. And then what was the M&A impact to the lab business?","Shawn P. Vadala - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yeah. I think, it was 3%, yeah.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Go ahead, Brandon.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Yeah, okay. Lastly if you could just...","Shawn P. Vadala - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","It was 3%, sorry, Brandon, yeah.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then lastly, if you could just sort of remind me what the total annual transition tax payments you expect will be.","Shawn P. Vadala - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yeah, just the payment I think we paid in the first quarter, which is I think $4 million \u2013 I mean, second quarter was $4 million.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Very good. Thank you.","Shawn P. Vadala - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Well, first of all, I'd say thanks everybody for taking the time here very late at night in Switzerland, so thanks for doing that. Second, the couple of questions, I'll ask them both and then I'll jump back in queue. One, just a very big picture question. I'm not going to direct it to anybody in particular, but we talked about the macro, the operating environment, products, execution tariffs. With these all, sorry to oversimplify it, but it sounds like issue is that we very much have a handle on things, stable, steady, going well. But over the next 90 days or so, you guys are going to be going through your planning process for 2019. I wonder given that we seem to have such a good handle on those dynamics, what do you think are the really critical swing factors that you're thinking about that you recommend we think about as you think about the outlook for 2019?","And then as a follow-up, just a couple of housekeeping things. I wonder if you could give us a sense for what you've estimated the impact of selling days for Easter might be on 1Q, 2Q and then any view on gross margins specifically, the cadence of gross margins in the back half of the year, really helpful and I'd say thanks again for sticking it out late here guys.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Sure. Hey, maybe I'll make a comment about packaging those tariffs and currencies et cetera and then let Olivier talk about some of the things he is expecting for budget tour. I do feel, Steve, that one of the key messages we have this quarter is that we have close to $0.50 of headwinds in the second half of the year that we didn't have the last time we (00:46:19) talked to you and we haven't adjusted our guidance for the full year.","And I take that speaks to we're entering a budget cycle with some challenges but we feel like we have our arms very much around those, so lot of things going well for us. With regard to some other bigger picture or longer term items, I hand it to Olivier.","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","We gave of course some pre-briefings to all our operating units around the world on what we want to focus on going forward, what kind of environment we expect. In essence, we are expecting the macroeconomic environment to be actually quite similar to what we had this year. We expect all the units to remain agile and in case that things would change and you have seen us in the past actually reacting to do these things quite in a fast way. But the working assumptions right now is that things remain the way they are right now.","And I would also say we are in a continuous investment mode. So, you have seen us doing Field Turbo programs in the recent quarters and I'm still in that mode. I just approved the couple of more of these investment projects and I do expect actually good growth going forward coming also from all the different programs that we have in place around sales and marketing, around Field Turbos, new product launches and all. So that's very much the briefings that we gave to the units. And I have no indication from any team that they see particular concerns or changing economic environment.","But of course, I don't want to say that macroeconomic things might not impact us, a dollar appreciation for example can impact also certain emerging countries and we would certainly also see that in the numbers but that doesn't necessarily mean that we would adjust our operating plans. So, with that, maybe Shawn, to specific questions.","Shawn P. Vadala - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","On the gross margin, yeah, so in terms of the margin, Steve, we look at gross margin maybe the flattish in the third quarter and just as a reminder, we're going to have a little bit more of the tariff headwind in the third quarter, still working through maybe some of these internal topics that we talked about earlier as well too. And then in the fourth quarter, we would expect gross margins to be maybe up in the 50 basis point kind of range. So, on a full-year basis, it would be flattish on a currency neutral basis.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Really appreciate all the color you gave.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And we will now take our last question from Mr. Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research.","Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Hi. Good evening, and thanks for taking my question. Actually, I have a couple of one for you. I guess first, as you are trying to offset tariffs through price increases, do you typically see or have you already seen customers either try to hold off on purchases given the price increase or maybe try and pull forward spending ahead of price increases? And then I have a couple of follow ups.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yeah. Actually if anything we've seen, we saw a little bit of acceleration in June with certain customers that knew that we were going to be announcing the price increase. And then maybe to add a little bit more from a competitive situation, we've actually seen competitors come out with some pretty significant price increases as well, which we felt was encouraging.","Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay.","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","And Steve, maybe one comment, that tends to be more in distribution channels and most of our sales are direct. So that's not a big impact and even in the examples that we're thinking about, that's mostly them placing the order before the end of the quarter. Yes.","Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Got you, both. Okay. Okay. And then secondly, just regarding the changes \u2013 I guess, lack of changes in your EPS guidance, Shawn, I think you made a comment of maybe $0.05 to $0.10 of a headwind from tariffs and then $0.25 to $0.30 from FX. So you add those up, you're looking at maybe $0.30 to $0.40 of incremental headwinds and maintaining the guidance. I understand maybe $0.05 is from the 2QB then you're trying to do some pricing. But you're aware of \u2013 what are you doing to kind of pull the strings here to find some other offsets or is it something you're doing with compensation or is it something else where you're finding those extra dollars to offset these headwinds?","Shawn P. Vadala - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","I think we feel our cost structure is in really good shape. I think that's one of the biggest things we looked at. We do a lot of homework, Steve, before we go on to the budget tour and that gave us some confidence and the cost structure is in good shape. I forgot I think it was Tycho or somebody asking about SternDrive. SternDrive programs are in good shape with the facility consolidation should add more of a benefit in the second half. So, it's just a number of things in terms of our cost structure being in good shape.","Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. And then I think just last thing, the facility consolidation down in Tampa, are the headwinds or disruptions and increased focus area, is that finished now or is that something that also continues in the third quarter?","Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","It will take certainly a couple of additional weeks, months, but I certainly feel that the biggest challenges are behind us.","Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Very good. Thanks so much for your time.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we have one question that just came into queue from Mr. Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","Oh, thanks for squeezing me in at the end here. I just wanted to know if the plan is still to purchase around $475 million worth of shares in 2018.","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Correct.","Shawn P. Vadala - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yes.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","And do you have the service growth, what that was for the quarter?","Mary T. Finnegan - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Go ahead, Shawn.","Shawn P. Vadala - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Yeah. Service was up 9.5% in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis, 6%. Service, I should point out, had a little bit of benefit from the Easter timing in Q1.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","And then finally what should we expect as far as the product inspection business for the fourth quarter?","William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","The fourth quarter, we're looking at high-single digit growth base, start to have an easier comparison in the fourth quarter","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","All right. Thanks very much.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. Ms. Mary Finnegan, back to you for closing remarks.","Mary T. Finnegan - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.","Thank you, Emani, and thanks, everyone, for joining us tonight. Of course, as always, if you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact us.

I'm the Treasurer and I am responsible for Investor Relations at Mettler-Toledo, and happy that you're joining us this evening. I'm joined by Olivier Filliol, our CEO; and Bill Donnelly, our Executive Vice President.","I need to cover just a couple administrative matters. First, the call is being webcast and is available on our Web site. A copy of the press release and the presentation we refer to are also available on the Web site. On Page 1, we have our Safe Harbor language, let me just summarize that.","Statements in this presentation, which are not historical facts, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 and the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

More detailed information with respect to the use of and differences between non-GAAP and the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in our 8-K.","Let me now turn the call over to Olivier.","Olivier Filliol","Thank you, Mary, and welcome to everyone on the call. I will start with a summary of the quarter, and then Bill will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments before we open the lines for Q&A.","The highlights for the quarter are on Page 2 of the presentation. We ended the year with a solid fourth quarter. Market conditions throughout the world developed as we expected and I\u2019m very pleased with our continued strong execution. Growth in the Americas was very strong and broad-based. Europe had good growth in laboratory instruments, which was somewhat hidden by a decline in retail due to strong prior year comparisons.","Sales in China and Brazil declined meaningfully in the quarter, while Russia\u2019s decline was modest. Growth in emerging market outside these countries was solid. Overall, we continue to gain share through our field turbo program, Spinnaker marketing initiatives and our exciting product offering. With strong execution on our margin enhancement and productivity improvement program we again had good margin expansion in the quarter. Despite the challenging currency environment in the quarter and for the full year 2015, we delivered 10% EPS growth, which equates to 15% before the estimated impact of currencies.","We are pleased with these results, particularly given the headwinds from currency and certain emerging markets. Equally important, we continue to make investments for growth, which position us well for 2016 and beyond.","Now, let me turn it to Bill to cover the numbers.","Bill Donnelly","Thanks, Olivier, and hello everybody. Sales were $673.5 million in the quarter, that\u2019s an increase of 3% in local currency and on a dollar basis sales decreased by 3% as currencies reduced sales by 6% in the quarter.","If you turn now to Page 3 of the presentation, we outline sales by geography. In the quarter, local currency sales increased by 9% in the Americas, they were flat in Europe, and declined by 2% in Asia\/Rest of World as compared to the prior year. China was down 8% in the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Brazil was down 12%, while we saw some improvement in Russia as their sales decline was only 1%. Excluding these three countries, we had a growth of 5% in the quarter.","Turning to the next slide, we have full year sales, which also increased 3% in local currency. By region in 2015, local currency sales increased by 8% in the Americas, 2% in Europe and were flat in Asia\/Rest of World, Brazil, Russia and China were down 11% in 2015, excluding these countries, three countries we had a sales growth of 7% in local currency for the full year.","Turning now to Slide Number 5, we outline sales growth by product line. Laboratory had a growth of 6% in local currency, while industrial was flat in the quarter and our Food Retailing business declined 8% in the fourth quarter. Full year sales growth is shown on the next slide, Laboratory increased by 7% in local currency, while Industrial was flat and our Food Retailing business grew by 2%.","Turning to now to Slide Number 7, let me walk you through key items on the P&L for the quarter. Our gross margins reached 58%, 150 basis point increase over the prior year margin of 56.5%. We\u2019re of course very pleased with this increase, currencies contributed about 80% to the increase and includes the benefit of the gain we have on the Swiss franc-euro hedges. In constant currency, our gross margins were up by 70 basis points. Pricing and material cost reductions contributed to the margin improvement. These improvements were offset impart by our investments in the field service organization.","R&D amounted to $31.1 million, that\u2019s a 3% increase in local currency. SG&A amounted to $177.4 million, which is constant with the prior year in local currency. Increased investments in our field service organization and employee benefit costs were offset by our cost saving program and lower variable compensation.","Our adjusted operating income was $182.2 million in the quarter and that\u2019s a 3% increase over the prior year amount of $176.3 million. Currency reduced operating profit by approximately $7.8 million in the quarter. Excluding this headwind operating profit increased by 8% in the quarter. Our operating margins were 27.1%, that\u2019s an increase of 180 basis points over the prior year. Currencies benefited margins by 50 basis points as the percentage impact of currency and sales was larger than the impact on operating profit.","The core underlying margin improvement was approximately 130 bps. Incremental OP margins reached 75% before currencies this quarter, which is particularly impressive given the meaningful investments we're making in our field turbo program.","A couple of final comments on the P&L, our amortization amounted to $8.0 million in the quarter. Our interest expense was $6.8 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate continues to be 24% it was slightly less in the fourth quarter and that added about $0.02 to our earnings in the quarter. Fully diluted shares for the quarter were $27.8 million, that's a 4.4% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase programs.","Adjusted EPS was $4.65 per share and that's an increase of 10% over the prior year amount of $4.24 per share. Excluding the impact of currency, adjusted EPS increased by 15% in the quarter. On a reported basis, earnings per share were $4.44 per share as compared to $4.17 per share and reported EPS includes restructuring charges of $0.17 per share and $0.04 per share of purchased intangible amortization.","The next slide provides our full year results for 2015. Our local currency sales increased by 3%, while gross margins grew by 170 basis points. Currency benefited gross margins by about 90 basis points, resulting in a strong 80 basis point improvement on a constant currency basis. Operating profits increased by 5%, and margins on a constant currency basis increased by 120 bps. Incremental margins exceeded 50% for the full year. Our adjusted EPS grew by 10% which reflects a growth of approximately 15% excluding currency.","Now let's turn to cash flow. In the quarter, our free cash flow was $126.4 million, or $4.60 per share. On a per-share basis, that's a 23% increase over the prior year amount. We achieved further improvement in DSO which was reduced to 39 days at the end of the year compared to 40 days in the prior year. Our ITO was 4.6. Full year free cash flow amounted to $364.8 million or $12.90 per share which is an increase of 11%. We converted 100% of our adjusted net income to cash flow in 2015 and we're of course pleased with that.","Now let's turn to guidance. Forecasting continues to be very challenging given the uncertainty in certain emerging market. We expect market conditions to remain soft in our China industrial business and we don't expect to achieve growth in China for the full year. Russia appears to at bottomed while Brazil has ways to go. For the rest of world, we expect continued growth but less than what we've achieved in 2015 given economic forecasts and some tougher comps. We expect continued share gains globally driven by our Spinnaker sales and marketing program, our field turbo programs and a strong product pipeline.","Taken all these factors together, we continue to expect local currency sales growth to be between 3% and 4% in 2016 and our adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $14.10 to $14.30. This is a growth of 9% to 11%. We expect currencies to reduce earnings growth by about a 0.5, which represents a growth of 10.5 to 12.5 excluding currencies. This guidance remains unchanged from what we reported on our last call.","Now let me turn to the first quarter. In the first quarter, we expect local currency sales growth of approximately 4% while our adjusted earnings per share should be in the range of $2.40 to $2.45 per share. We expect currencies to reduce EPS growth in the quarter by about 2.5%. Excluding the impact of currency our guidance reflects an EPS growth of 9.5% to 11.5% in the quarter. A couple of additional comments on guidance, first our sales guidance for the first quarter is at the top end of the range principally due to comparisons in China, we expect China to have flattish local currency sales growth in Q1 while for the full-year we expect China sales growth to be down low single-digits.","Let me cover currency, with respect to sales growth we expect currency to reduce sales growth in Q1 by about 4.5% and reduce it for the full year by about 3%. As already mentioned, we expect currencies to reduce EPS growth in 2016 by approximately 1.5% with a greater impact in the first half of year. Finally, let me comment on cash flow, we expect cash flow to be in the range of $355 million to $360 million for the full year and we would expect to repurchase shares of approximately $500 million in 2016.","Okay that's it from my side and now I want to turn it back to Olivier.","Olivier Filliol","Thank you, Bill. Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab finished the year strong and had a year, sales growth for the quarter was 6% and for the full year was 7%. Most product lines showed good growth. As mentioned on multiple occasions, our product pipeline is Lab is very strong they were also a major beneficiary of the field turbo program. We expect continued solid growth in 2016.","Industrial was flat in the quarter and for the full year. Product Inspection grew 6% in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Market dynamics for Product Inspection continue to be very good. We have strong leadership position the most comprehensive offering in the market and very strong product pipeline which positions us well for 2016 and beyond. Core industrial declined 3% in the quarter and for the full year. In the quarter, we had good growth in Americas and Europe also had growth while China declined. You can see that many peers to our core industrial business are having struggles. In this leg, we performed well and gained share. I expect more of the same in 2016, a challenging environment with us performing relatively well and gaining some share.","Finally, retail declined 8% in the quarter, Americas and Asia had good growth while Europe was down due to very strong quarter in the previous year. For the year, retail had growth of 2%, we would expect retail to be up modestly in 2016 due to timing of project activity. It is worth noting that retail had record levels of profit and profit margin in 2015 so we believe our strategy for retail is sound and well executed.","Now, let me make some additional comments by geography. Europe sales were flat in the quarter, in line with our expectations given the good growth in final year. I am pleased with the solid growth in lab and core industrial in Europe during the quarter. For the full year, sales growth in Europe was up 2%, overall we continued to execute well in this region and I would feel two of our investments should help us continue to gain share.","Americas had another excellent quarter with sales growth of 9%. We had good growth in most product lines especially where we make field turbo investments. Our outlook for Americas remained solid and although we will have tougher comparisons this year. We expect continued solid growth. Asia and rest of the world decreased 2% in the quarter, while increased 5% excluding China. As Bill mentioned, China declined 8% in the quarter.","Lab was flat in the quarter in China while industry was down 17%. The order picture was better for China lab in the quarter and we expect China labs to grow in 2016. As Bill mentioned earlier, overall we expect China sales to be down this year but not to the level we saw in 2015. Outside China, in the fourth quarter we had very good growth in India and solid growth in Southeast Asia. We expect market conditions in Asia, outside of China to remain solid in 2016.","Let me make some additional comments on 2016. Last year proved more challenging that we had anticipated and it also demonstrated our resiliency and ability as we deliver solid financial results despite sizeable sales decline in Brazil, Russia and China and significant currency headwinds. Our ability to navigate the wide economic environment around the globe is a result of our long standing core strategy and our discipline in executing them. These strategies which we have talked about with you for many years are well understood and embraced within the organization. We believe that our culture has been a key differentiator for us for many years and 2015 gave us ample of opportunities to show its benefits. ","In 2016, you will see more of the same, that is, we are more than happy to stick to our core strategy and focus on execution when we come in everyday. Let me provide some additional details to give you a better understanding of our key priorities in 2016. And first, the field turbo program had a good start in 2015 and we expect to add another 200 front end resources in 2016. Importantly, we are funding these investments due to productivity improvement and cost measures elsewhere in the business. The investments are aimed at underpenetrated market and are yielding tangible results as evidenced by our growth in 2015 outside of Brazil, Russia and China.","Adding field resources is a high leverage investment for us and particularly important given our organic growth focus. Second, our Spinnaker sales and marketing program continues to drive share and productivity gains. We are now entering the fifth wave of Spinnaker and one of the key focus areas for us in 2016 is to use data analytics to identify sales opportunities which are actionable. One example is an initiative for replacement of old products. Our installed base consisting of millions of instruments is a highly valuable asset to our franchise. Our marketing teams work diligently to clean and enrich the information stored about these instruments in our comprehensive database, called iBase. Using data analytics we can identify customers in our iBase who will benefit from having their all the products upgraded to newest generation, which can provide significantly more functionality and translate into real value for our customers.","To be successful, data transparency down to the model level needs to be extracted from the iBase and targeted marketing campaigns developed. We support this initiative through Telesales Resources, we have added to our field turbo program. Key account management is another key priority for our Spinnaker marketing programs in 2015. We\u2019re further developing our top 100 key account program with the focus on further penetrating key customer in food, pharmaceutical and chemical industry. As the market leader, we have a wide range of product and service solutions and a large direct salesforce presence has enabled us to be a true partner for our global customers with diverse needs in many locations.","Third, you have a large number of new products introduced in 2015 and expect similar trends in 2016 as well. In particular, balances and analytical instruments, process analytics, automated chemistry and product infection have robust pipelines. We continue to lead the market in technology advantage that provide competitive edge to our customers and keep us at the forefront of innovation in our industry. Finally, it is a core aspect of our culture. You can even say it is part of our DNA to continue to look for ways to optimize our cost structure. This drive for continuous improvement is at the foundation of our franchise and gives us the resiliency and agility to remain successful even when market conditions are not as favorable as we might have expected. Many productivity programs and cost initiatives in various areas add-up to significant savings and efficiencies. These efforts include lean initiatives and manufacturing in back office, leveraging low cost countries for R&D, marketing support and manufacturing and utilizing shared service centers for operational activities.","That covers my column on our strategy focus in 2016. Let me make some summary comments before opening it up for questions. We will remain cautious on China and some of the emerging markets. As market conditions are challenging and it will take some time for these markets to recover. Our priority in these countries is to protect margins and ensure resources are targeted to long-term growth opportunities. Our other businesses, which account for more than 80% of total sales, are performing well. Market demand is solid, and we are leveraging our excellent product pipeline, proven sales and marketing programs, and the investments in field resources to gain share. Our margin enhancement and productivity initiatives are well on track and allow us to make additional growth investments. We believe this positions us well for continued share gain in 2016 and beyond.","I want to now ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tim Evans from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Tim Evans","Thank you. I would like to try to get a sense for some of the sensitivities in guidance. I mean we have obviously been in a challenging macro environment now for some time and you've done a great job managing through that. As you are thinking about your 2016 guidance, what are some of the downside risks that you think are the most things that are on the front of your mind at this point? Is it still kind of emerging markets, or is it more kind of global GDP that you are thinking about? Just kind of give us a sense for maybe some of the things that could go wrong in 2016?","Bill Donnelly","So I would start with the global economy, right. We have certain assumptions about how the world should play out. We\u2019re using the same data that you guys are seeing the same information that you guys are. We continue to be a little worried about some of the emerging markets. We also see some weakness in some manufacturing data, which impacts our business. I mean, I would qualify that to say, if you dig a layer deeper into that, you would see that actually some areas like food and chemical or actually there is more, those are the more positive ones for example within those are actually growth areas within the U.S. PMI number as opposed to for example the oil and gas area or metals area are much more difficult at this time.","Second area would be currency, I think we\u2019ve all experience together ourselves the peer companies the new guys. How currencies can move things around and we have an assumption based on where rates are basically today. And if those should continue, if the economy should continue, we would feel good about our guidance for 2016 and I would highlight Olivier and I both feel that the things we can control, the execution of our business plan are things that we feel very good about for 2016.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Knight from Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is open.","Bill March","This is actually Bill March on for Paul. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe first, could you just speak to what you're seeing in China in terms of flat Lab maybe where you could see some upside into 2016 and what you're seeing on the industrial side as well?","Olivier Filliol","Okay I expect 2016 a little bit what we have also seen in 2015 we had in 2015 actually good profits of growth in the Lab area and particularly in the area that is not exposed to the industrial world. I expect that to go on. I do on the industrial piece however also expect that the challenge goes on in 2016, the challenge that we have experienced last year is that there is overcapacity in many of our end-user industries that we serve. And the overcapacity remains and the high volatility that we just see in general in China is going on. It is today probably too early to really have a good outlook for China, we want to see kind of Chinese New Year and how the business starts after that and we will certainly have a higher confidence level in our outlook when we talk next time about China and so May time is certainly giving us then better visibility, we saw that also last year the impact of how business does before and after Chinese New Year is actually quite important.","Bill March","Understood and then just as a follow-up maybe what is still playing out in the food retailing segment what is the decline this quarter and then as you look out in the next to see tougher comp even though Food and Chemical seems to be an area of somewhat strength in the applied markets? Thank you.","Olivier Filliol","So Food Retail I think important this is really to this -- our solution going to the big food retails\u2019 key accounts around the world and we have seen a decline here in Q4, but that was expected actually we did talk about this happening because we had a strong previous year and particularly in Europe we had one or two big projects. And for 2016, we expect also some declines in Food Retail that's because we have talked about key accounts and they plan their rollout actually a couple of quarters in advance, so we have a certain visibility about the big project. And just the way it is coming together makes us believe that 2016 will be more difficult. But I want also to remind the way we're running this retail, my strategic standpoint is really a focus on some profitability and not just on the growth and we accept in that sense also the volatility that we have in that business, but I did highlight in my prepared remarks that I am really happy to have the profitability is developing of this business. So I feel we're on a good track and I am not irritated by the fact that we expect some sales decline for that business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg from UBS. Your line is open.","Harris Iqbal","This is actually Harris on behalf of Jon I appreciate the question, so first one is in terms of pricing what are you expecting in 2016 compared to you prior guidance was 150 basis points, so curious seeing where FX and macro are today versus when you last reported what expectations are?","Bill Donnelly","So still think the 150 basis point is a good assumption here and even that macro-environment inflation and so on wouldn't necessarily suggest that it's an environment for price increases and we feel definitely comfortable with that. And our customers ban you, they ban your ad that our products are brining, we have well differentiated solutions. And this allows us also to have some pricing increases and we do that in a differentiated way across the world. We do it differentiated across the product lines and the tools that we have in place, the processes that we have in place should really enable us to increase prices independent of the macroeconomic environment. You might also recall that we did breakout price increases even in economic crises I feel we can do also price increases in low inflation environment.","Harris Iqbal","Got it and then one additional question, you've mentioned in the past various initiatives to and try to sale more serious contracts at the point of product sales, can you comment on the progress here and any initiatives you're pursuing on that front through 2016?","Bill Donnelly","Yes, so our focus is still very much on this topic and what maybe phrased as a more broadly of course we want to sell more service contract at the point of sales. So, we have efforts here that first we always include service in our courts. And then we train and incentivize our sales people to really also convert on that. That\u2019s an ongoing effort and the big benefit comes when we cumulate all the contract business over many years. But in parallel we have actually very significant efforts to grow on the whole installed base and make sure that we can capture as much of the installed base on the service contract. So, I want to make sure that we emphasize really both things. We are making good progress but I would want also to strength up on that it is a journey the service business growing the service business and particular the contract business is every quarter of every year capturing a few hundreds of additional customers. It's not just a bold strategy that you can implement within one or two years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Joel Kaufman","Hi guys it's actually Joel in for Isaac. Just wondering if you guys have seen any improved demand from your customers you actually benefit from lower oil prices and if not when do you think we might actually see that?","Olivier Filliol","It's an interesting question in the sense that I have been observing a little bit the chemical industry in particular who could be one of the beneficiary of the plastic industry as well. I don\u2019t see strong signals yet and in that sense I don\u2019t have much expectation that we are really going to benefit from this. And I would say that is probably a general comment, we don\u2019t see that many consumers or industry segments that are really benefiting from the lower oil prices.","Joel Kaufman","Great and then maybe just one on M&A, is the focus still on bolt ons or are you guys thinking about anything larger in the context of some of the valuations we are seeing in the market today. And then maybe any update on how the Board is thinking about the optimal leverage for the company?","Olivier Filliol","So, on M&A, we very much still pursue the same strategy, strategy of looking at opportunities, we have our radar, we nurture these opportunities and sometimes some more materializing and that the timing of it is difficult, the strategic target is to go for companies where we can add value and where it's strengthening our franchise and in essence there are not that very big companies that would really fall in that category and the few ones that are bigger might not just be available. So, I think what you are going to see from us is to do more of what we have done in recent years and this focus on really being able to strengthen the franchise has generated great results actually in the past and I want to continue to pursue that. On the balance sheet, Bill you might want to quickly comment on that one?","Bill Donnelly","So, as you know we've bought a little bit more in the share repurchase program and our free cash flow this past year we are going to do that again in 2016. And I think beyond that period of time I think we'll comment 12 months from now or something.","Operator","Your next question comes from the Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanly. Your line is open.","Michael Clerico","Yes hi guys, it's Michael Clerico on for Steve. Could you elaborate a little bit more on what's driving larger FX headwinds, are there any currencies outside the majors that are having a larger and is that expected to impact, also if you could quantify the impact to hedges on the '16 outlook and also how those hedges will lead into '17? Thanks.","Bill Donnelly","Sure. So, just to clarify there has not been any change in the OpEx environment since we last talked to guys in November, I mean there have been changes but they have basically netted out. In terms of the Swiss franc hedges, they will -- we have less of them this year. I think we were protecting maybe 85% of our exposure in 2015, that dropped to about 70% this year and then falls off completely in 2017 and the impact of it falling out completely is about $5 million or so.","Michael Clerico","Okay, great thanks. And then secondly, I just want to ask about guidance again, with stronger expected growth this quarter and the 1Q guide in at the top of the range. The full year implies deceleration throughout the year as we go. We know from last quarter you baked in a level of conservatism into that guidance. So I\u2019m wondering, what the bigger deltas are in the end markets that you saw since we last got the update and what\u2019s giving your cause in change the outlook given the stronger than second quarter, this quarter and the top of the range outlook for Q1? Thanks.","Bill Donnelly","I wouldn\u2019t read too much into that, we gave a guidance of 3% to 4%. We said 4% for the full year, we said 4% for Q1, I think in it very much reflects our more detailed look at how comps are going to go in particularly we see China has probably got to do a little better in Q1 then we expected it to do for the full year and I think that is largely explained by some specific comp considerations that they had. So I\u2019m careful I think the word you used to position, the question was deceleration. I think to say the, going from 4 to 3.5 deceleration is probably, I don\u2019t think the right analytical conclusion. I think is a little bit of comp topic in Q1 that benefits us and we largely think that what we see today is playing out very much in line with what the information that we had at the time we updated you guys in November.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin from Bank of America. Your line is open. Derik de Bruin your line is open. Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tycho Peterson","Hi, thanks. Wondering if you can talk about linearity in the quarter and any commentary you can provide on trends in January both to the overall business and then in particular within emerging markets?","Bill Donnelly","Tycho could you the word that you\u2019re asking, we both missed it we couldn\u2019t\u2026","Tycho Peterson","Yes. I\u2019m asking about linearity in the quarter, so just the sequential monthly trends throughout the quarter and then in January. If you can provide me commentary both for the overall business as well as emerging markets?","Bill Donnelly","Okay. So I think the guys both years for Chinese New Year is February. So in both periods it was February. The month of January is solid. So it\u2019s not that we are expecting to race at the finish, we entered the year with more backlog decent order trend leads and stuff seem in line. I think it\u2019s a realistic expectation, we had from the quarter. Maybe in terms of budget flush CapEx at the end of the year, I think ourselves and many of the peer guys felt very good about 2015\u2019s budget flush and I think how we saw it play out in 2016 was solid, vis-\u00e0-vis a relatively stronger Q4 of last year. So the farmer guys seem to be spending some money on businesses that are most oriented towards pharma had a good finish to the year.","Olivier Filliol","I think, I would also add, it\u2019s not easy to look at a trend on the monthly basis. A month can be impacted by bigger projects and number of working days and so on, so we don\u2019t necessarily look at monthly results to identify a trend, I think we prefer to take averages across at least three months, if not six months.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And I hate to harp on China, because I know you hit a disproportionate number of questions, but you did have flat orders there yet you\u2019re guiding for low single-digit decline in the year. So are you expecting orders to drop off over the next couple of quarters, I\u2019m just trying to understanding why you\u2019re projecting a decline not flat orders this quarter?","Bill Donnelly","I think so maybe similar to where Olivier finished off the answer to the previous piece. We don\u2019t read too much into the shorter period, if we kind of look out on the China business, there is nothing that has happened let\u2019s say positive since we talked to you guys in November about the China economic outlook. And I think we always have a little bit of a late-cycle economically in our business. So we\u2019re impacted by investment decisions and I don\u2019t think anybody is rushing to make positive investment decisions in China based on what they heard recently. So we think it\u2019s prudent to be cautious and we\u2019re happy it\u2019s going to be off to a good start. We prefer that than trying to explain to you guys, why we\u2019re going to catch up later in the year. But we\u2019re not, we prefer, what we got for the first quarter versus the alternative, but we\u2019re not still excited yet about a turnaround. And we don\u2019t expect when the turnaround does come Tycho that it\u2019s going to be a jump back, it\u2019s going to be a bottoming for a while that overcapacity will take some time.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then just lastly wondering if you could talk a little bit more Olivier on the fifth wave of Spinnaker and particularly interested on the replacement opportunity you alluded to, is there anything you can kind of guide us to as to the age of installed base or which part of the business you will see maybe disproportionate benefits?","Olivier Filliol","The fifth wave will not bring big revolutions. It's like the first four waves evolution. So we are strengthening all the different dimensions that we have been working on and bringing some additional sophistication. So topics around key account management, iBase management, the installed base topic all will remain in the center. I think where we get a little bit more sophisticated is in the area of big data analytics and leveraging it for sales and marketing initiatives. And the example that I used in the prepared remarks, we're going in that direction is that we're really applying more sophisticated analytics to the information that we have on the millions of installed instruments and the analytics allows us to better recognize the potential and based on the potential also use the right go to market approach. So meaning understanding, if this is an opportunity where we use telesales or are we using a field sales person and with what kind of value proposition we approach the customers. And there is certainly an area where we bring more sophistication with this fifth wave of Spinnaker.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brandon Couillard","Bill, just a couple for you, could you give us the ASP contribution in the fourth quarter and was there any acquisition revenue contribution from the deal you did in the third quarter?","Bill Donnelly","The latter one I can answer quickly, the answer is no. We didn\u2019t catch what you're asking for the first one?","Brandon Couillard","The pricing contribution to revenues in the fourth quarter?","Bill Donnelly","Okay, pricing was up 220 bps in the fourth quarter.","Brandon Couillard","And then I am just curious to how you're thinking about material cost for the year given what's happened in the commodity complex and how you see gross margins shaping out for the full year?","Bill Donnelly","I think again we'll have a good year on material cost we are down on an apples-to-apples basis about 3% in \u201915. I think we should have good year. It's important now to remember on commodity prices. We're not buying that much that is -- if you look at for example a machine part or a fabrication labor time, machine time would be a bigger cost element than the steel or the fabricating material itself. So we didn\u2019t' get hurt by material in anyway, I don't mean to imply that, and certainly we like it going this way more than the other. But it's for example of the 3% that we saved this year I think less than 1% is directly attributable to lower material cost.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Luke Lemoine","Hi, it's Luke in for Ross, I guess you've talked a little bit more than the returns you're seeing from your, the field turbo program, I guess what kind of inning we are in and if you guys have any plans to make any additional investments past what early goals were?","Olivier Filliol","So, as we discussed it on the November call, we have done a very successful wave of field turbo in 2015 and we want to repeat that into 2016, we're on track to implement about the same amount in terms of additional resources so roughly 200 field resources. We are very encouraged by the results that we had last year and we also want to approach it in a similar way this year in terms of funding it also through cost measures that we have in other areas of the company. And the projects or the field additions are very similar to last year in terms of the business priorities, but of course and the territories might be different, but the geographic focus remains on the markets that have reasonable growth momentum. And we're adding again quite a sizable number of resources in Americas and as well as selectively in Europe and yes.","Luke Lemoine","Okay great and I guess turning to emerging markets we're seeing a lot of mixed singles over there and you guys are seeing some strengths and some weaknesses, I was hoping you\u2019d give more color into the various customer segments that you're seeing these trends in and kind of where you see any turnarounds and reversals in any of these trends?","Olivier Filliol","So if we exclude China for a minute, in all the other emerging markets I wouldn't talk too much industry specific. I think actually it's more the geography than the industry. And when we talk about Brazil and Russia the challenges and the headwinds we had last year it's actually very difficult to attribute to that to a certain industry segment. We saw it actually pretty much grow across the business lines, and across industry segments. And what we are seeing is however that across the different emerging markets there are big differences, we have seen actually emerging markets that did very well for us. And we talked India, Mexico did well, Southeast Asia did actually well. And so we have multiple emerging markets that did well last year and I expect actually that this year it's also going to be mixed. We are going to have emerging markets that do well and they are going to be emerging markets that will be more challenging. Partially, I would attribute the good results that we had in certain emerging markets last year to an excellent performance by our local teams. With some highlights countries like Mexico and Southeast Asia that did really exceptionally well and that\u2019s certainly also attributable to programs that we have in place. Some of the emerging markets, and the economic environment might be a little bit more challenging but we consciously want to invest in these markets because we believe also in the long term I would name here for example Turkey but also Indonesia, and Vietnam and so on where you can see a certain cool down from an macroeconomic environment, nonetheless, we continue to invest there because we feel we can win market share and in the long term these economies will continue to develop well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias from Citi. Your line is open.","Brian Kipp","Hi guys this is actually Brian Kipp on behalf of Dan. Well I just wanted to step back and go to 4Q last year when the Swiss National Bank removed the peg. You guys were talking about looking at your cost structure especially in light of hedging starting to roll off 2016. Now that we are seeing volatility in emerging markets currencies a little bit more than we are seeing in Europe. What are your thoughts there, have you guys gone through a plan, have you started to reallocate resources into Europe, maintained in Switzerland or move to emerging markets just want to get some color there?","Olivier Filliol","Okay. I think we need to differentiate here between resources and cost base that we have that is associated with producing products and with serving local markets. When we talk about the cost base that we have in Switzerland and the currency exposure this wasn\u2019t the cost associated with serving Switzerland and the market but actually in terms of having a cost base because we do R&D product development and production in Switzerland. And this is true for Switzerland this true for our manufacturing base in China and so on, but we don\u2019t have this strengthening of a currency that is a headwind except in Switzerland until this was specific to Switzerland.","And now, in the order markets of where we serve a country and there is currency exposure. We do a little bit cost measure specifically it's more on the pricing side that we would actually work. And with one big exception and that\u2019s China. In China, we have taken cost measures not because of currency but because of market dynamics. And there it is very much about resource shifting, and we have business lines that have growth prospects in orders. So, probably not surprising we have done restructuring in the industrial business in China as for the lab business we continue to invest into it as we are adding resources.","Brian Kipp","I appreciate it, and piggy backing off of Tycho\u2019s question. I know the Spinnaker fifth wave is early stages but have you guys done any best testing at all yet and when do you expect to kind a fully ramp that and if you haven't done bets testing and start to convert some of those orders?","Olivier Filliol","So, the bets testing wouldn\u2019t necessary apply to Spinnaker the way we develop things is we go out to -- on the different market organization and we study different best practices. And when we see that we have a best practice of certain sophistication in an approach and so when we qualify that as a tool box with qualified and training and then we roll it out. So, in that sense it's not beta testing, it's already reality. We have these pilots these crusaders of teams out there that have done good stuff that we are scaling up and rolling out. The scale up takes place over to about a year, and we go and normally with these more sophisticated levels to the countries that are more mature. And then we follow-up with the other countries and there a few things that we drive from the center rather than bottom up from the units, like the big data analytics things there are from the center. And there I would say yes, we start with prototypes and then we industrialize the things so there I am with you with the beta testing. I feel comfortable where we stand on that one and I know we\u2019re going to have the results out of it.","Brian Kipp","Okay. I guess it was in context to the data analytics stuff, so you\u2019re in kind of like a bets testing type phase evaluating what methodologies you should use in the marketing realm versus actually out in reaching out to customers on a broad-base. That\u2019s correct?","Olivier Filliol","Yes, that\u2019s correct. In this area it is also about we really try to innovate in this area. As we try to come up with new approaches, tools, and technology tools, databases and all that stuff that we are combining. And there is a very small team that is leading the thinking process on that one. And that\u2019s the prototype part and when we have cracked that analytics, scaling it up afterwards or industrializing is normally not the challenging part.","Brian Kipp","I appreciate it. If I can sneak one more in Bill did you see any gross margin benefit were you able to clean out any gross margin benefit from oil and freight et cetera or is that something that\u2019s probably a little too deep?","Bill Donnelly","Hi we had a good freight number savings year-on-year. But I doubt it would be big enough to move the needle good could it be 5 basis points maybe something like that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Steve Willoughby","Just two things, one just a follow-up to make sure I heard you correctly. Bill and Mary as it relates to FX. Just want to make sure I heard you correctly that you\u2019re now assuming that FX is going to negatively impact your revenue by, I believe you said 4.5% and earnings by 1.5%, is that correct?","Bill Donnelly","It will impact earnings by 1.5% for the full year and it will impact sales by 3%.","Mary Finnegan","For the full year.","Bill Donnelly","For the full year, the 4.5, I think is Q1 and the 2.5 on EPS is Q1.","Mary Finnegan","That\u2019s right.","Steve Willoughby","Okay, great. Thanks for clarify that. And then just Bill, I know you guys have had a large number of different products in skews, but I was wondering if the creation or development of any new products that you guys have been adding over the past year or two worth into 2016 is anything worth discussing as it relates to the overall impact on the company?","Olivier Filliol","No. In the sense that, we need to constantly come out with product innovations, upgrades to existing products and so on and that is just part of our business model and it\u2019s typically an individual product helps us to increase pricing and have better models and keep the growth growing. But it\u2019s not that it\u2019s going to really change our overall number. An individual product will not really change the needle.","Steve Willoughby","Okay. I was thinking more in the kind of expanding in the new types of products that you guys haven\u2019t been offered in the past at all?","Olivier Filliol","In the new product categories it typically takes multiple quarters that is adds up to millions of dollars. Yes it is actually Bill corrected me make it years. So we need to be realistic on that one. Even, yes what I have seen when we expanded new product categories after 5-10 years, it becomes really something effective, so yes that is it.","Steve Willoughby","Sure. And then just one quick follow-up, I was just wondering that if we could have any thoughts on the difference in growth between the Americas and Europe. So I understand in the Americas, the pharma is driving a lot of the growth there. And is there any reason, there isn\u2019t thoughts on, why you\u2019re not seeing similar type of growth in Europe?","Olivier Filliol","I mean first I would clearly say North America it is much more healthy in terms of economy that Europe, definitely. But I want also to say that I\u2019m very happy with the results than we had in Europe last year. Particularly if I look at the two year phase and then if you exclude Russia and that is something that has to do in Q4 kind of a, as exclude retail. It\u2019s actually a good performance. So nevertheless, Americas did even better and I expect 2016 to be the same Americas have more dynamic than Europe. In terms of team performance, in terms of share gain actually similar.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Richard Eastman","Yes, good evening. Bill could you just kind of speak real quickly. So in the fourth quarter, the service and consumables, how did that grow relative to hardware against the 3% local currency growth rate? Did we see any hardware growth?","Bill Donnelly","Actually our service growth wasn't that high in Q4, I think it was 2% or so, its consumables might have 2 or 3 and the reason for that was we had about 11% growth in Q4 a year ago, so the product business modestly outgrew the service business, but I think that that's more of comp topic.","Richard Eastman","And Olivier I just -- may be you could just do just a quick deeper dive on the product inspection business and I am a little bit curious the macro trends in food inspection has been prevailingly positive here for some time and so when you look at that market what's your sense of the markets growth? And then is there some new products you spoke to there, are there any technology trends that are boosting at those content within that marketplace and just I am kind of getting at what the growth product inspection growth should be for \u201916 and what your expectation is to perhaps outgrow the favorable macro there?","Olivier Filliol","Okay. First on the macro, I would differentiate a little bit by geography. The long-term trends are very favorable across the world for this business segment and we're extremely well positioned. But there are temporary things happening for example China we clearly see that also the food industry is holding back. There is an overcapacity and the whole food industry is challenged right now in China also in terms of margins. So you see the big foreign companies but also local companies like MasterCom as well cutting back significant off their CapEx and that impacts our product inspection business.","And while in U.S. for example we have very good data again we had very good growth for example last year. And so I would say globally and long-term very favorable, short-term we need differences by geographies. In terms of our market position, we have an excellent position because we are the leader in all the core technologies. We are a leader across the globe as typically we have competitors that are more regional and typically in one or the other technology.","In terms of technology development, the check weighing and metal detection business is a relatively mature technology. The x-ray technology is still at an adoption rate that is growing meaning that not all the production lines are equipped today with x-ray technology even in western markets as part of a metal detection that is a more mature technology and has been widely applied and so we leave our supply from replacement business. And then the fourth technology is vision inspection, vision inspection has multiple applications and that's one that is more developing and it's more than early stage and also for us it's still a smaller and will hopefully develop well over the next 5-10 years.","Richard Eastman","And you would be pleased in \u201916, if on a consolidated basis that product inspection grew kind of at that similar 6% rate that we saw in \u201915, is that, that would be, okay, okay\u2026","Olivier Filliol","No, no, I think that's a reasonable assumption.","Richard Eastman","Yes, okay and then, I feel like I might have misheard the numbers or but in China the growth rates that you gave for Lab and the growth rate that you gave for the Industrial business kind of weighted out to 50\/50 in terms of the size of those businesses, is that correct?","Olivier Filliol","No.","Bill Donnelly","You said significant you're talking about the fourth quarter standing alone?","Richard Eastman","Yes, you talked about and you said in the fourth quarter that Industrial was down.","Olivier Filliol","Yes so, sorry, Lab was 42% sales in the quarter in China while Industrial was 49 and Retail was 9.","Richard Eastman","Okay, I got you, all right, that makes sense, and then just a -- how is the profit margin held up in China relative to the industrial declines that we've seen there, I got to believe certain pieces of the Industrial market are competitive but there is nothing visible in the margin line consolidated, so you've managed the whole margins there pretty flat despite the sales declines in China?","Bill Donnelly","Yes, this is the customers that have the money are usually spending on more sophisticated applications that we make more money on. It's always the businesses that have the least amount of customer value proposition that gets hit the hardest. And it's partly a reflection of who the buyers are, partly a reflection of the nature of the application. And so you are right our margins have held up reasonably in China despite some of the sales declines and we are working hard to continue to do that going forward as well.","Richard Eastman","Okay. And then a last question from me is the restructuring charge kind of kicked up a little bit and obviously we are using that to pay for the field turbo program. But can you just give us a sense of where the cost out is coming from either by end market or by region?","Bill Donnelly","Sure, I think the two biggest pieces would be China and Europe and you can assume it's more weighted to for example the industrial business in both cases.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derek de Bruin from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Derek de Bruin","So just one of the things I wanted to ask has already been asked but Bill what are your pricing assumptions 2016 in terms of being able to get pricing?","Olivier Filliol","It is actually 150 basis points, so it's about the same that we guided over back in November. We feel comfortable with that even that the macroeconomic environment might have changed a little bit I feel comfortable that we can execute on that one.","Derek de Bruin","And that is just you doing more Spinnaker and the focus on that. I mean I guess you are not seeing any of the local people sort of pickup speed like that or being pushed back on it I am just wondering if it's -- does your ability execute or does the competition just not play in?","Olivier Filliol","No, it is actually it has much more to do with the customers. We have good differentiated products and as long as we do price increases every year actually we operate almost the load at radar and they accept that. And of course we differentiate significantly across the world by geography as well as the business lines. And we are going to execute it in a similar way as we did in the past. Of course every year it is getting a little bit more sophisticated but the approaches that we used to it is very similar. And it is a line that I haven\u2019t used many times but the biggest obstacle for price increases are often not the customers but our internal organization sales people and that is something we can work on and can control, so, I feel comparable from that end.","Derek de Bruin","So, one of your strategies in terms of growth outlook has been that in your China business it is more heavily industrial weighted at the moment and overtime you expect China to look like the rest of the world business and have more of a Lab focus. Given the current economic situation in China and the slowing macro economy, are you worried that it may take longer to sort of get that conversion going on right now, I guess sort of how you are looking at what's going on in China right now into your longer terms plans so your strategy as to how tap into that market?","Bill Donnelly","I think that there are things kind of going both ways right Derek, so I may be give you two example so -- because our industrial has been shrinking we are moving more towards the corporate side.","Derek de Bruin","Good point yeah [Multiple Speakers].","Bill Donnelly","As far as the offer is that -- but then maybe to your point Olivier made this point on MasterCom cutting their CapEx levels the largest food company in China. And that certainly has slowed the move to more consumer safety in the food inspection area. So, probably both of us would say that if the economy was going better the move towards more consumer safety food inspection considerations would have had a more accelerated pace than China that it does now given the overall economic circumstances, so a little bit of both ways.","Operator","Your next quarter comes from the line of David Stratton from Great Lakes Review. Your line is open.","David Stratton","Thanks taking the call. I was wondering if you can give some color around CapEx expectations for 2016 and how that relates to the expansion projects that you mentioned in the last earnings call?","Bill Donnelly","So, we are going to have CapEx of 120 million or so next year and that includes some significant building programs in the United States and Europe and I think a little bit in China as well. China is a little bit more a story about we will be consolidating with some other facilities there.","David Stratton","All right, and then lastly kind of a housekeeping, would you breakout your service in consumables revenue as a percentage of sales for the fourth and the full year?","Bill Donnelly","All right, you have to give me one second we have that number it is, -- so in Q4, service was 27% of sales and if I include service and consumables. I am sorry that was service and consumables and for the full year it was 30%. And so always a little less in the fourth quarter because that\u2019s a big quarter for product sales so it impacts the mix of it.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will turn it back over to Mary Finnegan for closing remarks.","Mary Finnegan","Thanks Cameron and thanks everyone for joining us. Just had one last comment as your planning your schedules for this year. We wanted to let you know that we plan to hold an Investor Meeting at our Rainin facility and Oakland California on Friday, July 29th. We will have some more details for you in the coming weeks, but just wanted to mention it now as you are starting your planning. And that is all we have for tonight. Again thanks for joining us.

Please go ahead, ma'am.","Mary T. Finnegan","Thanks, Jay, and good evening, everyone. I am Mary Finnegan. I'm the Treasurer and responsible for Investor Relations at Mettler-Toledo. I'm happy to have you on the call tonight. I'm joined by Olivier Filliol, our CEO; and Bill Donnelly, our Executive Vice President.","I want to cover just a couple of administrative matters before we get started. This call is being webcast and is available for replay on our website. A copy of the press release and the presentation that we'll -- we will refer to in today's call is also on the website.","Let me summarize the Safe Harbor language, which is outlined on Page 1.

More detailed information with respect to the use of and differences between the non-GAAP financial measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided in the 8-K.","I will now turn the call over to Olivier.","Olivier A. Filliol","Thanks, Mary, and welcome to everyone on the call. I will start with a summary of the quarter, and then Bill will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments on 2014. As always, we will have time for Q&A at the end.","The highlights of the quarter are on Page 2 of the presentation. Local currency sales increased 3% in the quarter with solid results in the Americas and Europe. As expected, demand was weaker in China, but was offset by better conditions in other regions of Asia \/ Rest of World.","Similar to what we have achieved all year, we had another quarter of gross margin expansion, which, combined with the benefit of our cost control initiatives, drove a solid increase in operating profit and earnings. I'm pleased with the 10% increase in earnings per share in the quarter, given the modest sales growth.","As we turn to 2014, we are cautiously optimistic on the developed world, as it appears our markets have stabilized. We expect emerging markets to improve as the year progresses, largely based on easier comps. Bill will provide additional details on our updated assumptions for 2014, and I will have some additional comments on our growth initiatives for this year.","Let me now turn it over to Bill to first cover the fourth quarter financial results.","William P. Donnelly","Thanks, Olivier, and hello, everybody. Let me start with sales, some specifics there. We had sales of $684.3 million in the quarter, an increase of 3% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased by 4%, as currencies benefited sales by approximately 1% in the quarter.","Now turning to Page 3 of the presentation. We outlined sales by geography. In the quarter, local currency sales increased by 8% in Europe and by 2% in the Americas. Asia \/ Rest of World was flat as compared to the prior year. Without the impact of exited product lines, Asia \/ Rest of World increased by 1% in the quarter. For China specifically, local currency sales, excluding exited product lines, declined by 5% in the quarter, modestly better than expected as compared to the last time we spoke. Exited product lines contributed a further 2% decline in China sales for the quarter.","On Slide #4, sales growth by geography for the full year is summarized. In total, local currency sales increased by 1% for the year, with a 3% increase in both Europe and the Americas, while Asia \/ Rest of World declined by 4%.","Sales growth by product line for the quarter is highlighted on Slide #5. Laboratory sales increased by 6% in local currency, while industrial increased by 2%. Adjusting for product line exits in China, industrial sales increased by 3% in the quarter. Food retailing declined by 4% in the quarter.","The next slide shows results for the full year. In laboratory, our sales grew by 3%, while they declined in industrial by 1%, and food retailing increased by 1% for the year.","Turning to the next slide, let me walk you through the key items on the P&L for the fourth quarter. We're very pleased with our gross margins, which were 54.9% in the quarter, a 60-basis-point increase over the prior year. We benefited from pricing and lower material costs, which were offset in part by currency and other charges. R&D amounted to $30.6 million, a 7% increase in local currency versus the prior year. The increase was driven by the timing of some new product launches.","SG&A amounted to $179.8 million, an increase of 2% in local currency as compared to last year. Increased sales and marketing costs were offset by slightly lower variable compensation.","Adjusted operating income amounted to $165 million in the quarter, which represents an 8% increase over the prior year amount of $153.4 million. Our operating margins were 24.1%, an increase of 80 basis points over the prior year. We estimated that currencies reduced operating profit by $2.6 million or reduced the growth of operating profit by about 1% and reduced our operating margins by about 60 basis points. We're pleased with the growth in operating income and the margin expansion during the quarter.","A couple of final items on the P&L. Amortization was $6.9 million. Our interest expense was $6.2 million, and our effective tax rate continues at 24%. Fully diluted shares for the quarter were 30.4 million, which is a 3% decline versus the prior year and reflects the impact of our share repurchase program.","Adjusted earnings per share was $3.82 per share, a 10% increase over the prior year amount of $3.47. On a reported basis, EPS was $3.63 as compared to $3.35 in the prior year. Reported EPS includes pretax restructuring charges of $6.1 million or $0.15 per share. These are primarily employee-related charges. Reported EPS also includes $0.03 of purchased intangible amortization and $0.01 of debt extinguishment cost related to the new 5-year bank facility we put in place during the quarter.","Slide #8 shows our full year results. To recap that, our local currency sales grew by 1%. Our gross margins increased by 90 basis points, while operating profit increased by 6%. This resulted in an adjusted earnings per share growth of 9%. While our top line fell short of initial expectations for the year, we were pleased with our ability to generate solid earnings per share growth and despite the weak market conditions.","Now turning to cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $89.2 million as compared to $93.7 million in the prior year. We had expected cash flow to be down in the quarter, and it's largely explained by higher voluntary pension payments. Working capital statistics were solid in the quarter as ITO was at 5.2x on an LTM basis as compared to 4.9x a year ago. And our DSO was 43 days, which is constant with the prior year.","Full year cash flow came in higher than expected and reached $284.6 million or $9.26 per share. This represents a 16% increase per share over the prior year, a growth rate we're very pleased with.","Now let's turn to guidance. Market conditions in the West appear to have stabilized, and we would expect growth in 2004 (sic) [ 2014 ] to be low- to mid-single digits. Europe and Americas will both be in this range.","For Europe, I anticipate this region will start the year solidly, and then maybe a little less growth in the second half of the year as they reach tougher comparisons.","For Asia \/ Rest of World, there's more uncertainty in the market, but we certainly have expectations for an improvement in our Chinese business. Specifically, our expectations are in line with what we discussed with you last quarter on the call. That is, we expect market conditions to continue to be challenging in the early part of the year and expect a sales decline in the first quarter. We think order growth will be better, and we will start to see improved sales growth as we get into the second part of the year. Recent order trends would support our view that the China business is starting to improve.","Overall, we would expect Asia \/ Rest of World to have mid-single-digit growth in 2014, with China sales growth a little lower. As a reminder, we expect exited product lines to contribute to a 2% sales -- contribute a 2% sales decline in China.","So taking this all together, we expect local currency sales growth to be in the 3% to 4% range this year. That's the same range we provided during our last call. Although our sales guidance is unchanged in terms of the growth rate, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to the range of $11.40 per share to $11.60 per share, a growth rate of 8% to 10%. This is an increase of $0.05 from our previous guidance of $11.35 to $11.55. This raise reflects our Q4 beat, offset to a degree by a modestly worse currency environment as compared to what we had in November. Specifically, the yen and certain Asian currencies are hurting us more as compared to a few months ago.","For the first quarter, we would expect local currency sales growth to be approximately 3% and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.93 to $1.98 or a growth of 5% to 8%. Q1's EPS growth is lower versus our full year guidance for growth, as 2 headwinds we faced this year, higher Blue Ocean amortization as well as foreign exchange, had a disproportionately large impact in Q1 versus the other quarters.","As you're updating your models, let me cover some additional specifics on the guidance. First, currency. We would expect currency to reduce sales by approximately 1% in the first quarter, but have no impact for the remaining quarters and no impact for the full year, again, based on current rates. In terms of the impact of currency on earnings, we would expect currency to reduce earnings between 3% and 4% in the first quarter, 2% in the second quarter and be neutral thereafter. For the full year, 2014 currency is expected to reduce earnings growth between 1.5% and 2%.","A couple of additional clarifications. Amortization will amount to $29 million in 2014, and you should continue to assume an effective tax rate of 24%, and that all our free cash flow will be used for share repurchases. We would expect free cash flow to be in the range of $305 million, which represents a 10% increase in free cash flow per share versus 2013.","Just one final comment on 2014 before I turn it back to Olivier. We did a very good job in 2013 in generating earnings growth off of low sales growth. This was done through cost control measures that we first began to implement in 2012, as well as other initiatives in pricing and supply-chain and our ongoing cost improvement programs. It was also done via lower variable compensation, as we did not hit our targets in 2013. This was the second year in a row we fell short of our internal targets with the related impact on our variable comp. As we look at 2014, we feel very good about our ability to continue to expand margins through pricing, supply chain and the benefits of our cost actions. However, we don't have the same level of flexibility in our cost structure as we did in 2013 because we're facing a couple of headwinds. First, variable comp will be higher, as we've reset our targets; second, we have a tougher currency environment; and third, higher amortization with Blue Ocean. These headwinds can be overcome if the sales environment evolves as expected, but they would be a bigger challenge if we don't see the expected sales growth. I hope these last few comments are helpful.","And now I want to turn it over to Olivier.","Olivier A. Filliol","Thanks, Bill, and let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab increased 6% in the quarter with very good growth in Europe and Asia \/ Rest of World, while Americas also had good growth. We had growth in all major product areas, with particular good growth in Balances, Analytical Instruments and Process Analytics. For the year, lab increased 3%, and I continue to feel good about our market position. Industrial increased 2% in the quarter, with Product Inspection up double digits and core industrial down mid-single digits. We are very pleased with our Product Inspection growth, which reflects our strong presence in this market. The decline in core industrial is driven by Asia, particularly China, and we also had a decline in core industrial in the Americas. In Europe, core industrial was roughly flat. For the year, industrial was down 1%, with Product Inspection up single -- mid-single digits and core industrial down 4%. Retail was down 4% in the quarter and up 1% for the year.","Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Europe was up strongly in the quarter with an 8% growth. While comparisons were easy, we were pleased to see solid growth in most countries. For the year, Europe had growth of 3%.","Americas was up 2% in the quarter, with growth in lab and Product Inspection offset by declines in core industrial and retail. For the year, Americas increased 3%.","Asia \/ Rest of the World was flat in the quarter. The decline in China, which Bill already mentioned, was offset by strong growth in most other regions. For the year, Asia \/ Rest of the World was down 4%.","That covers my comments on the business, and now let me make some comments on 2014. I would characterize our outlook for this year as pivoting towards growth. Let me explain what I mean. We believe our markets in the developed world have stabilized and expect growth in 2014. Our priority in these regions is to ensure we have the sales and marketing programs and field resources in place to capitalize on growth opportunities as customer demand strengthens. In emerging markets, particularly China, it will take until the second half of the year to see improved sales growth as we approach easier comparisons. With this as a backdrop, let me comment on our key focus areas for 2014.","Our sales and marketing programs are centered on capturing organic growth opportunities. In 2014, we will continue our Spinnaker programs with a new series of best practice initiatives that we will roll out across units. I would describe the current round of initiatives as more focused towards improving sales force productivity versus generating more leads. We feel this emphasis toward the sales process is appropriate, as we expect improving market conditions and feel the lead generation processes are already highly effective.","In addition to the new Spinnaker initiative, we are initiating a new round of field turbos. Turbos, you will remember, are targeted additions of sales and service resources to pursue very specific product, segment or geographic growth opportunities. In total, we have initiated more than 40 field turbo projects, of which approximately 75% are focused in developed markets, with the remainder in emerging markets. There is a certain risk associated with adding these resources, but past experience has shown that these targeted investments have good returns in the medium term. We believe the investments are merited, assuming improving market conditions in 2014, but acknowledge that they do use the flexibility of our cost structure.","Important to our strong marketing program is a robust product pipeline. I have 2 examples to share with you, which highlight our innovation in product development. The first is from our Automated Chemistry group, which is launching a breakthrough instrument for sampling chemistry for analysis. Taking samples for off-line HPLC and NMR analysis is one of the most common practices in discovery and chemistry development plans. However, the task of high quality and representative sampling is widely recognized as being time consuming, tedious and prone to error that can lead to poor results. Our innovative easy-sample instrument addresses these challenges by using a unique proprietary mechanism, which can capture samples across a wide range of chemistries. And importantly, once the sample is taken, it is immediately quenched or stopped, ensuring that no further chemical reaction takes place.","Traditional sampling methods typically uses a syringe, which takes 30 seconds or longer, during which the chemical reaction is still progressing. With easy sampler, the sample taken is always representative of the chemistry in the vessel at the time of sampling. Furthermore, because the vessel is not open during the sampling process, it is safer for the operator, given dangerous and highly toxic chemicals that can be involved. And it includes no contamination of the chemistry in the vessel.","The easy sampler not only provides highly reproducible sampling, it is also automated, allowing 24\/7 operation. In our opinion, there is no comparable instrument in the market today.","Another innovative new launch currently underway from our Process Analytics group is our new portable TOC instrument or Total Organic Carbon analyzer. We are a leader in online TOC, which helps customers in segments such as pharma, power and microelectronics ensure no organic contaminants are present in the water used in manufacturing. We're expanding our portfolio offering with this fast, simple and reliable portable instrument. We see opportunities within our existing customer base, as it provides engineers and quality assurance managers flexibility to spot check several measurement points for water system performance. We also see opportunities in emerging markets and smaller manufacturers in developed markets, where TOC measurement is becoming more crucial and the price point of a full TOC system was prohibitive. We are excited about the potential of this market segment and pleased with our ability to leverage our strength in TOC to the portable segment.","These are just 2 examples from our product pipeline, which we believe continues to help us outdistance our competition.","Turning now to emerging markets. As I already mentioned, we believe market conditions will continue to be challenging during the first part of this year, but expect to return to growth in the second half as comparisons become easier. We are reallocating resources and redirecting certain businesses away from infrastructure-related markets toward higher-growth segments. We continue to be very bullish on China and emerging markets for the long term, as their economic development and movement to a more consumer-driven economy will benefit our lab, Process Analytics and Product Inspection businesses. These businesses, which are our centers of pharma, food, biotech and chemical, are traditional Mettler-Toledo strongholds. We have significant market, product and application knowhow in these market segments. We believe that the shift toward these businesses will position us even stronger in China and in emerging markets in the long term.","We view our strong presence in emerging markets as a key competitive advantage. The strength of our long-standing presence in these markets was highlighted by our selection late last year as one of 20 companies for Shanghai's new pilot free-trade zone. As the central Chinese government continues to take steps to move from government-oriented economy to market-oriented, this zone will act as a testing ground for new policies. We expect to benefit in terms of a more simplified customs processes, reduced need for approvals for shipping goods, receiving payments and converting currencies. We are also pleased with our selection as a pilot in this venture, and we'll leverage the opportunity to build a new Asian regional logistics hub, which we expect to begin operating later this year.","While I characterize 2014 as a year where we are pivoting towards growth, we also remain focused on continuing our enhancements to our margin. Our overall cost structure is in good shape, given the actions we have undertaken over the last 3 years. Pricing will contribute to margin increases this year. Our revised supply-chain initiatives, including those aimed at reducing material cost and improving lead times, will be a net positive in 2014. Finally, we will continue to develop expertise in low-cost countries for support areas, such as marketing, software development and IT.","Before I open it for questions, let me summarize the key points for 2014. Overall, we are optimistic, but recognize that until we return to our historic growth rates, we need to maintain a certain caution. Western markets appear to have stabilized, and I believe we are poised to capture growth opportunities as these markets continue to strengthen. China and certain emerging markets remain challenging, but we are executing well and our taking steps to reallocate resources that will benefit us in the long term. We continue to invest for both the short and long term in Spinnaker marketing programs and field resources, but also in Blue Ocean, product development and employee training and development. We feel good about our strong market position and, with continued good execution, believe that we can grow faster than our underlying markets and continue to gain share.","That covers my comments, and I want to ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Paul Knight with Janney Capital Markets.","Bryan Kipp - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","This is actually Bryan Kipp on behalf of Paul. Just want to start off here on the margin front. In the past, you guys alluded to 50 to 100 bp margin expansion on the op margin and just kind of want to get the color on that. With the 150 in the past, 150 on price, obviously, you have some headwinds there with SG&A variable comp. I'm just trying to get my head around what do you expect. Do you expect it to be more flat with that pricing leverage, or you think it's -- you have some opportunity for upside there?","William P. Donnelly","In terms of our margin for -- margin expansion for 2014, I think we should have something approaching 50 bps. I think, at today's exchange rates, it might be slightly less than that, but something in that range is realistic. And that would probably be a little split between what we do in margin, gross margin and operating margin. But I think we feel pretty good that we can have further gross margin expansion next year.","Bryan Kipp - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And just probably leveraged more to the back half like historicals, or do you think that's changed?","William P. Donnelly","So we -- and maybe the way you posed your question, I think, actually, we tend to look at it Q4-on-Q4, Q3-on-Q3. And this year, our -- in the second half, we had a little bit less expansion on the gross margin line than we did in the first half of the year. I think, sitting here at this stage, not quite knowing how things will play out exactly, I'd see no reason why the gross margin should have as big a delta. I think we'll have a gross margin expansion in the first quarter. It might be a little bit better in the second half of the year, but I don't think it's going to make such a difference quarter-by-quarter as it did this year. Prices[ph] went into effect in January so that's, of course, one of the bigger levers. In terms of cost measures, those might be realized more gradually through the year, but that would probably be my main comments.","Bryan Kipp - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. Appreciate it. And just a quick follow-up on China as well. Last time, you guys alluded to a leading bottler business. Potentially, it's growing extremely fast and a potential opportunity for you, all, and additional capacity utilization potential out in China. Are those -- do you still see excess capacity there? And the potential of that bottling business, is that ongoing?","William P. Donnelly","So in terms of the overall business in China, I think that it's -- of course, we weren't so happy to see the recent PMI numbers. We would comment that we saw some -- if I look at fourth quarter growth in our core businesses, actually order entry was pretty good. Our order entry was up mid-single digits with many of the businesses actually doing better than that and retail actually being down. In January, the numbers were a little bit more mixed, so it's tough to judge because of how Chinese New Year and everything falls. But I think, at this stage, we're kind of feeling that, in the current cycle, it's kind of bouncing along the bottom now. If new headwinds come from something else in China, it could -- or tailwinds for that matter, it could change that. But I think we kind of cautiously feel that what we've predicted to you guys, we would see evidence that things are moving in that direction. Now with regard to the bottling reference, I think we did mention, for example, last quarter, I think it was last quarter that there was some big expansions in that area. I wouldn't want to over-exaggerate that as a key end market for our business today. It's a market that we serve. And I think we were more commenting as an example of people in certain sectors, particularly those closer to the consumer economy, are making more investments and that's maybe just as an example of that. I think that we still have a long way to go to kind of convert the economy because that's where the majority of the spend is. But I think, step-by-step, we're moving our business there. As you know, sometimes transitions aren't totally smooth, but we think that we're very well positioned for these kind of consumer markets with food, pharma, cosmetics, et cetera. These are really markets we have excellent positions in, and excellent application knowledge, and we should be able to compete very effectively in China.","Olivier A. Filliol","What we are also saying was that is in China, we will have to differentiate more than probably in any other markets segment-by-segment. We see certain industry segments that it will take years until the overcapacity has rebalanced, and we're going to see good growth again. I think we mentioned in previous occasions, for example, the cement industry, the steel industry and so on, these are very difficult segments because they are also related to infrastructure. And then there are other industry segments like the food industry, life science industries and so on, that we perceive as much more attractive and have better growth potential. And also, geographically, we see differences. For example, there are multiple second-tier cities that we have good growth in Q4 and expect, actually, also good growth in 2014. We need to tap fully in these opportunities, shift resources towards that, and that will help us. But this differentiation by segments is particularly important in China and reflects the current economic state of that country.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So maybe just following up on the last ones on China specifically. I mean, it sounds like you're confident in the second half of the year recovery. Could you maybe just talk about, I mean, what your overall expectations are for the full year then? Have they changed since you guided last quarter?","William P. Donnelly","So, hey, maybe what I -- just to clarify a little bit what I was trying to say, Tycho, is I think we provided a certain guidance that, hey, we would expect a decline in Q1, flattish in Q2 with some mid-single-digit growth in the second half of the year. I think everything we've seen so far would say that, that path is very realistic. At the same time, I want to put it in perspective, it's a relatively short cycle business. So if I have -- I probably have a handful of orders that go into the second half of the year. But we think, based on the order trend we saw, what we view as our outlook for the first quarter, where we have a little bit more certainty on, we think that, hey, things seem to be moving in that direction. And I guess, I think that was kind of your question, or did I miss part of it?","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. No, that -- that's helpful. And then as we think about where the growth will be coming from, in China, you talked about food, pharma, environmental, I mean, do you need to invest in any of the channels there? And maybe just talk a little bit about globally, where you're making selective reinvestments for this year?","Olivier A. Filliol","Okay. So related to China, it's about -- we saw shifting. It's not that we need to do net investments. It's really moving the emphasis on different segments, different applications, so no specific investments. Most of the investments that we have initiated as turbos here went actually to the developed markets. These are certain territories that might have been under-penetrated, and we feel that we can gain market share and growth by having additional field resources. Sometimes, it's also initiatives, like we see good growth opportunities for service in Product Inspection in U.S., and we dedicate more resources to that. So it's actually really broad-based. I mentioned on -- in prepared remarks, more than 45 projects. So you can imagine these are many small projects, sometimes just 1 resource, sometimes it's 10 resources. It's about developing organic growth opportunities together with the countries, together with the strategic business units. And in the past, we were more focused towards emerging markets. This time, more focused to developed markets. The reason certainly is that we have been very selective in resource allocation in the West for many years. Now we feel we see a stronger development in the West, and we want to tap in that opportunity.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then, Bill, can you just break out gross margin contributions by price, material costs and mix? Then I'll hop off.","William P. Donnelly","Okay. So in the quarter, we had a 200-basis-point net realized price increase, and our material costs were down 240 basis points. In terms of the impact that, that had on gross profit margin, the 200-basis-point price increase was about 90 bps on the gross margin line, and the 240 bps on material cost translated to about 60 bps on the gross margin line.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Bill, just want to make sure I understand some of your comments right. It looks like currency was a little worse, both in the quarter and in terms of the full year '14 outlook. Looks like it was a couple of pennies, perhaps, in the fourth quarter and maybe as much as $0.10 negative to the full year view. Can you quantify that delta for us?","William P. Donnelly","Quantify it in terms of how much by currency or quantify it in which sense?","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","In terms of the incremental EPS impact from currency.","William P. Donnelly","So as compared to the guidance that we gave for full year 2014, I think the number is between $0.05 and $0.08, the incremental.","Mary T. Finnegan","Incremental.","William P. Donnelly","Incremental is $0.10 to $0.12. Okay. Sorry. Mary corrected me. And then in terms of the impact on the fourth quarter, it was $0.06 per share. But that's versus the prior year. In terms of versus what we guided, I think it was -- and Mary is looking it up.","Mary T. Finnegan","And it was pretty much on the top[ph] .","William P. Donnelly","Pretty much -- yes, fourth quarter wasn't too far -- in terms of the EPS impact, it wasn't too far off what we expected.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Got you. And then when I look at your first quarter organic growth guidance of about 3%, if you look at it kind of on a 2-year stack, you're lapping the easiest comp of the year. It implies a bit of a deceleration. Is that a reflection of perhaps the order trends that you've seen in January? Could you give us some color there? And to what degree was there any budget flush effect in the fourth quarter?","William P. Donnelly","So hey, it doesn't relate to what we see order-wise in January. I would comment that actually we enter 2014 with a healthy bit more backlog than we entered a year ago. As you know, sometimes, we are -- we overdo it with our stacked comps, so I -- Mary is providing me here our 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years -- 3-, 4- and 5-year stacked comps. If I look at, for example, 3 years, the 3-year stacked comp based on our current estimate is 8% for the 2014. And by quarter, it moves between 7% and 9%, our current forecast. So I see what you are saying, but I think we -- we think the 3% would be a good number. And now I'm really getting into details. But if you go back, you'll see, and I am not recalling the exact amount, but that we took down backlog in the Q1 last year, and particularly projects in China. And that was something I commented on, although I don't recall off the top of my head how much that was in Q1 last year. But I know we talked about it on the call.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with UBS.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Bill or Olivier, maybe just a question on China. Can you sort of update us on how things looked with regards to facility expansion, which I think you've kind of talked about as being a source of weakness there? Are you starting to see some movement there? And I guess, is the dynamic one where there are projects that are being planned, but not executed on, and it's sort of just an on-hold type situation? Or do you get the sense that activity just in terms of really thinking about new plans is -- or new plants is off the table?","Olivier A. Filliol","I think the topic in general is about capacity expansion, that we see our customers still being very selective. I think that's still a topic. What we saw last year, in particular, was often that international brands, global companies were very cautious. I start to see that things are gradually improving. But I would also recognize that the uncertainty that came up again in the last few weeks will -- could have an impact, and we need to monitor that. So that's certainly a reason why we'd say, \"Oh, we remain cautious,\" and I -- it's probably too early to really see a clear trend change that we would see again these investments coming back. But -- and with that, I think it takes also more time to get back to this double-digit growth that we experienced in China before. It's going to take new expansion projects through -- for us to really have this double-digit growth. But gradually, it's kind of coming back. Yes, I would give that flavor. I think it's difficult to be too specific here. I wouldn't have hard data, how many new facilities we really see being built in our customer base.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Maybe just sort of a bigger market question. You guys have talked about the fact that your markets are pretty fragmented in several areas, and that kind of gives you a bit of an opportunity. Can you just remind us which of the businesses or which of the markets have the greatest number of low share, maybe local players that are either more favorable to compete against or have M&A potential, just sort of how you're looking at the fragmentation over all the market?","Olivier A. Filliol","Okay. So if I thought of business like -- so the lab business is the most global one and the most concentrated one. This would be particularly true for Balances. In Balances, there is only very few players that operate on a global scale, and the 2 top players have major market shares. When -- the one that would then be most fragmented is the industrial business. For industrial business, you have a lot of local players specific to country, sometimes, regionals. And this would be particularly true for -- in -- for China. In China, we would have hundreds of scale companies that would compete with us. When -- in terms of consolidation opportunities and market share opportunities, I think our market share gains that we realized over the years was across all the businesses. It was against global competitors in lab, but it was also true for the industrial business, where we won market share against local competitors, i.e. we are in mature markets. It's -- and we don't see these major shifts. We, from time to time, see that smaller players might get out of the business, but I haven't seen a particular acceleration of that in the recent months, quarters. In terms of acquisition and opportunity for us to buy competitors, this is not a high priority. We feel we have a very strong product portfolio. We have definitely a very strong global presence. There are a few selected opportunities in countries where we might consolidate. I would remind here that a few years ago, we bought the biggest liquid handling company in U.K. that allowed us to become a leader in pipetting there. But these are relatively small acquisitions and very selective. We don't have an M&A strategy focused on acquiring competitors. And yes, I think, the examples that I gave, however, for certain local markets, yes, we might do that, but it's relatively small.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg with Macquarie.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Maybe just following up on that last question a little bit. I noticed you didn't want to buy competitors, wasn't really your strategy, all of you[ph] . But if you look at product verticals and you kind of evaluate how you're doing relative to competition and just how the markets are growing, everything else, is there anything that would make you kind of rethink your strategy a little bit and do something else to boost growth in certain of those product verticals?","Olivier A. Filliol","M&A is definitely part of our strategy. The only thing that I would say here is that we are looking at adjacencies and product categories that would complement the portfolio. They are -- our focus is there, mostly on the lab and Process Analytics and our Product Inspection businesses, where we have very strong positions, we have excellent brands, we have excellent customer access, we have excellent service organizations, and we feel by adding adjacent product categories, we can leverage these strengths. And we did that, for example, just a few years ago by acquiring Vision Inspection for our Product Inspection business, very complementary and, in that sense, also very strategic. Our M&A strategy is focused towards these opportunities.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","And I guess my question was so, along those lines, do you -- just kind of slower growth over -- or if it kind of spills into 3 years or so. Does that make you more inclined to be more aggressive there, or doesn't really change kind of how you go about looking at the -- at those opportunities?","Olivier A. Filliol","No. Actually, we have so much more opportunity for organic growth, and I feel actually really good how we performed over the last years and on that one too. We had a more difficult market environment, but we still -- we are winning market share. We expanded our margin. We want to continue to be very focused on this organic growth. However, M&A is part of the overall strategy, and I am very open, and we proactively pursue and nurture opportunities along the lines that I've described before. But it's not that we've become more aggressive in terms of M&A because we are coming out of a more difficult economic environment.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay. That's helpful. And Bill, if you -- on your -- kind of your comments around the variable comp and the increased amortization, et cetera. I mean, if you just put in -- can you help me -- help us maybe just put that in a little bit more context? As for example, in '13 on 1% local currency growth, you guys grew your EPS 9%. Your guidance is 3% to 4% organic growth for '14, and also the midpoint is 9% EPS growth. So just maybe -- if I was to put it -- if you were to grow 1% to 2% as opposed to 3% to 4%, what would that mean in terms of what you think you could do from an EPS standpoint?","William P. Donnelly","Okay. Maybe I don't want to speculate on such a precise number, but maybe I'd answer your question this way, Jon. I think, to the extent that we would exceed 3% to 4% growth, you'd probably see our incremental margins being in this 30% kind of range, maybe a little better, depending on how much we exceeded it, that you've kind of seen in the past. I think if you look at our incremental margins in 2013, they're very high. And I think, as an organization our -- we -- and that was achieved by large -- in a large part due to restructuring efforts that we had done. And I think, right now, organizationally, we're still kind of digesting that. It's not that we will never be able to do other cost measures again in the future. But I think just completing the ones we have already underway would make it -- in 2014, making those all sustainable as it translates to us realizing we don't want to organizationally start a new round of them right now. We need to digest and make the current moves we've made sustainable.","Operator","The next question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Joel Kaufman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's actually Joel Kaufman in for Isaac. Can you guys just address the impact, if any, the recovery in Europe is having on the various margin lines?","William P. Donnelly","So certainly, we have a nice mix of direct sales in Europe, and Europe has a slightly more weight towards the laboratory side of the business. It's also, because it's a direct sales organization, it has a high percentage than our other regions. You have more commission, so some more variable comp in that element, too. From an operating profit perspective, kind of looking at it from a see-through basis, our European entities are kind of in line, I would say. Even though the gross profit margin is higher, their actual profitability and op margin line is not above the corporate average.","Joel Kaufman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just turning to U.S., can you give us some color around the visibility and assumptions for the spending environment for capital equipment as you move through 2014?","William P. Donnelly","Could you repeat that again? Sorry, you broke up a little bit.","Joel Kaufman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, no problem. Just regarding the U.S., could you give us some color or visibility on your assumptions for the spending environment for capital equipment in 2014?","William P. Donnelly","So I think the majority of the products we sell are capital equipment to our customers. And so we would expect somewhere between low- to mid-single-digit growth in our U.S. business. Overall, maybe service could grow marginally better than that, but something in that kind of range. If I think about the different business segments we serve, we're probably expecting the lab stuff to do a little bit better than the industrial stuff in the U.S. market. With the exception of our Product Inspection business, I think we have actually quite good hopes for those products from an industrial perspective in the U.S.","Operator","The next question comes from Dan Brennan with Morgan Stanley.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Did you provide your bookings growth overall and by region? If you did, I apologize, but could you just give us that?","William P. Donnelly","Sure. We had better order growth than we did sales growth by about 2%. And I did mention earlier in the call that the Chinese number was quite a bit better in the month -- or in the fourth quarter. January was a little bit more difficult to read. It wasn't as strong of a number, but it's kind of tough to judge. I think for some of you who we've talked to lately, our view on Q1 in China is you got to get to the end of the quarter to really see where the trend is. There's kind of funny impact of the Chinese New Year, and sometimes, how the government treats it differently makes it kind of hard to compare the months of January and February individually. But our view would be by the end of March, we'll have a better read on the Chinese market. But at least what we saw in the fourth quarter was -- pointed to a turnaround. They finished with good order growth, more backlog. January, it's tough to conclude on.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And how about as it relates to the U.S in January, though? Just given the weak number so far, did you see any impact in your business thus far?","William P. Donnelly","You mean the weak PMI numbers?","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes.","William P. Donnelly","Hey, we actually had pretty good start to the year, but I want to preface that by saying we also went live on Blue Ocean, as you know, in the fourth quarter, and that -- there could -- how much of that could be some push out as a result of that, it's tough for me to judge. And I also -- I would caution everybody on the month of January, I don't know about for all our peer companies, but certainly for us, it's not a great data point. It's, by far, the smallest month of the year. And then -- so therefore, 1 order, 2 orders in a region can kind of make the difference. I think -- yes, I know, for example, our China number, we have a big comp in China because of 1 order in Q1 -- or January of last year.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then maybe just another -- just a couple of quick ones. Within China, can you just give us some color on the core industrial business in China? You're maintaining your outlook as pacing through China in the year, but how does core industrial look, specifically, how they do in the quarter? Any color on that, or the outlook for '14?","William P. Donnelly","Sure. Mary is pulling together some sales numbers. I just know by heart that the core industrial order entry growth was positive. I think it was about mid-single digit in the fourth quarter. The actual sales number was down, let's call it, low-double digit in the quarter. I mentioned that we finished the year with -- for China, a good increase in backlog. Almost all of that relates to the core industrial business. That's the longest cycle business that we have in China.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And maybe just one final one, just on emerging markets outside of China. I mean, obviously, there's been a lot of volatility with currencies. Is it just amongst your biggest emerging market countries? Can you just give us some flavor there, kind of are you seeing any impact from some of the unsettling trends? And what's kind of implicit in your 2014 guidance for EM x China?","Olivier A. Filliol","Hey, actually, if I look at Q4, we have pretty good numbers in other emerging markets outside of China, like India, Southeast Asia, Brazil, Eastern Europe. They did all, actually, well for us. The countries where there is lot of potential right now, like Argentina and Turkey. In Argentina, we go through a distributor. Turkey, we have our own presence, but it's actually rather small, so our exposure is not that significant. And as mentioned, Turkey is more a buildup, so I think we are still going to do reasonable. Brazil, we did actually well in Q4. I think we have a really, really strong team there, a good development. But obviously, the market itself is challenged more. The recent events bring more uncertainty for us, and that's never good for us. But overall, I think, actually, these other emerging markets will do quite reasonable for us in 2014.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Rafael Tejada - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It's Rafael in for Derik. I may have missed this, but can you provide us with the local currency sales growth expectation by the various segments, and also just your expectations in terms of price, volume and mix?","William P. Donnelly","Sure. So maybe, I get the last one out first. So we would expect net realized price increases in the range of 150 bps in 2014. That's, I think, in some ways, an ambitious target in the sense that we want to -- we, at this point, see no reason that we could justify a midyear price increase, so achieving that through this January 1 increase will mean good -- requires good execution. In terms of our expectations for how to break down that 3% to 4% guidance for the full year of 2014, we would see probably lab in the, I don't know, 3% to 5% kind of range; Product Inspection, maybe high-single digits; core industrial, probably low-single digits; and then, hey, food retailing, probably low-single digits as well.","Rafael Tejada - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Great. And just another follow-up. On the prepared remarks, you were talking about the Shanghai free-trade zone, a pilot program. And I was just wondering if this could be a source of upside. I was wondering if you could comment with regard to as to whether there are other competitors in your field and part of this pilot program, and I guess how you see that unfolding in 2014 and into 2015.","William P. Donnelly","I've seen the list of 20 companies, and there was no direct competitor. There might've been one of the larger, industrial guys that we might have some minor -- actually, yes, I didn't even think that. But -- so there's definitely not any of our direct competitors that are in that 20. In terms of the benefits to us, we definitely are happy. This will be beneficial to us, but it'll take some time. It's just that the program is just being rolled out. The government is laying out their processes, but we're going to -- we're already working on some of the business process side, systems-wise, to be ready for that. We've kind of figured out our legal entity structure. We're looking at our warehousing capabilities in the region. I would say that beginning next year and then through 2018, we kind of ramp things up. That has a little bit to do with how we see moving business there around other tax holidays that we enjoy in China and our ability to -- what's the right timing to do that. But we think it can be a meaningfully beneficial thing. And I think a comment we might have made to investors recently, but in general, or I don't know if we've had it on the last call or just in recent conversations, is one thing that we like about this free-trade zone is we think this very much speaks to China trying to acquire more foreign direct investment. As you guys know, that's been dwindling off a little bit in China. We were talking a little bit in our board meeting that U.S. foreign direct investment now, there's higher foreign direct investment in the United States now than there is in China. And these are the kind of activities. I know it's financially attractive for us to invest in this Shanghai free-trade zone as they expand into a broader group, which is clearly the intentions. We think that these are the kind of positive signs they can do to help foreign direct investment. And maybe, as a reminder, there were some things that China did a few years ago that kind of went in the other direction, that maybe discouraged foreign direct investment, in their efforts to try to manage some of the potential for bubbles in parts of their economy. And I think that, that took a while to have full effects, but maybe this will take now a while to have some positive effects on it.","Operator","The next question comes from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So could you just speak to -- we faced these credit issues in China for pretty much the balance of a year now. Is there any regional difference in credit conditions that you've seen emerge? Olivier, you talked about some of these smaller second-tier cities, but is there any use of credit to drive investment and demand in those second-tier cities?","William P. Donnelly","So I think when we talked about some of these businesses we exited, I think one of the principal examples we gave is some of these second, even really third and fourth-tier cities, where there were projects out there that, in effect, they were asked -- we used to get significant advanced payments in these type of vehicle business. Now they were looking for a 5-year financing and stuff. So those some of the businesses that we've walked away from are related to kind of regional-specific financing. So if I look at kind of how we view the overall situation from a credit point of view, we see it not deteriorating. We -- not that it's gotten better, but we just don't see it deteriorating. As an example, I think our DSO now has kind of been stable recently there. I think it's -- certainly, there is parts of the market that have gotten tougher because of credit conditions. But we, in our discussions with the field guys, we don't view this as something that's getting incrementally worse right now.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So then they're not using credit availability to reapportion investment into these consumer-facing industries in those markets versus getting even tighter on the infrastructure side, or is that too tight to cut?","William P. Donnelly","Well, I think, hey, I would tell you at -- in some conversation, but I would struggle to point to economic data. But certainly, there are favored industries that the government is supporting more than others, and that would be an impression that we have. I think that for our business, the majority of our core business is still people that are financing things themselves, whether they be multinationals or even the larger Chinese national companies.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just a question about the service and the consumables side of the business. When you look at '14, is it -- it sounds like some of your field resources are going into the service, and I know that's been a Spinnaker focus for a while as well to try to improve the productivity on the service side. But is that -- can I think of services and consumables as maybe a mid-single-digit grower in '14? Would that be a reasonable target?","Olivier A. Filliol","I would expect that service is growing above the group average. So in that sense, getting close to this mid-single digit. It did actually also quite well on -- in 2013. I think that's very much a reflection of our strategy and the many initiatives that we have on that business. This was -- yes, definitely true, and actually, if I look at 2013, we reached service and consumables together to 29% of total. That shows we are moving in the right direction, and I would expect in 2014 that this ratio will go up even again.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And is that -- when I look at the residual piece then, basically the hardware, are we able to get our 1.5 point price on hardware?","Olivier A. Filliol","Sure. On -- in average, that's true, yes. What I would stress is, of course, there are differences by different product lines. Retail, for example, is extremely difficult. Core industrial, I would say, also. But when I look at lab and Product Inspection, we have very good pricing power. And so for these businesses, I expect more than the 150 bps, and for retail and core industrial, less.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And is it just fair to assume if you take the services\/consumables cut and then the hardware cut that essentially, in your guidance, they're certainly at the 3% core growth rate, that you're basically thinking flat volume in hardware; mid-single digit, service consumables, and so any upside to the 3% to 4% guide is probably going to be more determined by the hardware market globally?","Olivier A. Filliol","Yes.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. So that's where the -- I don't want to say risk, but that's where the upside would reside?","Olivier A. Filliol","Yes, yes. It's part of this also more volatile. It's -- the service is more stable. And typically, when we grow nicely, you're going to see that we might actually grow faster with products than with service. And when the economy is weaker, service will outperform product. But over an economic cycle, I would expect service to do better than product.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And I think maybe just one last question. When you were commenting in your comments about new products, is -- your TOC new product is portable? Is that a market niche that you were not in previously, or were you in there with a bench-top product and this is portable, or is that a new kind of...","Olivier A. Filliol","No. Our core in -- with TOC was really in line, and what we are offering here is now a portable at-line instrument, actually. And the portable instrument allows you to move from 1 measurement point to another, but it's not a lab product. It's not one that you measure in the lab. It's really at-line.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","Just 2 things real quick. One, I was wondering -- given a little bit stronger growth in the lab business, was wondering if you could comment regarding how much of a budget flush you saw, if any? Maybe another way to ask is kind of the pacing through the quarter?","William P. Donnelly","Hey, it's -- they don't -- I'm not being sarcastic. They don't necessarily come with a red flag on them kind of saying this is a budget flush order. So it's a little bit -- maybe I -- you saw that the lab was good, so we think we had a reasonable budget flush period. I think the product categories that might have benefited a little bit more than others were lab balances, kind of picked up at the end. We didn't see as much in maybe AutoChem, some of the higher-end stuff than we might have hoped in that category. And I think it was most of the guys that kind of finished a little stronger than expected were more in Europe than in the United States.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. And then just like last thing is on the variable comp comments, where there wasn't variable comp this year, and you are expecting a variable comp next year. I guess, when did -- in 2013, when did it get to the point where you ended up not having a variable comp? I'm just curious if in the fourth quarter was there some sort of benefit where you were accruing then all of a sudden you had reversed that, or how does that kind of work?","William P. Donnelly","Yes. I think -- I could -- I think even since the beginning, after the first quarter when we saw the -- I believe we had a minus 2% sales growth in Q1, if I recall correctly. I think, at that point already, we were -- we started to get nervous in terms of how that might flow. I may be now trying to digest some numbers here, and I would say that, hey, maybe in the fourth quarter was probably the lowest amount we accrued of the -- as opposed to being at straight line. But it's not so materially different.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Sung Ji Nam with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Just 2 quick high-level questions here. Was wondering if you could -- given you're seeing more stabilization in the developed markets, was wondering if you could provide more color in terms of where the biggest drivers of growth there. Is it more the leveraging the product replacement cycle, expansion into adjacent markets or taking market share?","Olivier A. Filliol","Both. The improved environment helps us mainly on the replacement business. The replacement business, I see it coming back to historical levels, as in weak economic environment, people were holding back on replacement. So that's the key driver for us expecting better growth. I would also see selected investments in the West, in automation, higher quality measurement points and so on that will benefit us.","Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then last one. Maybe if you could talk about how important your tiered branding strategy is in China as you're trying to expand into the lab market, or is it more relevant now for other emerging areas?","Olivier A. Filliol","I didn't pick up the first part of the statement.","Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Just the tiered branding, the dual branding strategy?","Olivier A. Filliol","Oh, the dual branding, sorry. The dual brand strategy is very established for us in the West, in particular in the U.S. In China, we are still investing and strengthening the dual brand. So for example, the dual brand, we really expand the dealer network in China. We had good developments on that, and we're going to continue to leverage that. It's -- we will really also want to penetrate markets that we would not be present with the Mettler-Toledo brand with our direct approach. And so it's very relevant in our strategy and the core also in China.","Operator","The last question in queue comes from Greg Halter with Great Lakes Review.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","I thought I heard a figure thrown out about the service and consumable business. Was it mentioned that it's 29% of your total revenues, or did I hear that wrong? And that's for the year.","Olivier A. Filliol","Yes. For 2013, it was 29%.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","And what kind of growth did it experience?","Olivier A. Filliol","5% growth for the year. And in the fourth quarter, it was 4%.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","All righty. And the one last one I have here is can you provide the metrics for the share repurchase in the fourth quarter, number of shares and the dollars spent?","William P. Donnelly","Sure. We repurchased 317,179 shares at an average price of $244.52 for a total amount expended of $77.556 million.","Operator","There are no further questions in the queue.","Mary T.

My name is Victoria and I will be your audio coordinator for today.","I would now like to turn our presentation over to your hostess for today's call, Ms. Mary Finnegan. Please proceed, ma'am.","Mary T. Finnegan","Thanks, Victoria, and good evening to everyone. I am Mary Finnegan, I'm the Treasurer and responsible for Investor Relations at Mettler-Toledo, and I'm happy to welcome you to the call tonight. I am joined here with Olivier Filliol, our CEO; and Bill Donnelly, our Chief Financial Officer.","I want to cover just a couple of administrative matters before we get started. This call is being webcast and is available for replay on our website at www.mt.com. A copy of the press release and the presentation that we will refer to is also available on our website.","Let me summarize the Safe Harbor language, which is outlined on Page 1 of the presentation.

More detailed information with respect to the use of and differences between the non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in our 8-K.","I will now turn the call over to Olivier.","Olivier A. Filliol","Thank you, Mary, and welcome to everyone on the call. I will start with a summary of the quarter, and then Bill will provide details on our financial results and our updated guidance for 2013. I will then comment on the current business conditions, as well as provide an update on our Service business. As always, we will have time for Q&A at the end.","The highlights for the quarter are on Page 2 of the presentation. Local currency sales increased 1% in the quarter, in line with the range we outlined on our last call. Both Europe and Americas did better than we expected, while market conditions in Asia, particularly China, were more challenging than expected. In particular, we saw the situation in China deteriorate in June.","We had another quarter of strong gross margin improvement, which combined with the benefit of our cost control initiatives, drove a solid increase in operating profit. I'm pleased with the 9% increase in earnings per share.","Despite modest conditions, which are less than ideal, we believe we will generate solid earnings per share growth in the second half of the year. We will have more to say on our outlook for 2013 in a few moments. But now, let me turn it to Bill to cover the financial results.","William P. Donnelly","Okay, thanks, Olivier, and hello, everybody. Let me start with additional details on sales which were $578.7 million in the quarter, an increase of 1% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales also increased 1%, as we had no currency impact to sales this quarter.","Turning to Page 3 of the presentation, we outline sales by geography. In the quarter, local currency sales increased 5% in the Americas, increased 2% in Europe, while Asia\/Rest of World decreased by 5%.","On Slide #4, we outline the results for the first half by geography. Sales increased by 3% in the Americas in the first 6 months, and declined by 1% in Europe, and declined by 3% in Asia\/Rest of World. All these amounts are local currency and organic.","On Slide #5, we show sales by product line for the quarter. Laboratory Products increased by 3% in local currency, while Industrial declined 2% and Food Retailing increased by 5%.","In the 6-month period, which is shown on the next slide, Laboratory Products increased by 1%, while Industrial declined 1% and Food Retailing declined 2%.","Turning to Slide #7 of the presentation, we show the P&L. Let me walk you through the key items. We're pleased with our gross margins, which were 53.4% in the quarter, a 100-basis-point improvement over the prior year. We benefited from pricing, lower material cost and an overall favorable mix. R&D amounted to $29.0 million, a 4% increase in local currency versus the prior year. SG&A amounted to $173.4 million, a 2% increase in local currency as compared to the prior year quarter. We benefited from our cost control measures, which were partially offset by higher sales and marketing investments, as well as variable compensation.","Adjusted operating income amounted to $106.4 million, which represents a 5% increase over the prior year amount of $101.1 million. Operating margins were 18.4%, an increase of 70 basis points over the prior year. We are very pleased with our operating income growth, as well as the margin improvement in the quarter.","A couple of final items on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $5.8 million in the quarter, while interest expense was $5.5 million. Our effective tax rate is 24%, while fully diluted shares for the quarter were 30.8 million. Adjusted EPS was $2.35 per share, a 9% increase over the prior year amount of $2.15 per share.","On a reported basis, earnings per share were $2.24, as compared to $1.93 in the prior year. Reported EPS includes pretax restructuring charges of $3.2 million or $0.08 per share. This is primarily employee-related charges for cost measures announced in the second quarter of last year. Reported EPS also includes $0.03 of purchased intangible amortization.","The next slide highlights our results for the first half. Let me touch briefly on the key items. Local currency sales were flat in the first half as compared to the year earlier period. Gross margins have increased by 120 basis points, while operating profit increased by 5%. Adjusted earnings per share increased by 10% from the same period. Given the challenging economic environment we faced so far this year, we're pleased with earnings growth in the first half.","Now turning to cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter amounted to $78.2 million, a 13% increase over the prior year amount of $69.3 million. On a per share basis, this represents an increase of 17%. For the first 6 months, our cash flow per share is up 24% over the prior year period. We remain on track for our full year cash flow target in the $270 million range.","In terms of working capital, I'm pleased with the continued improvement in ITO, which reached 5.2x this quarter as compared to 4.5x 1 year ago. We continue to gain additional transparency on our supply chain with the new Blue Ocean system, which is helping to increase inventory turns.","Finally, our DSO was 45 days. This is 4 days slower than last year. Similar to what we saw in the first quarter, this increase is related to China and is impacted by their reduced level of project activity, where we benefit from advanced payments and by the overall liquidity situation there.","Let me spend a few minutes on the situation in China and what we think it means to our business. We continue to see liquidity issues in our Chinese customer base, which is impacting demand. We do not see short-term improvement to the situation, and we expect it to continue to impact growth in China. Our sales decline in China in the second quarter was more than expected, with June orders being particularly weak. The quarter got off to a solid start as reflected in the April results. May was okay, but June was weaker than anticipated. The tightening credit situation, which we spoke of, with the spike in CHIBOR rates in June as a symptom, was more of a factor than we anticipated. The government's attempts to rein in lax credit practices is clearly impacting their economy more than we had anticipated the last time we spoke. We continue to be bullish about China in the medium to longer term and believe that as their economy moves more towards a consumer-driven economy, our Lab and Product Inspection businesses will grow faster and our core Industrial business will be reduced as a percentage of our total sales.","One final comment. We have long believed that the growth in China will not be a smooth line, rather, we'll face these ups and downs, more so than in the developed world. We're seeing some of that right now.","Let me cover guidance. Although sales in the first half of the year were modestly below our expectations, we expect to see improvements as the year progresses. However, we see dynamics differently by region. Our businesses in the Americas are solid, while Europe is stable but below historical levels. I've already mentioned China, but clearly, economic framework is more uncertain in emerging markets than in the developed world. At this stage, we expect China to be down mid- to high-single digits in the third quarter and to be flattish in the fourth quarter.","Now for specifics. For the full year, we believe our sales in local currency will be between 1% and 2%, that is narrowing our range slightly from 1% to 3%, which we had previously communicated. This reduces the midpoint of sales growth by 50 basis points, and reflects the slower start to the year, as well as our current outlook for the second half.","Although we're narrowing the top line, we are slightly increasing our adjusted EPS guidance to the range of $10.45 per share to $10.60 per share or a growth rate of 8% to 10%. This compares to our previous guidance of $10.40 to $10.60 per share.","For the third quarter, we would expect local currency sales growth to be in the range of 1% to 3%. With our guidance of 1% to 2% sales growth for the full year, this implies about 3% sales growth as an estimate for the fourth quarter at this stage.","With our sales growth assumptions for Q3, we expect earnings per share on an adjusted basis of between $2.55 per share and $2.60 per share, or a growth of 6% to 8%.","A couple of additional points to cover with guidance. First, currency. We would expect currency to have no impact on sales growth in the third quarter and reduce sales by about 1% in the fourth quarter. For the full year, currency will be neutral to sales growth.","Now looking at the impact of currency on earnings for the remainder of the year, we continue to face a little bit of a headwind in 2013. In terms of the Swiss franc versus the euro, we're relatively neutral given the hedges we have in place. However, we're getting hurt with the Japanese yen and some of our other smaller currency exposures. In total, we expect currencies will reduce EPS growth by 3% in the third quarter and 2% in the fourth quarter.","A couple of additional points. We have continued to assume an effective tax rate of 24% for this year, and we continued to assume that all our free cash flow will be used for the share repurchase plan.","One additional item related cash flow. Today, the board increased our authorization under the share repurchase program by $750 million. We have used up our previous -- we would have used up our previous availability over the next 12 months, and this increase will allow us to continue for the next several years. We do not anticipate a change in our repurchase strategy, that is, we'll continue to target repurchases equal to our free cash flow plus option proceeds. For 2013, this amounts to approximately $290 million.","That covers my comments on guidance, and I want to now turn it back to Olivier.","Olivier A. Filliol","Thanks, Bill. Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab increased 3% in the quarter, with good growth in the Americas and Europe and a slight decline in Asia\/Rest of the World.","In terms of product areas, Analytical Instruments had very good growth, while AutoChem and Balances had good growth.","Turning now to Industrial, which was down 2% in the quarter, with Product Inspection basically flat and core Industrial down 2%. The declines were driven by Asia, particularly China. We had good growth in core Industrial in the Americas. Retail was up 5% in the quarter, driven by project activity in the Americas and growth in Asia.","Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Europe was up 2% in the quarter. Better than we expected, as Lab had strong growth and Industrial was up slightly. The U.K., Benelux region and Eastern Europe were particularly strong.","Americas was up 5% in the quarter, better than we expected and the economic environment has proven strong. Finally, Asia\/Rest of World was down 5% in the quarter, and Bill already commented on China and I'm sure we will discuss more during our Q&A.","That covers my comments on the current market conditions. I want to now spend a few minutes updating you on our Service business, which represents approximately 23% of total sales, with operating margins above the company average.","We have a wide range of services that provides clear value to our customers in terms of avoiding downtime, optimizing performance of their instruments, ensuring compliance with customer's standard operating procedures, as well as helping our customers increase their knowledge of applications and related processes.","We have made important investments in our service organization over the last few years, which we believe will drive further growth.","Two key focus areas are globalizing our service offering and increasing the percentage of our installed base that we service, thereby increasing the amount of service revenue under contract.","Let me provide some details of the initiatives that are driving these strategies. In conjunction with our Blue Ocean program, we have invested in the cleansing, enhancing and standardizing of data about our installed base. With millions of installed instruments, this is a significant project and we are still working through it in many of our units.","However, with better data on our installed base, our I base, as we refer to it internally, we can design more targeted and effective service marketing campaigns tailored to the product life cycle of the instrument. Furthermore, with this data, we can also target sales campaigns for instruments that are nearing the end of their useful life.","In 2013 alone, we have plans for more than 500 campaigns to our installed base. At the same time that we are gathering more clarity on our installed base, we are also working to harmonize and standardize our service offering around the world. With our decentralized organization, our service offering has been local in nature. While that has been effective, we recognize that we will have greater leverage with a globally harmonized service offering and related operational model. What this means is that we have a common scope of work, a detailed description of service delivered, regardless of where in the world the service is performed. The harmonization process allows us to productize our services. This leads to the ability to market our services more effectively and more easily sell it at the point-of-sale.","Our Blue Ocean program is a key enabler of this globalization of our service offering and the benefits are multifold. First, a standardized global service offering is an important competitive advantage, as our competitors are often local small service organizations.","Second, we can standardize and globalize marketing campaign and leverage internal global marketing resources to target additional service revenue.","Third, we can enhance productivity as a standardized service offering, which will allow us to create standard workflows. Finally, this approach will allow us to shift our pricing strategy to value-based pricing rather than hourly-based pricing. We're still in the early stages of this transformation, as we just went live with our pilot service organization in Blue Ocean earlier this year.","We think the potential in terms of service revenue growth and service margin is meaningful. We have complemented these investments in data and IT infrastructure with new equipment and automation tools for our technicians, including handheld devices, automated signature capture pads and device service management dashboards.","New uniforms and signatures on our vehicles have also reinforced the professionalism and strength of our Service business. Our Service business provides us significant competitive advantage as it keeps us in close contact with customers and provides invaluable insight into our customers' instrument needs. I'm confident that the investments we are making will lead to solid growth in our service sales and profitability over the medium term.","That concludes our prepared remarks. While market conditions are uncertain, we expect to see improvements as the year progresses. Although the dynamics will be different by region, we recognized the uncertainty in our markets, particularly in China, and we'll monitor closely. We believe our cost structure is in good shape and believe that despite the more challenging market environment, we are strongly positioned to capture growth opportunities and market share.","I will now ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ross Muken with ISI.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","This is Vijay in for Ross, and Olivier, I just wanted to dig in on the China. Sir, can you maybe parse out sort of what's behind your assumptions in mid- to high singles decline in third quarter? And I know that last quarter, you mentioned an order revenue mismatch and that was driven by tightening credit conditions. Is this a continuation of the same or is it the CHIBOR spike in last Q? Was that sort of an additional concern that China worsened? What are you seeing in China?","Olivier A. Filliol","Let me maybe have Bill cover it because he was actually the very close contact, also with the Chinese team over the last few days, on these kind of topics and he can give you -- certainly, he has more details.","William P. Donnelly","Sure. So first of all, I think CHIBOR, what happened to it, more as a symptom, right? We do see tightening of credit. So for example, I -- we see it in the customer base, that we have more guys on credit hold. We actually have -- I mentioned on the last call, and can see pretty significant reduction now in inventory in some of our lab dealer channels, for example, who would carry make-to-stock type of products. We see reduced big project activity and our feeling is that we still have a little bit of time yet for the overall situation to get to a little bit easier comp and that growth rates returned to, maybe not where they were 2, 3 years ago, but still to a nicer growth rate more in line with their GDP or a little bit better. The areas that we see that we're, let's say, most see the biggest weaknesses in the medium term, or the next couple of quarters, I should say, relate to the Industrial business. I think with regard to the Lab business and the Product Inspection, we feel a little bit better about that. I think particularly if you adjust for maybe the reduced inventory in the channel and some of the credit holds that are in place. Yes, I think that you guys have read a lot about it in the paper and heard news reports about these credit topics, liquidity topics, in China. I think we're seeing some of that manifest in our business. There's still a lot of good things going on, even in the short term. And I guess, nothing has changed in our minds about China for the medium to long term. We continue to be very excited about our growth prospects there. Maybe I can let Olivier comment a little more there.","Olivier A. Filliol","We, definitely, as Bill said, we recognize that the short-term outlook, we also feel a little bit worse than the last call. But when it comes to the midterm, long term, the factors that I mentioned on last call are still very valid. I feel really in that sense comfortable that the key drivers like the overall manufacturing GDP growth will remain healthy and will be driving our growth. The increasing GDP per capita is, for example, one that is very relevant for us because that will mean more packaged food consumption, helping our food inspection, but also the pharmaceutical industry will benefit from that indirectly. We benefit with our instruments. There is government efforts that are really going on to move into more value-add industries that will drive also the number of scientists in the workforce. Again, the fact that, that helps us very much. And I continue to see that there is good investments in automation and quality topics, and we will certainly continue to benefit from that one. So all in all, these macro factors are very favorable. They will be particularly favorable for the Laboratory business and the Product Inspection business. We would recognize that these businesses have the better growth prospect than the Industrial business. And we have been talking for quite a while that we would foresee that our Chinese business, who is currently skewed toward industrial, will rebalance more to a global average than we experienced.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe Olivier, I just want to sort of, you know what you mentioned in your prepared comments on service offering. Can you -- now how should we think about sizing that service opportunity in the longer term, I guess, given some of the initiatives that you rolled out and any color would be helpful.","Olivier A. Filliol","Yes, so currently, about 23% of our global sales, we would clearly see that this ratio is higher in the West than in emerging markets. And however, I see good, good progress in emerging markets on the topic and I would foresee that they have actually good growth momentum for many more years on that topic. So we're going to benefit from that effect. Then we're going to benefit from all these initiatives that I just mentioned. Over an economic cycle, I definitely expect service to grow more than products. And with that, I do expect that this share will grow up, but we are talking about every year a few points. I'm not suggesting here that this is a radical shift; it's a journey and there is a long way to go here. But every year, a little but will help us to shift the mix. I like it so much, because of course, the Service business is more resilient, more repetitive and service has above-group-average profitability. So it's a good trend for us.","Operator","Your next question is from Jon Groberg with Macquarie.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","So just maybe put a little more teeth around it, if you wouldn't mind. What did China grow or decline by in the quarter and maybe can you talk about by division, put some numbers around it? I think last quarter, too, you mentioned it was mainly small customers. I'm just curious if it's still small or if it's widening, and that's kind of one of the reasons why it got worse in June.","William P. Donnelly","Okay. So in terms of by division, we had a decline in the Laboratory business of, let's call it 7% or so, and about 15% or so in the Industrial business, and Retail business was actually up. If I'd look and you drill down a little bit on the Lab numbers, it was AutoChem, for example, which is not a big piece of that business, but it was down 90% in part because there was some big orders in the quarter the year before. And then our Balance business was down in China, and that's a largely reflection of us reducing inventory in the channel. In terms of your comments regarding, maybe it getting a little bit more broad-based, I think that, that is the case. It is the case, too, that maybe there were more orders we declined, if you know what I mean, in the second quarter, where we just felt this, the margin and the prospects for payment on this one, maybe were not as good as they should be for us to accept the work. In that case, most of those relate to some infrastructure-related projects maybe out in some of the second and third tier cities. Those are more government-related and that will be an example of a relatively bigger entity. But yes, I would maybe also say that there's always some impact if on a general customer base because they're all seeing their small customers spending less and that has some impact on them, too.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay, that's helpful. So all in, maybe down 10%, and I'm curious, I think before in the first half, you thought your orders would be a little bit better than your revenues. In this quarter, did that happen or no?","William P. Donnelly","Orders were a little bit better, Jon. But I think it's fair to say, and I think we would have -- we were, entered the quarter and came out of April thinking we ought to be able to put up a mid-single digit positive number and actually, while orders were better than sales, they were actually down around 5% or so in China. And that was mostly incurred in the month of June. We were actually, I think, positive, April, May combined.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay, and then maybe one quick one, just switching to Europe, which has been tougher. Do you get the sense that, that's just a bottoming out? Given some of the macro trends there, do you get a sense that things might actually start to improve a little bit? There's been a lot of pent up, maybe, demand for some products that might get released?","Olivier A. Filliol","Yes, I would characterize Europe as bouncing along the bottom. Market conditions remain still uncertain, but they are definitely not getting worse from what we are seeing. In contrary, I would say when talking to the team, they really express good outlooks and optimism. You might recall that I shared that also the last time we talked on the call, that the team were feeling things were better than what we could read in the newspaper. And it translated actually in the numbers, and I feel still that, that's the case now.","One explanation for that is certainly that comparisons. And we now start to benefit from easier comparisons. So that's a little bit the reason why I say we bounce along the bottom. Certainly too early to see here good momentum in the economy. And it depends, also, by the different geographies. But there were a few countries that I highlighted also in the prepared remarks that had good momentum. And so I feel that's probably a fair characterization of how we see Europe at this stage.","Operator","Your next question is from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I think we covered most of China pretty well and Europe, as well. I wanted to maybe switch back to United States. And if you could offer any comments on how you feel about capital spending visibility to the back half of the year. We're still easing into the sequester process, I know it's a limited piece of your end markets. But just the general capital spending environment in the back half would be helpful.","William P. Donnelly","Okay. I think our view is that, first of all, we had a solid quarter in the Americas. Order growth and sales growth were both pretty good. And our retail did well, but actually our core product categories all had good periods. So it was a good profit period as well. And they built a little bit of backlog. And so we were feeling pretty good about that. In terms of the back half of the year, I think you're going to see, let's call it, mid-single digit, maybe the lower end of mid-single digit, but in -- for that in the Americas. And I think we'll see all product categories probably doing pretty good, I think. The only product area I could think of right now that we -- maybe some of our kind of core Industrial product categories weren't particularly strong, but actually, the vehicle piece was good. And then maybe the Rainin business, which has exposure to academia, wasn't particularly strong, but not terrible either.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. If I could just ask one follow-up on China. It occurred to me to ask, are there any particular parts of the end market dynamic, whether it be industrial or academic or otherwise, that were particularly volatile? Meaning, did they kind of decelerate into the end of the quarter? I think Olivier said in the prepared comments that there was, I think, deceleration into June. So I'm just wondering if there's any one area that really stood out.","Olivier A. Filliol","Just on China, I would say the liquidity topic that Bill mentioned certainly impacts, in a different way, end-user industries. Everything that is infrastructure-related is very much impacted by that, and then we have smaller private companies that are also impacted by it. They're -- but at the same time, I want to also stress that there are market segments in China that remain, actually, very attractive and where we see, also, good activities. I would, for example, mention everything there is, testing labs, environmental market, and so on. We have not huge exposure to them, but they are healthy markets. And for example, food processing market, food safety topics and so on, remained good. And what we are really working on is to make sure that we are shifting resources and our attention to these growth opportunities, and not getting hang up on the segments that will probably suffer also for quite a while. The liquidity thing is a short-term thing, but we will also have impact from the overall economy that slowed down.","Operator","Your next question is from Dan Arias with UBS.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Olivier or Bill, I'm not sure if you guys touched on this during your first response, but what is the timeframe that you think of in terms of the business mix in China moving more in line with the corporate average?","Olivier A. Filliol","Well, we are talking about years. This is not a short thing, it takes years. And I would say the way it's going to happen is by having the Lab business and Product Inspection business having better growth in China than Industrial. So it's not that I expect here that we have continuous declines on Industrial or Retail, it's much more that the Lab business will -- and Product Inspection will have strong growth. So -- but to rebalance, we talk here about multiple years.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it, okay. And then maybe on Blue Ocean. I think better price realization is a part of the plan there. So do you have a feel for how much incremental prices come out of just having a better model versus maybe what you're able to do because of pricing power in the market?","Olivier A. Filliol","The way we should look at Blue Ocean. Blue Ocean is an enabler for us to continue all these programs that we have in place, for operational excellence and in particular, around Spinnaker and pricing when we talk about the front end. So I'm not looking to Blue Ocean, let's say, \"Okay, we have this country going live with Blue Ocean, and thanks to that, we will have an extra 2% price increase the following year.\" I rather see that Blue Ocean is a complete enabler for us to get more data transparency, get better pricing execution on all these topics, and will help us to maintain these ongoing price increases that we have every year and getting even more sophisticated. But it's a continuous journey and a continuous program.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So it's sort of a part of the overall price realization process, not sort of necessarily something explicit?","Olivier A. Filliol","Yes. I understand, again...","William P. Donnelly","An enabler.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. Okay. Maybe just one more. You'd said last quarter that order cancellations were not expected to be anything of a real concern. Just wanted to see whether that was still the case -- was it still the case in 2Q and is still the case for the coming quarters.","William P. Donnelly","We didn't have any order cancellations. I think I mentioned there were -- when we were talking to the Chinese team, they did tell us they walked away from more, what they felt were too low a margin, vis-a-vis the risk, from a credit perspective, with some customers, but it was never orders they expected, but more orders they ultimately declined to accept. And -- but in terms of actually us having received orders and then customers contacting us to cancel them, I am not aware of. I mean, I'm sure there are a few out there, but nothing material such that I would have noticed a backlog adjustment or something.","Olivier A. Filliol","I think what's happening regularly is that we work on promising projects, and teams can work along with they have in their sales pipeline. And then it doesn't materialize or we decide not to pursue it, but that wouldn't be in our -- wouldn't be booked as orders in our systems.","Operator","Your next question is from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Olivier, coming back to Europe, we're seeing some nice sequential improvements in the PMI figures there. Just curious how demand paced through the second quarter? And if you could give us a sense of how orders shaped up versus revenue, that'd be helpful.","Olivier A. Filliol","Okay. So we -- in Q2, overall, we had good momentum, and this relates also to order entry. And I would, in that sense, also expect that we'd get a benefit for the rest of the year. So rest of the year will be stronger than year-to-date numbers.","William P. Donnelly","Yes, and orders were good in the quarter -- a little better than sales.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And then, Bill, could you walk us through the major puts and takes in the gross margin line? I'm a little bit surprised in just the overall profitability strength, given the uptick in food retail. But anything you could share with us in terms of FX, material cost, pricing and mix would be helpful.","William P. Donnelly","Sure. So we had -- and now these are quarterly numbers. So overall, we had 100 basis points improvement in gross margin. We had a 2.3% price increase in the quarter, net realized. And so you can kind of -- the impact on gross profit margin from that was 110 basis points. Then we had about a 60 basis points benefit from material costs reductions, which were material costs were down 2.4% in the quarter. And then kind of, let's call it, mix and other, but a lot of the other is the low volume and what happened with overheads was minus 70 bps. And that's how you got to the 100 basis points.","Operator","Your next question is from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I actually just want to follow up on Brandon's first question there, about just trends, sequentially, in the quarter. Can you make -- can you help us quantify the drop-off in June? And any color you're willing to give on how things trended in July?","William P. Donnelly","Sure. In terms of, let's say -- and there are different pieces, but in terms of June, in China, our orders were down, it was the worst month in the quarter. I think they were down in the order of 10% or so. If you look at a multiyear basis, it's probably -- that sounds a little bit worse, because that was the toughest comp as well in the 3 months of last year's quarter. If I go to Europe, we had kind of a positive trend coming out of June. Orders were a good bit above the prior year and above the sales level. To give you a feeling, our backlog is up a good bit. Actually, I think it's the first time we've had a year-on-year backlog increase since the beginning of 2012. If I pull out China, which is usually -- accounts for a lot of our backlog as a company, it's actually quite a big increase, which I think, maybe to your point, Tycho, we see pretty good trends coming out in the Western world, maybe a little bit offset with what we're seeing in China.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then from a kind of cost perspective, it sounds like you're going to kind of hold the line with the initiatives you talked about at this point, right? Assuming that things don't deteriorate further?","Olivier A. Filliol","Yes, that's -- absolutely. We feel that we have the right balance of things going on. Of course, we continuously optimize our cost structure that's -- at the same time which we invest. But if I look big picture, I feel actually comfortable that we have the right cost structure going forward. There are things that we feel are adapting. For example, also, in China, we do selective moves here because we definitely recognize that we need to do some resource shift and we need also to maintain our productivity gains that we always pursue. But all in all, no major new initiatives that are being launched here.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then, I guess, as we kind of step back and think about kind of the bigger picture here, giving your commentary on China, just the macro situation. If we think about kind of the intermediate to longer term, for the next, call it, 12 to 18 months, should we be thinking about kind of low-to-mid single-digit organic growth and high 20% incremental margins? Is that the right way to think about it if we're starting to think a little bit longer term?","William P. Donnelly","Hey, Tycho, I apologize. You broke up a little bit. I got the incremental margin number, but I didn't get the...","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I mean, I'm just trying to kind of think about -- as we think about the revenue growth, should we be thinking about kind of low-to-mid single-digit growth? I mean, I know it's early to be talking about '14, but that's essentially the heart of my question. How should we be thinking about things beyond the next quarter or 2?","William P. Donnelly","I think that, that's reasonable. I -- of course, we're going to have some easier comps next year. We're probably feeling -- we're certainly not going to have negative numbers coming out of China for the full year, next year. So I think we would probably say, sitting here today, the lower part of mid-single digit to mid-single digits would probably seem realistic. We'll give you precise guidance when we -- in 3 months or so. And with regard to the incremental margins, I think your -- I think, if I heard you right, you were kind of staying high 20s, maybe low 30s, and I think that's probably realistic.","Operator","Your next question is from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Well, Tycho and Brandon got most of my question. So, I guess, on the Lab Products business, the -- is there anything -- I mean, in terms of new product introductions or anything that's coming out, I guess, because you talk about what the R&D is yielding. I mean the R&D, you're still keeping it at 5% range. What's new in the pipeline? What can we expect over the next couple of years?","Olivier A. Filliol","So that's -- I would almost say, I come up here with a standard answer. We definitely continue with our R&D commitments and investments. We have not been cutting back on that one, even in the more difficult economic times. And the pipeline is a continuous one. We -- every quarter, we are launching a few new products, and it is definitely also true here for the coming months. And there's some good things coming out in the titration area. We have things that we are leveraging in the pH area. Actually, I could name it. I just realized, of course, Balance, we have also something in the pipeline for the next 3 months. The usual things, nothing that I would particularly highlight and would say, \"Oh, this is going to make a big impact.\" But it's very important to our story here that we come out regularly with products -- new product generations to drive the product replacement cycle in the market and to expand our competitive advantage that we have in all the different Lab segments. So, yes, feel comfortable and good stuff coming, believe me.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So I guess if you think about the customer -- the situation in China right now, I mean, are the customers going to some of the -- or they can go to some of the local suppliers? The question then being is there some chance that it's not just like business getting put on hold, but there is potential for some lost business. I mean, maybe you're not willing to extend terms, but -- or do this, but maybe some of the local suppliers are?","Olivier A. Filliol","I don't -- I would see that when we walk away from deals. If we walk away from projects because of terms and conditions, the likelihood that it might go to another company is high. That's a calculated risk that we are willing to take because we feel that the right way and the sustainable way to do the business. But when -- absent of that one, I do not feel that customers are looking for lower-cost suppliers, that's not what I observe at all.","William P. Donnelly","I might even say that our -- you probably heard us talk in the past, Derik, that, from a competitive landscape point of view, China is by far the most fragmented of the markets we compete in, and that can't last forever. And maybe we're going to have a little bit of natural consolidation because our competitors are -- many of our Chinese competitors are actually the ones who are most hard hit by what's happening right now. So they're having their own access to capital issues, as well as maybe some of their customer base, on average, let's call it, they're not getting paid in 5 days from Nestle and 12 days from Pepsi. So they have bigger things probably to deal with in that regard.","Olivier A. Filliol","And on top of that, they have been operating with big margins for quite a while. So they are entering this economic situation with a much more difficult context.","Operator","Your next question is from Sung Ji Nam with Cantor.","Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","So I was wondering about maybe some of the other important emerging markets for you guys like Brazil, India and Russia, and how things are looking in those areas?","Olivier A. Filliol","Okay. Actually Russia had good growth and that's against easier comparisons. And we had -- India, actually, I'm really happy how India performs. The growth in the quarter, if I recall well, was more modest, but we had growth. And I think it's a good accomplishment compared to what's happening in the market. And I really feel -- well with that market. And then we have some modest markets, like Eastern Europe, that performed really well, and I continue to be happy, especially considering that they have a European context that could be challenging. But actually, the team performs very well.","William P. Donnelly","Actually the -- as you saw, we had worse results in China in the second quarter. But actually, the rest of emerging markets did better than they did in the first quarter.","Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. Great. And then I guess one more question about China. Just was wondering, you guys talked about shifting resources there, kind of maybe potentially near term. Do you think that's sufficient? As you look towards your longer-term goals of either rebalancing your customer mix, do you think you have the right resources there in order to achieve that? Or is this -- is that going to require further investment in the near term?","Olivier A. Filliol","We -- in general, I would say the capacity that we have, the facilities that we have are absolutely sufficient also for the long term. There's one exception that I would mention here is that we are building a new plant in the western part of China, but that's actually to serve that region. We want to be closer to the customers there. And this is mainly for the heavy industrial equipments, for example, vehicle scales, where you need a certain proximity to have a good penetration in the market. So I would say that's an investment in market development. And we take the opportunity, also, since we built a new manufacturing plant for the vehicle business there, we also are leveraging that new site for our market organization. But otherwise, I wouldn't foresee big investments here to expand capacity, even for a couple of years here.","Operator","Your next question is from Richard Eastman with Robert Baird.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Olivier, could you just speak to -- I know when you covered Europe, we kind of blasted through there. I know we have -- we had the 2% local currency growth. Did Industrial grow? You had mentioned Lab was up strong, but did the Industrial business grow as well?","William P. Donnelly","So the Industrial business was up in -- up modestly 1%, roughly.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And did that all come out of Product Inspection?","William P. Donnelly","Yes. Product Inspection, yes. It was actually slightly down in core Industrial, up a little bit in Product Inspection.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then can I ask -- when you give -- you shaved in your core growth guidance for the year, for '13 as 1% to 2%, so we're not obviously talking about a great deal of growth. But I'm curious, as you look out to that 1% to 2% for the full year, does the distribution look something like -- is lab plus 3% to 4% and Industrial and Food flat? Or -- I'm just curious if Lab's growth rate kind of exceeds that 2% number.","William P. Donnelly","Well, if you pick the midpoint of the range, it does, yes.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Midpoint of the 1%, so 1.5%. Okay. So Lab is a faster grower. And so, again, I guess that gives you a bit of an upward bias on the gross margin line, given mix. And then also, is the price -- you commented about a couple points of price in the quarter, presumably, that's all coming in Lab? Or are you able to capture something in Product Inspection?","William P. Donnelly","Lab is the biggest contributor, but Product Inspection does well, overall. And it would kind of go, in order, Lab, Product Inspection, Industrial and then Retail, I think, was actually negative.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So there is some volume growth in Lab outside -- or is it pretty much all price?","William P. Donnelly","Well, volume can be a little -- I mean, volume might be a little bit misleading, of course, because it's not standard units and the price points are so different. But if your point is, if you pull out the impact of pricing out of the Lab growth, is it, overall, more flattish? Yes, I think that would be the answer.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's how it plays out. All right. And then also, did you give an overall order growth rate for Mettler in the second quarter? Or could you?","William P. Donnelly","It was better than the sales growth number by, I think, 2 or 3 percentage points.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. All right. And then just last, Olivier, you spent a lot of time on the service piece of the business. And just 2 questions, actually, how did that grow, year-over-year, in the second quarter? And then also, when you see the kind of slump that we're in on the product side, do you tend to see an acceleration in the growth rate in service? Do people tend to extend the service policy? Or any correlation there?","Olivier A. Filliol","Yes. Let me cover the second question before I get the data for the first question. I was just looking it up. But -- so on the second part, actually, often, we see the opposite. We actually -- when the economic times is weak, people would cut also maintenance budgets. They would, on the one hand, try to keep the products lower, and so maybe there is a bigger risk that the product might fail and therefore more repair. But when it comes to maintenance contracts, it's more challenging. And what we would also see is that customers would try to do the service more themselves in difficult economic times. And then the third point I would stress is the Service business depends, particularly the Industrial business, depends also on capacity utilization of our customers' plants. Now what we are experiencing here that service is doing well for us, I think it's really a reflection of all the initiatives that we were talking about before. We have been working on improving our service growth rates for quite a while. And we start to really see the fruits. And if I look at the number, actually it was 6% and definitely reflecting that this was strong. But I would explain it was our own initiative and not an economic phenomenon.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Okay. And as you go forward over the next, say, 3 years, do you target the same growth rate in service that you target for overall Mettler? Presumably, service would be a little bit higher than products, but maybe not?","Olivier A. Filliol","Yes. I think that's a fair statement. I would expect service to do better. Not necessarily every quarter. What you would see is if product sales has a strong quarter, it's going to be difficult for service to match that. In essence, service will be certainly more steady, but if I take it over a certain time period, I would definitely expect service to be above product growth.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","You've seen good gross margin growth in the first half, just was wondering, what's your thoughts are on gross margin expansion in the back half of the year? And then secondly, the impact from currency, are you still expecting about a $0.10 headwind in total this year?","William P. Donnelly","I know the percentage is here, but...","Mary T. Finnegan","Steve, it's a little bit higher. You're talking about currency and EPS, it's probably closer to 16 -- $0.15 now.","William P. Donnelly","In terms of gross profit margin expansion, we expect it to narrow in the second half of the year. The reason we're expecting it to narrow a little bit is that, as a reminder, in the middle of last year, we put through a midyear price increase. And so we have, at least for the first half of this year, kind of 2 price increases, the midyear of last year, as well as the January 1. So it's not that prices will decline, but just the year-on-year impact will be less. As a reminder, we had about 100 basis points gross margin expansion in the second half of last year versus the second half of '11. And so I expect, now, numbers more in the 30, 40, 50 bps range in the second half of the year.","Operator","There are currently no further phone questions.","Mary T. Finnegan","Thank you, Victoria.

I'm the Treasurer and responsible for Investor Relations at Mettler-Toledo, and happy that you're joining us this evening. I'm joined by Olivier Filliol, our CEO; and Bill Donnelly, our Executive Vice President.","I need to cover just a couple administrative matters. First, this call is being webcast and is available on our website. A copy of the press release and the presentation we'll refer to is also available on the website. On page 1, we have our Safe Harbor language, let me just summarize it quickly.","Statements in this presentation, which are not historical facts, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 and the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

More detailed information with respect to the use of and differences between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided in the 8-K.","I'll now turn the call over to Olivier.","Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Mary, and welcome to everyone on the call. I will start with a summary of the quarter, and then Bill will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments before we open the lines for Q&A.","The highlights for the quarter are on page two of the presentation. We continue to execute very well. Spinnaker and field turbo programs are allowing us to leverage our strong product portfolio to gain share. The Americas have particular strong growth, and Europe came in as expected. We also had very good growth in certain emerging markets.","However, these strong results are masked (2:55) by weak demand in BRC; that is Brazil, Russia and China. While our overall local currency sales growth was 3% in the quarter, excluding BRC, we achieved local currency sales growth of 7%, a level which reflect the above-market growth and one we are very pleased with.","We also had excellent margin expansion in the quarter. Despite the challenging currency environment, we delivered 11% EPS growth, which equates to 16% before the estimated impact of currencies. We are pleased with these results, particularly given the headwinds from currency and BRC. Most importantly, our margin enhancement and productivity initiatives are allowing us to continue to make investments in field resources, which further position us for growth in 2016 and beyond.","Now, let me turn it to Bill to cover the numbers.","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","Thanks, Olivier, and hello everybody. Sales were $604.2 million in the quarter, that's an increase of 3% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, our sales decreased by 4% as currencies reduced sales by approximately 7% in the quarter.","Now, turning to page three of the presentation, we outlined sales by geography. In the third quarter, local currency sales increased by 10% in the Americas, 1% in Europe, and declined by 1% in Asia\/Rest of World. All of these are compared to the prior year.","Overall, the BRC countries continue to underperform in the quarter and reduced sales growth by about 4%. BRC was specifically down 12% in the quarter with China down 9%, which is slightly better than we expected.","Now, turning to the next slide, our year-to-date sales increased by 4% in local currency. By region, for the nine-month period, local currency sales increased by 7% in the Americas, 3% in Europe and 1% in Asia\/Rest of World. Our growth excluding BRC is 8% year-to-date.","Now please turn to slide number five. There we outlined sales growth by product line. Laboratory had growth of 7% in local currency. Industrial declined by 1%, while Food Retailing increased by 7% in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, as shown on the next slide, Laboratory increased by 7% in local currency, Industrial was flat, and Food Retailing grew by 6%.","Now turn to slide number 7 please. Let me walk you through the key items in the P&L. Gross margins were 56.2%, that's 160 basis point improvement over the prior year margin of 54.6%. We're very pleased that increase. Currencies contributed approximately 100 basis points to the increase and includes the benefit of the gain on the Swiss franc-euro hedges. In constant currency, our margins were up about 60 basis points.","Pricing and material cost reductions further contributed to our margin improvement. These improvements were offset by our investments in our field service organization.","Research and development expenses were $29.7 million, that's a 3% increase in local currency. SG&A was $175.5 million, that's a 1% increase in local currency and includes increased investment in our field service organization as well as some employee benefit costs offset by our cost savings program and lower variable compensation.","Adjusted operating income was $134.3 million in the quarter, that's a 6% increase over the prior-year amount of $126.7 million. Currencies reduced operating profit by approximately $6 million. Excluding this headwind, our operating profit increased by 10% in the quarter.","Our operating margins were 22.2%; that's an increase of 210 basis points over the prior year. Margins benefited by 70 basis points due to currency as the percentage impact on currency and the sales line was larger than the impact on operating profit.","The core underlying margin improvement was a very strong 140 basis points. Our incremental OP margins reached 60% in the quarter on a constant currency basis, which is particularly impressive given the meaningful investments we're making via our field turbo program.","Now, a couple of final comments on the P&L. Our amortization was $7.8 million, while our interest expense was $7 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate continued to be at 24%. Fully diluted shares for the quarter were $28.1 million (sic) [28.1 million] (7:53); that's a 4.4% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program.","Adjusted EPS was $3.26 per share; that's an increase of 11% over the prior year amount of $2.95 per share. Excluding the impact of currency, adjusted EPS increased by 16% in the quarter. On a reported basis, EPS was $3.16 as compared to $2.89 per share in the prior year. Reported EPS includes $0.07 of restructuring charges and $0.03 of purchased intangible amortization.","The next slide gives you our year-to-date results. Our local currency sales have increased by 4%, while gross margins are up by 190 bps. Currency benefits gross margin by approximately 100 basis points, resulting in a strong 90 basis point core improvement. Our operating profit increased by 6%, while adjusted EPS grew by 11%. Excluding currency, operating profit has increased by 10%, while our adjusted EPS has increased by 15%, both on a year-to-date basis.","Now turning to cash flow. In the quarter, free cash flow was $107.1 million, or $3.81 per share. On a per-share basis, this is a 6% increase over the prior year amount. We had continued improvements in our DSO with 41 days, as compared to 42 days last year. Our ITO was 4.8. Year-to-date, our cash flow amounts to $238.4 million, and that's an increase of 6% on a per-share basis.","Now let's turn to guidance. Forecasting continues to be very challenging particularly given the uncertainty in Brazil, Russia, and China. The timing of a recovery in these countries is uncertain. Another negative factor is currency, which continues to be a headwind to EPS growth for us in both Q4 as well as next year, but particularly the first half of next year. Offsetting these factors is our ability to execute. As you see in our year-to-date results, our various initiatives to drive share gain and expand margins are doing very well. We expect these trends to continue.","With this as a backdrop, let me cover some specifics. We expect local currency sales growth in the fourth quarter to be approximately 2%. Based on this sales growth, we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.58 per share to $4.63 per share. Currency will reduce EPS growth by approximately 5% in the fourth quarter. Absent currencies, adjusted EPS growth in the fourth quarter is expected to be in the 13% to 14% range.","Incorporating fourth quarter guidance, we would expect full-year local currency sales growth to be about 3%. Adjusted EPS for 2015 is expected to be in the range of $12.85 per share to $12.90 per share. Currencies are expected to reduce our full-year earnings growth by 5%. Absent the currency headwind, we have EPS growth of 15% in 2015. As we look to 2016, we expect market conditions in Brazil, Russia, and China to remain challenging, particularly in the early part of the year. We're not yet forecasting a recovery in these markets, hopefully some stabilization.","Outside of these three countries, we expect sales growth to be solid. Our product pipeline looks strong and we continue to see tangible results from our Spinnaker sales and marketing and field turbo programs. We will also make further investments in our front-end resources in 2016.","Taking all these factors together, we expect local currency sales growth to be in the 3% to 4% range in 2016. This should result in adjusted EPS in the range of $14.10 per share to $14.30 per share, which is a growth of 9% to 11%. We expect currency to reduce earnings next year by approximately 1.5%. Adjusting for this currency headwind and using the midpoint of guidance, this represents a growth of 10.5% to 12.5%.","A couple of items, I think, are worth highlighting with respect to our guidance. First, our productivity and lean initiative programs are well on track and yielding very good results. This will allow us to make additional investments in front-end resources in 2016, while maintaining our expense base at a reasonable level. We're very pleased with our ability to make these important investments, which are helping to drive share gains. Olivier will have some additional comments on our field turbo program shortly.","The second comment is currencies. We expect sales growth \u2013 with respect to sales growth, we expect currencies to reduce sales in Q4 by 6%, which result in an 8% reduction for the full year of 2015. In 2016, we expect currencies to reduce sales growth by about 1% for the full year.","One other item related to currency. I already mentioned that we expect currency to reduce earnings per share growth in 2016 by approximately 1.5%. I want to point out that that headwind will be greater in the first half of the year as compared to the second half. I realize some of you are updating your models, and thought this would be worthwhile to point out.","The third topic about next year is cash flow. We expect cash flow generation to continue to be solid and expect free cash flow per share to increase by 6% in 2016. This will result in a free cash flow amounting to $353 million. We expect to continue to make progress in working capital improvements, but will have higher capital expenditures in 2016 due to some manufacturing expansions we'll have underway.","In terms of share repurchase, you saw in the press release that the board has authorized an increase in our authorization, as it will be exhausted shortly. And we would expect to repurchase shares of approximately $500 million in 2016.","One final item with respect to guidance. Looking at the current quarterly consensus estimates for 2016, they reflect an adjusted EPS growth in the first half of more than 15%. Given our expectations for continued challenging market conditions in the BRC in the early part of the year, combined with greater currency headwinds in the first part of the year, I would not expect such a level of earnings growth. Similar to what we've done in the past, we'll update you on a quarterly basis with regard to our 2016 estimates. But I thought it was worthwhile to mention as you're updating your models.","Okay. That's it for my side. And then I want to turn it back to Olivier.","Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Bill. Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab increased 7% in the quarter, with good growth in almost all product categories. We're executing quite well in our Laboratory business. The combination of strong product pipeline, Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives, and our field turbo investments. Our Lab business does very well, and I expect results in the fourth quarter and into 2016 to continue to be solid.","Industrial declined 1% in the quarter. Product inspection had growth of 3% and our outlook for this business continues to be very favorable. As we discussed last quarter in some detail, we are well-positioned in this business with strong relative market share, the most extensive product portfolio and the largest service network in the industry.","We expect product inspection to have strong growth in the fourth quarter. And while they will face tougher comparisons as we get into 2016, I expect solid growth in 2016. Core industrial declined 3% in the third quarter. We had good growth in the Americas and decline in China. Europe was flat. We expect conditions in core industrial to remain challenging in fourth quarter and into first half of 2016, principally due to China. We may see some growth in later part of next year as we will benefit from easier comparisons.","Finally, retail was up 7% in the quarter with particular good growth in the Americas due to project activity. Retail will be down in the fourth quarter due to timing of activity and I would expect moderate growth in 2016.","Now let me make some additional comments by geography. As mentioned earlier, Europe sales growth came in as expected. We had growth in Western Europe and most Eastern European countries outside of Russian-centric countries. We do not expect much growth in fourth quarter due to prior year's comparisons, but expect to continue to execute well and further capitalize on our Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives, field turbo investments, and strong product pipeline in this region. We expect moderate growth in 2016 in Europe.","Americas had an excellent quarter with sales growth of 10%. We had good growth in all product lines. While I don't expect another 10% growth quarter, our outlook for Americas is good. Asia\/Rest of the World decreased 1% in the quarter and increased 9% excluding China. As Bill mentioned, China declined 9% in the quarter. We had growth in our Laboratory business in China, while Industrial was down 18%. I would expect Industrial in China to be down at similar level in the fourth quarter. Looking to 2016, we expect sales will decline but not to the level we saw in this year.","Outside China, in the third quarter, we had very good growth in Australia and Korea, and good growth in India and Southeast Asia. We expect market conditions in Asia outside of China to remain solid for the remainder of this year and into 2016. Service had good growth in the quarter with local currency revenue up 5% as compared to prior year. We had good growth in all geographic regions and in most product lines.","Let me update you on our field turbo program. We are very pleased with our progress and results to-date. The growth opportunities we identified are yielding tangible results, and the additional field resources are allowing greater attention and focus to our high priority accounts.","At the same time, we are executing very well on our productivity and cost initiatives throughout the organization. These initiatives focused on lean manufacturing and values (19:45) productivity enhancement programs, which allow us to continue our field resource investments in 2016.","We have identified targeted growth opportunities and will make a portion of the investments early in the year with additional investing as the year progresses, assuming market conditions remain favorable. Despite the challenging market conditions, we are executing very well, which is allowing us to make these front-end investments, which position us well for future growth. That is about all I want to cover on this topic.","One additional update I want to provide today is on the Process Analytics business which has a great track record for technology innovation and sophisticated marketing. It has a sizable percentage of its revenue from consumables and services, approximately 40%, and has achieved above-market growth for numerous years. It represents a little less than 10% of total sales and I wanted to update you on some recent developments.","Process Analytics provides in-line and real-time measurement of key analytical parameters for industrial liquids which helps pharma, biotech, and chemical companies monitor and optimize their production processes. While the total market is large, we are leader for pH, TOC, conductivity and dissolved oxygen measurements in niche (21:14) applications including ultrapure water monitoring.","Our solutions combine sensor technologies with transmitters to measure specific analytical parameters. The sensors must be calibrated, maintained, and replaced on a timely basis, which creates an attractive consumable stream.","We are highly regarded as the technology leader due to our unique sensor design, and our Intelligent Sensor Management software. We have the most complete product offering and most extensive field force of our direct competitors. We're also cost effective in terms of manufacturing with the vast majority of transmitters produced in China.","We have recently expanded our reach with an entry into gas analytics through a unique laser-based sensor technology. This technology combined with our deep knowledge of industrial processes offers cost-effective in situ installations and chemical process applications for existing customers. We're adding gas capabilities as well as unique installation solutions to complement our product range. Power generation is another expansion market for Process Analytics. We have extended our offering for this attractive market including multi-point transmitters, conductivity, TOC and optical dissolved oxygen sensors as well as panel mount analyzer solutions for monitoring of power plant water quality.","Extensive targeted marketing campaigns to end-users and panel fabricators in power and chemical markets are driving good results. We are also having success with the expansion of our TOC, or total organic carbon, portfolio. TOC is an important to ensure the integrity of ultrapure water and is especially important to regulated industries such as pharma and biotech.","We now have solutions in the valued mid-tier and high-end of the TOC market. We've added a portable version as quality engineers continue to gain acceptance of online analytical measurements in pharma. In the coming weeks, we will launch a VIS (23:37) verification system, which leverages our TOC and conductivity expertise to broaden our applications in pharma.","Finally, we recently completed a small technology acquisition, which further enhances our expertise in ultrapure water analysis. We will now have a laser-based technology that can detect bacteria in real-time which makes us the only company to offer all three regulated ultrapure water measurements: conductivity, TOC, and bacteria.","It is sold to the same pharma customers as our TOC offering, and the ability of customers to analyze bacterial contamination in real-time is a game-changer.","We have seen a similar development in TOC where the alternative is to take samples offline and analyze in the lab, with meaningful time differentials. For bacteria measurements, this time differential is typically five days to seven days, which offer significant cost savings opportunities for our customers.","I have covered a lot of the technology developments within Process Analytics but want to remind you that this business was the incubator for our Spinnaker methodology for sales and marketing initiatives. Process Analytics continues to make great progress in furthering their marketing and lead generation campaigns. This marketing focus combined with additional field turbo resources and excellent product portfolio is contributing to nice share gains for this business.","Let me make some concluding comments and then open it up for questions. We remain cautious on China, Brazil, and Russia, as market conditions are challenging and the turnaround is not yet visible. We are working to protect margins in these countries and ensure resources are targeted to long-term growth opportunities.","Our other (25:34) businesses, which encompass (25:35) more than 80% of total sales, are performing quite well. Market demand is solid, and we are leveraging our excellent product pipeline, strong sales and marketing programs, and investment in field resources to gain share.","Our margin enhancement and productivity initiatives are well on track and allow us to make the additional investments in field resources, despite weakness in China, Brazil, and Russia and negative currency headwinds on operating profit and earnings.","I want to now ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon.","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","Hey, Brandon.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Bill or Olivier, just curious, if you could elaborate on some of the productivity and lean initiatives that you plan to tackle next year. Just in more detail give us a few examples. And just how much runway do you see on that front to be able to still fund growth investments elsewhere in the business?","Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, let me say that we have these programs in place now for quite a while and there's a continuation of what we have been doing already this year. And we have lean initiatives on factory floor, where we are optimizing layouts, where we are optimizing planning processes, and we are optimizing the logistics parts between suppliers and ourselves, but also at the logistics part between the different factories. These all helped us to expand the margins.","And on top of that, we always have selective restructuring projects that are helping us. For example, last year we consolidated a plant in the U.S. and there is certainly also things that we continue to do in terms of leveraging low-cost countries. We have moved one product category actually to low-end part of that product category from Switzerland to China that will help us also next year. So these are continuous things that we do, sometimes project specific and sometimes just global initiatives. And then, of course, we continue also to do things on the supply chain management, optimizing our logistics (28:26), optimizing very much our purchasing, we have a very good material price index and I expect this to go on also next year.","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","Maybe I'd add to what Olivier said, Brandon, that one of the things we're leveraging more with Blue Ocean is that having most of our plants now on the Blue Ocean system allows us to have kind of common measures and KPIs around productivity, things that get measured and get done, so we are able to drive productivity improvements in kind of solving to the best-in-class standards within the group.","And then I would add on top of that that \u2013 and these are now more back office costs, we see opportunities for shared service centers. We've certainly done some of our initial shared service centers coming out of Blue Ocean but we see continued opportunities there. In general, we gain productivity, let's say, 10% or 15% when we do a shared service center just within the Western world and more than that then if we can we go to a low-cost country. And those should be good runways. We actually had a review together with the rest of GMC colleagues this week as part of our GMC meetings and one of the comments I made to the guys kind of relates to a question investors often asked me, ask of me and that's how much more opportunity do we have. The whole review of this productivity and shared service center activities, I drew the conclusion preparing for that that we still have a long runway to go. We have a lot of good ideas to continue to enhance our margins in the coming years.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. That's helpful. And then one more for you, Bill. Two things. Could you \u2013 what have you baked in for net pricing next year and then, what does your EPS outlook contemplate for local currency incremental margin?","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","So, in the first question, we're building in, I think, about 150 basis points, based on what we see today. In terms of the incremental margins, they're going to be in the mid-40%s on a constant currency basis.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","Operator, do we have other questions?","Operator","We do. Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yes. Good afternoon.","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","Hey, Rick.","Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Olivier, could you expand just a little bit on the strength in the Lab business? Really just kind of speaking maybe a little bit to the verticals \u2013 pharmaceutical, food, just maybe where the strength was, and are there any laggards in the verticals there?","Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Actually, absent of the BRC, I would say, we experienced a good growth across all product lines and actually, also across this end user segment. I think there's really good momentum. And I attribute that certainly that demand is healthy, but then the programs that we have in place are actually relatively broad-based and yield good results.","So I wouldn't single out here a particular segment. If I look at the U.S. market, it has been really broad-based. And typically, when we are \u2013 when we have good results across all the product lines, that's a signal that it's not a segment-specific topic.","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","Maybe the one area would be, some of the Lab side, in particular life sciences, look good.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, okay. And then, Bill, just on the gross margin, just kind of looking at the drivers on the incrementals quarter-to-quarter, and it was pretty substantial, 75% kind of gross margin incremental from Q2 to Q3. Is that \u2013 I'm just going to surmise that that might be a mix issue, with Lab as strong as it was. But is there a way that you could give us a feel for that?","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","Yeah. Hey. I think, Rick, this is probably like a classic. You're looking at it may be slightly different than how we look at it. Actually, the way we look at it, it's always Q3 on Q3, Q2 on Q2. And if I look in Q2, actually, our year-on-year margin expansion was a little bit less in Q3 than it was on a year-to-date basis. I think the absolute sales volume is partly explaining that.","If I look at the growth comparisons, Q \u2013 the two-year growth rates are maybe relatively similar, maybe slightly more in Q3, which could contribute a little bit to what you're talking about. But I...","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay.","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","I, overall, would say, on a constant currency basis, the margins were very good. Good expansion in Q3, but probably a little less than what we had seen earlier in the year.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, okay. Fair enough. And then just one last question, I mean given the outlook in China, certainly for China industrial and maybe the trailing performance there, no quick fix there from an end market perspective when you're talking about the Industrial business, and potentially a pretty long cycle downturn here. But is any of your restructuring actions targeted at China? We've talked about moving assets around a little bit, but what are you doing with the asset base on the industrial side in China? Is that stable? Are you taking that down or...?","Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We have been working on resource shifting in China for quite a while. And when I say resource shifting, there is parts of restructuring, head count adjustments, reflecting the pockets of future growth that we are anticipating. So, we are adjusting. We are assessing kind of the difficulty that we have in Industrial business, and you would have seen us, already in the last couple of months, still adding people, for example, for Laboratory business and for certain territories that we see a good future prospect. As for Industrial, we have been reducing head count. So, we are proactive on that. We have started last year, and this is still ongoing.","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","Rick, maybe one \u2013 because you used the word asset. And in terms of thinking about plants, maybe the one thing I'd remind you too is, we have our manufacturing for the Chinese domestic business, which clearly has been hurt on the Industrial side. But we continue to leverage those factories in terms of moving new products there and so things that were previously manufactured in the West.","So the picture, inclusive of intercompany sales, would maybe show a better leveraging that you might expect just looking at the Industrial piece of the business. I would add to that that we see some facility consolidation opportunities in China, because we didn't own all of our office space. We have some office space and things we can take advantage of there \u2013 rental spaces.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, okay. Very good. And again, given your primary global competition on the Lab side, probably more than Industrial, do you have a sense of \u2013 I mean, is more of your product sold in China manufactured in China vis-\u00e0-vis, say, Sartorius on the Lab side? Do you have a sense of that?","Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would say, in general, I think, of all of our competitors, we are very advanced in leveraging low-cost countries. And, in that sense, China as a production base is certainly significantly larger for us than for our key competitors.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I see. Okay. Very good. Thank you. Thank you much.","Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research.","Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Hi. Good evening. A couple of quick questions for you guys. First, you made a comment about some lower variable comp here. Was that for the third quarter? And if so, why did that happen?","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","Because a year ago we raised our bonus achievement expectations in Q3 a year ago. This year, we have about the same expectation as we did a quarter ago.","Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. That makes sense. And then, Bill, is there any way to sort of quantifying the impact from field turbo? As of yet, I know it's still rolling out and you guys are expanding, but is there any way to quantify the revenue contribution or anything like that?","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","We struggle to be precise there because, of course, we're often \u2013 the field turbos can often be splitting territories and things like that. I think, for us, the \u2013 what's that expression about the pudding \u2013 sorry, the proof in the pudding is the growth in non-BRC.","I think given global economic, we just don't think our markets are growing that fast. It very much \u2013 the outsized growth very much ties to geographies and product categories where we've made field turbo investment. So, I think, our success is in those markets is very much explained by the investments we made in 2015, but as well the ones we started in 2014.","Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. And then just one follow up on that then. Even in the BRC markets, is there a way to gauge how you're comparing, your growth compares to what you would consider the market would be? Are you seeing \u2013 even though the business is declining, would you say you're seeing the similar type of kind of outperformance versus the market?","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","So, hey, let's maybe exclude Brazil and Russia that we're talking in those two cases, $30 million, $40 million of sales spread across 20 product categories. So it would be wrong for me to imply we have that level of visibility vis-\u00e0-vis competition because you're talking about really small slices. In the case in China, we certainly listen to what direct competitors that would have conference calls, i.e. \u2013 e.g. or i.e., Sartorius. And we feel good about what they do as well as our local market intelligence. We see on the industrial side, a couple of our industrial competitors have gone away in China. So we think we do reasonably well on a competitive basis there as well. And \u2013 yes.","Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks for all the color, Bill.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","Hey, Ross.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","I was just hoping that you could go through your expectations for margins in 2016, if you can give us like your idea what the pacing is going to be like, what the core expansion and any FX impacts you guys are expecting?","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","So, first of all, maybe we are \u2013 if you pick the \u2013 we're saying 3% to 4% top line growth with about a 1% impact due to currency with that weighted towards the first part of the year. So a little more than 2% headwind in the first quarter and about 2% in the second and about 1% in Q3 and flat in Q4. Our margin expansion should be pretty well paced with maybe the fourth quarter being slightly more than the earlier quarters. But, overall for 2016, we're looking at 50 bps.","And then in terms of our incremental operating margins, we're looking at a number in the mid-40%s for the full year. And if I kind of look at the pieces, the only one that \u2013 only quarter we don't see a number in that kind of range would be a little less than that in the second quarter. And that has to do with year-end (41:49) mix topics as well as some currency topics.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Thanks. That was really helpful. I'll just hop in the queue.","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derik DeBruin with Bank of America ML.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Hello. Good afternoon. Thank you for the call. So, China came in a little bit better than expected at \u2013 declining only 9% versus the 22% declines that we saw in the last two quarters. I was wondering if you could just share with us some of the dynamics as that improved in China.","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","So \u2013 and maybe the first comment just to clarify some things. So our Industrial business was down in the low-20%s in China. Earlier in the year, it was down a little less than that in the high-teens. And, correspondingly, our overall business in China was down a little bit \u2013 2% less this quarter than it was last quarter.","You can see that if we're down high-teens in Industrial, but only down 9% overall, that reflects growth in areas like our Laboratory business largely. So in terms of the areas of our Laboratory business, it's \u2013 I think, overall, we have pretty solid growth. Probably the only area we didn't have good growth in Lab was AutoChem and frankly that's driven by \u2013 we're up (43:33) 135% a year ago in Lab in AutoChem. So we feel that that business \u2013 the Lab side goes reasonably well.","I think I largely answered your question.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, you did. Thank you.","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks. Olivier, can you maybe just give a little bit more color on growth by segment expectations on 2016. If you're going to get to 4% local currency or better on the top line, best case, would that be driven more by Lab or where do you see the strong factors (44:15)?","Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me have Bill comment, because of course we model that thing.","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","Yeah. So \u2013 hey, we \u2013 Tycho \u2013 first hello, Tycho. And we should be doing mid-singles in our Laboratory business. We have, relatively speaking, a somewhat tougher comp in Q1, but the rest of the quarters should be all kind of in that range. Our PI business, product inspection, will continue to do well. We should get high-single-digit growth out of that.","Our Industrial business will probably be flattish. We would expect China to again be down in Industrial, but we'll have some growth in the other parts of the world. And I would guess that that will be a little bit better in the second half of the year than the first half of the year largely due to comps in China. And, hey, our retail business is lumpy due to large projects but we're not building in a lot of growth overall, maybe a low-single-digit growth for that business.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then the bacterial contamination business that you picked up, how large is the opportunity? I mean it seems like it could be a pretty large for pharma.","Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, we bought mainly a technology here that we are now improving and then bringing to the market. As always when you launch a product with the new technology, it's going to take a while until customers will really adapt to it especially because you need to address your quality systems, you need to address standard operating procedures and so on. So, while in the long-term we see it as a very nice product category very similar to the TOC, we do expect that it's going to take a couple of years. But as mentioned also in the prepared remarks, it's very synergistic and we feel we have a really great customer access, we have the right team. And so from a competitive standpoint, we feel like we have a really unique position here to leverage.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then last one, capital deployment. It was good to see the buyback step-up, maybe just if you could comment on what you're seeing from an M&A perspective, given the market volatility, are you looking at more opportunities and any appetite to do something a little bit larger and some of the smaller bolt-ons?","Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","M&A strategy really remains \u2013 I'm very confident on that. As a reminder, we feel that from a strategic standpoint, there is no need at all for us to do something big. But we are very committed and very interested in doing these bolt-on acquisitions because we feel we can have a franchise that we can really leverage, if we have synergistic technology or if there are opportunities to develop a certain market access.","So very committed to that, constantly looking at opportunities. We have our own radar (47:27) with a lot of targets on it. But many of these cases are not available or don't materialize in the time lines we want (47:39). I think this recent technology acquisition that we did is a perfect example of how we are committed, and we are doing these cases.","When you refer to bigger deals, hey, it's not \u2013 we don't say no to it. But there are not that many targets out there that would really fit the franchise. And in essence, I'm not expecting just around the corner something big.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Knight with Janney Montgomery Scott.","William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Hi, guys. This is actually Bill March on behalf of Paul. How are you guys doing tonight?","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","Good. How are you, sir?","William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Doing well. I was just hoping you could speak to maybe the potential for growth in the Food Retail segment just in light of the potential Food Safety Modernization rules coming online.","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","So, maybe to clarify a little, the Food Safety Modernization Act has more impact for us in our product inspection business, and I would describe it as kind of an indirect impact. There is already \u2013 the principal driver of our product inspection business relates to brand protection and food safety topics. We certainly view the act as positive but for most of the guys, this is a little bit catch-up for maybe 20% of the market and probably 80% of that was largely covered already in people standard practices. The Food Retailing business itself won't really have any impact due to this.","William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Great. Thank you. And then maybe just to follow up on China in terms of kind of Lab. What are you seeing maybe between the first half and the second half of the year in terms of \u2013 has there been a pickup in spending? And if so, if you think that continues into 2016? Thank you.","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","Yeah. I talk \u2013 maybe could I clarify your question? You were asking about Lab in China and...","William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Correct.","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","Yeah. Okay. Sorry. So our Chinese business, PI (50:05), the first quarter was our strongest quarter of the year. We would have grown a little more the last couple of quarters, except for some tough comps on our AutoChem business. But we see no reason we can't grow high-single-digits in our Lab business, based on what I see out there.","William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good afternoon. Thank you. Bill, just wondering if you could maybe give us an update on pricing. I think it's obviously been a successful area for you year-to-date. But could you maybe give us a year-to-date view on what that's been, and maybe what's embedded in your guidance for next year? Thank you.","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","So, on a year-to-date basis, we're up approximately 200 basis points. Very much the Lab business leading the way there, with numbers actually north of that, and our Industrial business is somehow being somewhat laggards to that. And Retail, we struggle to have global price realization in the Retail business.","In terms of next year, I think that we should be able to get something in the 150 basis point range. If you're wondering why a little bit less, we did make some extra moves this year, particularly driven in countries where we wanted to push through a little bit of extra pricing because of the strong dollar. So, for example, in places like Southeast Asia, we pushed through a little bit extra price increases there, to try to make up for some of the currency impacts.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. And then, maybe a second question would be just sort of, on the China point, you guys have put a lot of color on that, I appreciate. But wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit more about which end markets were, maybe not the weakest, but maybe the strongest. I'm just kind of curious, within that 9% number, how wide the range is between your various either end markets or product areas, because I have to imagine there are some bright spots, but curious about the dispersion on what you're seeing in China. Thank you.","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","Sure. So, hey, I would describe, first of all, a bright spot would be the Lab business overall and, of course, our Lab business maybe has a slightly different mix than some of the other guys. We have a little bit less healthcare, a little bit more industrial, within our product portfolio. But, overall, as mentioned, I think, kind of pulling out the impact of some large AutoChem orders last year, we think that that can be a high-single-digit business in the coming quarters.","If I look at other parts of the portfolio, actually, Retail would be an area that's been growing there. And, of course, that's being driven by the increasing GDP per capita increasing consumer spending. Our Industrial businesses continue to be weak overall, but we do see pockets of growth there in some specific product categories where we're, I think, trying to push product categories. But, hey, probably they're small enough that it's not so helpful for us to mention at this point.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understood. Thanks for all the color. I appreciate it.","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","Hello, everyone.","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","Hi, Jason.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","Looking at your forecast for 2016, what is your assumption on material costs?","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","So, material costs should be down, let's say, somewhere in the 1% range to 1.5% range. And you can kind of multiply that number by 0.3 or 0.4 to get a sense for what kind of impact that would have on the gross profit margin.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","And then, looking at China overall, did you say it was going to be off around 9% in the fourth quarter, or is that just the Industrial side?","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","I think I'd like to give it a range. But I would certainly say high-single-digits.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","And then how about 2016?","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","2016, it's got to do better than that. If you look at our Industrial business, we would expect the levels of decline are still large, that it's got to take a few more quarters to stabilize that business. So I think the beginning of the year, you'll continue to see declines in our Chinese business overall, whether we get to a flat business or a modest growth business in the second half of the year, I'm not quite sure yet.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","And then, looking at the percentage of your products manufactured in China, you expect that to change materially next year?","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","No, not \u2013 definitely not materially, because we have, to a certain extent, that \u2013 because such a high percentage of our Chinese business is Chinese manufactured products, clearly that piece will, again, at least, decline in the first half of the year. And we have, of course, always every year, a handful of products that we're transferring there ,or activities that we're transferring there. But I wouldn't expect the overall percentage to move materially.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","And then finally, what was the number of shares repurchased in the quarter?","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","Just give me a second here. So, we repurchased 390,548 shares.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","Thank you very much","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.","Michael Clerico - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good evening. It's actually Michael Clerico on for Steve. You drove some good acceleration in the Americas sequentially this quarter. So I'm just wondering what's behind that growth rate and, more specifically, are you seeing any drag from weaker industrial trends, specifically in the U.S.?","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","Yeah. So, in terms of our Industrial business overall, I think the Q3 is in line with our kind of year-to-date numbers. And we would expect to have maybe some slowing in some of core industrial areas but maybe some acceleration in terms of our food safety, product inspection related businesses. Our Lab businesses in the Americas did very well in the quarter and we expect continued good performance in the fourth quarter as well.","Michael Clerico - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Second question, it seems like field turbo is going well, any updated thoughts on deploying a second wave of reps? And also could you give us an idea of how long it will take the current wave to be fully ramped up in terms of productivity?","Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, this year, we added about 200 field resources. This typically I do \u2013 they take a few quarters to ramp-up in terms of the first quarter you have training, onboarding, that's one. And then it takes them a few quarters to build up the pipeline. I would say, after two years, they should actually be really profitable contributing to the overall situation. And we prioritized, of course, on product categories that have the highest profitability. And so, we have both (58:30) group average contribution. For next year, I expect if things continue to go as expected in terms of market demand, to add about the same amount as we did this year.","Michael Clerico - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Groberg with UBS.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, guys. I'll just follow up with you offline. Thanks.","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","Hey, Jon. You're on the line.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Can you hear me? I said (59:17) I'll just follow up with you guys offline. Thanks.","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Is this bacterial contamination detection technology that you purchased, is there any application or cross application there with your product inspection business?","Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. The application points (59:56) are very different. This is really pure water analytics \u2013 totally different. The synergy is, with our (60:07) business that you might know, particularly related to TOC and conductivity measurements.","These are the three measurement points that you would find in ultrapure water. For example, an application is Water for Injection. And when you have Water for Injection in pharma, you need to be USP compliant and that's the parameters that are relevant here.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. I was hoping you'd say yes. And it seems to be a big opportunity in bacterial detection on the food side. But maybe that's still to come. And then, Olivier, I was always so curious, during the third quarter, we had noticed kind of a flurry of new product introductions from old house (61:04). And I'm curious maybe that not atypical, but is there any strategic rationale for that? Was there any window open on the U.S. dollar creating any opportunities or any soft spot in the competition that worked (61:22)?","Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, you shouldn't read anything into it. This...","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, okay.","Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It wasn't unusual for us at all.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay.","Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We have a certain strategy to expand the product portfolio in terms of leveraging the access to the channel for life science applications and so on. But that's something we have been doing over a couple of years and what you have seen more recently was actually product launches for Retail, Industrial as well as for the Lab product (61:56).","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. And then \u2013 and there's no bump in your Lab growth? That wasn't big enough, any channel fills since that goes through distribution?","Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. And certainly not related to old house. No, (62:11) I don't...","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, okay.","Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Everything kind of as usual.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Citigroup.","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","Hi.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks. Bill, maybe just one for me and apologies if you've touched on it when I drop off the line there, but on the outlook for next year, what are you assuming in terms of the payout from some of the efforts that you have going on in service, increasing the attach rate on service contracts et cetera? Is that something that's sort of built into guidance or is that more of the \"upside case\" so to speak?","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","We built in some additional service growth over product growth and maybe that will be short answer, Dan.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Okay. Thanks very much.","William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT","Have a good one.","Operator","And there are no more questions at this time.","Mary T.

I'm happy that you're joining us today . I'm joined here by Olivier Filliol, our CEO; and Shawn Vadala, our Chief Financial Officer. Let me cover just a couple of administrative matters.

It is Friday morning for us and Thursday evening for most of you on the phone. I will start with a summary of the quarter and then Shawn will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments and we will open the lines for Q&A.","The highlights for the quarter are on page 3 of the presentation. We had a good second quarter results. Local currency sales growth was solid, and we are particularly pleased with the excellent growth in our Laboratory business and very solid growth in Core Industrial product lines.","Total local currency sales grew 5% in the quarter. Excluding Food Retailing, which declined in the quarter, local currency sales grew 6%. Growth in the Americas and Asia was very good. We had another quarter of good operating margin growth, and despite headwinds from currency and tariffs, we achieved a strong increase in EPS.","Turning to the remainder of the year, with the exception of Food Retailing, demand in our markets is favorable and our outlook for the third quarter is positive. As we look towards the end of the year, we acknowledge greater uncertainty due to the deteriorating macroeconomic data and potential unfavorable consequences to the global economy due to trade disputes, particularly between U.S. and China. We will monitor our markets closely, remain agile, and be ready to adapt our plans if necessary. We remain focused on execution of our growth initiatives and believe we are well positioned to continue to gain share regardless of market conditions. Based on market conditions today, we believe we can generate good earnings growth in 2019.","Let me now turn it to Shawn to cover the financials and guidance, and I will come back later with additional comments on our business.","Shawn Vadala","Thanks Olivier. Sales were $731.4 million in the quarter, an increase of 5% in local currency. As a reminder, all growth is organic. On a U.S. dollar basis, this total sales increased 1% as currencies reduced sales growth by approximately 4% in the quarter. On slide 4, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales were 7% in both the Americas and Asia\/Rest of the World. Growth in the Americas, excluding Food Retailing, was 9%, a level we're quite pleased with.","Sales growth in Europe declined 1% in local currency and was impacted by a decline in our Product Inspection business. Absent Product Inspection, growth in Europe was up 3% in the quarter, which is quite good particularly given the 9% sales growth we had in Q1, which included some benefit from the timing of Easter holidays. Finally, China had another very strong quarter with 9% local currency sales growth.","The next slide shows year-to-date results. Local currency sales growth increased 4% in Europe during the first half of the year; 5% in the Americas; and 8% in Asia\/Rest of World. In total, sales grew 6% in the first half of 2019.","On slide 6, we outline local currency sales growth by product area. In the quarter, Laboratory sales grew 8%. Industrial increased 3% with Core Industrial up 5%, and product \u2013 while Product Inspection was down 1%. Food Retail declined 8% in the quarter. As you heard from Olivier, Food Retailing reduced our overall sales growth by 1% in the quarter. The next slide shows sales growth for the first half of the year. Laboratory sales grew 8% in local currency; Industrial grew 5%, with Core Industrial up 7% and Product Inspection up 2%. Food Retailing declined 6% during the first 6 months of the year. Overall first -- overall for the first half, total sales were up 6% in local currency, 7% if we exclude Food Retailing.","Now let me move to the rest of the P&L for the quarter, which is summarized on slide number 8. Gross margin in the quarter was 57.4%, a 20 basis points increase over the prior year level of 57.2%.","Productivity and pricing continue to be strong contributors to margin growth. Partly offsetting these positives were tariffs from the U.S.-China trade dispute and some costs associated with product launches. R&D amounted to $36.6 million, which represents a 7% increase in local currency.","SG&A amounted to $205.2 million, a 2% increase in local currency over the prior year. The increase was driven by investments in our field force, offset in part by our cost savings initiatives.","Adjusted operating profit amounted to $177.7 million in the quarter, which represents a 5% increase over the prior year amount of $169.3 million. We estimate currency reduced operating income by approximately $6 million. We also estimate the tariffs were a gross headwind to operating income by approximately $5 million. Absent adverse currency and the gross impact of tariffs, operating income would have increased 11% in the quarter.","Operating margins reached 24.3% in the quarter, a 90-basis-point growth from the prior year. We're quite pleased with this increase given the meaningful headwinds we faced in the quarter.","A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $12.3 million in the quarter, interest expense was $8.9 million in the quarter, other income amounted to $1.6 million.","Let's turn to taxes. We are lowering our effective tax rate for the full year from 20.5% to 20%. The effective tax rate in the quarter is 19.6%, which reflects the catch up for the first quarter. Our effective tax rate is before discrete items and adjusts for the timing of stock option exercises.","Moving to fully diluted shares, which amounted to 25.1 million in the quarter and is a 3% decline from the prior year reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program.","Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $5.16, an 11% increase over the prior year amount of $4.65. Absent currency and the gross impact of tariffs and adjusting for the tax rate change, our adjusted EPS growth would have been 15% in the quarter, a level we are quite pleased at.","On a reported basis in the quarter, EPS was $5.06 as compared to $4.31 in the prior year. Reported EPS includes $0.10 of purchased intangible amortization, $0.09 of restructuring and a $0.09 difference between our quarterly and annual tax rate due to timing of stock option exercises.","The next slide shows our P&L for the first half. We're quite pleased with these results, which shows a local currency sales growth of 6%, operating margin improvement of 80 basis points, and earnings growth of 11%. We're particularly pleased with these results given the meaningful headwinds we faced with adverse currency and tariff costs. That is it for the P&L and now we'll cover cash flow.","On a year-to-date basis, adjusted free cash flow amounted to $193.5 million as compared with $177.3 million in the prior period. This represents a 12% increase on a per share basis. Our working capital statistics remained solid with DSO at 39 days and ITO at 4.5 times.","Let me turn to guidance. We continue to feel very good about our ability to execute on our growth and productivity initiatives. As Olivier mentioned, with the exception of Food Retailing, demand in our markets is favorable.","We acknowledge the deteriorating macroeconomic indicators and growing uncertainty of the impact of the global economy due to trade disputes. Our outlook for the third quarter is positive as we have assumed no change to market conditions.","As we look to the fourth quarter, we will face tougher comparisons due to a very strong growth in the prior year. We're also cognizant of the uncertainty in the global economy.","We believe our business is less susceptible to an economic downturn than in the past due to the greater percentage of our sales in Laboratory and shift within our Industrial business to more attractive market segments. However, we don't believe we are immune to economic cycles and we will remain agile to adapt if necessary.","One final reminder. While the adverse impact of tariffs and currency headwinds in our business will be lower in the second half of 2019 as compared to the first half, we still estimate 2.5% earnings headwinds for the remainder of the year. For the full year, we expect adverse currency and gross tariffs to reduce EPS growth by approximately 4%.","Now let me cover the specifics. We now expect local currency sales growth in 2019 to be approximately 5%. This is a 50 basis point reduction from our previous guidance largely driven by weaker-than-expected results in Food Retailing. We expect Food Retailing to be down double-digits in Q3 and down mid to high single-digits for the full year. Our full year sales guidance excluding Food Retailing is 6% in local currency. ","We are raising the bottom-end of our range and now expect full year adjusted EPS guidance to be in the range of $22.60 to $22.75, which is a growth rate of 11% to 12%. We'll benefit from the lower tax rate and beat in Q2, which is offset in part by the slightly lower sales growth and worse currency.","With respect to the third quarter, we would expect local currency sales growth to be in the range of 4% to 5% and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.65 to $5.75, a growth rate of 10% to 12%. Absent currency and the gross impact of tariffs, EPS growth in the third quarter would be approximately 14% to 16%. Furthermore excluding Food Retailing, we would expect Q3 sales growth to be in the range of 5.5% to 6.5%.","Some final comments on guidance. With respect to the impact of currency on sales growth, we expect currency to reduce sales growth by approximately 2.5% in 2019. For the third quarter, we expect currency to reduce sales growth by approximately 2%.","That is it from my side. And I'll now turn it back to Olivier.","Olivier Filliol","Thank you Shawn. Let me start by providing some additional comments on our operating results. Our lab business continued to perform very well with 8% local currency sales growth in the quarter, which was against a good growth in the prior year. Analytical instruments, pipettes and automated chemistry did particularly well. All three regions showed good lab growth.","Our laboratory business continues to benefit from disproportionate investments in field resources, Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives and R&D investments. We expect market demand to remain favorable and expect good growth in the second half of the year. It won't be quite at the level we had in the first half, principally driven by more challenging comparisons.","In terms of our Industrial business, Product Inspection was down slightly in the quarter. This business continues to do well in Asia and we saw better growth in the Americas, but it was more than offset by a decline in our European business.","We continue to feel very good about this business over the medium-term. We would expect to see growth in the second half of the year likely in the low to mid-single-digit type range.","Core Industrial did quite well in the quarter with growth of 5% in local currency. Growth was good in all regions. We would expect continued solid growth in the third quarter in Core Industrial and then they will face particularly challenging comparisons in the fourth quarter.","Finally, Food Retail was down 8% in the quarter. This was slightly worse than we expected. This business faces challenging market demand and the timing of customer project activity, which is further impacted in that we are managing it for profitability and not for sales growth. We expect market conditions to remain challenging and this business will be down meaningfully this year.","Now let me make some additional comments by geography. I will start with Europe, which was down slightly in the quarter. Lab and Core Industrial did well particularly as they were against the tough comparisons from the year earlier period. Both products inspection and retail were down in the quarter.","For first half of the year, Europe is up 4%, a level we are very pleased with. For the second half of the year, we continue to believe Europe will be up low single digits even with retail continuing to be a drag on sales growth, particularly in Q3.","Americas had very strong growth in the quarter. Excluding Food Retailing, Americas grew 9% in the quarter. Lab had very strong growth and Product Inspection and Core Industrial had good growth as well.","For the remainder of the year, I would expect Americas to grow low to mid-single digits. Absent Food Retailing, we would expect Americas to grow mid-single digits for the full year.","Finally Asia\/Rest of the World had another quarter of strong growth. All business lines did well. China had another quarter of very good growth. Lab was again up double digits in China in the quarter while Industrial was up high single digits.","Our outlook for this region remains positive, although we would expect more moderate growth for the second half of the year due to multiyear comparisons. One final comment on the business, service had another quarter of good growth in the quarter, up 7% in local currency for both the quarter and first half of the year.","That concludes my comments on the different pieces of the business. Let me update you on our sales and marketing initiative on segment newsletters and then I will also provide some additional insights on our China business.","Segment newsletters have long been an important tool and are a core part of our Spinnaker sales and marketing approach. Our newsletters build brand awareness and showcase our industry expertise and knowledge of our customer processes. They highlight products and use case studies to discuss the trends and challenges, most relevant to specific segment.","In total, we create 27 different newsletters covering our Laboratory Process Analytics, Core Industrial and Product Inspection businesses across 18 different industry segments. These newsletters are workplace specific with content customized for decision makers such as chemist, scientists, R&D managers or production engineers.","Two editions are published each year and translated enough to 15 languages. Overall, we expect to distribute about 2.5 million copies to our customers each year. This is a good example of the unique capabilities we have developed and fine-tuned with our Spinnaker sales and marketing approach. Newsletters have proven to be an important tool to communicate with our customers and generate interest for our products.","Now let me make some additional comments on China. I've been here over the last week and a half visiting our operations, conducting senior management meetings and we had our Board meeting in the last two days. As a reminder, China is approximately 18% of our total sales. China is similar to the overall group in that we have at number one market position in vast majority of our product lines here. Our market share is similar to our global market share, however, our relative market share is higher as we compete against a greater number of smaller competitors.","I'm very happy with the team here and the progress and development of our global programs, mainly Spinnaker sales and marketing and investments in field resources. The R&D teams have also made excellent progress in new product development.","Lab now represents a little less than half of China sales, not too different than the overall company. I know that there are questions about the generics market here in China and the 4+7 initiative currently underway. A strength of our business here in China and globally is our diversification, while we do sell into the generics market, it is only one piece of our lab offering here in China.","We sell a wide range of products at relatively low price points to various customer segments in a variety of customer applications. While we may encounter weakness in one market segment we often can make up for it with strength in other segments. Central to capitalizing on this targeting under-penetrated area and shifting resources to faster growing segments.","Within Lab in China, automated chemistry is a good example of this. AutoChem in China was historically focused on academia with limited service and pricing potential. Over the last several years we have shifted to focus to pharma and chemical. We have made investments in terms of our field resources and increased our sales and marketing programs. Currently, the chemical market is particularly attractive given some recent explosions and heightened priority on safety and production and scale up.","We are able to capitalize on this demand and our AutoChem solutions are now helping to set the standard for chemical safety. This is just one small example, but I think it gives you the sense of how we approach the market and continue to shift resources to the most potential. Process Analytics in China is another example of this. They have achieved double-digit growth for many quarters by targeting and penetrating the bioproduction market.","Turning to Industrial. Historically, our business in China was more heavily weighted to Core Industrial, but this has changed over the last 10 years. Core Industrial now represents about 40% of the China sales and the mix within Core Industrial has shifted from heavier industrial end markets, such as steel, cement and others to faster-growing market such as food manufacturers, pharma and chemical.","Product Inspection is disproportionately smaller in China than the rest of the world, but the outlook is very positive as the economy continues to mature and people eat more packaged food and demand higher quality in the product. This is an excellent example of how we target under-penetrated markets.","For those of you that visited our Tampa facility last November, you had a chance to see our new mid-market X-ray instrument that we refer to as X34. The team in China has been working over the last six months to localize this instrument to reduce the cost and adapt some of the product features for local manufacturing. The results are promising and we will launch our new X34 for the Asia Pacific market in the coming weeks. Our global R&D priority on modular and reusable design was invaluable for this new product launch.","You can see from the several examples, how our growth in China is being driven from value-added industry versus infrastructure that was historically at its core. We have a very strong team in China with many years of MT experience. They have consistently demonstrated the ability to react to the aftermarket conditions that can be challenging and change quickly.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We are very pleased with our results in the quarter. While the markets in the second half may be more challenging than in the first half, we believe we can continue to gain share and deliver good earnings growth. I want to ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tycho Peterson","Hey thanks. Maybe Olivier we'll start out with product inspection. Given what we've seen from some of your industrial peers, data points haven't been great. You're talking about a back half of the year recovery. Can you maybe just talk to your confidence in Product Inspection particularly getting better in the back half of the year?","Olivier Filliol","Yes, let me comment. So, we had already good growth in Americas and Asia. And we expect solid growth in Q3 in these regions as well seeing also better spending from food manufacturers in these regions. It was really the Europe that was weak, but also against strong comparisons.","For Europe, I feel Q3 to be relatively flat, but overall, I expect low-to-mid single-digits growth this year overall. This is below our long-term trend, and it's below what I expect also here if I look a couple of years forward.","But I certainly also expect packaged food customers will return to growth. And hey, we are really, really well-positioned. We have leading positions here in multiple technologies. We see that customers combine more and more of these technologies, so-called Combitech is becoming more important. We have a unique position with our service network. So, I feel very, very good about this.","And, of course, quality control in packaged food remains something very important. And just think about all the macro trends here that help us with the growing population in Asia and American markets, changing consumer trends. So, feel good, but I recognize that in the short term, we could have expected a little bit more.","Tycho Peterson","And then I guess as a follow-up if we think about just your Industrial business more broadly can you talk to leverage you can pull if the macro continues to deteriorate? And then the guidance reduction seems mainly on the tariff front. Obviously, there's another 10% tariff coming our today, I assume that wasn't factored in, but how should we think about the impact of that? I know it's a little bit soon.","Shawn Vadala","Hey Tycho, this is Shawn maybe I'll answer the second part of the question. In terms of the tariff that came out today, that one has very little impact on our business. As a reminder, more than 90% of our imports from China are already subject to a tariff. So, if we kind of like look at the last piece, it's probably on a gross basis, it's probably like $0.5 million a year on an annualized basis.","Olivier Filliol","Back to the Core Industrial, I think we had actually really good growth across all the regions, another one in Q2, but actually for the whole first half. That reflects solid market conditions. But I want also to remind ourselves, as long as the economy is good enough, we feel actually -- we can actually drive replacement business we can go for market share gain.","Our segment marketing here helps really very nicely because we can go after the industry segments that have good growth potential. I certainly also feel that the team is executing very nicely. We have very good momentum in the Spinnaker initiatives.","So, I expect for 2019 year, mid-single-digit growth. Good growth for this business, although a little lower than what we had in the last two years mainly due to strong comparisons especially in Q4. We're going to have very strong comparisons coming up.","But in terms of how we're performing, I feel good. And also as a reminder, the key industry segments that we serve here are a little bit less exposed to the economic cycles.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan from UBS. Your line is open.","Dan Brennan","Thanks for taking the question. Olivier, back to China if you don't mind. One of your peers, Sartorius, obviously discussed slower lab formation in China. I'm just wondering it sounds like things are -- remain very robust for you there. But maybe can you discuss your lab business in China. And is there anything on that front that you're seeing?","Olivier Filliol","Hey, very happy how the lab business has been performing in China in the last couple of quarters. And I had a deep dive into the lab business also last Friday when I met our market organization team. I feel we are executing very well, and I see really the team to go after the many opportunities that are around.","Now, what's helping here of course is our lab business serves a broad range of end-user industries, a lot of different applications. And the price points of our solutions are at the low end. And so it's -- yes, we don't see a slowdown here. I think rather we have the comparisons topics in the terms that multiyear, we had really good growth. But absent of that, I feel really very, very good.","And all these programs that we have in place, the Chinese team is executing very well on it.","Dan Brennan","Got it. And then, -- thanks Olivier. And then maybe just one other just related to China. I know a few of the peers, and I figured that Tycho already addressed this, but a few of the peers have discussed how the government there seems to be trying to favor non-U. S. players in certain areas, and I'm not sure if it relates to any of your businesses. But is that something -- I know you've been in the country for 30 years, and all your managers are local, so you're kind of part of the local fabric there. But is that something that you're seeing at all? Or is that something that could pop up and impact you? Thank you.","Olivier Filliol","Yeah. Valid question, but really -- we have -- we don't see any of that, and we talked about that. And one of the reason is what you just said, 13 years in China. We are viewed as a local company. We have such a big presence. We have local management team. We have been around for so long. The Mettler-Toledo brand is viewed as a local brand, local company.","And then first also, because the big majority of the products that we sell are locally manufactured, and we -- the big remaining part of imported products come from Switzerland. And we have hardly any products coming from U.S. So, it's for us. It's a non-topic. And we -- again, we are viewed here in a very good way. So, yeah happy to report on that one.","Dan Brennan","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Mike Ryskin","Hey. This is Mike on for Derik. Thanks for taking the question. I want to talk about the -- you called out another robust quarter for service in the quarter. Anything in particular that stands out? It seems like it's just been a very wrong -- very long runway there. So wondering how the dynamics there play into the guide.","And then a follow-up was going to be on the pacing of 3Q to 4Q. You gave a lot of comments on your expectations for Food Retail and slowdown there, but even sort of if you backed that out, it looks like slightly more moderate expectations for the second half. I know part of that you talked to the general uncertainty in the macro and Industrial. Just curious if there's anything more specific on that or if it's just general caution.","Olivier Filliol","Yeah. Okay. Let me take the first part, and then Shawn will general address the second part. So service, yes indeed, very good performance here that we have now performed many quarters. We have shared with you our strategies on service. We are very focused on executing on that one. It's something that we have global programs that we are executing across all the businesses. And really every country is involved. I see also pretty much every country with very solid service growth.","And as a reminder, service is today about 23% of our sales. We had the 7% growth in Q2 as well as year-to-date. And I -- my expectation is that we're going to continue to grow above group average with service. We have these programs that have many more years to go. We are far from being saturated on that one. And there are also different markets where we are kind of at the beginning of the journey. I would include also China where we have solid growth in the last couple of quarters. But, when you look at the percentage of service in total, there's more room to go.","And I would also add one additional associated business and that's the consumable business. That's also one that we are very focused on. I sometimes also look at service and consumables together, which is today about a third of our business. That one if combined, we had even better growth than service. So again, very happy how we performed on that, and services is very much also an execution topic. And you need to be on top of all the tactical aspects of that, and we do well on this.","Shawn Vadala","Yeah. Mike in terms of the other part of your question. We don't see any particular changes between Q3 and Q4 in terms of moderation in the business. But the one thing I would maybe highlight to you is that we do face a very difficult and challenging comparison in the fourth quarter of last year. Overall, we were up 8%. But in particular our core Industrial business was up 13% in Q4 of last year. And also Europe had a pretty strong number too. So that's maybe just a comparison topic.","Mike Ryskin","Got it. Appreciate that. Thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Your line is now open. Mr. Willoughby, your line is now open. You may now ask your question.","Steve Willoughby","Can you hear me now?","Shawn Vadala","Yeah, we can. Hey, Steve.","Steve Willoughby","Okay. Sorry about that. Good morning. Shawn, I believe if I heard you correctly, you said that you're assuming FX and tariffs to be a negative 4% headwind now. And I had it down for -- you're saying that was negative 4.5% before and so I\u2019m just trying to figure out the moving pieces between your old guidance and your new guidance and how that all settles out? And then I just have one quick follow-up.","Shawn Vadala","Yeah. Hey, Steve it might be more of a rounding topic. I'm not seeing any particular changes in terms of like the tariffs versus what we talked about before. And if anything the FX is modestly a little bit worse than the last time we spoke.","Steve Willoughby","Okay. And then just double checking here. Shawn, at the end of your prepared comments you'd mentioned that you're not assuming any change in market conditions. But then near the end of Olivier's commentsm he commented about how the markets are more challenging in the second half than the first half. So how are you -- what are you assuming in terms of the overlying and underlying end markets overall?","Shawn Vadala","Yeah. Hey we continue to feel very good about our execution. And what we're seeing in our business is, of course, it's always hard to look out beyond the quarter in front of us. Right now when we look at our bottoms-up submissions from our units, we feel good about our Q3 guidance. I mean especially if you exclude Food Retailing.","So at this time, we don't feel like we need to build in any particular anticipated slowdown in the fourth quarter. But we also tried to be transparent with -- we fully acknowledge that there are uncertainties out there in terms of moderating economic statistics, the trade tariff dispute, which is obviously a very dynamic situation, which back to Tycho's question the direct impact on our business is very insignificant. But with this announcement what impact that may have on the global economy is probably a bigger question.","Steve Willoughby","Sure. All right, thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mr. Steve Beuchaw from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Steve Beuchaw","Hi thanks for the time here, and thanks for the questions as well. I'll ask two. One, I actually want to revisit a topic that was -- you touched on very briefly later but I wonder if you could give us a bit more detail on it. And that is you mentioned in your prepared remarks that in the event that the environment were to become more challenging there are steps that you can take to offset those headwinds in terms of -- I believe your implication was the earnings power of the company. So it would be helpful to know what those steps might be and how big an impact do you think you could have if the macro does get worse.","My second question actually relates to food specifically. I appreciate that some of what's going on in food is in Europe but it sounds like in food the U.S. is also a little tougher. Be really helpful to understand thematically why it is that food has gotten so much tougher here relative to your expectations coming into the year. And what would you recommend that we keep an eye on as we try to diligence and keep an eye on what's going on with the pulse of that particular segment of the revenue stack? Thanks so much.","Olivier Filliol","Let me start and then Shawn will add flavor to this. So in terms of how we can react, if the economy changes or the market changes. So foremost that I would highlight is this flexibility that we have how we can allocate resources. We have programs in place and we have a strong tool set that allows us to go after the pockets of growth in the markets that exist particularly around segment marketing. We can guide our sales force to visit a certain type of customers by segments. And we can drive this also to our leads generation program. And then we have shown also in the past that we are quite agile in shifting resources from one business to the other. So that's one avenue that we always leverage.","And the second one is, of course, we implement a discipline in our cost structure. And this is not certainly something that we also have a good track record and we have this agility in the system. Yeah, I think that's the core that I would give. And, of course, we monitor the markets very cautiously and try to anticipate these things and it very much depends how severe it is. And the very high diversification that we have in our business helps us tremendously.","As you can imagine we have a huge diversification by country and we have a huge diversification by business and the end-user industry and that comes to a big advantage to us.","Shawn Vadala","Yeah. Hey Steve I wouldn't add anything to what Olivier said, other than he implies that we also tailor our actions to the situation. And so we leverage these programs. We're constantly looking for productivity gains and we'll adapt if necessary.","Olivier Filliol","The second part was the Food Retailing. Here as a reminder for -- we always said we run our Food Retailing business for profit and not for growth. It's -- we call it kind of noncore to us in these terms. I'm very committed to the business but it is a business that is below group average in terms of profitability. And so we have always managed that way including also in recent quarters where we have taken some steps to reduce the complexity in the business. We have taken some step also to take some cost out of the business. And so that's one effect that we have.","But the second effect which is even bigger is that the whole Food Retailing market is lumpy and it's certainly also impacted by changes going on. And we see here this year a bigger downturn than we expected. And we are not trying to fight that, but rather actually adjust to it again in terms of measures that we are taking. I'm not particularly worried about it in terms of from a strategic standpoint and from my group -- or a business franchise. We are comfortable with that. But of course, it hurts our top line numbers. But this is more for Q3 and the year. As for next year, I'm not that pessimistic at all.","Steve Beuchaw","Okay. Really appreciate that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Patrick Donnelly","Great. Thanks. Maybe one for Olivier. I know it's been asked a few different ways, but just on the Industrials the Core Industrial's outlook. Obviously, we've seen a bunch of mixed data points, particularly even in the space. Can you just talk through I guess your visibility into the back half confidence level maybe even by geography how you're feeling about that market overall?","Olivier Filliol","Yes. If I look at our performance year-to-date, it has been really strong in all regions and not only here in Q2, but really for the whole first half. We feel that we have good enough market conditions in pretty much all the areas of the world. I feel strong execution from the team. And so for the whole 2019 I expect mid single-digit growth. The -- here also in Q3 where we have good visibility, I feel really good. But want to be cautious about Q4 just because of the comparisons. We are going to face a much stronger comparison here in Q4. That's the main reason.","Then I would also highlight here what I said at previous occasions or in the context also of China for Industrial, we serve a very broad base of end-customer segments. We can apply segment marketing to also guide our sales force to the most promising applications in the industry even if some end-user industry would be hit more strongly by a tentative economic slowdown.","Patrick Donnelly","Okay. And then maybe just one more just on the Americas. That continues to be a source of strength for you guys. Can you just parse out what segment has been particularly strong here? And then the outlook I think you said mid single-digits ex Food. Could there be upside there? And what would be the upside levers?","Olivier Filliol","So indeed very happy with the performance year-to-date and certainly also in Q2. The lab continued to do particularly well. We had good strength in our product offering. The investment in field resources pays off very nicely. Industrial was also solid here. Core Industrial as well as Product Inspection was nicely up in the quarter. And I expect solid growth in this business also here in Q3. The one that was down was retail that was significantly down. And I expect also Q3 retail would be down again. But otherwise, yes feel very good about the execution. The team did very well. Our program -- sales and marketing programs show great fruits here in that region.","Patrick Donnelly","Thanks. Olivier.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Baird. Your line is open.","Richard Eastman","Yes, good afternoon. Could you just maybe Shawn, just give us a snapshot here of how pricing was in the second quarter? And then the cadence of price increases last year in 2018 if I -- I think I have this kind of noted properly, but it would seem that pricing might be a little bit more challenged year-over-year in the back half of the year. I mean, would be plus 1% to 2% in the back half of the year?","Shawn Vadala","No...","Richard Eastman","No?","Shawn Vadala","Well I fully agree that pricing will be more difficult in the back half. And Rick that's also consistent with what we've been saying in our public commentary as well. And this is very much related to like you said the timing of the significant midyear price increases that we've put in place last year. I'd say it might be more like the 1.5% to 2% range in the back half of the year. And then maybe just to respond to the first part of your question I mean the program -- the execution around the world in the program is really fantastic at the moment. I feel very good about it. We're in the -- we probably did 2.5% or so in Q2 and I feel very good about how we're executing around the world.","Richard Eastman","Okay. And then also Olivier within the Lab segment, you're kind of underexposed so to speak to a lot of the industrial process markets. But you do have some chemical exposure there maybe petrochem exposure, just any inflection or just change in trends within lab that you might associate to those more industrial-oriented markets.","Olivier Filliol","No particular that I would highlight. I think here again this diversification plays a role. And even in -- within the chemical industry, there are so many subsegments from fine chemicals over to bulk chemicals and everything. We have different applications. On the prepared remarks, I highlighted for example the China dynamic where we are benefiting from a heightened focus on safety due to all these explosions that is triggering additional demands for us in the chemical industry particular for automated chemistry, partially also for material characterization and process analytics. So, while you might have one segment that is maybe a little bit down for example the chemical industry, that is also serving the automotive world, but then you have other segments that are up. All-in-all, we see the chemical industry still being good for us and I expect it to stay that way.","Richard Eastman","Okay, okay. And just the last question for me. Is there any color you could shed -- you could provide on maybe the M&A pipeline? Is there a few things in there? Or is there anything active? How do you approach that these days just kind of keep refreshing it? But maybe you can give us some thoughts there.","Olivier Filliol","Yes, yes. No problem Ric. Hey very consistent on that one. It's -- the way we look at it the way we approach it is very much from my strategic standpoint. We are focused on adjacencies that fit the strategy where we have important synergies. We don't need an additional leg. We certainly feel we are well diversified already. We have a very strong franchise. We don't need an additional leg. What we want is to acquire companies where we can add value and we add value for our customer solutions.","And so the targets that we have are typically bolt-on opportunities in particular Lab Product Inspection area. We have -- if you look back, we have done a few acquisitions with Biotix and Troemner. And I would rather -- our target universe would be that kind of company. But it's not that we have something here just around the corner. I think these are very much dependent on the availability of such companies. It's -- and the -- what I also want to add, we are very disciplined when it comes to valuation. We always have and we will also continue to be. And yes, so I expect us in the couple of next years to continue to pursue that strategy. Yes, I think that fits well. And while we welcome M&A, it's not a must and it's not -- yes, we are very focused on this organic growth story.","Richard Eastman","Okay, very good. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Jason Rodgers from Great Lakes Review. Your line is open. Excuse me Mr. Jason Rodgers, your line is open.","Jason Rodgers","Can you hear me now? Hello?","Shawn Vadala","Yes, we can.","Jason Rodgers","Okay. Thanks. China, I might have missed it, but did you give expectations for growth in the second half of the year?","Shawn Vadala","Yes, we're looking at mid to high single-digit growth for the second half with good growth both in our Laboratory and Industrial businesses.","Jason Rodgers","And then looking at Europe, the expected improvement that you're looking for in the second half, is that primarily from better results you're expecting in Product Inspection and the slightly easier comps? Or are you looking for some type of improvement economically in that region?","Shawn Vadala","Yes. I think the best way to probably look at Europe is on a year-to-date basis. We have this Easter timing topic that we talked about in the first quarter. So, on a year-to-date basis, Europe is plus 4%. For the second half of the year, we're probably like low to mid-single digit, but it's going to have a little bit of this retail effect. If you exclude retail, we're probably more in the mid-single-digit range. So, we're not expecting any particular changes in the second half. We're kind of assuming that the economy continues to be good enough for people to stick to their replacement cycles. And as we look at the third quarter outlook from our organization, we kind of feel good about what we're seeing in the execution in our business.","Jason Rodgers","And then moving on to the Field Turbo program is 200 -- is that still the figure for the planned additions for the year? And any issue in finding qualified candidates there?","Olivier Filliol","Believe me I have more proposals that I can approve just because I think it's a good process to always be selective and go for the most attractive one. As a reminder, this is kind of a bottom-up top-down review process and we continue to have very good opportunities. But we also review the opportunities in the context of how we reach the economic -- the economy and in particular also when it comes to countries and industry segments or business lines.","I feel good about the projects around Turbo that are already approved. And Shawn and I will be on our annual budget around here in the coming weeks and that will be certainly also a topic that we will further review. But I feel good about the program and we are still in the investment mode.","Jason Rodgers","And then lastly, any change to the share repurchase expectations for the year? I think $745 million was the last number given.","Shawn Vadala","No, changes at all. No.","Jason Rodgers","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brandon Couillard","Thanks. Good afternoon. Shawn, sorry if I missed this. But could you just help us with the gross margin bridge year-over-year between the components of currency pricing and the tariffs?","Shawn Vadala","Yeah, sure Brandon. So as I mentioned before pricing was good in the quarter up about 2.5%. That had an effect of positive 100 basis points to the margin. Kind of offsetting that was the gross impact of tariffs, which was about 50 basis points. And then we had a variety of things kind of going both ways to make up the bridge.","Brandon Couillard","Super. And then just an update on net interest and other expense for the year.","Shawn Vadala","Sure. So interest expense for the year, we'll have Mary double check for you. $139 million for the year. Oh, I'm sorry, sorry, sorry. Looking at the wrong line\u2026","Mary Finnegan","37.","Shawn Vadala","30 -- oh, sorry. $37 million. Yeah, $37 million for the year. And what was your other question?","Brandon Couillard","I guess just net interest and other kind of all rolled up together.","Shawn Vadala","Okay. And then other would be about $4.5 million. And that would be income by the way.","Brandon Couillard","Okay. Super. Thank you.","Shawn Vadala","Yeah.","Operator","As there are no further question at this time, you may continue speakers.","Mary Finnegan","Thank you. Thanks Maria. Hey, thanks everyone for joining us this evening. As always, if you have any questions just let us know. Hey, we are in China, so probably the easiest way to get a hold of me or us is through email, but we're happy to get back to you. Take care everyone.

I'm happy that you're joining us this evening.","I am joined tonight by Olivier Filliol, our CEO; and Bill Donnelly, our Executive Vice President. I need to cover just a couple administrative matters. The call is being webcast and is available for replay on our website. A copy of the press release and the presentation that we\u2019ll refer to on today's call is also available on our website.","Let me summarize the Safe Harbor language, which we have on page two of the presentation.

On today's call, we may use non-GAAP financial measures. More detailed information with respect to the differences between the non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided in the Form 8-K.","I'll now turn the call over to Olivier.","Olivier Filliol","Thank you, Mary, and welcome to everyone on the call. I will start with a summary of the quarter and then Bill will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments before we open the lines for Q&A.","The highlights for the quarter are on page three of the presentation. Local currency sales growth was 6% in the quarter and better than we expected. We continue to generate very solid growth in the America. Asia\/Rest of the World including China had very good growth. Europe growth was solid.","With the benefit of our margin and cost initiatives we had good growth in margins which contributed to excellent growth in earnings per share. Cash flow was also strong in the quarter. We are very happy with our performance as well our outlook for the remainder of the year.","We will cover this shortly, but let me now turn it to Bill to cover the numbers.","William Donnelly","Thanks, Olivier and hello everybody. Sales were $608.3 million in the quarter and that's an increase of 6% in local currency. On the U.S. dollar basis sales increased by 5% as currencies reduced sales by about 1% in the quarter.","On slide number four we show local currency sales growth for the quarter. Sales grew by 6% in the Americas, 4% in Europe and 8% in Asia\/Rest of World. On the next slide we show local currency sales growth of 5%. On a year-to-date basis that includes the Americas at 6%, Europe at 2% and Asia\/Rest of World has increased 6% in the first half.","Starting on page -- slide number six we will outline sales by product area. Laboratory had very good growth, with local currency sales of 10%. Industrial increased by 3% and Food Retailing declined by 2%. All these comparisons are forced to the prior year.","And the next slide you'll see our year-to-date sales summary by product lines. Lab has grown 7% in the first half. Industrial 3% and Food Retailing increased by 1%.","Now I'd like to turn to slide number eight and walk through the rest of the P&L. Our gross margins were 57.1%, that's a 160 basis points improvement over the prior year amount of 55.5%. We are very happy with the strong performance in the quarter. And on a year-to-date basis, our gross margins have increased in line with the expectations we had for expansion for the full year. ","Pricing material costs and mixed off contributed to the increase in the quarter and was partly offset by some additional targeted investments in our Service business. Currency had no impact on gross margins in the quarter.","R&D amounted to $30.7 million in the quarter and that's a 5% increase in local currency. SG&A was $187.8 million, that's a 9% increase in local currency over the prior year. Investment in our Field Turbo program and higher variable comp were offset in part by cost-saving initiatives.","Adjusted operating income was $129.1 million in the quarter, that's a 9% increase over the prior year amount of $118.3 million. Currency reduced operating profit by approximately $800,000 in the quarter. Adjusted operating profit margins were 21.2%, a 90 basis points increase over the prior year and, of course, a level of which we are pleased with.","A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization was $8.7 million in the quarter, while interest expense was $6.9 million. Our effective tax rate was 24%. You'll notice our reported tax rate was lower at 22.9% which is due to the tax impact of the one-time pension charge which I'll cover in a minute. ","Fully diluted shares for the quarter were 27.1 million, which is a 4.6% decline from the prior-year amount and reflects the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted earnings per share was $3.22 per share; that's a 15% increase over the prior year amount of $2.80 per share. On a reported basis earnings per share were $2.93 per share as compared to $2.73 per share.","As we mentioned on our last call, during the quarter we took a one-time non-cash pension settlement charge of $8 million before tax, or $0.19 per share after-tax. This relates to offering former employees of our U.S. plan a lump sum payout. The plan that we're talking about is frozen and the timing was advantageous to cash out the vested portion for these former employees. There is no cash flow impact to the company as we used pension plan assets to fund the payments. Reported EPS also includes $0.04 of purchased intangible amortization and $0.06 of restructuring charges.","The next slide shows the P&L for the first half of the year. We had local currency sales growth of 5%, operating income increased by 7%, and adjusted earnings per share increased by 12%. Absent currencies, growth for the first half of the year would have been 14%.","Now turning to cash flow. In the quarter, free cash flow was $108.9 million, which compares to $89.9 million in prior year. We're pleased with our working capital management and achieved further improvements in DSO, which was reduced by two days to 38 days as compared to the prior-year. ITO was 4.6 turns, cash flow for the six months was $138 million as compared to a $131.3 million in the prior year.","In the third quarter we expect to complete the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of business called Troemner, which is focused in two areas: weights and weight calibration, as well as the manufacturing of basic lab equipment. We paid approximately 10 times EBITDA for the business and it should add about 1% to the sales on a full-year basis. It is a unique strategic fit with our business, and we're very happy to be able to close the business shortly. Olivier will provide some additional background on Troemner shortly.","Now let's turn to guidance. We're raising our full-year local currency sales guidance to approximately 5% versus 4% previously. We estimate that Troemner will contribute about 50 basis points of sales growth for the half year, so for 2016. But to say it differently, we raised our organic growth expectations for the full year by 50 basis points to approximately 4.5%. We have also raised our EPS guidance and now expect adjusted EPS to be in a range of $14.40 per to $14.50 per share, which represents a growth rate of 11% to 12%. This compares to previous guidance of 10% to 11% EPS growth or $14.25 per share to $14.35 per share. We're raising the midpoint of our guidance by $0.15 to reflect our strong performance as well as the acquisition of Troemner.","With respect to the third quarter, we expect local currency sales growth between 5% and 6%. This includes about 75 basis points of growth from Troemner. We assume adjusted EPS will be in the range of $3.65 per share to $3.70 per share, which is a growth rate of 12% to 13%. In terms of currency, let me first comment on sales growth. We would expect currencies to reduce sales growth by approximately 2% in the third quarter and 2% for the full year. In terms of the impact of currency and EPS, we do not expect it to have a meaningful impact on Q3 or for the full year.","That's it from my side, and I now want to turn it back to Olivier.","Olivier Filliol","Thanks, Bill. Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lad had very good growth in the quarter with 10% increases. Pipettes, analytical instruments, and process analytics had an excellent growth with balances and auto chem also had good growth. Growth was strong across all regions and reflects our robust product pipeline, benefit of Field Turbo investment and continued strong sales and marketing program. Spending by our biopharma customers continues to be very favorable.","Industrial increased 3% in the quarter driven by a 6% increase in Core Industrial. Growth in Core Industrial was particularly strong in the Americas which benefited from some projects activity in transportation and logistics. We also have growth in Core Industrial in Europe and Asia including China. ","Product Inspection was down slightly in the quarter. This business continues to perform well, but was impacted by timing of some activity and the strong comparison from the prior year. Product Inspection had strong order growth in the quarter and we expect good sales growth in Q3.","Finally, sales declines 2% in the Retail. This was pretty much as expected. We have growth in Europe and Asia, but decline in the Americas against good growth in the prior year.","Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales growth in the Americas continues to be very solid with 6% growth. We have very good growth in Lab and Industrial, while sales declined in Retail.","Demand continues to be solid in the Americas, but tougher comps will impact the second half. Europe grew 4% in quarter, an improvement over the first quarter which we think was in part due to timing of Easter holidays. Lab have excellent growth in Europe, while Core Industrial and Retail also grew. Product Inspection was down which was improved in the quarter.","Asia\/Rest of the World had growth of 8% in the quarter. China did very well and better than we expected as compared to the last time we spoke. Lab growth in China was double-digits with almost all product lines showing very good growth.","We are pleased with performance which reflect some improving demand, also the benefit of our actions to reduce -- redirect resources to fast-growing market segments. While Industrial in China had modest growth, the fact is that overcapacity in industrial manufacturing sector remain. But we also pleased with our results in China we expect growth in the second half to be in the mid single-digit range. ","Let me make some comments on Service which grew 5% in the quarter. And on a year-to-date basis, Service represent about 23% of total sales and it is a key competitive advantage and an important source of revenue growth. This is the fifth year in a row which Service growth is outpacing Product growth. Although, this might not occur each and every quarter, over the medium term we expect Service growth to exceed Product growth.","We have a service force of approximately 2,600 personnel which is by far larger than our direct competitive. Our Service team is specialized by-product area and we have made significant investments including training of tools which supports the daily activity. ","Core to our Service growth strategy is increasing the percentage of our installed base on the service contract and increasing the amount of service sold at a point of product sales. The long-term objective is to change the mix of our Service business to be largely contract business versus rate fix. Today contract represent approximately one-third of our Service sales. There are several reasons why this migration is a strategic imperative including the increasing quality of our products reducing the need to repair contract work -- sorry -- and all the other hand contract work is more easily planned and therefore our technicians can be more productive. And finally, our studies show that service contract leads to higher levels of customer satisfaction, and therefore [indiscernible]. ","The globalization and harmonization of our service offering which we have took several years ago led the groundwork to drive the contract business. Our marketing campaign under the Spinnaker initiative and our Field Turbo investment are helping to drive this change. Overall, we continue to make very good progress. We believe Service is one of our most important competitive advantage and could to continue to be an important source of sales and profit growth.","Those are all my comments on business trends. I now want to provide some context to our acquisition of Troemner. Located in the Philadelphia area, Troemner is the U.S. market leader for weights and weight calibration and the great strategic fit to our leadership position in Europe.","Together, we are now the global leader in this niche market. Weight and weight calibration services is an attractive market. It has strong barriers to entry as it requires very specialized know-how and expertise. We have 14 calibration labs worldwide, and the acquisition of Troemner firmly positioned as the U.S. market leader. Troemner is very strong brand in U.S. based on its world-class metrology competence and solid infrastructure.","Service, which consists primarily of weight calibration, is almost 20% of Troemner\u2019s business and growing quite well. This is an attractive business, as customers must calibrate weight on a regular basis and one in very few players have the expertise to do it correctly. This is a good example of the kind of service business that fits well into our goal and of moving our service business to more contract value-added service.","Troemner is also a provider of basic lab products such as [indiscernible] mixers and shakers, which will be a good strategic fit to Ohaus offering. As a reminder, Ohaus is our second brand used for indirect distributions for laboratory product and certain industrial weighing products. Troemner will help us strengthen the life science portfolio for Ohaus, which we have worked to expand over the last few years, in terms of channel presence and product portfolio. We also believe we can further extend this equipment offering internationally, particularly in emerging markets. We think this is a great opportunity to extend the offering of Ohaus.","Troemner would add about 1% to sales goals, with similar margins to our own. We anticipate synergy potential from top line growth as well as potential in operational synergies. We expect to complete the acquisition shortly and have already begun integration plan. We believe this is a solid strategic acquisition and are excited about the potential development in this attractive market segment.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We have kept our comments brief, as we will see many of you tomorrow at our investor meeting. Let me make some summary comments before opening it up for questions. We are very pleased with strong results in the second quarter. Our outlook for the remainder of the year is good, but we acknowledge the uncertainty in the global economy.","Our focus remains on factors we can control, viz. successful execution of our initiatives. We feel very good about our new product launches, Field Turbo investment, Spinnaker marketing initiative and productivity measures. We believe with continued strong execution we can continue to gain share.","I want now to ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Michael Ryskin","Hi. It\u2019s actually Michael Ryskin on the line for Derik. I want to say congrats on the strong quarter and the Troemner acquisition. A couple of quick questions. The strength in the lab was a little bit better than we expected, obviously. It is coming off a little bit of weaker comps per year, but is that something that was strongly affected by that, or is this something you\u2019re seeing operationally, and how do you feel about your ability to carry that double-digit growth, going forward?","William Donnelly","So you\u2019re right. It was modestly easier comp so in Q1 of 2015, we grew by about 8% and in Q2 of 2015 we grew by about 5%, and then last quarter we grew 5% on the 8%, so about 13% two-year growth, and now the 10% would imply 15% two-year growth and a slight therefore acceleration in the two-year growth. If we look out to the next quarter, the comp will be 7%. So I think our view is that lab will grow well. The two-year growth rate will continue in a similar kind of range to what we have on a year-to-date basis, and specifically in terms of the end-market as Olivier mentioned biopharma spending is good. It should continue to be good, but you know comps [ph] matter of it.","Michael Ryskin","Yeah, nothing a substantial difference, not to your run rate there.","William Donnelly","That's substantial. And I think it could probably be explained by a larger order here or there.","Michael Ryskin","Okay. That's helpful. And in terms of the gross margins sort of similar question, you mentioned that, you know, it was mostly flat in 1Q, but you had the strong 160 basis points improvement this quarter. Is this -- was it mostly just making up for some weakness you had in 1Q, you mentioned pricing material costs, the 50 basis improvement going forward. Is that still in play for future quarters?","William Donnelly","Yeah, I think -- so we're at I think it\u2019s 80-plus on a year-to-date basis and that might be a little bit more than we would expect in Q3 and Q4 but still something probably north of the 50 basis points in Q3 and Q4. As we mentioned on the last call we really just had a very tough comp vis-\u00e0-vis Q1 of year ago on our gross profit margin. It was by far the biggest year-on-year increase that we had our year-end. And so I think kind of work themselves out on year-to-date basis in terms of the expense so we feel that the gross profit margin expansion that you guys have got used to should continue now.","Michael Ryskin","All right. Thanks. I will get back in the queue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Knight from Janney Montgomery. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, guys. This is actually Phil on behalf of Paul. I just have one question. You were kind of highlighting Services and Products, if you maybe could just by either by segment or by geography kind of where are you seeing strengths for each of those. There's any anomalies in terms of growth of demand. Thanks. ","Olivier Filliol","So if I take it by geography actually I will talk with the performance across the geography. But what I would highlight as particular nice is that we in Asia Services going very nicely. China had actually good growth of multiple quarters despite the product range [indiscernible] and the Services are growing that had a good reflects that our initiative have actually real impact and then we capitalize that growth. A highlight of the perfect market of age, of course, our penetration attach the place of Service is higher in mature markets and seeing us and catch up in emerging market side.","If we talk about business segment particularly with ionized product where Service is going very nicely over the last couple of quarters and in terms of profitability but also pretty benefit is this particularly for us is Services increasingly across all the business, Products in particular. So that's probably benefit of the flavor that it would get [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is [indiscernible] in for Ross, actually on his way out to see you guys. Congrats on a good quarter. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about your services investments that you've been making a lot of the you know and how that's impacting the sales line in terms of -- you know how do you think about the payback for those investments and how does that get address you know show you evidence that confidence in the revenue line trajectory? Thanks.","Olivier Filliol","So we used the term Field Turbo and we have found on to weight this field additions have very project oriented in the sense that we really drilled out on the business story that the business line look and where we have these opportunities with good pay back. And what we do is we monitor actually the progress of these. So we monitor on one hand the implementation of it, are we successful in recruiting, onboarding, building up the pipeline and all the things. I'm very happy with how it\u2019s going. We do kind of [indiscernible] support for that. We need to [indiscernible]. But then when it comes to the financial results, of course, it\u2019s a little bit more difficult to isolate, but we have also dashboard behind us where we look at are we successfully outgrowing across the group average. Where we [indiscernible] and there is a very nice correlation between [indiscernible] where we are accelerating our growth.","So I really feel good about it. Definitely [indiscernible] reflects in our results that this is paying off. We were talking about service before. Service is also an area where we did very positive addition [indiscernible] sales or services. We use like telesales and dedicated service and sales resources for service and [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","Great. And then just one quick follow-up. Do you have any worries about any industrial softness or purchasing delays in Eastern Europe post Brexit? Thanks.","Olivier Filliol","Not really. I think actually overall the industrial business is not too great [indiscernible]. I don't see anything get worse at all. On the contrary we could see very gradually things getting better and in Europe overall I expect that within the next few quarters we will be reasonably good. So the Brexit effect I am not saying it\u2019s positive, but it's also not particularly negative. [indiscernible] with one exception, U.K. itself. But we need to [indiscernible] U.K. is a [indiscernible] percent of our total revenue. U.K. had already some softness before Brexit. I would associated some of the softness with the uncertainty and certainly after the whole uncertainty [indiscernible] further up and we will expect some further softness in U.K.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. That was super-helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Isaac Ro","Hi, guys. Thank you. Just the first question on regional performance. On Europe you mentioned the 4% growth that was helped by [indiscernible]. If you back that out, just wondering if there was another effect there in terms of market share or something else that would have allowed you to grow faster than the actual market?","William Donnelly","I think it's sometimes difficult to point specifically to market share gains. I think if we look in our lab in particular within one quarter, Isaac, but if we look at how we\u2019re performing in lab and product inspection, I would say those are two categories that we would view ourselves doing very well competitively and very well specifically in Europe. As a reminder, Europe is the place where we have the largest percentage of direct sales. And so many of our [indiscernible] initiatives are often most fruitful there.","Isaac Ro","Got it. And then on the acquisition, I was just trying to put together some of the numbers you gave us. I think you mentioned 50 basis points contribution in the back half. Curious if you can give us a little sense of that number, what it assumes in terms of timing of deal closed in the third quarter, just so we get a sense of like the annualized impact? And then as part of that, just wondering, I don't think you mentioned how the revenues will be allocated between lab and industrial. I apologize if I missed that.","William Donnelly","Okay. So a couple questions. So on an annualized basis, it's [indiscernible] about 1% of sales, and then we're assuming it's going to close in the next couple of weeks. And it's at 1% on an annualized basis [indiscernible] by a week or two I think. That won\u2019t make a material difference. And then the nature of the business would be that the vast majority of it will be inside the lab business.","Isaac Ro","Got it. Thanks very much. Sorry to miss the event.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of an Dan Arias from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst","Hi, guys. This is actually [indiscernible] behalf of Dan. I just wanted to take a step back just given the macro shift that we saw at least in terms of -- I'm surprised that over the last few weeks and kind of get an update on your view of how you guys think of the structure of your business. I remember last year when we use the tag Swiss franc conversations are being had as to whether or not you guys would shift from your cost to the euro dollars versus Swiss franc just kind of want to get an update on that in light of needs whether anything is fundamentally changed.","Olivier Filliol","Yeah regarding Switzerland note currently it\u2019s actually didn't move particular it's worth make a difference and Swiss matters was something that we initiated with a multiyear plan and we are progressing very well on that plan and I am very happy with the progress that we're making.","The currency moves that took place is impacting our producing organization in U.K. As we might know we have for the Product Inspection we have the metal detection at the x-rays production there this is an attempt a favorable for us, but it will not change something to our global manufacturing strategy or output. So I don't see that this will impact our strategy in any significant way.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. No fundamental change you're hedging strategies either.","Olivier Filliol","In terms of hedging, no. ","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And I guess another one for me is the incremental margin in 2Q I have at right a little bit north 30% kind of in line what we have seen over the last few years and little bit higher Q-o-Q. Just surprised given the 6% organic I know you guys have prioritized some investments that would be net dilutive. Just kind of want to get a sense of how you guys looking at incremental margins going forward especially in the context of you know kind of a 3% to 4% growth and north and south of that where you think it can go on the incremental basis.","William Donnelly","Yeah, so maybe a little bit of clarification in terms of the incremental margin I think at least the way we calculated it it's the 31% in were measured in actual dollars, but it's actually about 34%, 35% in constant currency, so probably closer to maybe what you would expect it. And then those included in there was a bid asset catch up and made investment to incentive payment in terms of our SG&A increase. And so we did trigger some reevaluation of where we expect to finish at the end of the [indiscernible] target.","And maybe a last point would be along the lines when we were talking about for a while is that we do like the effectiveness to date in the Field Turbo program so either certain some brand investment with our -- to our internal program be in the quarter-end. And you'll see a little bit of that forward.","In terms of our incremental margin I continue to think that, you know, numbers [indiscernible] are very realistic and frankly with the caps at the judgment that the comps in the current quarter won't impact full year number in any material way would have been there.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Can I seek one last one just on China Industrial I mean you guys were relatively tapping to start the year and improved in 1Q in the sense of your outlook. It seems like it it's modestly improved in the second quarters as well is that after it one and two, do you expect to be relatively steady here or you think there's a few one-offs that might provide some mental the close of the year.","William Donnelly","So if I look at China in total I think the second quarter was marginally better than the first. If I -- that was largely driven by our bad business and in particular the process analytics in the Lab business. If we look at kind of where we are we would expect a positive second half of the year particularly be to where we - where expectation were once we started the year but probably a little less than what you saw in the most recent quarter I think we grew our Lab business in China by, you know, close to 20% in the second quarter, and I think we don't expect that kind of growth a little bit large order driven and particularly in the third quarter. We probably sitting here today would estimate that maybe the fourth quarter [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","I appreciate all the color, guys. Congrats on the quarter.","William Donnelly","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tycho Peterson","Actually, Bill, just following up on the China question. Could you give the exact growth number for China? I may have missed it. Are you still expecting kind of low-single digit, mid-single digit for the full year?","William Donnelly","Yes, I think at this stage, I think mid-single digit would probably be a pretty good guess. Specifically in the second quarter, we were at 9.5%, 10%, and about 20% on the lab.","Tycho Peterson","And then product inspection, that's been a bit of a drag for a while. I think you previously mentioned you're expecting something around high-single digits for the year. Can you maybe just talk about some of the dynamics? What caused the decline this quarter and when do you think things turn there?","William Donnelly","Yeah, maybe just to clarify, at least for us we\u2019re thinking this is the first decline from a sales reported number, the first weak number. I think it\u2019s been pretty consistent. It was 7% in the first quarter, 6% last year. It\u2019s totally in backlog build. Actually the order entry in the quarter was high-single digits, and we were looking for a return to high-single digit or better in the third quarter. In the details of the why, if you kind of look at what happened in our product mix, as you know, it's one of the longer lead time products that we have in the portfolio, and just the mix changed a bit in a quarter where there were a lot more within [indiscernible]. So we're very happy with how that business performed in terms of execution, and continue to think that the market dynamics are good in that business, Tycho.","Tycho Peterson","Okay, then just lastly, what are you baking in, in the back half for core industrial out of Europe? Are you assuming things improve from here?","William Donnelly","Yeah, let me double-check the details. So maybe in the second half of the year we think we'll have some growth. I\u2019ve to double check and see if there are any large P&L orders [indiscernible] something in the second half of last year, but I don\u2019t think so. So some modest growth, single-digit growth.","Tycho Peterson","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Steve Willoughby","Hi, guys. Good evening. Just two things. Bill, the EPS guidance increased as you guys did. Are you guys expecting any accretion in the back-half of the year from the acquisition you've done here? And then I guess secondly, it's not every day that you guys do a lot of M&A stuff. But just wondering if there was any \u2013 do you think there are other future opportunities down the road for further consolidation of smaller lab manufacturers such as this?","William Donnelly","I'll take the first part of the question, but let Olivier start with the second part of your question.","Olivier Filliol","So this is a case that fits perfectly now with franchise. From a size perspective, it\u2019s really core. With these opportunities around, yes, we definitely go for them. We have a radar of possible targets and there are more such companies. But actually you can\u2019t really time when they\u2019ll become available [indiscernible]. So we really pursue them and whenever they materialize, we are more than happy to close them. We are looking at smaller ones too, but you shouldn\u2019t look that as a new path strategy that we are pursuing here. Yes, we did a couple of technology adjacencies and this time we had a great opportunity to acquire actually a service business, and if that pops up again we will do so.","William Donnelly","Okay. And with regard to, it should add a couple pennies, maybe up to a nickel in a best case scenario. And that would include us making some investments in terms of different things on the growth side, for example, international distribution enterprise. ","Okay. Steve, any other questions? ","Steve Willoughby","No. That's good. Thanks guys. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. ","Richard Eastman","Just a couple of follow-ups on the Troemner acquisition. Olivier, did they compete with you or is just kind of fill you know a regional hole in your service capabilities, is that is that part of the fit here.","Olivier Filliol","So we did compete but while in Europe we are market leader, in the U.S. Troemner was the market leader and we had a relatively small weights and weight calibration of business in U.S. and talk it perfectly fit our franchise.","Richard Eastman","I see. Okay.","Olivier Filliol","Troemner has a fantastic brand and confident in U.S. that they build up over decade that always made it difficult for Mettler to lead or to compete. As in Europe we have been the leader with patent it was difficult Troemner to establish a presence in Europe.","Richard Eastman","I see. And did they route to market for their mixers and stirs and some of the basic lab equipment, did that go through Ore House [ph] or how did they get to market with those products?","Olivier Filliol","Now so they use other indirect channels and Ore House was not a part of them and they have -- that they have multiple brands that they also leveraging at this current stage and we're going to maintain that, but in addition we definitely want to leverage the Ore House brand or the Ore House franchise to expand in particular also in international markets where Troemner was a particularly strong with their lab equipment business.","Richard Eastman","I see. Okay. And then, Bill just a question, you know, we took up the 16 core growth guide from 4% previous leader now more like 5% and did you did you suggest earlier that, you know, 50 bps the basic points of that increase was due to Troemner?","William Donnelly","Correct. ","Richard Eastman","Okay. So\u2026","William Donnelly","\u2026the pure organic number by 50 bps.","Richard Eastman","Okay. Despite the strength that you are seeing out of Asia-Pac and even you know the reacceleration maybe in Europe, I mean that's -- is that a high confidence forecast that that's all that would contribute in the second half? I would think that geographically is that Asia-Pac seems to be driving more upside than that. ","William Donnelly","You know I understand the comment if you -- I think that the comment that we've been making now in the last couple of quarters, Rick, is that given over capacity as well as credit risk in the Chinese market that it's worth put a little bit of a discount on that piece of it that would kind of number one. And number two would be in the details now and I am not counting a lot of basis points but that we see some tougher comps in a couple of different areas. So if you look at our year-to-date number we are plus 5% and we're saying A, by the end of the year we should finish it 4.5% at the midpoint of the range and I guess closer to 5% at the high end of the range, so let's see how China and some of these comps play out. Biopharma has been a strong market for a while. I'd like to think that there is upside to the numbers but we'll see as the quarter and the second half plays out.","Richard Eastman","Okay. This is great. And then just one last question maybe for Olivier the Lab strength in China is that, you know, somewhat traditional relative to the other geographies? In other words is that coming out of the biopharm vertical or, you know, are we seeing more uptake there in other labs, environmental or food and beverage or is it -- is a strength there by vertical kind of match up with U.S. or Europe.","Olivier Filliol","I would say yes to both what you said. [indiscernible] generally the Lab is doing well, but I would also say, yes, that the life science and biopharma is particularly strong in China.","Richard Eastman","It is, okay. Great. Thank you much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brandon Couillard","Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Just, Bill, circling back on China, just give us an update kind of on what\u2019s the current or latest KPI readings, how they're faring in China in general, and if you could give us the order growth rate in the period.","William Donnelly","Maybe on the economic stuff, I\u2019m not sure if we\u2019re a better source than kind of what you guys read. I think it's a bit of a lot of economic data globally. It\u2019s a bit of a mixed picture. Maybe one interesting insight we might give you is that I know there\u2019s been some articles that some of the GDP growth has come from leveraging up further some of this state-owned enterprises and regional governments, and it was interesting for us to see when we sorted through the details of our numbers that we saw really good growth, of course, in the government sector when it came to labs, but we also saw across the board a very good growth with multinationals.","And that's an interesting comment in the sense that if you look over the last three years, the percentage of our total sales in China going to multinationals has shrunk, but now we see a nice rebound in the first half of the year across product categories, and I think that this famous comment that we talked about for a multinational company, they can defer the replacement cycle for a while on our products, but eventually it bounces back and I think we see that a little bit there. It\u2019s probably a little less on the project side but much more of this return to the normal replacement cycle.","In terms of the order entry, the order entry was similarly positive to what we saw on the sales side. So it was a solid number. It\u2019s not that purely the order entry would make us cautious about the second half; it's just the realities of that it\u2019s still a market with some instability in it, and I think us remaining cautious makes sense, but I actually felt what we just shared with you about multinationals was one of the more positive readings that we had in our data coming out of China.","Brandon Couillard","That\u2019s helpful and just two other quick steps. Could you give us the net ASP in the second quarter? How you\u2019re feeling about the second half? And then should we assume the tax rate still 24% in the second half?","William Donnelly","Sure. So in terms of our price increases, our net realized price increases were 230 basis points up in the second quarter, and on a year-to-date basis they're now up at 2%. We did go and look \u2013 and just to put that in a little bit of context, some of that was us chasing some of the currency movements. That\u2019s going to happen in the course of the earlier part of the end of the first quarter, early part of the second quarter. And so we are trying to do something in terms of mid-year prices. I would not expect the second half of the year to be worse than 2% at this point in time.","Brandon Couillard","Super, thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","William Donnelly","Hey, Brandon. Tax rate we expect at 24%. I realized I forgot to answer that part of your question.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

I will start with a summary of the quarter and then Shawn will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments and we will open the lines for Q&A.","The highlights for the quarter are on Page 3 of the presentation. We had a very good start to the year with the first quarter results. Local currency sales growth was strong and better-than-expected as demand in our markets remained favorable and we continued to execute well. Total local currency sales grew 7% in the quarter. Food Retailing declined in the quarter. Excluding this business, our total sales grew 8%. We had excellent growth in our Laboratory and Industrial product lines, which more than offset the decline in Food Retailing. Growth in Europe and Asia was a strong and Americas, excluding Food Retail, also grew quite well. Our productivity and margin initiatives continue to drive good results, and despite a 7% gross headwind due to the adverse currency and tariff costs, we achieved a 10% increase in adjusted EPS in the quarter.","Our outlook for 2019 remains positive. This week has brought some noise surrounding the trades tariff dispute situation with China. For now, we have assumed that the second wave of tariffs will increase to 25% as indicated by the administration earlier this week. Shawn will go over this in more detail including the potential upside to our 2019 guidance if the tariffs situation improves.","We continue to be cautious on the global economy as economic data points have moderated in certain regions. However, we see no evidence of a downturn in our markets to date. We remain focused on execution of our growth initiatives and believe we are well positioned to continue to gain share regardless of market conditions. Assuming market conditions remain favorable, we believe we can generate good earnings growth in 2019.","Let me now turn it to Shawn to cover the financials and guidance, and I will come back later with additional comments on our business.","Shawn Vadala","Okay. Thanks, Olivier. Sales were $679.5 million in the quarter, an increase of 7% in local currency. As a reminder, all growth is organic. On a U.S. dollar basis, total sales increased 3% as currencies reduced sales growth by approximately 4% in the quarter.","On Slide 4, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales grew 9% in both Europe and Asia\/Rest of World. Local currency sales growth was 3% in the Americas but as Olivier indicated, sales were impacted in this region due to a decline in food retailing. Absent food retailing, Americas grew 6% in the first quarter. China had another excellent quarter with 13% local currency sales growth. We're executing well in Europe but also had some benefit from the timing of Easter this year versus last year.","On Slide 5, we outline local currency sales growth by product area. In the quarter, laboratory sales grew 8%, industrial also increased 8%. Within industrial, core industrial grew 9% and product inspection increased 6%. Food retailing declined 5% in the quarter. As you heard from Olivier, Food Retailing reduced our overall sales growth by approximately 1% in the quarter.","Slide 6 provides the P&L for the quarter. Gross margin in the quarter was 57.2%, a 50-basis point increase over the prior year level of 56.7%. Productivity and pricing continue to be strong contributors to margin growth. Partly offsetting these positives were tariffs from the U.S. China trade dispute as well as some initial cost and product launches. R&D amounted to $36.1 million, which represents a 9% increase in local currency. SG&A amounted to $204.4 million, a 6% increase in local currency over the prior year. The increase was driven by investments in our field force as well as higher variable compensation.","Adjusted operating profit amounted to $147.8 million in the quarter, which represents a 6% increase over the prior year amount of $139.5 million. We estimate currency reduced operating income by approximately $5 million, which is about $1 million worse than what we had expected the last time we spoke. We also estimate that tariffs were a gross headwind to operating income by approximately $4 million. Absent adverse currency and the gross impact of tariffs, operating income would have increased 12% in the quarter.","Operating margins reached 21.8% in the quarter as compared to 21.1% in the prior year. We are pleased with this increase given the meaningful headwinds we faced in the quarter.","A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $12.2 million in the quarter, interest expense is $9.1 million. Other income amounted to $670,000 compared to income of $2.4 million last year. As we mentioned on our last call, this line includes pension income, which for the full year, will be down versus the prior year. Our effective tax rate was 20.5% in the quarter before discrete items and adjusting for the timing of stock option exercises.","Moving to fully diluted shares, which amounted to 25.3 million in the quarter, and is a 3% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $4.10, a 10% increase over the prior year amount of $3.74. Absent currency and the gross impact of tariffs, our adjusted EPS growth would have been 17% in the quarter.","On a reported basis in the quarter, EPS was $4.42 as compared to $3.58 in the prior year. Reported EPS includes $0.10 of purchased intangible amortization, $0.05 of restructuring and a $0.47 difference between our quarterly and annual tax rate due to timing of stock option exercises. That is it for the P&L and I'll now cover cash flow. In the quarter, adjusted free cash flow was $80.2 million as compared with $56.5 million in the prior period. Our working capital statistics remain solid with DSO at 44 days and ITO at 4.5x.","Let me now turn to guidance. We continue to feel very good about our growth and productivity initiatives. As Olivier mentioned, we remain cautious on the global economy as certain economic data points continued to moderate. We have seen no impact to our business to date and our guidance assumes demand in our markets remain favorable. There's been a lot of talk this week on the China trade tariffs situation. As we sit here today, there is no meaningful change to our assumptions since the last time we provided guidance. That is, we assume that tariffs rate on the second tranche of tariffs that were announced last September will increase from 10% to 25% effective tomorrow, May 10, as announced by the administration earlier this week. We'd assume in our February guidance that this will occur in March, so a slight delay but no meaningful impact to our guidance. Therefore, we still assume that gross negative impact of tariffs and operating profit will be approximately $25 million on an annualized basis. For 2019, we assume a gross EPS headwind of approximately 2.5%. If tariffs were eliminated completely, we would expect EPS to benefit by approximately 1% on a full year basis.","In addition to tariffs, currency also continues to be a headwind to earnings in 2019, particularly in the first half of the year. For the full year, we would expect adverse currency to reduce EPS by approximately 2%. However, in the first half, it will reduce EPS growth by approximately 4%. Now let me cover the specifics. We now expect local currency sales growth in 2019 to be approximately 5.5%. This is a 50-basis point increase from our previous guidance, largely driven by the strong Q1 sales growth. One additional factor I want to mention is that we now expect Food Retailing to be down low single digits for the full year. Previously, we had expected Food Retailing to be flat. Excluding Food Retailing, our full year sales guidance would be a growth of a little less than 6.5% in local currency, a level we are very pleased with.","Largely driven by our first quarter beat, we are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance to $22.55 to $22.75, which is a growth rate of 11% to 12%. This compares to previous adjusted EPS guidance of $22.50 to $22.70.","One final comment on tariffs. As mentioned, we have assumed that the 25% rate for the second tranche goes into effect tomorrow. However, if the 10% rate should remain in effect, our 2019 guidance would benefit by a little less than $0.10. With respect to the second quarter. We would expect local currency sales growth to be approximately 5.5% and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $5.05 to $5.10, a growth rate of 9% to 10%. Absent currency and the gross impact of tariffs, EPS in the second quarter would be approximately 16% to 17%. Furthermore excluding Food Retailing, Q2 local currency sales growth would be approximately 6.5%.","Some final comments on guidance. With respect to the impact of currency on sales growth, we expect currency to reduce sales growth by approximately 2.5% in 2019. For the second quarter, we expect currency to reduce sales growth by approximately 4%. That is it from my side and I'd now like to turn it back to Olivier.","Olivier Filliol","Thanks, Shawn. Let me start by providing some additional comments on our operating results. Our lab business continues to perform very well, with 8% local currency sales growth in the quarter, which was against good growth in the prior year. Analytical instruments, pipettes and Process Analytics did particularly well. Market demand is good and this business benefits from these proper investments in field resources: Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives and R&D. We also see the nice benefit from good spending in biopharma in our Laboratory business and biopharma is a good example of how our Spinnaker sales and marketing strategy are targeting the most attractive and fastest-growing segments of the market. We serve both the upstream and downstream processes in biopharma that is R&D, quality control, process development, in-line process monitoring, such as bio reactors and pure water analytics.","Our pipettes Process Analytics and certain analytic instruments, such as UV\/VIS and pH benefit from strong market dynamics in biopharma. We have also expanded our offering to biopharma in Process Analytics through new product launches in - with CO2 sensors to monitor bio production and new in-line micro bio detection for pure water solution. Our AutoChem business had also expanded their solutions in process development targeted to large molecules.","Finally, our biotech acquisition expanded our offering into biopharma market as this the launch of UV\/VIS few years ago. Overall, we would expect lab to have strong growth in the second quarter and good growth in the remainder of the year, although they will face tougher comparisons in the back of the year.","Our Industrial business did quite well in the quarter. Product inspection was up 6% in the quarter, a little better than we expected. We have put the internal challenges we faced last year behind us with our move and Blue Ocean implementation. We continue to feel very good about this business over the medium term but have not seen large package food companies to return to investment mode. We think it will take a little longer for this to develop. While we expect full year sales and product inspection to be in the mid-single digit range, we expect growth in the second quarter will be below Q1. Core Industrial did very well in the quarter with growth of 9% in local currency. We had some project activity in transportation and logistics but even excluding this benefit, our Industrial business grew quite well. We were particularly pleased to see another quarter of solid growth in each region with particular strong results in Europe and China. Our Core Industrial business is benefiting from our Spinnaker sales and marketing programs as well as product innovation and strong execution from our teams. Overall, we would expect continued good growth for core Industrial for remainder of the year.","Although we wouldn't expect it to be at the level of Q1 and will face a difficult comparisons in Q4. The final piece of our company is the retail business which was down 5% in the quarter. Similar to the comments I made last quarter, we are not overly concerned given that we manage this business for profitability, not sales growth. We would expect further sales decline in Q2 and probably a little worse than in Q1. For full year, we would expect Food Retailing to be down low single digits. Overall, Food Retailing is a little more challenging than we had expected the last time we spoke given the softness in this market and the timing of customer investments.","Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Europe did very well with 9% growth in the quarter. Lab had good growth and product inspection, Food Retailing also had good growth. As already mentioned, Core Industrial had excellent growth in Europe.","Turning to the Americas, lab had very good growth while core Industrial had solid growth. Product inspection was up slightly, while retail was down significantly as previously mentioned. Finally, Asia\/Rest of the World had another quarter of very strong growth. All business lines did well. China had another quarter of excellent growth, both lab and Industrial were up double digits. One final comment on the business, service had great growth in the quarter, up 8% in local currency. We had excellent growth in both lab and Industrial, reflecting traction on our growth initiatives surrounding service. We also benefited a bit from the timing of Easter.","That concludes my comments on the different pieces of the business. Two additional topics I want to cover briefly today. Our initiatives surrounding investments in field resources as well as update on our productivity and cost initiatives in Stern Drive.","We continue to make great progress in our sales force activities, specifically in generating more leads and recognizing more penetration gap opportunities. We want to continue to invest to capitalize on these opportunities. We are now in their fifth year of our Field Turbo program, in which we invest front-end resources in markets where we are underpenetrated in specific product lines. We are complementing our Field Turbo investments by also increasing our front-end resources by shifting market organization resources from nonselling, nonservice activities to front and field activities. Internally, we refer to this program as Shift 5, which targets a 5% shift in our market organization resources to more productive growth activities over a 3-year period. Some examples of resource shifting we are doing, we move sales and service back-office functions to field, telesales and inside sales resources in high potential strategic business units. We are shifting service technicians from less profitable business areas to higher growth, higher potential business. We're also shifting our marketing and IT and logistic resources to more front-end growth areas. A fundamental part of our continuous improvement focus is reallocation of resources to our most attractive markets. Going hand in hand with shifting more resources to the front-end and to the most attractive markets is furthering our initiatives surrounding optimizing our overall sales force activities. Central to our sales and marketing strategies to gain share in our fragmented market is the efficient use of our front-end sales team.","We continue to further our sales force guidance programs which utilize our sales resources in a sophisticated, go-to-market approach that capitalizes on big data analytics to guide our sales reps to the most promising market opportunities. I'm pleased with the continued development of these sales and marketing programs and initiatives.","On the cost side, we have made great progress on Stern Drive, our global program for continuous improvement in supply chain, manufacturing and back-office functions. Since the launch 2 years ago, we have completed more than 700 projects and we have annual targeted cost savings of approximately $20 million. While Stern Drive focuses on cost savings, we also focus on cost avoidance at the front-end of our product development. We have developed initiatives surrounding value engineering, which is - also incorporates design for x. The x stands for areas including manufacturing, assembly, logistics or service. By developing and using standard parts and modular design and integrating, assembling our service requirements into the design of our product, we can avoid nonvalue added activities and reduce costs.","Value engineering focuses on the product, specifically, how we can generate the highest functionality for our customers at the lowest cost. We are still in the early stages of value engineering and expect to see additional developments in the future.","That concludes our prepared comments. We're very pleased with the strong start to the year. Assuming market conditions remain favorable, we believe we are well positioned to generate good sales growth, capture market share and deliver strong earnings growth. With that, I want to ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.","Ross Muken","Just maybe starting out on China, it seems like performance in the quarter was quite good and most of our checks on the ground there are pretty constructive but obviously this week a little bit of a curveball relative to some of the trade and tariff debate. I guess, are you more concerned about domestic demand if something negative were to transpire on tariffs and they were actually going to be implemented tomorrow? Or do you think about it more in the context of what it does for global growth in general? I'm just trying to think through like where risk really lies relative to your business. I'm guessing more the Industrial than the lab side if at all and how you're just thinking through sort of some of the machinations there?","Olivier Filliol","Ross, it's more the latter one and I'd say so because when I look at our business mix today in China, we are less exposed to the manufacturing side - sector and, particularly, discrete manufacturing sector that is more exposed than again to the export business. So I feel really that we have today a very favorable business mix in China with many industries that we serve that will depend on the domestic demand rather than export business. But of course, the global economy could be impacted here. We would probably see the effects throughout Asia, not just China. I think South East Asia, Japan, but also Europe would be impacted if this has further escalation.","Ross Muken","Makes sense. And then maybe I think you sort of gave us some comments on product inspection. Obviously, the traditional package food guys have had particularly in the U.S. some volatility. I guess, the emerging market opportunity there given how far behind in their country seems obvious. But I guess, how are you thinking through how temporal some of these disruptions are and there's also been an uptick a bit in M&A in that world or consolidation. Does that matter? Is that a positive for you because it sometimes will stimulate the desire to upgrade and\/or new hold. I guess, how are you just thinking through that backdrop?","Olivier Filliol","I think the challenge is a temporary one. I mean long term, I think actually, this business offers excellent growth. The market dynamics are very good. We are very well positioned. And so I'm very positive about this business. It's a business that I think will contribute above the group average in terms of growth. But the things that you just mentioned will continue to have an impact here for a few more quarters. I don't think this is an immediate turnaround of the market environment. But I don't also want to portray here that the whole market is just challenging. For example in emerging markets, in Asia, we had good growth and I expect this to go on. But maybe in the West, it's where you have big companies there. We feel it - particularly where we feel it is the global roll outs. We had in the past this big global companies that were committed to very significant investments for global roll outs. We see fewer of these and that's the kind of impact that we have to go through, particularly this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank.","Daniel Leonard","The geographic distribution of your growth is a bit different than what we've seen from others this earnings season, particularly in Europe. So Olivier, heard the comments on the businesses. But could you elaborate further on what you think you're doing well in Europe and why your performance would be so discordant from the macro?","Olivier Filliol","Yes. Hey, I definitely feel that team is executing very well. We have these different programs in place, and they very well resonate also in Europe. All this topics that I mentioned at the end of the prepared remarks about Spinnaker approach, its sales force guide, big data analytics, very much applies to Europe. And so that's one effect but I don't want to also ignore the fact that it against an easier comparison. We have a 9% growth. We will not repeat this kind of growth going forward. And if you look at 2-year growth, however, I'm still very pleased. I like it. And particularly because it was across all the core businesses, the lab did very well, Core Industrial did excellent and product inspection actually did also well. So happy about that. And last, I would also mentioned there was a certain Easter impact that helped us this year. Yes.","Daniel Leonard","And maybe just a quick follow-up. Is it possible to quantify how much you think the Easter timing benefited you?","Shawn Vadala","Dan, this is Shawn. Hey, it's of course difficult to estimate was it 1% to 2% maybe. But probably the best way to look at it is if you look at our guidance for Q2, we're thinking of more like low single-digit for Q2 in Europe. So on a year-to-date basis for the first 6 months of the year, Europe is going to be approximately mid-single-digit.","Operator","You're next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Ruizhi Qin","This is Julia on for Tyco. So regarding China, obviously you still have very strong results Industrial and lab, both up double-digit like you said. So given that I mean do you think there is room for updates to your full year outlook which I think assumes high single-digit for lab and low single-digit for Industrial? I mean, I understand you - why you might want to invent some conservatism there but given the Industrial performance so far, do you think low single digit is still a reasonable expectation for full year?","Shawn Vadala","Julia, this is Shawn. Thanks for the question. So for Industrial, I think you're right. I think given the start to the year, we would look at more like a mid-single-digit on the Industrial side in China. And on the lab side, probably a high single-digit. So overall, we are now looking at more high single-digit for China for the full year.","Ruizhi Qin","Okay. Got it. And then regarding the front office resource shifting initiative, could you maybe give a little bit more color on the magnitude of the benefit both in terms of top line and bottom line? And how soon you expect to generate that benefit? And if any of those benefits are embedded in your current guidance?","Olivier Filliol","So the way you need to look at it - this is a multiyear program that we are running here. We have started with the Field Turbo program already a few years ago, and then started to expand it with the Shift 5 program. The way I look at it is how many additional field resources we have versus the previous year as a combined program. And here, we are talking about roughly 200 resource for 2019. This is not so different to what we did in the past, and I would - in that sense, I'm not suggesting that this is - you can see an incremental benefit that is not already built into the guidance or I'm not suggesting here that you will see a further acceleration next year. It's a part of our overall Spinnaker 5 program and it's an enabler also for all the other things that we are doing. Internally, we - when we look at these programs, we look at reasonable payback times because sometimes you have some pre-investments like recruiting and so on. But yes, it's not - this would be on top of what we have budgeted or guided.","Ruizhi Qin","Got you. That's helpful. And then lastly, I think last quarter, you noted that some of your competitor price increases were higher than yours in light of the tariffs which facilitated some share gain. Have you seen that dynamic continue to play out in the first quarter?","Shawn Vadala","Yes. So hey, Julie, just to maybe clarify, I think what you're referring to. So when we were talking about specifically about our midyear pricing last summer in some of our Industrial product categories in the United States, we had noticed that we went out with a robust price increase midyear. Some of our local competition went out with a slightly higher increase in that particular business. We went out with another robust increase during the 2019 annual increase. We're off to a very good start with pricing. And I think we're probably just under 2.5% for the first quarter results, very much in line with what we expected and kind of feel good in terms of where we stand versus competition.","Operator","Your next question comes from Daniel Brennan with UBS.","Daniel Brennan","I was just hoping to - Olivier, I think you touched upon possibly some of the knock-on effects from the China trade, if there isn't one, maybe impact on global growth. Maybe you could just speak to, I mean, is there any risk around kind of relation the ability for China to look for local suppliers again to maybe company like yourself if in fact, it was a retaliation investments? Maybe a high-level question about the competitive dynamics between what you offer and maybe what some local suppliers offer?","Olivier Filliol","I think we are well positioned here. Mettler-Toledo is viewed as a local company in China. We have been there for so many years. We have excellent relationships. We have so many plants there. So I feel really confident on that side and the fact that we have - as a company, we have always been viewed as a global company - there is this Swiss element in it. So I'm not worried about that. It's - we are well positioned also in terms of well differentiated products. They've not - we will not be easily substituted. I think the bigger topic is just the economic development, the global economic evolution.","Daniel Brennan","Got it. and then you spent a fair amount of time discussing your offerings within pharma, probably more than we've heard you elaborate in the past. Maybe can you just address kind of collectively, you're kind of pharma end-market, what that grows at today and possibly with some of the investments you're making, could we see a benefit to you forward growth rate given the fairly strong dynamics within pharma?","Olivier Filliol","Just one additional comment and I wanted to make in China about this whole trade. Of course, there is currency movements that also come with that. We talked about global recession but the currency movements are always very important too and can have ripple effect on other economies, including the Southeast, Asia economics and so on. So I just wanted to also highlight that effect. Now back to pharma, life science industry. What I tried to highlight here is the prepared script is particularly also the subsegment of biopharma. Often we have in previous calls, talked about the pharma and the life science customers of us. In this call, I highlighted the biopharma because, of course, that's one that has a particular dynamic and a good growth momentum. And I wanted to share with you that we have a nice exposure there, that it's growing nice.","We have, for example, the Process Analytics business where it's a very significant share. That business has been growing very nicely for us for many years. And we benefit that there's a lot of investments going in biotech and in particular, also on the production side. We - in terms of investment in these and returns, I think this is a gradual thing. We are, today, with our sales force programs in place, with our shift resources and so on, we all are focusing more on pharma, chemical and food industry. And I think that's one of the benefits that we translate in good growth that we have here in Q1 and previous quarters. It's multiple effect. I would be hard-pressed to give you a specific number that would just come from pharma or biopharma in isolation.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard","Olivier, a question on the product inspection business, specifically. Could you sort of give us a breakdown between what the service side is doing versus the equipment side? And with some of your food packaging customers kind of let's say lengthening out their budgets or with muted budgets right now, are you seeing them leaning more on service needs?","Olivier Filliol","Yes. So we don't specifically break out within a business line. But I certainly can share that the service business continues to outperform the product side, that's a trend that we have now for many years. And service does actually, particularly well it's also very nicely profitable. We care very much about the service business and product inspection because it's a key differentiator that we have. You might remember when we were down in Tampa","for the Investor Day, we had also a session on the topic where we highlighted the fact that we have about in U.S., for example, 7x more service technicians than our nearest competitor. That's a unique differentiation and so part of the package. So again, this is going very well and nicely profitable. In terms of the exact impact of the large food companies and their evolution, no, I could not give you here a specific breakout. It's - I would want to refer to the point that I made before about this big global rollout that are missing. It's on an individual account and local size. It's less of a topic. It's more the global rollout that are missing at this point.","Brandon Couillard","One from Shawn. Cash flow off to a pretty good start in the first quarter here. Any updates to your free cash flow expectations for '19?","Shawn Vadala","No. Our free cash flow expectations for the full year is still kind of like in the $510 million range. Yes, we got off to a great start. Some of that is timing of how things are going to play out during the year on different topics. But overall, feel very good about it. Our working capital statistics are at an excellent level, very similar to where they were a year ago. So no change in terms of guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays.","Jack Meehan","Shawn, I was hoping you could give us - help us quantify some of the changes on the gross margin line, at least the expansion year-over-year. It looks like one of the strongest in about 1.5 years. So I think we have the tariffs number, how much did price contribute and how much was FX year-over-year?","Shawn Vadala","Yes. Sure. So if I just kind of walk it down. So yes, pricing came in pretty much similar to what we expected as I mentioned earlier. That's probably like about 100-basis point improvement on the margin, kind of offsetting that was the gross tariff impact, which was about a 60 basis point headwind on the margin. Currency had about a 20-basis point benefit, and then we had a bunch of other stuff kind of lumped together that went kind of 20 basis points the other way or whatever - however, the math works. Maybe that's 10 basis points. But you kind of get the picture so that's kind of I think the highlights.","Jack Meehan","Great. And then just to clean up on the buyback. Is your expectation still $545 million and look like you're off to maybe a quicker start for the year? Just what's driving the pacing there?","Shawn Vadala","So for the full year, it is going to be just under $750 million. So sorry as a reminder, it would be a free cash flow plus estimated option proceeds plus an incremental $200 million to increase our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage to 1.5 by the end of next year. So just to clarify for everybody, we'll do an incremental $200 million on our share repurchase program this year and next year, and this is consistent with what we've previously communicated to you back the last couple of quarters.","Operator","Your next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Donnelly","Maybe just one on the Core Industrial growth continues to be strong, in spite of some macro signs pointing a little down. Does that mix shift seem less sensitivity to general macro trends compared to the historical certainly seems to be the case. So maybe just help us think about what kind of has driven this dislocation again softer macro yet the core Industrial results continue to be pretty robust.","Olivier Filliol","Yes. We never really know if we are early or late cycle and all of these things. It's really difficult to measure. I think first, we need to look at us on a comparable basis, I talked before about how Europe and core Industrial was extremely strong, but it was against a little bit weaker comparisons. But I am very happy how we do in Industrial. I think it's a reflection of a good execution in the market organization. We have also a very strong product portfolio. We have this effect that I mentioned before, so that it's focused more on pharma can food that it is playing out. So different factors. I wouldn't attribute it too much to the economic cycle.","Patrick Donnelly","Okay. And then maybe just one on lab, another strong quarter even against 10% comp as you mentioned. This type of growth has almost become standard for you guys. So it seems broad-based, areas like liquid handling and process analytics. Anything else to call out on this kind of sustained strength that we've seen for the past couple of years here?","Shawn Vadala","Yes. We were particularly pleased with our analytical instrument growth in the quarter. As you mentioned, we tend - we've been seeing really good trends on some of the biopharma categories like liquid handling and Process Analytics. But we are seeing excellent growth throughout the portfolio. I think one of the standouts in my mind is our analytical business in all areas of the analytical business. And then as I think you're familiar we've had a lot of product introductions throughout the entire lab portfolio with - so I could also comment on Laboratory balances which has particular - a very strong momentum at the moment too. So we feel really good about the lab business when you look at the portfolio of products as well as the execution of the market organization, combined.","Operator","Your next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Ryskin","This is Mike on for Derik. Most of the question have been asked, I'll just throw in two quick ones. One was I thought you mentioned something in the prepared remarks about you had some benefit from timing in core Industrial. I was wondering if you could clarify that a little bit sort of the magnitude there and whether that was tied to the Easter comment on Europe or whether that was a separate event.","Shawn Vadala","Yes. Mike, I'm not - we're kind of looking at each other. I'm not sure when you mentioned timing of core Industrial. I think maybe what you could have referred to is that we did mention something about a little bit of benefit in our transportation and logistics business. Yes, that business has a tendency to be lumpy with projects when it has an impact we bring it to your attention and call it out. So we kind of acknowledged that, that's had some benefit in the quarter. But even, excluding that, we were still high single-digit in our core Industrial business. So still feel good about it.","Michael Ryskin","Yes, that is exactly what I was referring to so appreciate the color. And then another quick one. Just thinking broadly, I was ignoring all the - trying to ignore all the things happening this week and potentially some of the headlines that could or could not happen tonight as far as the tariffs are concerned. Could you just speak broadly to your view on sort of the visibility you have in your key end markets going through the rest of the year? In the past, you've talked to, you know you want to take a cautious stance because of some increased volatility in the macro picture. Has that changed broadly excluding the tariffs story over the last year or so? Is it a 3, 6 months visibility appropriate to comment on in market conditions?","Olivier Filliol","We still feel the same as we - when we talked last time. Actually, we are recognizing that there are clouds out there, but it's not that we are seeing it in our numbers. I feel confident with early indicators. What I hear from my teams pretty much around the world is actually positive, is encouraging. But we do recognize that things are fragile when it comes to the economy and that there are signs, like PMI, things like that, that are - that could make us feel a little bit more cautious. I think we are alert, we are agile to react if anything would happen. But we have no internal indications, and that's why we continue to invest. That's why I was talking about Field Turbo's and all these things. Very confident in that sense about what the upside is. But prepared if things would change.","Operator","Your next question comes from Richard Eastman of Baird.","Richard Eastman","Olivier, could you elaborate just a little bit when you were talking about the lab earlier, the lab segment earlier, you did call out this biopharma production, the bio process production applications that you are growing within the Process Analytics business. Could you just - is that business big enough at this point to move the needle? And is that a newer effort because I didn't really - I haven't placed you guys in the bio process manufacturing process before and I'm just curious if you could maybe shed a little bit of color on that and if you are large enough, is the method of production within biopharma. Is that a benefit to you, or is it more about absolute level of investment?","Olivier Filliol","Interestingly, the bio piece is the region and the core of Process Analytics. I know it well because I started there 18 years ago. It was the pH measurement, in-line measurement with pH and very much this was a parameter used in the fermentation particularly for bio reactors but then also in the beer industry and that has always been an important customer segment for us. And there are parallels between the beer industry and the bio reaction industry with cell growth. And pH measurement and [indiscernible] oxygen have always been a strength of ours. We are clearly the leader in that segment. And then over the years, we have expanded the portfolio and we have added for example, CO2 measurement, which is a similar technology, but we have also added TLC, for example, and more recently - bioburden and these are parameters that you use to - for water purity, and the water purity is very important in pharmaceutical processes, but including also in the bio processes. So the answer is we have been in this business for a long time and we have benefited from the growth of that industry not just in the recent quarters but actually in the recent years. We are also in the business of the single use bags where we provide the sensor for. And I think we highlighted it just on this call because there are multiple products we think Mettler-Toledo portfolio, not just Process Analytics that goes into that end-user industry, we feel that we have actually also good marketing programs to it. We have good databases. And we wanted to highlight it because it had a little bit more attention in the analyst and investor community in recent quarters.","Richard Eastman","Yes, yes. Okay. Is there - in lab and total in the 8% local currency growth that you referenced in the first quarter, is pricing in lab above the 2.5 corporate average? Did that contribute at all?","Shawn Vadala","Maybe, probably. I don't think there's a significant difference this quarter between lab and Industrial. We did more bolder increases on the Industrial side given the tariff situation between the midyear stuff and the stuff we did for the annual price increases as we entered this year.","Richard Eastman","Okay. And then just the last question if I may. Within your European business, was there any positive benefit from the Brexit, let me just say push? In other words any buy forward or inventory levels or anything that you saw we've seen that in a number of companies?","Olivier Filliol","Not really. No. We - basically, we have prepared ourselves with safety stock, absolutely. But from a customer standpoint, I have no indication at all and I visited actually the U.K. just a few weeks ago, and this was a non-topic with the team. In general, I'm surprised how that Brexit, so far, has a limited impact on our business, other than what we take precautions of safety stock. But from a customer's reaction, not much impact. It's also not that we see that many of our customers are shutting down their investments or so, lucky enough not too much impact.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research.","Stephen Willoughby","Just one question for you, Shawn. Just sort of question on guidance here. You beat your first quarter guidance by $0.05, you've obviously raised by $0.05, but you took up the full year organic growth by 50 bps so I just was wondering why there wasn't more flow through into earnings.","Shawn Vadala","Yes. No good question, Steve. So I think that best way to think about it is that the 5.5% or the 50 basis points improvement on sales had largely - was largely related to our Q1 beat. Similarly, our EPS increase was largely related to the Q1 beat. But the one thing that probably stands out in our minds as we were giving the guidance that kind of goes the other way is the currencies have worsened a little bit over the last quarter, particularly in the last couple of weeks. We didn't necessarily adjust for 100% of that, but certainly, it's something to call out.","Stephen Willoughby","One quick follow-up, Shawn. Just to confirm, there is no M&A contribution in the quarter?","Shawn Vadala","That's correct. Entirely organic.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from Paul Knight with Janney Montgomery.","Paul Knight","Congratulations Olivier on the quarter. On the bio production side of the business, are you applying the original - are you implying systems direct or are you going through DE Sartorius network into part of their systems?","Olivier Filliol","So the big majority of our business also for Process Analytics is direct but there are relationship with system integrators that are building whole plans. And for single use applications, we are working with multiple companies in that space. However, it's always important, even when we go to any system integrators or partners or so, the decision are normally done by the end user and in that sense we have, strong relationship with the end user and the end users know the Mettler-Toledo brand very well.","Paul Knight","And Olivier, what do you think your market share is in the [indiscernible] area and then also, in the beer side of the market?","Olivier Filliol","Let's say, I feel we are a strong leader in all these applications. Again, this fermentation, bio reactor for the specific parameters, the specific analytical parameters, we are viewed as a global leader.","Operator","There are no further questions. I turn the call back to the presenters for any closing remarks.","Mary Finnegan","Thanks, Jesse, and thanks, everyone, for joining us tonight. As always, if you have any questions, don't hesitate to give us a call or easy as we're traveling, or easiest to send us an email. Take care, guys.

Please proceed, ma'am.","Mary Finnegan","Thanks, Holly, and good evening, everyone. I'm Mary Finnegan. I am the Treasurer, and I'm responsible for Investor Relations, and glad that you're joining us today. I'm joined here today by -- with Olivier Filliol, our CEO; Bill Donnelly, our Executive Vice President and Shawn Vadala, our Chief Financial Officer. I want to cover just a couple of financial administrative matters. This call is being webcast and is available for replay on our website. A copy of the press release and the presentation we refer to is also on our website.","Let me summarize the Safe Harbor language, which is outlined on Page 2 of the presentation.

I will now turn the call over to Olivier.","Olivier Filliol","Thank you, Mary, and welcome to everyone on the call. I will start with a summary of the quarter, Bill will provide details on our third quarter results, and Shawn will be discuss our guidance for the rest of this year and for 2019. I will then have some additional comments, and we will open the lines for Q&A. The highlights for the quarter are on Page 3 of the presentation. We are pleased with our sales growth, which was 7% in local currency in the quarter. Our laboratory products had very good broad-based growth. In addition, China had strong growth despite excellent sales growth in the prior year. Our sales growth, combined with results from our margin and productivity measures, drove a 17% increase in adjusted EPS.","Let me comment briefly on how we observe current market conditions and how we are deploying our strategies given the environment. First, demand in our markets remains good. Sales, orders, even leads look solid. But there are many reasons to be cautious about the global economy, including higher interest rates, a strong dollar and uncertainty and costs arising from tariff disputes. I would characterize it as a sunny weather but clouds on the horizon. These clouds provide a different outlook than it was 1 year ago when we gave guidance for 2018.","So what do these clouds mean for us in terms of strategy deployment? We clearly remain focused on growth. We are investing for growth but somewhat more cautiously than we were at this time last year. We want to remain agile and react to, even to a certain extent and anticipate a slowdown. We are confident that we can continue to deliver share gains, irrelevant of underlying market growth. And with our strong focus on margin enhancement and cost management, this should translate to reasonable earnings growth under almost any circumstance. Shawn will cover this further in his comments on guidance.","I now want to turn it over to Bill, but before I do, I want to acknowledge that this is Bill's last earnings call with us. Bill has made tremendous contribution to Mettler-Toledo over more than 20 years. I have worked closely with Bill and want to personally thank him for his support, dedication and leadership with the organization. Bill's personality, in particular his sense of humor and his down-to-earth approach to our challenges, will be missed.","I think one of Bill's greatest contribution to Mettler-Toledo was his nurturing and development of his successors. He leaves the global supply chain and IT organizations in good hands with Oliver Wittorf, who many of you will hear from on Monday at our investor meeting. And, as I think many of you have seen over the last year or so, he leaves the finance organization in the skilled hands of Shawn, who has worked with Bill for many of this -- of his 20 years here. Bill, an official thank you for all of your contribution to Mettler-Toledo and you know I personally wish you all the best for the future.","Bill Donnelly","Thanks, Olivier, for the warm remarks. I acknowledge we're on a transcript and a call, so I'm not going to take too long but the thanks go back in return. It's -- Mettler is a great company, I'm proud of what we've accomplished and it's been an honor to work here. And maybe to the shareholders on the call and to the investors on the call, I have great respect for the job you guys do. I hope you feel that respect from all of us in return.","And maybe, one of the things I've loved about our shareholder base is they've been with us for a really long journey and maybe, a special thanks to them for all they've done for us. And maybe also to them, I want to acknowledge that -- what Olivier said, I think we left things in -- I feel like I'm leaving things in great hands with Shawn and Oliver but maybe to you in particular, Olivier, you and the rest of the team around the globe, I feel like the company is as strong as it has ever been, and thank you for the opportunity.","All right. So enough of that stuff. I'll try to cover the numbers now. Sales were $735 million in the quarter. That's an increase of 7% in local currency. The Biotix acquisition contributed about 1% to local currency growth. On a dollar basis, our sales increased by 5% because currencies reduced sales by 2% in the quarter.","On Slide number 4, you'll see our growth by region. So local currency sales grew by 5% in the Americas, 3% in Europe and 11% in Asia, Rest of World. Our sales growth in China increased by 12% in the quarter and that growth was broad based. In China, growth was particularly impressive when you consider that we had 28% sales growth in the prior year. Biotix benefited our growth by about 1% in the Americas.","Now I'd like to turn to Slide number 5 and that's our 9-month numbers. So you see there, local currency sales have increased by 5% in the Americas, 3% in Europe and 10% in Asia\/Rest of the World. Biotix benefited the Americas growth year-to-date by approximately 2%.","Onto Slide number 6. We outlined in local currency sales growth by product line. In the quarter, lab grew by 11% while industrial increased 1% and retail grew 14%. Biotix helped out the lab group by about 2%. Within our industrial group, our core industrial business grew by 2.5%, offset against very strong growth in the prior year, offsetting this to a degree was approximately a 1.5% decline in product inspection and we'll elaborate on that later.","Turning to the next slide. We have year-to-date sales growth by product line. So lab is up year-to-date 10%, while industrial is up 1% and retail is up 6%. And Biotix helped the lab sales by about 2% and of course, all those numbers were in local currency.","All right, let's go to now Slide number 8, which gives you the P&L for the quarter. Our gross margins were 57.1%, that compares to 57.4% in the prior year. On a constant currency basis and adjusted for acquisitions, gross margins were down 10 bps in the quarter. Pricing continues to be a strong contributor to gross margins but we had headwinds from tariffs as well as poor mix in retail and some initial costs associated with our product inspection U.S. facility comp consolidation as well as a little bit on product launches.","R&D in the quarter was $34.8 million and that's a 10% increase in local currency, and our SG&A of 202.5 million was a 1% decrease in local currency versus the prior year. That number included increased investments in our field force, which were offset by cost savings initiatives as well as lower variable compensation. That resulted in an adjusted operating income of $182 million in the quarter, and that's a 13% increase over the prior year amount of 161.7 million. We estimate that currencies reduced operating income by about $1 million, a little worse as compared to what we told you last time.","Our adjusted operating margin was 24.8%, and we're pleased with that 170 basis points improvement over the prior year. A couple of comments on the P&L. Our amortization amounted to 11.9 million, while interest expense was 9 million even. Other income was 1.5 million, which primarily is pension income.","Now let's cover taxes. We reduced our effective annual rate slightly from 22% to 21.5%. This reduction reflects the impacts of changes in our income sources and some benefits in China. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.7%, which reflects the cumulative catch up to get our year-to-date rate to 21.5%. We expect our Q4 effective rate to also be 21.5%. As Shawn will cover in a moment, we expect our rate to be further reduced to 21% in 2019.","All right, now moving to fully diluted shares, which were 25.7 million in the quarter, and that's a 2% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted earnings per share was $5.12, and that's a 17% increase over the prior year amount of $4.36 per share. On a reported basis, EPS was $4.93, that compares to $3.99 in the prior year. Reported EPS includes $0.07 of restructuring, $0.10 of purchased intangibles and $0.02 related to a discrete tax item surrounding our stock option program.","The next slide provides year-to-date results. Local currency sales increased by 6%, operating profit increased 13% and adjusted EPS was up 16%. Of course, we're very pleased with those results.","Okay, that's it for the P&L, and now we'll cover cash flow. In the quarter, adjusted free cash flow ","and now we'll cover cash flow. In the quarter, adjusted free cash flow was $121.3 million, and that compared to $111.9 million in the prior year. Our working capital statistics remained solid, with DSO at 39 days while ITO is at 4.5x. And that's it from my side, and then I want to turn it over to Shawn to give some info on our guidance.","Shawn Vadala","Okay, thanks, Bill, and hello, everyone. Let me start with a couple upfront comments on guidance before covering the specifics. First, our growth and productivity initiatives. These are well within our control, and we feel confident in their effectiveness and our ability to execute them. These initiatives are well ingrained within the company and have proven to be a success, and we feel very good about our ability for them to drive sales and earnings growth.","Second, the economy. As Olivier mentioned earlier, demand in our markets is solid. This is evident with our third quarter results. Similar to how we have done this in the past, our guidance for Q4 in 2019 assumes market conditions remain largely unchanged. We do acknowledge, however, there is some more uncertainty in the global economy, in particular, what could be the potential longer term impact on the Chinese and global economy due to the trade\/tariff situation, but we're not seeing any impact to date.","Third, tariffs and currency. On our last call, we outlined the impact of tariffs from the first wave that went into effect in early July. As a reminder, we estimated this would reduce operating profit by approximately $10 million on a full year annualized basis. We had built the net impact of the tariffs and response initiatives into our previous 2018 guidance. The second wave went into effect at the end of September, and we estimate the full year annualized impact, once the full rate is implemented, will be approximately $15 million. For clarity, these incremental tariffs are initially at a 10% rate and step up to a 25% rate in January. The $15 million is the full 25% impact on the second wave. Therefore, the total impact of tariffs, both the first and second wave on an annualized basis, is $25 million reduction to our operating profit.","Our guidance for Q4 and 2019 reflect the impact of this new wave of tariffs and our responses. In addition to tariffs, currencies also continued to move against us. In particular, the Chinese renminbi versus the dollar and the Swiss franc versus the euro. One final comment on taxes. As you heard Bill mention, we reduced our tax rate in Q3 to 21.5% for the full year 2018. Due to some additional impact of income sourcing, we expect a further reduction in our tax rate to 21.0% in 2019. I realize this is a lot of numbers and data but thought it was important as it will help put our guidance into perspective.","With respect to the fourth quarter of 2018, we expect local currency sales growth of approximately 6%. This is organic, and we have owned Biotix for more than a year now. We expect this sales growth will generate adjusted EPS in the range of $6.72 to $6.77, a growth of 13%. We estimate currency and the impact of tariffs are a headwind to Q4 adjusted EPS growth of approximately 5%.","For the full year, we expect local currency sales growth to also be 6%, with an adjusted EPS in the range of $20.20 to $20.25, a growth rate of 15%. For 2019, we expect local currency sales growth of approximately 5% and adjusted EPS growth in the range of $22.40 to $22.60, a growth rate of 11% to 12%. We estimate the headwind to earnings growth in 2019 due to adverse currency and tariffs will also be approximately 5%, similar to what we are facing in the fourth quarter.","Let me also comment on cash flow for 2019. We expect cash flow of approximately $510 million. This represents a growth of 12% per share, adjusting for facilities CapEx. In terms of share repurchases, you saw in the press release that the board has increased the authorization as we would have exhausted our current authorization by the end of the year. We would expect share repurchases in 2019 to include our free cash flow estimate, plus option proceeds, totaling approximately $545 million. In terms of quarterly guidance for 2019, as usual, we will provide that on our upcoming call. However, I know you will update your models and want to point out that while our adjusted EPS growth is 11% to 12% for the full year, I would expect a lower growth in the first half, in particular, the first quarter, due to currency and timing of tariffs and implementation of our response actions.","On a preliminary basis, we would expect adjusted EPS percentage growth in the first quarter of 2019 to be in the mid-single digit range. In terms of currency on sales, we expect currency to decrease sales growth by approximately 3% in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2018, we expect currency to benefit sales growth by approximately 1.5%. In 2019, we expect currency to reduce sales growth by approximately 3%, with more decline in the first half of the year as compared to the second half. That is it from my side, and I now want to turn it to Olivier.","Olivier Filliol","Thanks, Shawn. Let me start by providing some additional comments on our operating results. Our lab business continues to perform very well, as shown by the 9% organic growth in the quarter. I point out -- this out, as this was in addition to solid growth in the prior year. Sales growth was broad based, with most product lines showing good growth. We are executing well in this business, as we benefit from a very strong product portfolio, our continued investment in field resources and our Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives. I would expect good growth in lab for the remainder of 2018 and into 2019.","Turning now to industrial. Let me cover this in 2 parts; core industrial had approximately 2.5% growth, which was impacted by the very strong 9% growth in core industrial in the prior year. We would expect to see a better growth in core industrial in the fourth quarter and in 2019. As you heard from Bill, product inspection was down slightly in the quarter. We had expected it to be flat to a little weaker as compared to last time we spoke. I want to remind you, this business is impacted by prior year's comparisons, not one in 2017 but strong growth we saw in the second half of 2016.","We expect to see growth in the fourth quarter and in 2019. For those of you joining us on Monday, you will hear more about this business and have a chance to see its new facility. The final piece of our company is the retail business, which was up 14% in the quarter, better than we expected, given some project activity in the United States. As you know, this business is lumpy, and we would expect a modest decline in the fourth quarter and minimal, if any growth, in 2019.","Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Europe came in pretty much how we expected. We had good growth in lab and retail, while industrial was down slightly. In the Americas, lab had very good growth and that is on an organic basis. Industrial was down, in both core industrial and product inspection. Retail in the Americas was strong due to project activity just mentioned.","Finally, Asia\/Rest of the World had strong growth, with excellent growth in lab and very good growth in Industrial. Retail was up nicely as well. China had very strong growth across most product lines. As we look to next year, we would expect Americas and Europe to have growth at, or little bit below, the mid-single-digit range and Asia\/Rest of World, including China, to have growth a little more than mid-single digits.","Longer term, we would guide for Asia and China, in particular, to have growth in the mid-to-high single digit range. But they will be impacted in 2019 by very strong growth over the last 2 years. That concludes my comments on the different pieces of the business.","Let me now comment on our overall guidance for 2019 and what gives us confidence in our ability to generate the sales and earnings growth we have outlined today. I will start with our Spinnaker sales and marketing strategy, which we believe are a unique competitive advantage and important source of growth. We have core initiatives surrounding lead generation and investments in our field force through our Field Turbo program. These initiatives remain well on track, and we are also focused on sales force activities. Specifically, we have tools and programs to help ensure our front end sales reps maximize their productivity by targeting those customers with the greatest potential. How do we go about it? First, we identify what are the most attractive pockets of growth. ","This means specific market segments, where products provide the most value and the specific customer accounts where we have the best access and highest cross-selling potential. Second, we utilize sophisticated go-to-market strategies, which ensure we utilize the most cost-effective sales channel given the sales and profit potential of the different accounts. This increasingly means that sales reps are spending more of the time with high potential noncustomers and we use telesales resources for accounts with lower sales potential. ","It is worthwhile to highlight that over the last four years, we have more than doubled our telesales resources and currently have almost 300. We have developed a substantial amount of materials and tools to support our sales reps and telesales resources in demonstrating how our solutions help specific needs of the customers. Finally, we leverage our unique data analytics to formulate tailored marketing and sales campaigns. We process millions of internal and external data to guide our sales reps to the most promising opportunities. These sales force activities will increase the sales force time with the most strategic accounts and it will ensure we are redirecting resources to our most attractive businesses.","This is core to maximizing our sales force productivity. We believe these sales force activities in combination with our other Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives will continue to allow us to gain share. New product launches are another important contributor to growth. As we have spoken to you about in the past, we are constantly coming to market with new products. No single launch will make a material impact to our results in any quarter but all of them combined are essential for our strategy to trigger replacement, gain share and support our pricing program.","Let me give you a recent example from our laboratory offering and the launch of our new line of analytical balances. We have the most comprehensive portfolio of these balances and have reduced the minimum weight by 50%, thereby allowing customers to use smaller sample sizes and reduce waste. A patented cooling system and intelligent features that include ensuring the balance is level and free from static actively monitor weighing conditions to ensure outstanding accuracy and reproducible results. A large user interface and process and settings that can be saved for different tasks also help improve the efficiency of our lab customers.","We are excited about this launch, which is receiving very favorable customer reactions. We also launched the newest generation of LabX, our lab data management system. From central control of instruments and tasks to eliminate manual errors, LabX helps ensure security, efficiency and data integrity of the lab. As mentioned, this is just one example of our many new product launches.","With our Spinnaker sales and marketing programs and new products focused on growth and capturing share, our pricing and productivity initiatives are driving operating profit growth. I'm very pleased with our extensive pricing programs, trainings and tools we have developed over the last several years. On the productivity side, Stern Drive is continuously driving productivity and cost leadership of our operations and supply chain. Stern Drive is the platform for improvements in how we manage our procurement as well as how we improve our labor productivity in both the shop floor as well as back office operations.","Using data analytics and benchmarking, we identify high-impact and fast-return projects in these areas. So far, we have completed more than 500 projects and have managed to establish a continuous pipeline of projects that allow us to deliver against our target of $20 million year-over-year savings.","In summary, we feel very good about the factors we can control, namely the execution of our growth and margin and productivity initiatives. Demand remains solid, and we will monitor the global economy and be ready to react if conditions change. We face headwinds next year in terms of currency and tariffs but believe can still deliver strong earnings growth. That concludes our prepared remarks, and I want to ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Dan Arias, Citi.","Dan Arias","Bill, I'm sure I won't be the only guy to say it's been a pleasure and good luck. You've been one of the best around for a long time, so thanks.","Bill Donnelly","Thank you.","Dan Arias","I just wanted to maybe start on pricing, if I could. That's been a really good tool for you guys. What are you baking in for 2019? How much of that do you expect is related to areas where maybe historically you've pushed hard versus those areas where maybe you've been a little bit less aggressive?","Shawn Vadala","Dan, this is Shawn. Thanks for the question. For 2019, we normally would guide to about 150 basis points. But the way we're thinking about 2019 is something in the 2%, maybe a little bit better than that kind of a range. We put in place some additional pricing actions, as you know, during the second half of this year, and we're thinking similarly as we, kind of, enter next year, given the higher inflationary environment, and we would expect to do a little bit better than what I said on an annualized basis in the first half of the year, given the timing of some of these measures versus the second half of the year.","Dan Arias","Okay. I believe it was Olivier that made the comment, but you talked about just how you entered the year versus the way that things are now. So I guess, the question is if you ignore comps, and you just think about the outlook for demand, can you, kind of, crystallize the way that you see things headed into 2019 and how that differs from the way that you were looking at spending and demand heading into the year this year. I'm just curious about the relative confidence that you have when we think about the customer segments and the macro environment?","Olivier Filliol","Yes, the things that we really see in our numbers, in terms of leads generation and quote requests, but also all the feedback that I get from the organizations around the world, they all remain very positive. And in that sense, we have -- we don't see any negatives yet of the clouds that I was referring to in the prepared remarks. But of course, we are more alert, and we are a bit more cautious because there are things out there that could impact us. And that's just ask for us to, kind of, hedge our risks here. But when you think about investments and activities, we are very much still in this growth mode. Very comparable to what it was last year.","I'm still funding Field Turbo programs, very committed to that, and we certainly also, when we interact with our market organizations around the world, we go for the growth mode really, in every single market. That includes also all the emerging markets, even that they might be impacted a little bit by the dollar topic or China that of course, is also impacted by the tariffs. But we don't see it and that, in our markets directly, until we feel we need to go for the top line.","Dan Arias","And if I could sneak one more in on the tariffs, obviously that's a headwind on costs. But I'm just curious whether you're finding that -- are the tariffs and the trade war concerns diminishing or washing out any of the smaller local competitors over there, as the mom and pop type places try to make it all work?","Olivier Filliol","No. I don't really think it changed much to the competitive landscape. So when we talk about our many Chinese competitors, I also referred to, we have hundreds, sometimes even thousands of weighing scale companies there, they serve the domestic market. Hardly any of them are engaged in significant export. The one thing that could happen -- from today's perspective, these tariffs mostly impact the discrete industry metal plastic, and I would say, this is a market segment that is maybe more served by the local competitors, as we have refocused our business already for now a couple of years, more to the value add businesses like Pharma, chemical industry and so on. And I would think that these businesses will be less impacted by tariffs. But again, our Chinese competitors that we have are not really directly involved in export business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.","Ross Muken","So, Bill, I'll second the comment. Obviously, it's been a long time we've known each other. Great pleasure and best of luck. In terms of the business, so maybe on China, I'll, sort of, stick on that as a theme. There's a lot of cross currents, right? So the macro data in some parts has kind of deteriorated, at a country level, you've got a number of the consumer-oriented companies are, kind of, warning on demand. And yet, every company in the space, including yourselves had good results, not really seeing any shift in demand. It seems like your commentary and orders are still consistent. So help us, kind of, make sense of how these budgets are protected. How it's so broad in that, sort of, stability of demand and, kind of, what you're looking at in terms of the customer base in some of the more volatile or cyclical parts of your Chinese business that's kind of, giving you comfort that some of these other warning signs won't sort of, manifest themselves over the balance of '19.","Olivier Filliol","First, I want to say, we don't see it today, and we don't know if there will not be future side effects from certain market segments that will decline and then spill over to others. But at this stage, what we see, the markets that we serve predominantly are less impacted because, as I described before, they are less export oriented. And the -- for the domestic consumption, there is still this desire for better quality, safety and productivity. And so, we see our Chinese customers to continuously invest and look to our instruments. I certainly also would expect that the Chinese government will continue to drive the growth in these value-added industries, for example, life science industry.","And that's the piece that we are more and more focused on and probably, also not a coincidence I was talking about the strong results that we have from the lab business in China. We have the 10th quarter of mid-teens growth in this business. And I see that really, also the last quarter being very strong and that gives us confidence also going forward. But there might be spillover effect, from these other segments that are negatively impacted and it's just too early to really see it. And that's why we remain agile or also a little bit cautious. You certainly have seen us guiding for China next year a little bit more modest, and this is, on the one hand, because comparisons but secondly, also that we realize that the overall economy will not be that strong.","Ross Muken","And maybe, it's really a tremendous job, the whole team did around mitigating some of these tariff and FX related headwinds. One, can you just give us kind of an example outside of obviously, price of maybe anecdotally, something you came up with or decided to do to, kind of, help with margin management for next year. And then, help us think through in, sort of, the various scenarios. You reacted so quickly this year to some of the headwinds that came up, like, how much flex do you have into next year, should the 25% tariff go into place or other counter -- other measures or we see even more volatility in the dollar, et cetera? How much juice is left to be reactive because you've already obviously, done a lot.","Bill Donnelly","Maybe I give you an example, Ross, it's Bill. I think an easy one to understand is, if you take a look like at how we bring product into the United States from China, if we can bring down the transfer price, that of course, has $1.04 -- or $0.25 on a dollar kind of impact. And so that might require that we also adjust where some activities happen in the supply chain. So moving some value-add from some -- one place the other. Now if -- back to your point what we can do in the future, well, we certainly, as you know, we sell a lot of SKUs.","So we don't try to do too many things to touch the supply chain because we don't have that many products we can get a lot of activity behind it. But if we were to think it might be more permanent, we could probably do more on the supply-chain side and have more on the transfer pricing side to, kind of, offset that. But I think one of the bigger points would be is those are only mitigations. We're not eliminating the tariff in those cases, and frankly speaking, we would prefer if things were reversed, that the tariffs went away, we'd frankly rather move those activities back to China. Let China enjoy a little bit larger transfer price and -- but our overall cost structure would be much more efficient if we didn't have that work around.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Dan Leonard, Deutsche Bank.","Dan Leonard","So I wanted to talk about the result in industrial. Appreciate the issue around comps but how much of the performance do you think is a reflection of more challenging comps versus anything structural, like CapEx pressures and some of the big food companies?","Olivier Filliol","So I think we need to talk -- when we talk about industrial, we should really differentiate between core industrial and product inspection. I think here, you refer more to product inspection. And in product inspection, we had three key effects: One is, this comparison topic and this is very much related also to some key account activities. Very strong key account orders that we had in previous years. And these key account activities are more lumpy. And partially, also related to what you said, the very big packaged food companies did manage their capital spending in a more forceful way this year than we have maybe seen in previous years. But I -- the early signals that we have is, this is something that will come back. And so, that's one of the reasons why I'm not worried.","The second one -- impact that we had was that we made some important changes to our manufacturing blueprint, particularly here in the U.S. This was a major undertaking. This will make the franchise so much stronger and the ones of you that join us next Monday I'm sure, you will immediately recognize what this means. Consolidating three plants but also three technologies at one place. It's going to bring huge synergies going forward, not just in terms of production capability but very much, this brings benefits to customer interactions because we can demo and all the technologies at the same time.","And that in sense, this was a pre-investment. A pre-investment that did cost some margins initially but also brought some distraction for us to serve the markets as we normally would do. And that's something that I see us recovering really fast and is a part of why I say Q4 will also look better. When I say Q4, I imply with that, also next year. I expect good growth from product inspection.","Dan Leonard","And, Olivier, is it possible, can you give us just kind of a rough flavor of how much you expect the industrial segment to accelerate in Q4? What roughly would be in your plan?","Bill Donnelly","We should grow high single-digit in the fourth quarter and maybe, one of the interesting things, Dan, is if you look at, like, multi-year growth rates, I think it will be our best three year growth rate of the year, which speaks to, I think, the foundation, as Olivier mentioned, of the franchise.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Patrick Donnelly, Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Donnelly","Definitely want to echo the prior sentiments that you'll be missed, Bill. It was great working with over the years. And maybe since it's your last earnings call I'll throw one your away. Always appreciate your macro perspective. So I just want to expand on, I think it was Dan's earlier question. Relative to this time last year when you provided guidance for '18, sitting here today, looking ahead to 2019, can you just walk through the geographies and then talk through which you feel more cautious or constructive on.","Bill Donnelly","So sure, I'm happy to do that. So, I mean, on a broad statement, I think emotionally, even as you look out a year ago, we had a very positive currency environment looking forward. The tariff situation wasn't where it is today. And so, it's just the combination of those two things. I think when Olivier refers to clouds, I think that's the type of the thing he has in mind. If I go through the world geographically as compared to a year ago, I think we knew we had -- I start with the Americas.","We knew we had a tough comp coming in the Americas when it came to product inspection, and we probably underestimated a little bit some of the challenges with the plant consolidation. So those two should both be a little bit better. In terms of the core industrial business, I think we probably feel like we're getting later in the cycle now, so do we feel materially different? Not really. And then, the lab business, looks to be again on solid footings.","If I go to Europe, I think we do see that maybe GDP forecasts are a little bit less for '19 than they were a year ago for '18. But if I look out, kind of, what we've done recently as well as what we do in the fourth quarter, it's pretty solid, and we haven't built in overly high expectations as part of our guidance for Europe. I think one of the bigger changes is China, and the change there just relates to -- we were coming off a year ago very strong comparisons in China, and now, we see that that's kind of behind us, but we still keep a pretty solid base. But I thought Olivier answered the question around, kind of, outlook and confidence for China very well. I think the 5-year plan calls for them to invest in life sciences.","So the life science, we see no reason why even these tariff topics should have much of an impact there. The industrial business is probably a little bit more exposed but certainly, much less exposed than the industrial business we would have had 3 years ago for these moves that Olivier mentioned. So I think that would be my key comments.","Patrick Donnelly","And just for '19 on the guidance side, could you guys just let us know what the growth rates you're guiding for, for lab, industrial and food are? Just to -- want to make sure we have that.","Shawn Vadala","This is Shawn. So on the lab side, we would be doing, kind of, a mid-to-high single-digit. On industrial, kind of, more in line with the total group number. And then, on food retailing, we're currently looking at flattish, just given the pipeline of project activity looking towards next year.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays.","Jack Meehan","Bill, it was a short time but I echo, good working with you. I was hoping you could elaborate a little, either you or Shawn, as we look into 2019 on the gross margin line with some of the moving parts, whether it's the different currencies or tariffs and pricing and just, underlying productivity. If you could, kind of, walk us through some of those factors and what the build for gross margin looks like.","Shawn Vadala","Sure. Hey, I'll take that one. So in terms of 2019, we'd probably be looking at currency -- sorry, not currency -- gross margin benefit of probably like, say, 50 to 60 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. I'd start with the price increase. I mentioned earlier, we'd be looking at a price increase in the 2%-plus range. That would probably have about a 90 basis point improvement on the margin. Offsetting that would be the cost of the tariffs. The tariffs would be about 60 basis points. And then, on the differential, we've have some of the benefits of some of the productivity and other actions we've been taking place this year and maybe some of the upside of some of the benefits from our facility consolidations that Bill and Olivier talked about earlier in the call.","Jack Meehan","And then, maybe just continuing on that. Excited to see all the work in Tampa next week. Could you -- sorry if I missed it, but what was the CapEx forecast for '19? And could you just give us an update on the what the right pacing looks like as you wrap up some of these projects?","Shawn Vadala","Yes, so the total CapEx number would be about $120 million. And that still includes some facility CapEx because we have one more facility to go in the U.K. in our -- one of our product inspection facilities there, which requires additional capacity to keep up with the volume growth.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Tycho Peterson, JP Morgan.","Julia Qin","This is Julia on for Tycho today. First off, congrats, Bill. And on behalf of Tycho, thank you for being so great to work with and best of luck. So maybe to follow up on China. I know you guys mentioned mid-teens growth in the quarter. Could you maybe break that out by end market?","Shawn Vadala","I'm just going to -- I'll just run down the different business lines. So on the lab side, we did just under 20% in the quarter. And then, on the industrial business, we did a high single-digit.","Julia Qin","And then, how much of your China exposure is from the Pharma industry and to what extent did you benefit from the generic quality regulation in the past year?","Olivier Filliol","So we don't break out the details for a country. I would phrase it that way, the whole life science piece is one that has been steadily growing, and that's true actually for the laboratory business as well as pieces of the industrial business. And regarding your last point, it didn't have any particular impact for us. Remember, we are very strong in general labs, QC labs as well as R&D., and it's not particular in the bioresearch area or even medical area also. It's very, very broad based when we talk about life sciences industry. It would also include academics that is connected to life sciences.","Julia Qin","And then finally, on the services, how much was services as a percentage of revenue in the quarter? And how high do you think you can increase the mix to? And to the extent possible, can you comment on just the current service penetration rates within the biopharma and food markets particularly? And the runway you had?","Olivier Filliol","I've got to hand over afterwards to Shawn to give you the specific share for the quarter. When it comes to growth -- so the way we look at service is, we, over a midterm, we clearly see that service will outgrow product. I say the midterm because it doesn't necessarily happen in every quarter. If we have a very strong product quarter, that doesn't mean that service can top of it. But I expect that service is outgrowing product because we really have a great opportunities there. We have very strong value propositions and we, as we often refer to, we have strong programs like the iBase and marketing campaigns that is really addressing our installed base.","We're also using Big Data analytics for that. And then, we try to do more and more service under contracts. In that context, we talk about the attachment rate. And this is something that you build up over a years -- over years, because it's really hard work but one that has great payoff. We have very different service attachment rates by different countries and businesses. And so, just using a year-on-year universal number, would not be that insightful. But you will see on next Monday, we have actually a separate session that talks about service, and we're going to drill down in more details and to illustrate to you that what the value proposition is and how we do these iBase campaigns and contract attachment rates for the product inspection business specifically.","What's -- maybe one insight also that I already want to share with you today and I will talk to again also on Monday is that the service contract business is actually outgrowing the average service growth that we have also because the break\/fix part of the businesses is not growing as fast. And that's a consequence that our quality of our products actually are continuously improving. And so, there is these extra efforts going in, in the service contract business. And in the meantime, I'm sure Shawn has the number. And so, I'll hand over to you.","Shawn Vadala","Thanks, Olivier. So, Julia, the service as a percentage of our total revenue is 22%. And if we include consumables, that number would be 31%.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Derik De Bruin, Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin","Bill, it's been an interesting 15 years. It's been a pleasure. I'll miss you and I look forward to seeing your one-man show on Broadway the next time you're in town, because I assume that's what you're going to do, I can already envision it, Hamilton. So on that note, let's talk about net interest expense and sort of what you're thinking about for interest rates next year and how should we think about the interest expense and then interest expense for 2019 and this sort of leads on to a conversation about, you just annualized the Biotix deal. How are you looking at capital deployment beyond share buybacks, M&A. Do you feel comfortable in this environment levering up a bit if you need to -- just find something interesting.","Bill Donnelly","Hey, it's a timely question, I think, in terms of our capital structure. One of the things we've reviewed with the board in recent days is we think it's appropriate to start to gradually move our leverage up. We have tended to think that a medium-term number in 1.5 range, just for you guys that aren't tracking it, we're probably at about 1.1 right now, would be appropriate. I think we would look to be doing that over with a combination of M&A and share repurchases, if I just look back on past probabilities, for lack of a better expression. But I do think it would be appropriate to lever up a little bit more and I think we're going to that over maybe two years.","Derik De Bruin","And thinking about the last time, a couple of years ago, when China was topical and started to hit. I'm just curious, any signs of credit problems like we saw in the past? And then just on a broader note, I mean the currencies have moved so much. Is there any sense of hesitation that people don't have enough purchasing power right now, to go out and buy things, any sort of hesitation that FX, rather than the tariff issues, are causing some slowdowns in spending, or potentially?","Bill Donnelly","Just, maybe for the benefit of everybody, Derik, your memory is good. One of the things we've commented about in the past in China is there's not a free flow of credit like there is in the Western world. And so, a couple of comments in response. And then, because of that in times -- at times in the past, things have moved quickly or markets have deteriorated relatively quickly when the boys in Beijing dialed back credit a little. Now if I look at how we've moved our mix of business, kind of, again going back to this combination, to the point that Olivier made, that our industrial business today is a different industrial mix than it was three to five years ago.","And secondly, the percentage of our sales going into lab and product inspection is a lot bigger than it was five years ago. The two of those facts would make us, let's say, less susceptible to such items. But I think everyone that does business in China would acknowledge that a tightening of credit would flow through the market but sitting here today, we don't see signs of that, and we certainly would say that, given all the other uncertainties and what's going on in their stock market and how their government has typically worked to keep the economy going, I would not anticipate that and frankly, would be quite surprised if that happened. And we see no details in our credit-type stuff that would indicate that, that's the case with our customers nor in how the government's dealt with us in terms of bringing cash out of the country and that type of thing.","Derik De Bruin","And one final question. Just talking a little bit about supply chain moving around, east-west supply chain is like -- can you -- just a little bit broader plans on what you're doing to, sort of, mitigate some of the impact that you're seeing now?","Bill Donnelly","So I gave one specific example so I want to avoid repeating that. So for us, it's largely focused on our U.S. the impact is really on our U.S. industrial business, our U.S. retail business and our U.S. Ohaus business. And it's an impact on products we manufacture in China and sell into the U.S. market as well as some components that we bring into the country. So we haven't been impacted, we see no signs on, we're not impacted by the Chinese tariffs that they've put on some U.S. products, I mean, it's de minimus, and we also haven't seen any, let's call it, prejudice against our products in China, which frankly speaking most of what we sell in China is coming from Switzerland and everybody loves Switzerland.","And in terms of what we're doing now, we're doing as much as we can to mitigate as Shawn and Olivier talked about with regard to pricing, so where we think we can. But of course, Olivier would point out, pricing isn't without some volume consequences. And we're doing the little things that we can in supply chain like the example I gave in response to Ross's question, and we don't really want to do more permanent things because we hope that this would end but there would be additional steps we could take if this thing were to continue on for multiple years. But frankly, none of the mitigating steps would be as good as what we have now with our manufacturing capabilities in China.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Daniel Brennan, UBS.","Daniel Brennan","Bill, obviously it's been tremendous working with you and certainly hope to see around. So first question would just be on, what was the price realization in this quarter?","Shawn Vadala","Dan, this is Shawn. Price realization was about 2.7%.","Daniel Brennan","And then, Olivier, not to belabor China, just had one follow-up on your comments that you've already made, just so I understand it. So to the extent your demand was to be negatively impacted, is what you were basically portraying earlier in the conversation that basically would be just from slower economic growth in China that just kind of seeped into your customers or I know you talked about a spillover effect, but I'm just trying to think through, you talked about the clouds and you're not seeing it today but effectively, is that essentially what it is? Just kind of general slowdown in China, that would, kind of, be felt across your businesses?","Olivier Filliol","Yes, I think there are market segments that are today already impacted. Of course, there are exports related to discrete manufacturing segments that are impacted by the tariffs and when they export to the U.S. I think we will see more of that going forward. But these are typically markets that we don't sell to directly. However, if these market segments are slowing down, I would not exclude that they might also have an impact on other markets that partially supply the exporting segments. And so, I would not exclude that, for example, chemical segments will be impacted because the discrete manufacturing segments are buying less. That's one of the spillover effects that I was meaning. And overall, the economy in China might be impacted also just by the sentiments around these topics. But that's more a macroeconomic view than something that I see today already or the team tells me.","Daniel Brennan","And then, maybe as just one follow-up, I know Bill has already talked about it earlier in the quarter. But in terms of the core industrial business, which I know you've deemphasized some of the more cyclical areas within that business in China specifically, to kind of temper, I guess, the impact. But you just remind us today like how big that business is in China and give us some perspective on what that business did this quarter? And I know Shawn already mentioned 8% total industrial growth but more with the breakdown of core industrial and as you look out towards 2019, kind of, what are you baking in for that core industrial business in China?","Shawn Vadala","Yes, so the core industrial business in China is about 42% of the total business. That business was up high single-digit in the quarter. And as we, kind of, like, look to next year, hey, we'd probably be mid-single-digit and wouldn't be surprised if it's even a little bit lighter than that next year, just given the tough comparison that we have.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby, Cleveland Research.","Josh Waldman","It's Josh on for Steve. Just a quick one on the earnings guide for '19. You guided for 11% to 12% earnings growth. If I understand you, that's including the 5% headwind from FX and tariffs. So effectively guiding to 16% to 17% earnings growth in your initial guide. Just looking back over the last decade, the strongest earnings growth you guided to right out of the gate was 13%, last year was 13%. So given you're already absorbing this 5% headwind from FX and tariffs, how much cushion are you factoring in, in your initial guide compared to maybe years past?","Bill Donnelly","I think we do our -- as the guide guy for a long time, I think the guide process was similar to how it was in the past. I struggled a little bit to understand, I think if I -- I thought I heard you say that 13% has been our highest earnings per share number, and that -- I'm not sure where that number came from.","Josh Waldman","That was -- the 13% year-over-year growth in your guide just out of the gate for the following year.","Bill Donnelly","Our guide for -- yes. I think one thing certainly is that we have put some measures in place. I think that the comments with regard to foreign exchange are factual, the comments with regard to tariffs are factual now. If these tariffs were to go away because maybe, if I give you the example around that we talked about earlier on transfer pricing. If the tariffs went away tomorrow it's not that we would add 5% back on because it would probably be 3.5% maybe 4% back on because the tariff piece, the mitigating factors, it isn't 100% reversal.","So I think that one of the reasons that the earnings power is so good next year is that you have full benefits coming from some facility consolidation we did in Switzerland. We have full benefits of facility consolidation that we did in Tampa. We have the Stern Drive program now is maturing significantly. Shawn mentioned quite a bit of pricing power and that combination of things meant that our incremental margins, particular incremental margins excluding the impact of tariffs and foreign exchange, are excellent. So I, process wise, I think we went about it the same way. But yes.","Olivier Filliol","I'll add also that because of the tariffs, we have a little bit of higher inflationary environment particularly in the U.S, which allows us to do more on pricing. And that's, of course, we build in, and we did not have that in the recent years. Actually, the inflationary environment, we didn't have, and that's the reason why Shawn was sharing with you that we expect more than we normally would expect. And that alone has quite an impact on our EPS guidance.","Shawn Vadala","And hey, maybe one final comment is that we do get a little bit of benefit from reducing tax rate by another 50 basis points next year. So that's maybe 70 bps on the growth rate, which would round to 1%.","Operator","I'll now turn today's conference back to Mary Finnegan for closing comments.","Mary Finnegan","Thanks, Holly, and thanks, everyone, for joining us tonight.

I will start with a summary of the quarter and then Shawn will provide details on our financial results and guidance for the remainder of this year and for 2020. I will then have some additional comments and we will open the lines for Q&A.","The highlights for the quarter are on Page 3 of the presentation. Sales growth in the quarter was very good in our laboratory and industrial product lines. Food Retail declined 15%, worse than we expected the last time we spoke. Total local currency sales growth in the quarter was approximately 4.5%. And excluding Food Retail, sales growth was 6%, which is in line with our expectation at the beginning of the quarter. Excluding Food Retail, growth in the Americas was excellent while growth in Europe and Asia\/Rest of World was solid. We achieved very strong growth in operating margins and earnings per share despite meaningful headwinds due to adverse currency and tariff costs. Overall, we are very pleased with the strong results for the third quarter.","As we look to the remainder of 2019 and our initial thoughts for 2020, we face somewhat of a balancing act. On the one hand, we remain confident in our growth initiatives and our ability to continue to execute and gain market share. These initiatives have strong momentum and are well ingrained in the organization and surface well in an environment in which it is more important than ever to focus on the best growth opportunities within our markets.","The diversification of our business, products and end markets is particularly helpful when there are mixed signals in certain end markets. Our sales and marketing programs are tailored to help guide our sales force to our best opportunities. And on a positive front, is that we believe we will continue to see tangible results from our productivity and margin initiatives.","Offsetting this positive practice is that we sit here today with an economy that is more uncertain than 1 year ago as macroeconomic data continues to weaken. We will also continue to face headwinds from adverse currency and tariff costs. ","What does this mean when we take that all together? We continue to invest for growth but are cautious on the macro environment. We believe we can generate solid sales growth and strong earnings growth for 2019 and 2020. Shawn will provide more specifics, but I wanted to provide some context upfront.","Let me now turn it to Shawn to cover the financials and guidance.","Shawn Vadala","Okay. Thanks, Olivier. Sales were $753.9 million in the quarter, an increase of approximately 4.5% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, total sales increased 3% as currencies reduced sales growth by approximately 1.5% in the quarter. ","On Slide 4, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales grew 7% in the Americas, 2% in Europe and 4% in Asia\/Rest of World. Sales growth in Europe was particularly impacted by the decline in Food Retail. Absent Food Retail, Europe had sales growth of 4% in the quarter.","Food Retail reduced sales growth in the Americas by 2% and 1% in Asia\/Rest of World in the quarter. China had growth of 5%, pretty much in line with what we expected and was impacted by strong multiyear comparisons.","The next slide shows year-to-date results. Local currency sales growth increased 5% in the Americas year-to-date, 3% in Europe and 7% in Asia\/Rest of World. ","On Slide 6, we outline local currency sales growth by product area. In the quarter, laboratory sales grew 7%, industrial increased 5% with core industrial up 7% while product inspection increased 3%. Food Retail declined 15% in the quarter. And excluding Food Retail, our overall growth in the quarter was 6%.","The next slide shows year-to-date sales growth. Laboratory sales grew 8% in local currency, industrial grew 5% with core industrial up 7% and product inspection up 2%. Food Retailing declined 10% on a year-to-date basis. Overall, total sales were up 5% in local currency and 6% if we exclude Food Retailing on a year-to-date basis.","Now let me move to the rest of the P&L for the quarter, which is summarized on Slide 8. Gross margin in the quarter was 57.7%, a 60 basis point increase over the prior year level of 57.1%. Stern Drive initiatives on material costs and productivity and pricing were strong contributors to margin growth. We also had some mix benefit. Partly offsetting these positives were tariffs from the U.S.-China trade dispute and some costs associated with product launches.","R&D amounted to $36 million, which represents a 5% increase in local currency. SG&A amounted to $202.8 million, a 2% increase in local currency over the prior year. The increase was driven by investments in our field force and growth initiatives, offset in part by our cost savings initiatives.","Adjusted operating profit amounted to $196.2 million in the quarter, which represents an 8% increase over the prior year amount of $182 million. We estimate currency reduced operating income by approximately $3.5 million.","We also estimate tariffs were a gross headwind to operating income by approximately $4 million. Absent adverse currency and the gross impact of tariffs, operating income would have increased 12% in the quarter. Operating margins reached 26% in the quarter, a 120 basis point increase from the prior year. We're quite pleased with this increase given the meaningful headwinds we faced in the quarter.","A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $12.3 million in the quarter. Interest expense was $9.8 million in the quarter. Other income amounted to $2 million. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 20% and is before discrete items and adjusts for the timing of stock option exercises. ","Moving to fully diluted shares, which amounted to $24.9 million in the quarter and is a 3% decline from the prior year reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $5.77, a 13% increase over the prior year amount of $5.12. Absent currency and the gross impact of tariffs, our adjusted EPS growth would have been 17% in the quarter, a level we are very pleased at.","On a reported basis in the quarter EPS was $5.20 as compared to $4.93 in the prior year. Reported EPS includes $0.11 of purchase intangible amortization, $0.22 of restructuring related primarily to the two back-office cost-reduction actions. We also had a $0.24 difference between our quarterly and annual tax rate due to timing of stock option exercises.","The next slide shows our year-to-date P&L. We're quite pleased with the results, which shows local currency sales growth of 5%, operating margin improvement of 90 basis points and earnings growth of 11%. We are particularly pleased with these results given the meaningful headwinds we faced with adverse currency and tariff costs.","That is it for the P&L, and I'll now cover the cash flow. In the quarter, adjusted free cash flow amounted to $151.6 million, a 29% increase over the prior year on a per-share basis. Our working capital statistics remain solid with DSO at 39 days and ITO at 4.5x. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted free cash flow amounted to $345.1 million as compared with $298.6 million in the prior period. This represents a 19% increase on a per-share basis.","Let me now turn to guidance. Olivier provided some introductory comments on guidance, but let me reiterate a couple of points before providing the details. We continue to feel confident about our ability to execute on our growth and productivity initiatives. We believe we are well positioned to continue to gain share regardless of the macro environment. We also believe we can continue to expand our operating margins through our ongoing productivity and pricing programs. ","The factors outside of our control, namely the continued deterioration in the macroeconomic indicators makes cautious in our outlook. We believe our business is less susceptible to an economic downturn than in the past due to the greater percentage of our sales in laboratory and a shift within our industrial business to more attractive market segments. However, we don't believe we are immune to economic cycles. And although we remain in the investment mode, we remain agile to adapt as market conditions necessitate.","Just two final items to keep in mind. We will face very challenging comparisons in the fourth quarter and currency is worse as compared to the last time we spoke. Both tariffs and currencies will continue to be headwinds for our business. For the full year, we expect adverse currency and gross tariffs to reduce EPS growth by approximately 5% in 2019 and by almost 1.5% in 2020. ","Now let me cover the specifics. We continue to expect local currency sales growth in 2019 to be approximately 5%. Our full year sales guidance, excluding food retailing, remains at 6% in local currency. We now expect full year adjusted EPS guidance to be in the range of $22.65 to $22.70, which is a growth rate of 11% to 12%. We have narrowed the range in our Q3 beat is offset by a more negative currency. With respect to the fourth quarter, we would expect local currency sales growth to be approximately 3%, which is an 11% growth on a 2-year stack basis. We would expect this sales growth -- with this sales growth to result in adjusted EPS to be in a range of $7.66 to $7.71, a growth rate of 12% to 13%. ","For 2020, we expect local currency sales growth to be approximately 4% and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $24.85 to $25.10. Using the midpoint of 2019 guidance, this represent -- this results in a growth rate of 10% to 11%. This includes an estimated headwind of almost 1.5% from currency and the gross impact of tariffs. ","Some further comments on 2020 guidance. We expect interest expense to be approximately $40 million in 2020 and amortization to be approximately $53 million. Other income in 2020 will be approximately $2 million, which is a decline from 2019 principally due to lower expected pension income. ","In terms of free cash flow, we expect it to reach approximately $560 million in 2020, which is a 12% increase on a per-share basis. We will repurchase shares of approximately $800 million in 2020, which includes an incremental amount as we target a net-debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of 1.5x. As in the past, we will buy shares evenly throughout the year. ","Some additional details. With respect to the impact of currency on sales growth, we expect currency to reduce sales growth by approximately 1% in the fourth quarter 2019 and 2.5% for the full year 2019. In 2020, we expect currency to reduce sales growth by approximately 1%. ","Finally, as we typically do, we will provide updates on a quarterly basis for next quarter's EPS. However, I would like to point out that we would expect adjusted EPS growth in the first half of the year to be below the second half due to tougher comps and a more unfavorable impact from currency and tariffs. In particular, we would expect Q1 EPS growth to be below the low end of our full year guidance range. We will provide more specifics next year but wanted to point this out now as I know you'll be updating your models.","That is it from my side. I'll now turn it back to Olivier.","Olivier Filliol","Thanks, Shawn. Let me start by providing some additional comments on our operating results. Our lab business continues to perform very well with 7% local currency sales growth in the quarter, which was against very strong growth in the prior year. ","Most product lines did well, particularly if you look at it on a 2-year basis. Sales growth in the Americas and China was particularly strong. Our laboratory business is well positioned to continue to gain share. We spent a disproportionate amount in lab on investments in field resources, Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives and R&D investments. We expect market demands to remain favorable and expect solid growth in the fourth quarter and in 2020, although we face more challenging comparisons after several years of very strong growth.","In terms of our industrial business, product inspection was up in the quarter, in line with our expectations. Our expectation are for relatively flat growth in Q4 given strong prior year and we would expect low- to mid-single-digit growth in 2020. This growth is below our medium-term guidance as the packaged food manufacture end market continues to be mixed. We have not yet seen that large food manufacturers return to full investment mode, particularly with respect to global rollouts. We think this will take some additional time. We are very well positioned in this business, and we believe growth economics are very strong over the medium term given the focus on food manufacturers, on brand protection and expected growth opportunities in emerging markets.","Core industrial did very well in the third quarter with growth of 7% in local currency. We benefited from some project activity in Transportation and Logistics but have good growth even excluding this benefit. We are executing well in core industrial as this business is gaining traction with the Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives. Underlying market demand is good enough as we expect continued solid results, although this business had growth in Q4 last year of 13%. So they will face a particularly challenging comparison. Outlook for next year is solid, although we would expect growth in China to moderate modestly given a strong multiyear comparisons and slightly more challenging market dynamics.","Finally, Food Retail was down 15% in the quarter, which was worse than we expected. As we highlighted last quarter, this business is impacted by challenging market demand and the timing of customer project activity. We are managing this business for profitability and not for sales growth. We have enacted cost-reduction actions over the last year in light of the challenging conditions. We expect market conditions to remain challenging, but expect the business to return to modest growth next year aided by easier comparisons and new product launches.","Now let me make some additional comments by geography. I will start with Europe, which was up mid-single digits, excluding Food Retail. Lab had growth while core industrial did particularly well. Retail was down significantly. We believe our lab and core industrial markets in Europe are good enough to maintain replacement cycles. Q4 will be impacted by very strong prior year growth, but we would expect reasonable growth in 2020.","Americas had very strong growth in the quarter. Excluding food retailing, Americas grew 9% in the quarter. Lab had very strong growth while product inspection and core industrial had good growth as well. For the remainder of the year, we expect Americas to grow mid-single digits and also expect mid-single-digit growth in 2020. We believe markets will remain solid, but will be impacted by prior year comparisons.","Finally, Asia and rest of the world have solid growth with most business lines doing well. China had solid growth in the quarter with high-single-digit lab growth and mid-single-digit industrial, which was in line with our expectations and impacted by very strong growth in prior year. Our outlook for this region remains solid, but they will continue to face strong multiyear comparisons and a slightly more challenging environment. ","One final comment on the business. Service had another quarter of good growth in the period, up 7% in local currency for both the quarter and year-to-date. I will have some additional comments on service shortly. That concludes my comments on the different pieces of the business. As mentioned earlier, we remain confident that our growth initiatives can continue to generate additional market share. ","Let me give you a few examples. I will start with sales and marketing in which we are continuing to invest in new tools so field sales reps have more capacity for impactful customer interactions. Digitalization tools are one of the examples, including our new sales tool, the digital library. The library houses a vast array of materials, including videos, cross-selling overviews, customer references, value-selling guides and referrals. All the digitalization tools include field sales mobility solution at our mobile CRM, which allows sales reps to immediately follow up on customer requests and leads. We also utilize e-demos so our sales reps at the customer side can leverage the expertise of a product specialist via live demo. E-demos allow for greater reach as customers from multiple sites can participate and are especially effective for presenting our instruments that are highly complex or application-oriented. ","Digitalization is also at the heart of our e-commerce platform, which promotes the ease of doing business and allows for no-touch transactions while also further enhancing our relationship with the customer. Digitalization tools are just one example of how we are helping to ensure our sales force has the most direct interaction with customers with the greatest potential while also enhancing the customer experience.","Service continues to deliver good growth. It was up 7% to date and it accounts for about 28% of the total sales. Versus our direct competitors, service is an excellent competitive advantage as we have one of the largest, most global and best trained service force. Our service force keeps us close to customers and provides insights on how to best serve them. ","Global customers are increasingly asking for services to be delivered in a unified, consistent way across regions, countries and continents. To meet this need, we now offer 2 harmonized service levels, standard for noncontract customers where we respond within 3 days during regular hours; and service level agreements, which can be customized up to 4-hour response time and available 24\/7. It is hard for our direct competitors to offer such a service level agreement. ","We also provide value-added services. A good example is our digital performance verification for our product inspection customers. Targeted to food manufacturers who need to show compliance with safety regulations, this service assesses how an instrument performs according to global food safety initiative standards and provides documentation in digital format that can be assessed -- sorry, can be accessed worldwide by the customers' quality control teams. It is just one example of how we are helping customers execute and document routine tasks and maintain data integrity.","Consumables is another source of good growth for us and now represents about 10% of our total sales. Year-to-date, consumables are up 7%. Pipette tips are a key component of our consumable offering, which we enhanced with the acquisition of Biotix about two years ago. ","In addition to sales and marketing and service initiatives, our product portfolio is also an important source of growth. For example, we have developed a comprehensive solution for pipette asset management. A large biopharma company can have up to 10,000 pipettes at 1 site alone. The administrative cost of tracking each pipette's location, calibration status, audit certificates, service times and replacement schedules can be overwhelming. ","To help manage this, we have developed a comprehensive solution that combines an asset management software with our unique SmartStand, which holds our pipettes with an embedded RFID chip that indicates when the next service and calibration are due. The software connects multiple SmartStands and tracks and manage all pipette brands and models in the lab. Our solution helps customers save time and increase productivity while providing integrated data and traceability for quality control and compliance. This is just one example of our technology leadership, and we have many more within our product portfolio.","That concludes our prepared comments. We are very pleased with our results in the quarter and year-to-date. While more uncertainty exists in the global economy, we believe we are well positioned to gain share and deliver good earnings growth. ","With that, I want to ask the operator to open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JP Morgan.","Ruizhi Qin","This is Julia on for Tycho. So maybe to start off, regarding your commentary on Europe, I think I heard you saying that industrial was particularly strong in that region. We're just comparing to some of the other commentary we've heard from your peers. So could just give us a little more color on that?","Olivier Filliol","Yes. Indeed, we were very happy about the performance. I think it's a reflection of an economy that is good enough for us, but then a very strong execution by the team in terms of the Spinnaker initiatives, in terms of focusing on the right end-user segments. And we had also some good product launches that helped us. So indeed, really a good performance. ","What I, however, would also add here, the part of the economy that is particularly weak in Europe is not necessarily one that we have a focus on, so thinking of machinery, automobile industry and so on. These are not the most important industry segments for us.","Ruizhi Qin","Got it. And -- sorry, go ahead.","Shawn Vadala","Yes. It's fine, Julia.","Ruizhi Qin","Okay. And then regarding Food and Retail, I'm just wondering what drove the negative surprise in the quarter. And how has your visibility into that business line has changed? Because I think you previously said that you typically have pretty good visibility a quarter ahead. So just wondering, are there any changing dynamics there that you'd like to call out? ","And then as we look at your 2020 guidance, obviously, for lab and industrial, you're still having pretty strong momentum there. So with the 4% constant currency growth, is that all sort of due to food weakness that you're expecting for next year? And what would be the guidance excluding food?","Olivier Filliol","So I will take the first part and then Shawn covers the second part of the question. So back to retail and visibility, indeed, we have a reasonable visibility within the quarter. But our visibility is supported by good diversification across regions and across businesses. And so I think in retail, we certainly have a reasonable visibility to very large projects, but then there is an underlying business that we can't properly predict the whole quarter. ","What plays also in the weakness of retail is that the big projects did not come in as expected. And so we experienced that weakness in particular also from that end. We expect, as we did talk on the prepared remarks, retail to continue to be a challenge here for another 1, 2 quarters. It's also because we are managing this business too with profitability and not top line. And yes, I -- it's not a fundamental shift, but we do recognize that this market in food retailing is a challenging market right now. We expect that the latter part of next year will look better for us.","Shawn Vadala","Yes. In terms of the second part of your question, Julia, if I look at 2020 for retail, for the full year, we probably imagine modest growth of low single digit. But during the first half of the year, we wouldn't be surprised if we see it down slightly during Q1 and Q2, but down in kind of like low-single-digit kind of a range. If we look at the full year, excluding Food Retail, not as much of an impact as we would have seen in 2019, but modestly better than the 4%. ","And if I just kind of like walk down the divisions or the business areas, lab, we're probably looking at lab in the mid-single-digit range next year. I mean keeping in mind, we have very good momentum in that business, feeling very good about the execution, but just acknowledging we're coming off of several years of very strong growth there. On the core industrial side, probably looking at more low single digit next year. We've been growing very fast in that business since the fourth quarter of last year. As a reminder, the core industrial business grew 13% in Q4 of last year, and we've been at very strong growth levels in the high-single-digit range for most of this year. ","And then if we look at product inspection, probably more in the low- to mid-single-digit range next year. This is acknowledged below our longer-term expectations. We still feel very good about the business from a long-term perspective, given our many competitive advantages, but just acknowledging some softness in the packaged food segment.","Ruizhi Qin","Got it. That's very helpful. And then lastly from me regarding China. I think last quarter, you had double-digit lab growth in China and a high-single-digit for industrial. It seems like it has moderated a little bit. So just wondering if there are any comp dynamics that you'd like to call out and how should we think about your outlook for China in the near term? Have there been any changes?","Olivier Filliol","So indeed, there is a comp topic. We had here in China many quarters of very good results, and that starts now to play in. Absent of that, we feel still very good about our business in China. We have an excellent leadership position there. We have, in average, probably a 25% market share, which is about similar to what we have in the group. We have the Spinnaker programs that are executed really particularly also well in China. And we are benefiting from a good diversification of the end-user markets that we serve. ","So these are all very strong assets that we bring here, and I feel that our end-user industries that we are focused on are actually still going well in China. So all in all, good, but then we have these comparison topics and, of course, we also see that there are parts of the Chinese markets that are weaker. We are just less exposed, but I'm not pretending that we are totally immune to that one.","Operator","Your next action comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Barclays.","Jack Meehan","Just back on the core industrial business, that's kind -- despite some of the macro commentary, seemed to continue to do well. I was wondering if -- you did mention some discrete projects, which may help the quarter, what would the growth have been like otherwise? And then, Shawn, as we're thinking about 2020, is there any phasing within that low-single-digit outlook you talked about for 2020 as you look at the year for core industrial?","Shawn Vadala","Yes. Jack, I mean, we called out a little bit some project activity in our T&L business. We actually see excellent momentum in that business kind of continuing for the medium term. There are some very interesting things going on in that business for us. So I wouldn't view it as necessarily a onetime topic for next year. But if we exclude that, I don't have that number, but it -- I don't think the number is also that significant on the overall division. ","What's been really interesting to us is that the growth in industrial has been extremely broad-based geographically and in a lot of our product categories as well. And I just feel like the -- this focus on the more attractive segments of the market really has gained momentum over the last year. And as I mentioned in my previous comments with Julia, I mean, we grew 13% in core industrial in Q4 of last year and we've really seen strong execution throughout this year. ","As I look to 2020, I haven't thought too much about pacing, but I can imagine Q1 might be a little bit lower than the other quarters, could be flat, more flattish to modest growth just given that we have a very difficult comparison in the previous year, but frankly, haven't put a lot of thought into that one and we don't have very good visibility going out that far at this moment in time but, of course, we'll give you an update the next time we talk.","Jack Meehan","Yes. That's fair. And then on the gross margin, so up 60 basis points year-over-year. I think that's the best progression you've had in a while. Can you walk us through some of the moving parts with FX, tariffs and pricing, just what the drivers of that were?","Shawn Vadala","Yes. Sure. Again, no, very pleased with the margin expansion in the quarter, also came in line with what we had expected at least. Price realization did well. It was about 2.5%. Again, that was probably a little bit better than what I was thinking when -- the last time we would have spoken. That would have had a benefit of about 100, 110 basis points on the margin. Kind of offsetting that was the gross impact of the tariffs of 50 basis points. And so I think those are really the 2 items that -- to call out. There was certainly a lot of things offsetting each other that were smaller in nature going either way, but nothing worth really mentioning.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan from UBS.","Daniel Brennan","Olivier, just back to geographies or, Shawn, just for a moment. Just I don't think you mentioned this, but just how do we think about China and Europe, specifically, as you look at the fourth quarter in 2020? I think it may have been asked earlier, but I'm just kind of -- think about, yes, the comps are a little bit easier for 2020, but just trying to get a flavor for how you're kind of modeling it.","Shawn Vadala","Yes. Right now, -- yes. Thanks, Dan. So right now, for Q4, we're looking at probably more mid- to high-single-digit growth. But as we look to 2020, right now, we're assuming mid-single-digit growth. I would imagine the lab business will do better, maybe high single digit but probably a more cautious view on the industrial business, not that we're particularly seeing anything in our business, but just given the overall environment there that's kind of how we're thinking about it right now. Like every year with China, there's always upsides and downsides and things can change quickly.","Daniel Brennan","Got it. And then I'm sorry, for Europe, Shawn, I don't know if you gave those numbers for 2020, just wondering how you think about it.","Shawn Vadala","For Europe, right now, we're thinking probably low single digit in Europe, and then just to be clear, for Americas, mid-single digit.","Daniel Brennan","Got it. And then, Olivier, I know you talked about the global economy and kind of where we're at. You guys are kind of powering through with the exception of Food Retail. But just kind of your sense for 2020, I mean the guide of 4%. Is it there anything you see? Are there -- I mean like what indicators do you watch because you've been kind of highlighting the risks for about 4 or 5 quarters and yet, with exception of Food Retail, the business has held in well. So I'm just wondering about -- it seems like you're warning that something may come, but maybe it won't come. So just can you give us a flavor for what are some of the indicators you're watching?","Olivier Filliol","All the indicators that we have internal still look favorable. I think we commented before, we have in retail and in the packaged food area some end markets that are more challenging. But absent of that, all our KPIs that we have internally, leads growth, all that stuff looks favorable. We are very pleased about the team being focused on execution. We see good results of our sales and marketing programs. So that's unchanged. And we feel good. ","I think the overall economy, we look at PMI metrics, we look at economics, and we want to take that in our consideration. And in that sense, we continue to talk about also clouds, economic clouds. I think that was one word that I used a year ago. And I would still apply it here. But it's not that we see something particularly worrying or that the clouds get really dark here. Yes, in that sense, not anything that is so different to what we experienced the last few quarters. And we always said, the economy needs to be good enough for us to grow, and we feel the economy is good enough.","Daniel Brennan","And then maybe one final just on Food Retail. I know it's a small part of the business, but is it -- so in 2020, it gets better from a comp basis. And then as you look out, are there fundamental issues or kind of benefits that will improve do you feel like with the supermarket industry or the other parts of the industry you're serving just given the pressure from the Internet?","Olivier Filliol","I think the challenges will remain, but we will have adjusted to that. The comparisons will become easier, of course. But we have been also proactive in restructuring parts of this business, and we will have the benefit of that behind us. That's also one of the reasons why we feel like the second part of next year will be better. And that should position us well also for the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar","Olivier, just maybe one on the 20 comments you're making. If I understand it correctly, what you're saying is we want to be cautious but you haven't seen any deceleration in either industrial or food versus what you're seeing right now. This is more of a cautious tone you're just taking, but from an actual trend that you're seeing so far, you haven't seen any deceleration. Is that a fair comment?","Olivier Filliol","Yes. That's a fair comment. And in contrary, I would say, what we are seeing year-to-date in the business, absent of product inspection and food retailing, we are very pleased that we have not seen a slowdown in the momentum from -- so it's yes. And this is true for all the relevant KPIs. So not just kind of the reported sales we -- growth activity, leads generation and all that stuff.","Vijay Kumar","That's helpful. And then maybe one on the assumptions around '20. It looks like just based on at the EPS, maybe there's some moderation in margin expansion for next year, not sure if this is FX or what kind of FX you're assuming. Maybe any comments on incremental margins next year?","Shawn Vadala","No. I mean, I think when I look at our guidance for margins, I feel actually pretty good. From an operating profit margin perspective, there might be a little bit of currency noise there. But excluding currency, we're looking at operating margin expansion of about 90 basis points, which is closer to the higher end of our typical guidance of 70 to 100 basis points. When I look at the incremental margins, I mean, we're looking at 40 -- north of 40%. And when I look at the gross profit margin level, it probably is in the 40% to 50% kind of a range. So overall, yes, we feel pretty good about our margin expansion story.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Wolfe Research.","Stephen Beuchaw","I wanted to ask just one housekeeping question for Shawn, and then a couple on customer dynamics for either Shawn or Olivier. Shawn, I wonder if you could just speak to the tariffs impact that you have embedded in the guidance for 2020. Just operationally, how and where is that manifesting? And then I have a couple on customer dynamics.","Shawn Vadala","Yes. Sure. Thanks, Steve. So for tariffs right now, the direct impact of the tariff is about a 0.5% headwind to EPS next year. And just to maybe proactively address the currency it's probably -- well, close to a 1% headwind next year as well, too.","Stephen Beuchaw","Sorry, but the question was with tariffs, is it -- what is it about the tariffs? Is it about redomiciling something operationally? Or is it a direct -- more direct impact?","Olivier Filliol","No. No. It's a direct impact. It's the costs that we incur because we import products out of China. To recall, a significant part of our production is based in China and then we export. And when they arrive in U.S., we have tariffs that apply to that. And the -- always the assumptions that we use on these calls is what has been communicated, and we are not taking any speculation of what might change or not.","Shawn Vadala","Yes. Just to be clear, we're assuming the 25% rate on the enacted tariff stays in place.","Stephen Beuchaw","Okay. Perfect. So then two on customer dynamics, and then I'll jump back in queue. One is on pharma. You guys have pretty substantial exposure to pharma as a customer base. Can you talk about what you've seen in terms of demand trends there and what the assumption is for 2020? ","And then on China, I appreciate the comments about the operating environment. Certainly, they're making a lot of sense. I just want to make sure that in your narrative when you are not calling out any more challenging tender dynamics or local competition or local preference, any of those items, just to make sure you're indicating that you're not seeing any of that.","Olivier Filliol","Yes, thanks. Let's start with life science or pharma. Actually, why I say life science, that's the way we look at our business. We don't particular narrow it down just to be pharma. Also, our life science business has big pharma, CROs. We include also biotech companies. So it's relatively broad-based. This is about 30% of our revenue. And it has been a market that is doing well for us. We have very good competitive positions. We have -- this is an end use these competitive differentiations that we have, and there are also additional beneficial things happening like data integrity, which is becoming more important also. So it is a very good end-user industry, going well for us globally. And what's important to us, at the end of the day, it's a market that is still nicely diversified because we have not just big pharma; it's small and big and it's across geographies. And historically, what we have seen is there were times when big pharma was restructuring in the West, but then you saw a lot of CROs coming up in the East. And we have benefit from that and I -- looking forward, I see that underlying diversification, that is also beneficial for us, but we certainly count strongly on life science industry. We continue to invest in it. And it's certainly one of the markets that we expect us to continue to win market share. The second question, Shawn, do you want to take that one or...","Shawn Vadala","Yes. I think the second question was in China, any local preference. I think the short answer is we're not experiencing that like some of the other peer-group companies are. In China, we're very much viewed as a local company. We've been there for over 30 years. We employ a lot of people. We make a lot of products there, very strong reputation in the market. If anything, we would be probably secondly viewed as a Swiss company in China as opposed to an American company.","Olivier Filliol","And so bottom line, we don't have any disadvantage here or we don't see any problems coming up or so. I think contrary, I would say we have a trend in the Chinese market where quality really matters and people are, in that sense, willing to pay premiums also for Western brands, so we feel good about that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Derik De Bruin","So just a question, just sort of thinking about some of the past brands when we saw you give relatively conservative balance and then sort of like beat that. Is -- when we look for next year and you look into it, was there any sort of like pockets of where people didn't buy in lab and industrial because they were worried about tariffs or worried about trade? I'm just basically saying is like do you think there's some catch-up spending to be done in 2020? Is there -- thinking about what happened back in the 2016, '17 time frame when you had the catch-up trading, what the -- when your China industrial business was down so much, just wondering if that dynamic will repeat for next year.","Olivier Filliol","No. I don't -- I think we referred that in the past as pent-up demand. I don't see that. And I see it -- and I say so because I don't see that we are experiencing a particular [indiscernible] declining here or -- we are expecting that the economy remains about the same as it is now. And I used the term also before \"good enough.\" So the good enough actually implies that there isn't customers holding back and then we would expect a pent-up the following year. ","And in terms of our guidance being conservative or so, I would say we did it in the same -- similar way as last year. Of course, to our guidance there are upsides and downsides, but I don't feel that we are more conservative or more bullish than last year.","Derik De Bruin","Great. That's helpful. And then just -- I mean, I realize that you're guiding based upon what the current political situation looks like. But if the tariff situation between the U.S. and China goes away, does that -- or normalizes, does that impact your ability in any way at all to sort of like how you would get pricing for next year, i.e., would you not get as much pricing because you took some this year?","Olivier Filliol","So if tariffs would go away, I would see an upside in our EPS and our margins. I feel like we kind of keep the current pricing power that we have. There are a few things that would -- we would reverse. But in general, there is a significant upside to EPS if the tariffs would really go away and particularly, because I would think that currencies might also change everyone there. But what I would not automatically assume is that the top line would improve because of that. Again, I don't feel we lost business because of the trade war. Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research.","Stephen Willoughby","A couple for you. First, I guess, Shawn, just a few housekeeping items. I apologize if you did mention it, but have you -- did you provide specific operating margin, tax rate and share count guidance for next year?","Shawn Vadala","I think so. But I don't mind going over it again. In terms of operating margin, we're looking at margin expansion excluding currency of 90 basis points. In terms of tax rate, we're assuming we maintain our rate of 20%. And in terms of weighted average shares, we're estimating just over $24 million -- I mean 24 million shares.","Stephen Willoughby","Yes. And then just a follow-up question maybe for Olivier. The product inspection business, if we take a little bit longer-term view, going back a few years, it was a business that consistently grew in the double-digit range. And it's been closer to flattish or low-single-digit growth over the last 2 years. I understand that some of these customers are under financial pressures, but just wondering what your view is on kind of the longer-term potential growth in this business as I wasn't sure how much of the sales from customers are discretionary versus more kind of driven by regulation.","Olivier Filliol","Just to clarify, we might have had quarters with double-digit growth, but we are more high single digit. And the high single digit, sometimes in quarters, we can have a very big project and therefore, it can be the double digit. But medium term, long term, I expect us to have this mid- to high-single-digit growth in product inspection. It is driven because we have really an exceptional strong market position. We are the only one that will -- or have a lead in all the core technologies. So including check weighing methods, x-ray and vision inspection. We have a fantastic service network that customers really value. And we are really a partner to global accounts to -- for global rollouts. And these global rollouts are driven by requirements to protect the brand. ","It is regulation-driven but indirectly. In a sense, the regulation specifies how recalls need to take place. And that incurs a lot of cost and, again, also damages to brands when you need to do recalls. But it's up the different accounts to decide how they protect themselves. And we certainly feel that installing our instruments at the end of a packaging line is the best insurance and allows to really protect the interests of the company and provide the best quality to customers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Knight from Janney.","Paul Knight","Olivier, could you talk about the particular products that you are driving this accelerating growth in lab products as 2020 rolls out?","Olivier Filliol","I wouldn't narrow it down to any particular product. We talked about this on past calls, that we have the most modern product portfolio in lab that we have ever had, but this across all the product lines. So this is true for pipette, this is true for analytical chemistry, this is true for our automated chemistry, it's also true for our lab balances. So it's the whole portfolio. ","It's not things that I would say only benefits us in the last 2 quarters. This is an ongoing thing. We benefited last year and we're certainly going to benefit next year. In our business, as an individual, new product doesn't really move the needle. It's the sum of things and having this technology leadership that allows us to win new customers and also allows us to raise prices, gives us this pricing power.","Paul Knight","And then what is pricing power a year? Is it 100 bps, 200 bps, low single digits?","Shawn Vadala","Yes. Going forward -- I mean, Paul, of course, this year, we did very well. We're 2.5% year-to-date. We've been north of 2% in the last couple of years. As we kind of guide, we typically think about 150 bps. As I look at next year, 150 to 200 basis points is probably a reasonable range.","Paul Knight","Okay. And then lastly, you had mentioned earlier that consumables were 10%. How much is the software content now and service content of Mettler-Toledo?","Olivier Filliol","So service is 23%. And then we have -- it's 10% from consumables, that's why we say we have about a 1\/3, which is really recurring. And both have been growing very nicely this year, about the 7% range.","Paul Knight","Okay. Congratulations.","Olivier Filliol","Thanks.","Shawn Vadala","Thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard","Olivier, just curious if you could share an update on Stern Drive with us and perhaps quantify the net savings from that program in '19 and the incremental opportunities you see in '20.","Olivier Filliol","Yes. So it has really good momentum. Happy to -- that you raise the question because yes, it's one of the contributors to our margin expansion. We have really all the producing organizations across the world engaged in this. We really see benefits in terms of productivity on the shop floor. We see benefits in material costs. We have very good new additional initiatives of sub-projects also for next year. You might recall at an earlier call, we mentioned that we have about 300 sub-projects on the Stern Drive, and we have a similar number of projects also going into next year. ","In terms of results this year, we're very happy about this and so, in that sense, achieving our target. And I expect about the same benefit over next year from the program. And to highlight, we look at Stern Drive in a similar way as to Spinnaker. It's a journey, i.e., I expect this to be incremental every year, and I wouldn't be surprised if in 10 years, we are still going to talk about Stern Drive on this call.","Brandon Couillard","Very good. And then, Shawn, could you give us the CapEx number for '20?","Shawn Vadala","The CapEx number for '20, just 1 second, Brandon. Just under $110 million.","Operator","That was our last question. At this time, I will now turn the call back over to the presenters.","Mary Finnegan","Thanks, Mike, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this evening.

I am happy to have you join the call today. I am joined here by Olivier Filliol, our CEO and Bill Donnelly, our Executive Vice President. I need to cover just a couple of administrative matters. First, the call is being webcast and is available for replay on our website. A copy of the press release and the presentation that we will refer to is also available on the website.","Let me summarize the Safe Harbor language, which is outlined on page one of the presentation.

I will start with a summary of the quarter and then Bill will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments before we open the lines for Q&A.","The highlights for the quarter are on page two of the presentation. We had local currency sales growth of 5% in the quarter with strong results in the Americas. We also performed well in Europe and are very pleased with the growth in this region, particularly given the strong comparisons from the previous year. Our industrial business in China has proven more challenging than expected, but our lab and retail business in China did quite well, as did most of the other regions in Asia and rest of world.","With the continued benefit of our margin enhancement and cost control initiatives, we again generated good growth in EPS of 13% in the quarter and this despite currency headwinds. While economic uncertainty exists and currency will continue to be a headwind for us, we feel good about our growth prospects for 2015 and beyond.","I will have some further comments later on the call, but now will turn it to Bill to cover the numbers.","Bill Donnelly","Okay. Thanks, Olivier and hello, everybody. Sales were $535.7 million in the quarter, an increase of 5% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales decreased by 3% as currency reduced sales by about 8% in the quarter.","Turning to page three of the presentation, we outline sales by geography. In the quarter, local currency sales increased by 7% in the Americas, 2% in Europe and 5% in Asia and rest of world as compared to the prior year. Two areas that underperformed in the quarter were our industrial business in China and our Russian business overall. In China, our laboratory business did very well in the quarter but our industrial business was weaker than expected with a decline of approximately 22%. As a result, local currency sales growth in China declined by 7% in the quarter. Russia was down by 40% in the quarter, which impacted our growth rate in Europe. looking at Europe, excluding Russia, we had a growth of about 4.5% in the quarter.","Turning to slide number four, we outline sales growth by product area for the quarter. Laboratory was strong with an 8% increase in local currency sales, industrial increased by 1% and food retailing increased by 5% in the quarter.","Turning now to slide number five, let me walk you through the key P&L items in the quarter. Gross margins were 55.8%, a 270 basis point increase over the prior year margin of 53.1%. We are very pleased with this increase. Currency contributed approximately 100 basis points of the increase including the benefit of the gain on the Swiss Franc, Euro hedges that we discussed earlier this year. Pricing, volume, material cost reduction and mix all contributed positively to the margin improvement. These improvements were offset by investments in our field service organization.","R&D was $28.5 million and that was a 2% increase in local currency. SG&A amounted to $173 million, which is an increase of 8% in local currency. Increased investments in our field sales organization as well as higher variable compensation and employee benefit costs were the primary contributors to the increase.","Adjusted operating income amounted to $97.3 million in the quarter and that's a 7% increase over the prior-year of $91 million. We estimate that currency reduced operating income by $3.5 million and that was a 4% headwind to our operating profit growth.","Our operating margins were 18.2%, that's a 170 basis point increase over the prior year. Margins benefited by 70 basis points due to currency as a percentage impact of currency on the sales line was larger than the impact on operating profit. We are very pleased with the underlying margin improvement of more than 100 basis points on a apples-to-apples basis.","A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization was $7.5 million in the quarter while interest expense was $6.7 million. Other income was $817,000 and that includes currency gains. Our effective tax rate continues to be 24%.","Fully diluted shares for the quarter were 28.8 million, which is a 4.4% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted earnings per share was $2.25 cents, an increase of 13% over the prior year amount of $2.00. Currency reduced earnings per share growth by approximately 4.5%, on track with what we outlined to you last quarter.","On a reported basis, earnings per share was $2.19 per share, as compared to a $1.93 in the prior-year. Reported EPS includes restructuring charges of $0.02 per share and $0.04 of purchased intangible amortization.","Now turning to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter amounted to $41.3 million, a 27% increase on a per share basis as compared to the prior year. We continue to benefit from good working capital management. In particular, DSO improved three days to 45 days as compared to the prior year. We are pleased with this level of DSO and our IPO also, which remained at 5.0.","Let me now turn to guidance. Forecasting continues to be challenging as we have several factors to take under consideration. First, we are very pleased with our continued strong performance in both the Americas and Europe. We believe we are operating well in both of those regions and are continuing to gain share. Second, we are well on track with our field turbo program that we discussed with you last quarter. As a reminder, this is a program which will meaningfully increase our field resources during 2015.","Offsetting these positives, however, is caution regarding certain emerging market countries, but especially our Chinese industrial business. Demand in our industrial business in China declined 22%, as I mentioned, this quarter. Weakness was seen in most end markets and product categories. We were disappointed in the results and now believe industrial sales in China will be lower in 2015 than we discussed with you last quarter.","The factors facing this business, which we have been talking to you about, namely overcapacity in certain sectors, reduced level of government projects and foreign direct investment in a weak export market are taking longer to resolve than we had originally anticipated. It is clear that demand pulled back meaningfully to begin this year. We now believe China will be down for the full year with good growth in lab, offset by industrial decline. We would expect some improvement in the second half but it will not be enough to turn around our slow start to the year.","Let me elaborate on two items in particular. One, this decline came relatively quickly and was broad-based. There was clearly a pullback in CapEx for our type of products in recent months. Q2 will not be better and we expect declines in our Chinese industrial business to continue into the second half of the year. The second point we want to make is that we see no evidence that the competitive dynamics have changed. We have studied international and Chinese competitors and see no signs of different performance. On the one hand, we take some comfort in this, but we are also disappointed in our Chinese results and are seeking to return to our above market growth. Olivier will have some additional comments on China in a second.","With that backdrop, let me cover some of the specifics. Principally due to the weaker than expected results in our industrial business in China as well as our Russian operations, we now expect local currency sales growth for the full year will be at the lower end of our previously provided sales guidance of 4% to 5%. At the same time, we are raising the bottom end of our range by $0.05 and now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $12.75 to $12.90, which is a growth of between 9% and 10%. Adjusting for currency, it represents a growth of 13% to 14%. We are incorporating our Q1 beat into our updated guidance but this is offset to some degree by the reduction in the midpoint of our sales guidance.","Now turning to the second quarter. We would expect local currency sales growth to be approximately 4%. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of between $2.75 and $2.80, a growth rate of 7% to 9%. Currency will reduce EPS growth by approximately 3.5% in this quarter.","One additional comment on currency for your models. We expect currency to reduce sales growth for the full year by approximately 7% and for the second quarter, we would expect currency to reduce sales growth by approximately 9%.","Okay, that's it from my side and I want to turn it back to Olivier.","Olivier Filliol","Thanks, Bill. Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab did very well in the quarter with local currency sales growth of 8%, which was on the top of good growth in the prior year. Analytical instruments, pipettes and process analytics did particular well, but we had growth in all product lines. In terms of regions, Americas and Asia and Rest of world did very well and we had growth in Europe too. We continue to benefit from our sales and marketing programs and strong product pipeline. Our industrial business was up 1% in the quarter with product inspection up mid-single digits and core industrial down low-single digits. We had particularly strong growth in industrial in the Americas. Retail came in a little better than expected with growth in the mid-single-digits","Now let me make some additional comments on geography. Americas continues to perform very well. We had very strong growth in lab and industrial. Growth reflects the strong economy in the United States as well as good performance by our team. As mentioned earlier, we are very pleased with our growth in Europe, particularly given the strong comparisons from a year ago and headwinds due to the downturn in Russia. We had good growth in most regions in Western Europe. Eastern Europe was down driven by Russia. We expect Russia to continue to be a drag on sales growth in the near-term. With respect to China, I am very pleased with our lab business, which was up double digits. We are well positioned in this business and market demand appears robust.","You heard from Bill, the weakness we are currently seeing in our industrial and the outlook for China for the remainder of this year. I think it's worth mentioning that we continue to feel very good about China overall and our Chinese industrial business specifically in the medium to long-term. We are competing well and maintain solid market position in this region. Furthermore the long-term dynamics remain very favorable. Specifically, the growth in GDP and GDP per capita will lead to more consumption of packaged foods, pharmaceutical and cosmetics as well as greater attention to consumer safety.","Furthermore, the government's determination to transform the economy and focus on quality of growth is driving more commitment to science and continue to increase in the number of scientists graduating. Finally, we expect overall quality related regulation to continue to increase. All these factors are positive for our China business, particularly our lab business, but our industrial business as well. We expect China to be a source of above average growth in the future.","We have talked a lot about China, but let me also comment on the rest of Asia. We have very strong performance in India, Southeast Asia, Korea and Australia and that strong performance will continue. Our Asian franchise and Asian teams are strong and we see the good long-term opportunities. One final comment on the quarter. We are pleased with growth in service and consumables which grew 6% for the quarter.","I mentioned last quarter that our product pipeline is more robust than ever. I have a couple of additional examples to share with you this quarter. Last month, we launched our new generation of mid-range balance portfolio. These instruments are used daily in research labs, quality control and manufacturing for a wide variety of daily applications and tasks. The new generation of balances focuses on simplifying daily weighing tasks through built-in applications and a weighing guide to improve productivity. Our proprietary weighing cell and expanded warning features helps to ensure accurate results and is also fully traceable. The instrument is intuitive to operate and has a unique user-friendly touch screen which is almost twice the size of anything in the market today. We expect good traction in the market with this introduction.","We also had an important launched recently on the industrial side, our new multifunctional terminal. This new generation of midrange terminals has a larger higher resolution display with enhanced user interface. It helps improve productivity through a more powerful workflow, improved connectivity and enhanced data management. Unique in the industry, it also has the capability for remote services port via a secured connection in compliance with ISO standards. Particularly in the manufacturing of high-value items such as active pharmaceutical ingredients, the avoidance of down time and proactive notification of potential weighing system inaccuracy is critical.","Monitoring sensors and our remote capability allows managers to be notified when something in the weighing process needs attention or they can establish alert for certain events such as expired calibration or if the scale weight is overcapacity. All these actions help to reduce expensive downtime risks or inaccurate weighing performance. These are just two examples that I felt worthwhile highlighting as they represent core products for both lab and industrial but also demonstrates our ability to continue to innovate in these product areas.","Let me make some concluding comments and then open it up for your questions. We are cautious on the global economy, particularly the timing of the recovery in our Chinese core industrial business. Despite some weakness here, we remain confident about our full-year sales growth target and we believe we are well-positioned to continue to gain market share by capitalizing on our field turbo investments, our ongoing sales and marketing programs and strong product pipeline. We also continue to focus on margin enhancement initiatives which should continue to drive good earnings growth.","I will now ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley,","Steve Beuchaw","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions and bringing the new guy on the call. First, I might actually start with, let's say, the brighter side of the China market, China lab. I wonder if you think about the balance of industrial and lab in China, so number one is, is the lab business actually accelerating? And number two, Bill, maybe you could reiterate your perspective on 2016? I know you have commented before that you are more optimistic about China industrial, but if China industrial is down this year, how do we think about China industrial's relative contribution in 2016 versus 2015, just thinking about the scale of those businesses? And then I have a follow-up?","Olivier Filliol","So let me take maybe the first part of the question. The first thing I want to say, we, for many years, said our Chinese business is skewed toward industrial versus our global average and what we are seeing now for a while is that the lab business is doing better than industrial and accordingly the mix start also to shift to gradually to lab and we have seen now good lab momentum for quite a while. I wouldn't say that the lab, we see an acceleration in lab growth, I would say, hey, we are continuously happy with what we are seeing. I think last year we had similar results and I do expect that this goes on in that way. And I am happy when I see kind of high single-digit, low double-digit growth for lab. I think that's a very healthy number and if it continues that way, we are happy.","Bill Donnelly","So maybe a couple of more granular comments on the China industrial and then I will speak to your comments, maybe about 2016. So when we look at the numbers in our Chinese industrial business, it was interesting for us that it was pretty consistent across pretty much every customer segment, pretty much all the industrial product categories and as well it was interesting it was smaller size orders as well as larger order. So one of the takeaways from us on that last point is that there appears to be a pullback not just in new projects but in, what you would call, typical replacement cycle stuff in China as well as to a certain extent what people are adding individual instruments maybe it's a new instrument but it's into an existing lab. And I think we have seen in the past in Europe and North America what happens when people are kind of delaying their replacement cycles. We do usually get that back up.","So that, in theory, should make us feel pretty good about an improving environment next year, but that being said, I think we would acknowledge both Olivier and I were surprised with how this year started. I think we were all a little bit thinking, how to look at their business with the change in how the Chinese New Year fell but then it became pretty clear when we saw how March was going to play out, that things have changed in the industrial market. So we are feeling that competitively things are in good shape. We should continue to be able to gain share there and the market will improve in part because the replacement cycle will come back a little bit and we will have easier comps. But after having a the quarter like that, it's tough to make great statements about 2016 at this stage, Steve.","Steve Beuchaw","That's incredibly helpful granularity. I appreciate that. Just one housekeeping follow-up for me on the buyback. Is the parameter for the year still $450 million, $475 million?","Bill Donnelly","Yes.","Steve Beuchaw","Great. I appreciate it. You guys have a great evening.","Bill Donnelly","You too.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho Peterson","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Can you quantify how much you are now expecting China to be down? I don't know if we heard that. I heard you say down. Are you thinking mid single digits or more?","Bill Donnelly","So it looks like it will be down in Q2, similar to what it was down in Q1. If I look at the second half of the year, it's probably going to be a few points better, but still down, Tycho.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And any thoughts on whether you use this as a means to kind of pull forward some cost actions? Just trying to figure out how you are thinking about managing the operating margin?","Bill Donnelly","As you saw in the current number, I think if we look globally at our cost management programs and margin enhancement programs, they are really going well. I mean, the EPS growth there was, if you pull out the impact of currencies, was north of 15%. I think 17.5% or something like that. And so we feel like we have a cost structure that makes sense. If we look at our Chinese business and our Asian business overall, we see no reason to really do pullbacks. What we did do in China, we will continue to do this resource reallocation that we have been talking to you guys about the last couple of years where we are moving into segments that we think or moving resources into segments that we think will grow for the long term. The lab business, the product inspection business, the process analytics business as well as I am thinking about customer segments and so maybe we will have a change in the mix of resources in China, but we are committed to China. We like China for the long term. So we don't expect any overall changes in that.","Olivier Filliol","Hi, Tycho. I would add that we have taken cost measures last year in China and have certainly be proactive also in terms of the portfolio and in that sense, I feel that we have the right franchise. And the second point that I would add is the Chinese business remains highly profitable for us. And so it doesn't demand the same way of cost measures as we might have in other situations when we have such sharp declines.","Tycho Peterson","And then, Bill, can you quantify the pricing, volume and cost reduction contributions on margins? And are you at the point now where Blue Ocean is really starting to give you better pricing traction here in the U.S.?","Bill Donnelly","So pricing was up, I believe, 190 basis points and contributed about 90 bips to the gross profit margin increase. Our material costs were down about 140 bips and that contributed a little more than 30 bips to the cost of sales. In terms of the reasons for that, certainly Blue Ocean is an enabler, but I would say that it's, broadly speaking, the program that we put around it, like Blue Ocean, is a tool that gives us certain opportunities and then we have, within the organization, pricing specialists, the front-end people working towards that on the pricing side and similarly in our manufacturing operations we have global procurement teams working with the unit procurement guys and they have some new tools with Blue Ocean to do better in category management and other ways. So I do expect that we will continue to have good price realization and continue to take down material costs, I will broadly say, at similar kind of levels for the coming quarters.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then just one last one. Olivier, can you comment on the upper tranche service attachment where you are increasing the attachment rate for service?","Olivier Filliol","This is something that has been ongoing for a while and it's a journey. So this will take us many years to really get to the level that we are fully satisfied. We are doing multiple things. So we have efforts to really make it much easier for the salespeople to automatically attach the service offering to any product quote that we are doing. We are helping them with new tools that we have. We help them with new service offerings. We have been upgrading all of the marketing material across all the different channels. So with that, I mean, also on our website, print materials and all these things. And then we are working on training for the sales people and we are working on the incentives around that and we are making progress across the world on the topic, but there are still very big differences by country in terms of, this is a journey that in terms of change management, but also kind of developing it in a country. Feel positive about the progress but there is still quite a way to go before we have fully utilized or capitalized on the opportunity.","Tycho Peterson","Understood. Okay. Thank you very much.","Bill Donnelly","Thank you, Tycho.","Operator","You next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin of Bank of America.","Derik de Bruin","Hi. Good afternoon.","Bill Donnelly","Hi, Derik.","Derik de Bruin","Bill, superb gross margin, improved strong in the quarter. I mean I realize some of that was currency based, but how should we think about progression for the rest of year?","Bill Donnelly","It is going to continue to do well. Let me give you some, so for the full year it will be, let's call it, somewhere approaching 200 bips, okay. And we did a little bit more in this first quarter, but that has a little bit to do with the impact of the hedges are kind of static number, the impact of the hedges and as the sales numbers, this our lowest quarter in terms of sales. So the impact of the hedges isn't as large, but yes I think we feel good about what we are doing. We actually, Olivier and I, reviewed the presentation with some of our front-end leaders earlier this week on the whole topic of pricing looking at some of the new tools that we are developing from an analytical perspective, but as well as tools for the front-end and we continue to come up with good ideas and reasons to think that pricing will continue to be a sustainable advantage for us and a good value driver for the company.","Derik de Bruin","And I guess as we think about the hedges, when they roll off, is there any impact in 2016?","Bill Donnelly","There is a smaller impact on 2016. If I were look at from a EPS perspective, think about we have 1% headwind to EPS for the piece of the hedge that roll off in 2016 and then an additional 2% for the piece in 2017.","Derik de Bruin","Great. How big is Russia for you?","Bill Donnelly","A couple of percentage points, Mary? And maybe includes Ukraine and Belarus or something.","Derik de Bruin","Great. And also staying with Europe and some of the other emerging markets there. I mean you had really good results there. Have you have seen anything to suggest that people are delaying purchases because they don't have enough purchasing power with this currency that's come in?","Bill Donnelly","I apologize, Derik We heard most of the question, but the start of that question wasn't clear.","Derik de Bruin","Yes. Basically, when you look at the currency changes that are going on, it's like have people not bought things or bought less because they don't have enough purchasing power? Basically have you seen anybody slowing purchases because of the currencies?","Olivier Filliol","Actually not really, because we price in local currency. In majority of the world, this is not a topic. It can be a topic in some countries where we have pricing that is also linked to U.S. dollar or Euro and would be, for example, like the case in Brazil or this would be the case in Russia. And so I would say, of course, we saw two countries that we have significant drop and I would make a link to the currency in that sense. But for the majority of all the markets around the world, that wouldn't apply.","Derik de Bruin","Great. Very helpful. Thank you very much.","Bill Donnelly","Yes. Maybe to add to Olivier, it's kind of probably to Brazil and Russia, we would both say the impact of energy prices has probably been as big on purchasing behavior as the impact of the currencies themselves.","Derik de Bruin","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard","To follow up on Tycho's question there, just to be clear. Have your plans changed around the field turbo program and your hiring expectations for the back half of the year at all?","Olivier Filliol","At this stage, not. Actually we are working already on additional plans. But of course, we will see a little bit how things will play out in the coming weeks and months. But I am actually optimistic that we are going to implement as we were actually planning. And we have really great ideas. The teams have further expanded their analysis to identify new opportunities and I have multiple projects that were already submitted and I am excited. In that context, maybe also want to say that the ones that we initiated late last year are progressing very well. The big majority have been recruited and are onboarded and are now in training mode. I am actually optimistic that we are going to see good impact from it. And in that sense, if things don't change, we would go on another way.","Brandon Couillard","Super. And then, Bill, in terms of the outlook for the year, could you tell us what you have baked in for just service per versus product growth?","Bill Donnelly","China is disproportionate and Russia are both disproportionately low on service. So our service growth is basically the same assumption that we started the year with, which is kind of a mid-single-digit kind of number. And we would expect that no reason to change that number.","Brandon Couillard","Super. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro","Hi. Good morning or good afternoon, guys. Thanks. I do have a question on China. Can you talk a little bit about what you thought maybe geographically within the country over the course of the quarter? Was there any real strength difference between coastal cities and more inland China?","Bill Donnelly","Maybe I think you were just asking about geographic differentiation.","Isaac Ro","Yes. Just within China.","Bill Donnelly","Yes. We did see some improved growth, though there is better growth, maybe in the western part of the country, but still proportionately that's a smaller piece compared to the traditional manufacturing markets of China, Shanghai, for example. We opened up our Chengdu plant this quarter. That's certainly is a nice addition, but still proportionately the west is relatively small compared to those traditional areas but there was better growth, to your question.","Isaac Ro","Great. And then maybe I haven't spent as much time on the call here, but Japan just curious how things are looking there for the balance of the year? Obviously the currency has been a issue, but just fairly where is the [indiscernible] environment there?","Bill Donnelly","Okay. So our Japan business was up, let's call it low single digits, but I wanted to highlight that was against the plus mid-teens number a year ago because of a project. So I would expect that number to be modestly improving as the year progressed.","Isaac Ro","Got it. Thanks very much. Sorry about the background noise.","Bill Donnelly","It's okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Knight with Janney Capital.","Bill Donnelly","Hi, Paul.","Paul Knight","Hi, Bill. Can you hear me?","Bill Donnelly","Yes. We can hear you.","Paul Knight","In the past you have had cycles like pipettes, the scale business in China. Is there a couple of product lines that bear mentioning and us digging into, to kind of see or engage incremental growth for the future?","Bill Donnelly","And just to be clear, Paul, you are referring to China?","Paul Knight","No, not China.","Bill Donnelly","I am sorry.","Paul Knight","Within the portfolio of products at Mettler-Toledo. You have always been able to produce some exciting products that really contribute to incremental growth. What would you want us to look at going forward?","Olivier Filliol","I want to highlight maybe that we need to have continuous product innovation and come up with new product in all the different product categories. They are important to expand our lead versus competition and it's critical also to drive the replacement business. But typically, when we introduce a new product, it benefits that product category, but for the whole group it's not so important. It doesn't really move the needle that much. And I am excited about the two products that I just mentioned on the call. No question. But they are not going to make a huge difference. But they are important for the next couple of years. So I think every time on every quarter's call I highlight two or three product innovation that we have to show to you guys how broad our innovation is and we are going to continue. Actually for the full year, we have a very nice product pipeline and launch pipeline, pretty much across all the different businesses. And yes, I feel good, i.e. for example, just remember last year we talked about inspection product that we launched and we were just talking here about earlier this week how they had really an impact this product launches. So I would have a hard time to single out one product for you here.","Paul Knight","And Olivier, has your philosophy on share buybacks changed? I know you are still an aggressive share repurchaser. But are you exercising opportunistic purchases or is it a regular repurchase program? Have you changed your tactics on share repurchase?","Olivier Filliol","No. We are really very steady. We are in the market every day. We don't try to time the market at all. It's really -- Mary has a program where it actually basically buys everyday. And we have in that sense a very consistent policy.","Paul Knight","And then lastly, what steps are left for you, do you think, regarding mitigating currency volatility going forward? Is there anything left that you want to do?","Olivier Filliol","I think we have accepted that currency volatility is probably something that we are going to face also for the future. We had significant in the recent past, in particular around the Swiss Franc. But of course, the dollar appreciation is also very real and we expect that to go on. The key measures that we take against it is first on the pricing side. We always look also on what kind of opportunities this offers and how this relates to competition, but also can we adjust or not. So we sometimes do a very targeted mid-year price increases to mitigate a currency impact. And then currency changes can also have an impact on where we locate resources and we take measures around that one. And these are typically not a quick hit, but things that we do over time. We have had, for example in recent years, programs in Switzerland to address things. And we have, for example, built up local country service organization and these are certainly things that we will continue to do in the coming years.","Paul Knight","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken of Evercore.","Bill Donnelly","Hi, Ross.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi guys. This is Luke, on for Ross today.","Bill Donnelly","Hi.","Unidentified Analyst","Just basically, I wanted to know if you had to break up the industrial weakness in to the following pockets, how would you do it? And if this would be qualitative or quantitative? So the first one would be delays due to the corruption measures, second one would be the dislocated demand in heavy industrial materials and the last one would be the general macro malaise?","Bill Donnelly","I think Olivier and I will take this one maybe together. I think the first one we would probably on the industrial side say it's the smallest one. We do see that lead times on bigger projects that the government is behind directly or through state-owned companies, maybe take a little bit longer, but I don't think of that as the biggest one and probably the other two.","Olivier Filliol","Actually we see some delays but this can also be related to the leadership. The new leadership team really putting in place and all the people around the different decision-making bodies and that probably slows down things. We certainly have concrete examples that's the case. But otherwise, I wouldn't connect it to your first point.","Bill Donnelly","And the second too probably is, it's tough to judge. Maybe I would lean to the second one being a little bit more because of what I commented on, with regard to the replacement cycle, but it would be tough to quantify it.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Great. And then I guess for the second one, so we have heard from a couple of players that the U.S. industrial side might be moderating. Did you guys see anything in the quarter that would give credence to that?","Olivier Filliol","If I take the early indicators like leads, these quote requests and so on, I don't see supporting point. In contrary, I would say, overall it continue to be healthy.","Bill Donnelly","And our second quarter looks good, which is the place where we had the most visibility.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Olivier Filliol","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Arias of Citigroup.","Dan Arias","Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. Bill or Olivier, on China. I am not try to put too fine of a point on it, but is the improvement that you think you might see in the back half strictly due to comps at this point? Or are you feeling like it's still reasonable to sort of think about some actual spending improvement?","Bill Donnelly","Probably mostly the former.","Dan Arias","Okay. And then maybe just within the quarter, do you feel like there was any China New Year effect at all? Or was that just not even a relevant factor, given the magnitude that we are talking about?","Olivier Filliol","Initially we were seeing this January, February thing and we were kind of explaining it with that. But when we had the actual results of March and visibility also about Q2, we wouldn't connected it to that. I think no, that's not the explanation.","Dan Arias","Okay. Maybe just finish with share gains. You guys have been talking about this for several quarters now. So I guess maybe in which product areas or geographies are you feeling like you are having the most success with the competitive win dynamic?","Olivier Filliol","I think it's very broad based. I really feel that way. Of course, the European numbers are still strong, particularly if I look on a two-year base that I feel particularly confident about that one. But actually also the U.S. numbers and for emerging markets like Southeast Asia, India and so on, I have also very high confidence. And for some of the markets, it's maybe a little more difficult because there I have less data point from competitors to really compare. But honestly it's really broad based across the different business lines and across the geographies.","Dan Arias","Got it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research.","Steve Willoughby","Hi. Good evening. Two questions for you. First, I know you started to touch and discuss a bit about the field turbo program. I was just wondering if you could provide any more color on either the returns or the production you are seeing from those hires you have already made and where that compares to your expectations for those hires so far? And then I have a follow-up as well.","Olivier Filliol","So out of the program that we initiated last year, we are talking about roughly 200 front-end resources that we added throughout the world. Most of these resources, as mentioned before, are hired and onboarded and now kind of in training. So you can imagine that they start now to have some impact but it takes time until they really have here an impact that is significant to us. Typically it takes six to nine months to cover that cost and then from then on, actually we start to have a good payback. It increases actually more on a linear base then exponentially and we would typically expect four to five years until such an additional salesperson plateaus in terms of sales growth. I think that if you, kind of an indication and so it's a pre-investments, but we just break even rapidly and then having actually a better contribution in particular in the second year.","Bill Donnelly","I might add, Steve, that as a reminder, we had a smaller field turbo program, including in Europe in 2013 and clearly we think part of our success in Europe and in the Americas, but particularly, Europe is partly related to that.","Steve Willoughby","Okay. Great. Thank you for all that color. And then just secondly and I realize this could be partly due to timing but in the quarter I see that your debt outstanding stepped up quarter-over-quarter but you are interest expense declined. So I don't know, Bill or Mary, if you could just talk about what's going on with the debt that you are taking on and the timing of it?","Bill Donnelly","So yes, there is nothing special there, It's all a little [indiscernible] for you, but we are cash flow, I mean, you know our full-year number and you know that the first quarter is typically a period of time where we are more of a net borrower, we are anyway for the full-year a net borrower because of the extra repurchases and the first quarter is the weakest quarter, cash flow wise. So with regard to its relationship to interest expense, I can't think of anything that's changing or that has changed. You have seen what we have done debt issuance wise.","Steve Willoughby","Okay. Thanks very much.","Bill Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg from UBS.","Jon Groberg","Hi, guys. Congratulations on the quarter. So just two quick questions for me. First, I may have missed it, Bill, but what are you expecting for pricing for the year?","Bill Donnelly","So we did 190 bips in first quarter and if we can say, somewhere in the 1.75% to 2% range, I think that that's a real realistic expectation.","Jon Groberg","Okay. And this quarter you hit 18% margin. Olivier, do you kind of think about the next two years or so? Do you start thinking at all in terms of an additional, as your margins get higher, an additional 100 bips of margin expansion just doesn't have the same meaningful impact on your EPS growth as it would have at 12%, 13%, 14% and you start shifting at all how you think about maybe using your cash? And I am just curious if you start to think that M&A becomes a more useful, a more productive use of your cash in terms of what you are able to do with it maybe in two or three years?","Olivier Filliol","Our view on M&A really remains unchanged, in the sense that M&A is part of our strategy. I like to do M&A cases but they need to be strategically really fit into the franchise. If there are close adjacencies, if they add from a technology standpoint, or gives us an opportunity to consolidate our market position in certain country, we are going to pursue it. And it's actually much less financially driven in the sense that I say foremost strategy needs to be right and then the financial needs to be right in terms of business case and we remain very disciplined on that one. I do not foresee a change in that one, even with what you alluded to about we seeing nicely improved profitability and so I think the nicely improved profitability gives us the opportunity to further invest in organic growth. The field turbo, for example, are good examples of that. So I don't expect a change in the strategy, but I want to reinforce even that we have only done very few M&A in the recent quarters that we are very committed to it. And we are actually constantly working on cases and we have a good pipeline on the radar screen kind of cases that we try to nurture, but it's also we are now in an environment where people are willing to pay premiums for acquisitions and here we stay disciplined and so we will see how it plays.","Bill Donnelly","And Jon, Olivier and I, both continue to believe that in the medium term, we can't, let's call it mid-single-digit organic local currency growth, deliver mid-teens EPS growth in a constant currency environment and we have, while the absolute margins are getting higher, we have one of our biggest programs that we have invested in to drive margin enhancement with the Blue Ocean program being an enabler. We are only roughly halfway done with that. And so there is more to come in terms of that. And then, of course, we are saying that knowing that the amortization is kicking in and that intangible asset and that will mean even better free cash flow yield in terms of our EPS numbers as well. So we think the organic -- there will be nice acquisition opportunities, but we believe that the organic financial story has many years to run.","Jon Groberg","Okay. And so just to be clear, on the field turbo initiative that you talked about, Olivier, in year two or year three would you be expecting to be growing 100, 200-basis points faster than you are today? Is that how you are going to measure the success of the program?","Olivier Filliol","Your numbers are high and the way I want you to look at it is, the field turbo are part of us to achieve the mid-single-digit growth that we always talking to you guys. So we are not suggesting here with field turbo that we are going to accelerate our growth and you are going to certainly see higher growth rates.","Jon Groberg","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And there are no further questions.","Mary Finnegan","Thanks Leanna. Thanks everyone for joining us tonight. As always, if you have any questions or any follow-up, please don't hesitate to call us. Good night.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

I'm the Treasurer and responsible for Investor Relations at Mettler-Toledo, and I\u2019m happy you\u2019re joining us tonight. I'm here today with Olivier Filliol, our CEO; and Bill Donnelly, our Executive Vice President.","I need to cover just a couple of administrative matters. This call is being Webcast and is available for replay on our website. A copy of the press release and the presentation that we'll refer to on today's call is also available on our website.","Let me summarize the Safe Harbor language, which is outlined on Page 1 of the presentation.

More detailed information with respect to the use of and differences between non-GAAP financial measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure is in our Form 8-K.","I\u2019m going to now turn the call over to Olivier.","Olivier A. Filliol","Thanks, Mary, and welcome to everyone on the call. I will start with a summary of the quarter, and then Bill will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments on 2014. As always, we will have time for Q&A at the end.","The highlights of the quarter are on Page 2 of the presentation. Local currency sales increased 4% in the quarter with very strong growth in Europe. We have solid growth in the Americas and improving demand in China, although as expected sales were down in the quarter. China sales results were offset by relatively good growth in all the regions of Asia \/ Rest of World.","We executed well in the quarter and I\u2019m pleased with our growth in earnings per share, particularly given the challenging currency headwinds we faced in the quarter. We are benefiting from our values cost control and margin initiatives that we have enacted over the last few years.","Let me turn it to Bill, to provide more details on the financial results and an update to our guidance for the year.","William P. Donnelly","Thanks, Olivier, and hello, everybody. Let me start with additional details on sales, which were $550.6 million in the quarter, an increase of 4% in local currency. On a dollar base -- U.S. dollar basis, sales increased 5%, as currencies benefited by about 1% in the quarter.","Turning to Page 3 of the presentation, we outlined sales by geography. In the quarter, local currency sales increased by 9% in Europe, 3% in the Americas and 1% in Asia \/ Rest of World. Without the impact of exited product lines, Asia \/ Rest of World increased by 2% in the quarter. For China specifically, local currency sales, excluding exited product lines, were flat with the prior-year. Exited product lines contributed a further 2% decline in China sales for the quarter.","Sales growth by product line for the quarter is highlighted on Slide number 4. Laboratory sales increased by 7% in local currency, while industrial increased 1%. Adjusting for the China product line exits, industrials increased by 2%, food retailing increased by 8% in the quarter.","Turning to the next slide, let me walk you through the key P&L items for the quarter. Gross margins were 53.1%, this compares to 53.2% in the prior-year. This was a little lower than we expected. We had benefited from pricing and lower raw material costs, which were offset by unfavorable mix, currency, and higher inventory charges. R&D amounted to $29.5 million, a 4% increase in local currency. The increase was principally driven by project development activity.","SG&A amounted to $172.2 million, which is an increase of 3% in local currency. Increased sales and marketing costs and higher variable compensation were offset by cost savings initiatives and lower employee benefit costs.","Adjusted operating income amounted to $91 million in the quarter, which is a 6% increase over the prior-year amount of $85.4 million. Our operating margins were 16.5%, that\u2019s a 20 basis point increase over the prior-year. Currency had a larger negative impact on operating profit than we had expected the last time we spoke.","We estimate currency reduced operating profit by $3.7 million. Without this impact operating profit would have increased 11% and our operating margins would have grown by 100 bps in the quarter. Given this headwind, we\u2019re pleased with the growth in operating income and our margin expansion for the quarter. ","A couple of final items on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $7.1 million in the quarter. Interest expense was $5.7 million, while our effective tax rate was 24%. Fully diluted shares for the quarter were 30.1 million, that\u2019s a 3% decline from the prior-year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program.","Adjusted earnings per share were $2, a 9% increase over the prior-year amount of $1.84. Currency reduced EPS by approximately 5%. Given this headwind, again we\u2019re pleased with earnings growth in the quarter. On a reported basis, earnings per share was a $1.93, this compares to a $1.69 in the prior-year. Reported EPS includes pre-tax restructuring charges of $1.5 million or $0.04 a share, which are primarily employee-related charges. Reported EPS also includes $0.03 of purchased intangible amortization.","Now turning to cash flow, free cash flow in the quarter was $34 million, and this compares to $9.6 million in the prior-year. We are obviously improved with that strong number. Working capital statistics were solid in the quarter with ITO at 5.1x and our DSO at 48 days; both of these are slight improvements as compared to the prior-year.","Let me make some additional comments on our balance sheet before turning to guidance. We have about $350 million of net debt which is a relatively modest level resulting in a net debt to EBITDA ratio of approximately 0.6x. Given this solid capital structure and cash flow generation capability, we believe we can improve our cost of capital with modest increases in our leverage ratio over time.","We\u2019ve evaluated different alternatives to achieve this objective. In consultation with our Board, we have decided to increase the level of our share repurchases in the coming quarters. We\u2019ve always believed that having an investment grade rating was appropriate for this business, but we can maintain such a rating with a larger debt burden than we have today. This is a gradual change that we expect to do in our capital structure and it will not have any impact on our ability to do bolt-on acquisitions.","We also want to highlight that we do expect the changes in our leverage levels to be gradual and achieved over multiple years and begin to have a modest benefit to EPS towards the end of this year. Just one last item on the balance sheet and cash flow, given the strong start to the year, I think will likely our cash flow will come closer to the $310 million range and this compares to the $305 million we had discussed in the last quarter.","Now let's turn to guidance. We are more optimistic about our Western markets as the conditions appear to be improving. Europe will face tougher comparisons in the second half, but we expect both Americas and Europe to perform well this year.","Offsetting this is greater uncertainty and caution in emerging markets. Year-to-date China is pretty much playing out according to our expectations that we shared with you last quarter. While sales growth was a little bit better than we expected, there remains enough uncertainty to keep us cautious. We expect sales to be flattish in the second quarter and then see sales growth in the second half of the year, principally due to easier comparisons in China.","As a reminder, we estimate exited product lines will reduce sales by approximately 2% for the full-year. In terms of our emerging markets macroeconomic conditions in Russia, Brazil and India are all weaker as compared to the last time we spoke. Taken altogether, we\u2019re slightly more positive about the developed world which is offset by a little more caution towards emerging markets.","Given this outlook and the good start to the year with our Q1 sales growth, we are moving our full-year sales guidance to approximately 4%. This compares to our previous guidance in the range of 3% to 4%. We are also raising the bottom end of our adjusted EPS guidance by a nickel to $11.45. This reflects the Q1 results, some help at the end of the year from the increase in our share repurchase program offset by a little greater currency headwinds than previously thought. The top line remains at $11.60, which results in a growth rate of between 8% and 10%. Our previous guidance was $11.40 to $11.60 per share.","For the second quarter, we would expect local currency sales growth to be in the range of 3% to 4% and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.50 to $2.55 or a growth rate of 6% to 9%. Similar to what we experienced in the first quarter, earnings per share growth is lower versus our full-year guidance as two of the headwinds we faced this year, higher Blue Ocean amortization and foreign exchange, had a larger impact as compared -- in the first half of the year as compared to the second half of the year. There is also more difficult comparison on sales as compared to Q1.","As you're updating your models, let me also cover some additional specifics on guidance. First, currency. We\u2019d expect currency to have no impact on second quarter sales. It should also have no impact on Q3 sales, but will reduce Q4 sales by about 1%. These are all based on current exchange rates.","For the full year, we\u2019d expect to have no impact on currency -- on sales due to currency. In terms of impact of currency on earnings, we\u2019d expect currency to reduce earnings by approximately 2% in Q2, 1% in Q3, and to be slightly negative in Q4. For the full-year 2014, currency is expected to reduce earnings growth by 2%. This is slightly worse than what we discussed last quarter.","Okay, that\u2019s it from my side. And now let me turn it back to Olivier.","Olivier A. Filliol","Thanks, Bill, and let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab increased 7% in the quarter with very good growth in Balances, Analytical Instruments and Automated Chemistry. Process Analytics and Pipette also had growth in the quarter.","Industrial increased 1% in the quarter. We are happy to see core industrial returning to growth with 2% sales increase in the quarter. Product Inspection also had growth. Retail increased 8% in the quarter driven by project activity in Europe.","Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Europe was up very strongly in the quarter with a 9% growth, better than we expected. While comparisons were fairly easy, we did see good growth in most countries.","Americas increased 3% in the quarter. We had good growth in Lab and Core Industrial offset by Product Inspection, which was up against very strong comparisons from a year earlier period.","Asia \/ Rest of the World increased 1% in the quarter. Bill already made some comments on China, but let me add some additional ones. As mentioned, China is pretty much on track with our expectations. We recognized it is going to take some time to work through the weakness in industrial sectors, but I\u2019m pleased with the strong growth that we\u2019re seeing in certain markets.","For example, our Lab business was up 6% in the quarter in China. However, if you look deeper, you\u2019d see that our Lab instruments sold primarily into life science and research environment was up strongly, in fact, up double-digits. This was offset however by our Lab business, which is sold into more industrial markets which was down significantly.","Similarly, in industrial, while Core Industrial was down as expected, Product Inspection was up quite strongly. We acknowledge recent economic news has not been encouraging and we\u2019re being cautious for the second quarter and second half of the year, given its greater level of uncertainty.","I\u2019d stress however, we\u2019re convinced of the strong growth opportunities in this market over the medium and long-term, given the growing GDP per capita, increasing number of scientists, and greater focus on quality.","Now let me make a few comments on service, which had good sales growth in the quarter of 5%. Service and consumables represent 30% of sales with service representing about three quarters of the total. Service represents an even larger percentage of sales in the developed market due to the large installed base and the maturity of the markets.","With all -- with almost 2,800 service personnel, we have the largest and most global service force as compared to our competitors. We invest a great deal in our service organization in terms of expensive training and value of tools to support their activities. Also our service technicians are specialized in the product areas, which makes them expert. Taken together, this attributes makes -- make our service organization a unique value proposition to our customers and a clear competitive advantage for us.","We are currently making investments for growth in our service business, most recently as part of our field approval program that we discussed last quarter. Approvals are targeted additions of front end resources to pursue very specific growth opportunities. On the service side, we are adding some direct resources in our Lab and Product Inspection areas as well as support in a couple of regions to better leverage our service technicians.","One last comment on service. With an installed base of a few million instruments, our service data base provides important information that is wanted for product development, but also for service marketing campaign, tailored to the product life cycle. We view this data as one of our most important intangible asset and in 2014 we will launch 100s of marketing campaigns to leverage this asset and deliver further growth.","That covers my comments on the current business conditions. In terms of additional topics this quarter, I want to cover two new product offerings which illustrates how we continue to use product launches to target growth segments and margin enhancement to cost reduction.","Let me start with our offering in Product Inspection. As background, this business represents about 17% of our total sales and customers are principally food and beverage manufacturers and pharma companies. We help to ensure the integrity and quality of packaged items with our checkweighers, metal detectors, X-ray vision and sterilization solutions.","We are the clear leader in this business with the broadest product offering of anyone in the market today. We combine this with the most extensive service force, which is especially important to these customers as manufacturing uptime is critical. The dynamics of this business are very strong because of market concerns around quality in all consumer products.","Given our broad product offerings, customers can gain synergies by using multiple products in their line to tackle rather complex quality hurdles. For example, a European food company recently purchased an integrated solution involving checkweighers, metal detectors and [ph] [column] vision inspection systems. In addition to ensuring accurate weight and no metal contaminants, the food manufacturer wanted to enhance the identification of products that does not meet quality level. In particular, they wanted the ability to isolate products that had a burned area, irregular shape, or insufficient amount of topping such as cheese.","The vision inspection technology allows these defects to be identified and the product to be rejected before packaging. The vision system consists of five cameras, covering different angles and it is incorporated into the checkweighing conveyor line. This results in reduced space on the line and the more efficient man machine interface. While infield training and testing are needed to ensure accurate performance to specifications, the instruments are intuitive and easy to operate. This is just one example of the synergies within our product offerings and product inspection.","Another example of our innovation is from our core industrial business. We recently launched our next generation of industrial weighing terminals. These terminals are used in manufacturing operations and capture data from our weighing instruments and integrated into manufacturing control systems. This new generation of terminals enhances operator productivity by providing cost effective reliable weighing.","The display has outstanding readability under a variety of lighting conditions and function keys with graphical items, easily guide an operator. Software allows users to easily configure the terminal and backup files over multiple units within a facility, while the remote display provides additional operational flexibility.","Communication options allow connectivity to devices such as printers, remote displays and PCs. The terminals are targeted to general manufacturing customers, particularly in the food segment. Completely designed and developed in China, these terminals provide a cost effective solution for our customers and improved margins for us. These are just two examples of how we use new products to target growth sectors and continue to drive margin improvements.","Let me make a couple of concluding remarks before I open for questions. We remain cautiously optimistic in our Western markets and believe we\u2019re well positioned to capture growth opportunities in these regions. We recognize the conditions in emerging markets and in China, in particular, are more uncertain, but believe we\u2019re executing well and will see better growth as the year progresses. We continue to focus on execution and capturing more share.","That covers my comments, and I want to ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Thanks, good afternoon.","Olivier A. Filliol","Hi, Brandon.","William P. Donnelly","Hi, Brandon.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Olivier, I think Mettler might be the only company on the planet raising revenue guidance at this point in the year. Can you give us a sense of like how the orders trended in the first quarter, was April better? And, particularly, what region do you feel more comfortable about in terms of the dynamics?","Olivier A. Filliol","Okay. I mentioned on the call Europe certainly positively surprised us, and it was little bit better than we expected. And I would say in general, the West feels better than we talked last time on the call. When it comes to order of trend, I think we need always to be (audio gap) rather and talk about the year-to-date numbers and the year to May numbers, reflect the comments that we had on the call and give us kind of the confidence that we had a good start and allows us to modestly increase the midpoint of our sales guidance.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Thanks. And Bill, are you able to quantify the incremental buyback planned for the year now? And could you remind us how much cash, if any, is trapped overseas?","William P. Donnelly","So in terms of quantifying it, I think we probably will end up by somewhere in the range of another $50 million, $75 million before the year is out. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that our goal is to catch up in -- I should say, our goal certainly is not to catch up on the capital structure side too quickly. We will do it gradually over a longer period of time. And then sort of the second part of your question?","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Just if you have any overseas trapped cash?","William P. Donnelly","Oh, so in terms of trapped cash, we really don\u2019t have any. Our program is our tax rate reflects the idea that we got to fully repatriate our earnings. So in that sense, we don\u2019t really have any trapped cash. Sometimes, if I look at the $100 million, most of its related to kind of the idea that in certain countries you need to hand in the annual statutory accounts before you can remit the cash back. So it\u2019s never the idea of trapped cash and our tax structure doesn\u2019t really fit together these days.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Super, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks. I\u2019m just wondering if you could maybe spend a moment on some of the less often discussed emerging markets, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe. Just give us some color or anecdotes there as to how those markets are doing?","Olivier A. Filliol","Yes, okay. In general we commented that emerging markets are a little bit more challenging in these days. But there are -- there were some good numbers nevertheless, I start for example, with Russia. Russia was actually up for us in the quarter, but against easier comparisons. I would however, expect that Russia will be weaker in the near-term. I would also stress that all the emerging markets are actually the individual account, we saw less than 3% and for example Russia is only about 2% for us. Then going on the Eastern Europe, actually did perform very well for us, had good growth and partially against weaker comparisons, but still was very happy to see the numbers there. The part that was weaker was Latin America. I would say in general Latin America, but in particular also Brazil. The currency effects and the general economic conditions in Brazil are more challenging. Then we have in India certainly also currency topics, partially also government related topics that delay certain investments on our customers. Then Southeast Asia was also softer, I\u2019d say mostly impacted in China, but then sometimes you have also country specific issues going on, like in Thailand that we\u2019re also facing. But I would stress the point in all these countries, we really feel we have very strong local management, very experienced management, but also interesting is that all these country management and country managers have been around for many years. They have experienced us addressing the downturn, particularly in Europe and U.S. in the economic crisis. They know how to handle their own local crisis now and adapt to the circumstances and adapt also the cost structure, but I would say as much also applying Spinnaker techniques to go after the segments that still offer growth. So I feel like we\u2019re responding in a very good way in all these countries.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs","Very helpful. Thanks very much. And Bill, just a question on share repurchase in the context of your revised views on target leverage. If I heard you correctly, earlier you said that you\u2019re looking at, I think, a pretty modest pace of share repurchase for the balance of the year. I think you said -- I won\u2019t quote you, but I missed the number. But the point was that sounded like you might be -- maybe ticking up your annualized repurchase on an absolute basis. But the pace of repurchase for the rest of this year kind of sounded like you\u2019d more or less end up to be about in line with last year, effectively 95% or 100% of free cash flow. So can you just maybe clarify kind of the magnitude of share repurchase we should assume for this year? That would be helpful.","William P. Donnelly","Yes. So sorry if I chose my words poorly so, we\u2019d incrementally add another $50 million, $75 million between now and the end of the year. I think it a little bit depends on how our free cash flow, but in terms of absolute dollars I think even at that level because of the higher cash flow as well, we will probably be closer to the $400 million range, whereas in last year we\u2019re closer to $300 million range.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs","Okay. That\u2019s perfect. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan","Thanks. First question on Europe, you called out strength in food retail and some of the other sub segments. Can you maybe just talk about the sustainability of the trend, in particular, food retail? I know you had an easy comp there, but how are you thinking about that business in Europe?","Olivier A. Filliol","Okay. I\u2019d first state Europe overall did very well and it wasn\u2019t so much driven by food retail. Food retail was nicely contributing, but actually you have to say we did well in Europe across product lines and across countries. The food retail as you all know is for us very project driven business. In that sense also lumpy. I\u2019d not read too much into our performance of Q1 by food retail. Actually I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we\u2019re also going to have the quarters in this year where we will be down in food retail. So this is not a new trend. It\u2019s more reflecting the nature of the business. When I look for the overall European numbers, I don\u2019t certainly expect that we\u2019re going to experience this nice growth rates of Europe in the same way for the full-year. We\u2019re going to have more difficult comparisons in the latter part of the year, but I\u2019d say what was really good about this Q1 number is first the magnitude of the growth and then how consistent it was across countries. We had even France showing growth. We had Southern countries that has growth. We have the U.K. and Nordic which was for example very solid. This very encouraging signs and of course it\u2019s also very motivating for the teams and that will create additional momentum also for the rest of the year.","Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan","And then thinking about China, I think you had previously talked about back half of the year getting back to mid-single digit growth. Anything changed in your assumptions given kind of the recent data, and any update on kind of how payment terms are trending?","Olivier A. Filliol","I would agree the economic news have not been that promising, but at the same time I have to say we did really anticipate that things in China will remain challenging for us. The numbers should start to look better in the second part of the year, mainly because of comparison reasons. We feel like our numbers are showing that we\u2019re bottoming, but it\u2019s actually difficult to really say when the momentum comes back. What I\u2019m really seeing and the team is confirming that is that there are different areas of growth. I think the prepared remarks about our Core Lab in selling mostly to the life science industry is certainly encouraging and showing that point. There are different industry segments that we see life coming back, particularly when it\u2019s oriented to consumer goods. But even I got an update last week about specialty chemicals industry segment that were encouraging. There is certainly also geographic parts of China that are encouraging. Certainly markets will remain very difficult for a long time, talking about steel industry, service industry and so on. But all in all, we do see that things should gradually improve and then combining with the easier comparisons yet, we do expect growth in the second part of the year. How fast things will get -- come back to the high single-digit growth, low double-digit growth, that\u2019s the key part. So really difficult to forecast and anticipate.","William P. Donnelly","In terms of the \u2026","Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan","It's not that we see -- go ahead, Bill.","William P. Donnelly","Yes, maybe just a comment on the credit thing. So, you guys remember we talked probably about a year-ago about our concerns around credit topics, I think for us its not that we see more credit availability in the system, but its not incrementally worse in terms of our own balance sheet, our past due, our DSO type of statistics are actually now back to where they were before we started seeing this problem and so we feel good about that. Actually it\u2019s probably one of the reasons are -- probably it is one of the reasons our cash flow was good this quarter and so we don't see that situation getting worse.","Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan","And then last one, Bill can you just talk about bookings versus revenues? Last quarter I think the delta was about 2% in any particular areas where the bookings were better than the revenues significantly?","William P. Donnelly","I think if we kind of look at the Western world let\u2019s say or even excluding China, we\u2019re talking about mid single-digit kind of growth rates in terms of orders and sales. And then China was took both of those down. If I look at like absolute backlog levels, I think we\u2019re -- we\u2019ve a little bit more backlog than we did a year-ago and things started out reasonable in the first part of this quarter.","Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jon Groberg with Macquarie. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is actually Harris on for Jon. Just a quick question around capital structure. Can you maybe comment on what your new longer term leverage targets are?","William P. Donnelly","So we think it make sense to be remain in investment grade like company that probably implies net debt to EBITDA ratios in the one, no more than probably two level. And so we could gradually work there over a multi-year period.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bryan Kipp with Janney Capital. Your line is open.","Bryan Kipp - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Hi. This is -- just taking this one for Paul. Just to start off, I guess, to step back and look at the margins -- you did see a gross margin decline and there was some acceleration, some incrementals in 4Q. Did those not crossover? I know those were on material costs and a little bit of a pricing leverage. And then on that SG&A decline as a percentage of sales, is that attributed to anything specific ala the pull in consolidation that you guys saw at the beginning half of 2013? Was that pulled through or does it represent more of the benefits and initiatives you guys instituted in 2013?","William P. Donnelly","Okay. So let me start with the gross profit side. So just to set the numbers, we -- our gross profit was down about 10 bps in the quarter. If I look at pricing, our pricing did well, our price -- net realized prices across everything was more than 150, slightly less than 200 basis points. Our material costs were down about a 100 and -- between a 100 and 150 basis points, let\u2019s say. And if you kind of dig deeper into okay, so why then was the margin not bigger because those are certainly numbers that would be inline with what we\u2019d expect for the full-year and should produce, lets say, 30 to 50 bps if we kept on that pace. We had kind of a funny mix within some of the details like so for example the mix within what we sold of Lab balances and a couple other topics. And then we had a currency headwind and then finally we just -- and that we had some inventory charge comparison topics between two periods. Our expectation will be that we will return to this some margin -- gross margin expansion for the remainder of the year. So I don\u2019t expect that trend that you saw here in the first quarter to remain. Maybe the second comment you made was on what were the specifics that led us to being able to have a pretty good cost control on the SG&A side. I think there are several factors there so and maybe some pluses and minuses, but overall a good picture. As a reminder, we have a headwind on the bonus side, so have some catch up to do this year and bonuses versus the prior-year. I think for the full-year, it\u2019s a number in the $15 million range. That\u2019s kind of being split now throughout the year. Second headwind is currency and then we of course have some cost savings as well associated with different programs that we had. Some of them relate to the shared service center, but other topics as well. So overall we feel like the cost structure is in pretty good shape as we start the year.","Bryan Kipp - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","And just a quick follow-up on the new -- two new products that you guys highlighted earlier, just thinking about that in terms of your revenue guidance here, is there any benefit with those new products in those numbers? And I guess the other question, to back up is full utilization when you ramp up on something like that, is that 6 to 9 months or 12 months?","Olivier A. Filliol","Either way we need to look at product launches in Mettler-Toledo is that we have such a broad product range and so many products that a new product launch makes -- has a very little impact on our top line. It\u2019s -- we have really in that sense very diversified across many different businesses. Continuous product innovation and product launches however is very important to maintain our technology leadership to be able to continue to expand our markets and all that. So in that sense, I\u2019m very happy about this product launches, but I do not expect that they have a big impact on the overall revenue.","Bryan Kipp - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ross Muken with ISI Group. Your line is open.","Ross Muken - ISI Group LLC","Good afternoon, guys. I just wanted to maybe dig into a little nuance on the China commentary and I appreciate a lot of the details you\u2019ve given. Any differential demand or order trend at different price points? We\u2019ve heard from various folks some of the higher end instrumentation, obviously, it\u2019s a little bit different for you guys, it\u2019s been less robust than maybe lower-priced or typical service or other types of revenues. And then, Olivier you commented on the industrial side, pieces like specialty chemical getting better, any other discernible trend among some of the other major industrial end markets where things either got materially better or materially worse or you were kind of surprised with the lack of reaction, and this is China-specific?","Olivier A. Filliol","Okay. On the price point actually I would say surprisingly we don't have much differentiation. I would say the big difference is what goes well and what doesn\u2019t go well is more actually geography than anything else and if I look at the different business lines that we have, they were relatively consistent and even if I like -- take a product category like laboratory weighing, its not that the high-end or the low end did perform particularly in a differentiated way.","William P. Donnelly","Just to clarify your question Ross, you were asking specifically about China?","Ross Muken - ISI Group LLC","Yes.","William P. Donnelly","Yes, so if we dig down actually what Olivier said would apply to China as well. If you look maybe to pick pipettes and balances as a proxy for lower cost, I don\u2019t want to hurt any of our Swiss engineers\u2019 feelings with the higher end of the balances. And then maybe analytical instruments and auto can be kind of \u2013 relatively higher end. Actually we had excellent growth in all those categories.","Ross Muken - ISI Group LLC","Great. That was very helpful. Thank you.","Olivier A. Filliol","In terms of industry segments, I think nothing particular to add, other than what I said. Its really everything that\u2019s closer to consumer related things is going well. And the industry that is linked to consumer demand and benefits of that and then things that are related to quality measurement, food safety and so on is also particularly healthy. And on the other side, everything that\u2019s related to infrastructure is particularly challenging.","Operator","Your next question comes from of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research","Hi. Couple of questions. First, Bill, your comments regarding the impact from FX on margins, you made a comment about, something about 80 basis points. I was just wondering if that was the total impact from FX on margins or versus what you were expecting?","William P. Donnelly","A year-on-year number.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research","Okay. In total?","William P. Donnelly","Yes.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research","And then secondly, on the step up in share repurchases, should we also factor in some sort of step-up in interest expense, or is it going to be from working down cash balances?","William P. Donnelly","Hey, there will be a step up in terms of interest expense.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research","Okay. And then, I guess, just the final thing is if you could just comment on Japan in the quarter and then Japan maybe after the quarter, given the changes there at the end of their fiscal year?","William P. Donnelly","So let me pull forward the Japanese numbers first. So, we had a good quarter in Japan, but it was against a relatively easy comp. Maybe to give you a feel that the two-year growth rate would get you mid single-digit kind of numbers. In terms of their outlook for the second quarter, I don\u2019t remember them sticking out particularly good or bad. And actually getting a -- yes, lets call it some modest growth in Q2 probably.","Olivier A. Filliol","What might be interesting for you to realize that Japan is definitely skewed towards Lab business and you have heard us saying that Lab was strong across the world in the first quarter and that\u2019s actually also reflected here in Japan. In Japan we have less and less revenue in the industrial world and none for food or retail.","William P. Donnelly","And as you guys know Japan is not nearly as big a market for us as it is for some of the peer group companies. But I think that there are also some tax things that took place in Japan that might have helped some customers who want to buy in Q1 versus Q2, if I remember correctly.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc.","Yes, good afternoon.","William P. Donnelly","Hi, Rich.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc.","Olivier or Bill, could you just kind of speak to the Lab growth rate of plus 7%? I guess, is the appropriate way to look at that again is kind of this two-year growth rate, which puts it more in the lower single digits or was there anything that really stepped out at you as driving a 7% core growth rate there?","William P. Donnelly","Hey, we certainly think that multi-year growth rates are a good way to look at it. As we some times look at three-year growth rates too. Rick so on a three-year basis, it was maybe a nice move in a positive way. So while Q1 of last year was the easiest comp for 2013 in terms of the quarters if you actually look at 2012 and 2011, 2011 we grew 16% the Lab business in the first quarter and in 2012 8%. So there is some of why Q1 last year was weak was partly due to the comps of the prior-year. So -- but we\u2019re -- we think that -- we think in China -- or sorry in Asia, or sorry in Europe, we\u2019re certainly benefiting from that market being more stable economically not having things and there were some pent up demand as comps get a little tougher in the second half of the year from Europe, we wont be seeing those type of growth rates. But we feel very good and how we did vis-\u00e0-vis competitors in our Lab product lines in the last few quarters frankly.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc.","Sure. And do you get -- if price was 175 basis point kind of capture for all of Mettler in the quarter, would it be north of that for Lab, I presume?","William P. Donnelly","Yes, I think that\u2019s a fair statement.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc.","Okay, yep. And then, I'm still maybe a little bit surprised when I look at the growth rates by Lab, Industrial, I\u2019m surprised that again that you didn\u2019t get more of a positive bump on the gross profit margin line. But you referenced kind of a weak lab mix of instruments, was that anything to do with material costs or one-timers or was that just \u2026?","William P. Donnelly","Yes. I could take it through there is a little bit of a story behind multiple of them. AutoChem had one very large order that went through, there were some specifics on a couple of other product categories like the mix of business within processing analytics, a little bit less TOC versus some other topics. So there were different things that contributed to it as well as just kind of some inventory charge topics where we were unusually low in Q1 last year and a little bit above what we\u2019d expect on quarterly basis in Q1.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc.","Sure, okay. All right. And then, just the last question, I probably just missed this, but in terms of China, did you mention -- I think you had mentioned Lab was plus 16% in China. If I tried to weight that out, then maybe the industrial was minus kind of a high single-digit. Is that reasonable math?","William P. Donnelly","Maybe just I think the word that Olivier used was quote unquote Classic Lab which would have included, excluded process analytics. So actually our Industrial business did a little bit better than what you described.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc.","Okay, I understand. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Sung Ji Nam with Cantor. Your line is open.","Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Hi, can you hear me okay?","William P. Donnelly","Yes, we can hear you great.","Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P.","Thank you. So I was wondering, you obviously had a good quarter for your Lab business, had more difficult comps for product inspection. Just curious, I know I think you guys have roughly a quarter of your business exposed to biopharma. And in light of all the announcements about mergers and potential mergers, I was wondering kind of how that might or if it all, impact your business going forward?","Olivier A. Filliol","These merger activities that we see today in big pharma and partially also expected associated restructuring has been going on for quite a while. And we had that in the past few years in the West. In essence, we\u2019ve also learned from that that this can impact some of our Lab categories, but then all the lab categories might benefit. So to give you an illustration, while the number of scientist might go down, and this could impact the pipette business partially also the Lab -- balance business, but then the automated chemistry typically benefits from that, because these new companies want to invest in automation tools. Then what I also want to stress is that none of this big pharma customers are really representing a big part of our revenue, not -- we don\u2019t have a single customer that is representing more than 1% of revenue and in that sense we are particularly exposed to it. And then last, but not least this has been a continuous trend that we\u2019d see the pharma, biopharma more challenging in the West, but more than offset by the activities and the growth going on in the East. All the CROs and all the auto partially government driven investments in this biopharma industry sector.","Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P.","Great. Thank you. And then just one more question on China. Obviously you\u2019re seeing the region playing out as you had expected thus far. I was wondering kind of if you could talk about the competitive landscape. I know you\u2019ve talked about in the past walking away from some of the project, and I also was wondering if there are further opportunities for pruning your -- or rightsizing your product portfolio there?","Olivier A. Filliol","Yes. In terms of portfolio this was some thing that we did last year and then rapidly executed by absent of any major changes in the economic environment. I don\u2019t see that we\u2019ve additional steps that we\u2019d take. And in terms of competitive landscape, we keep our discipline on payment terms and so we still have cases where we see competitors accepting these payment terms that we\u2019d not. We are okay. We are okay; we definitely feel that keeping the discipline is more important. We don\u2019t have full transparency about market share on a quarterly basis, and we\u2019ve many competitors that don\u2019t publish numbers. But exchanging with the teams, I really don\u2019t feel that we are losing here market share, in contrary, especially against international players, we\u2019re very well positioned and I feel we continue to win market share even in this environment and even that we keep this very disciplined approach to payment terms.","Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P.","Great. Thank you.","Olivier A. Filliol","Thank you.","Operator","There are no additional questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back to our presenters.","Mary T.

My name is Kyle, and I'll be your audio coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the presentation over to our hostess for today's call, Ms. Mary Finnegan. Please proceed, ma'am.","Mary T. Finnegan","Thanks, Kyle, and good evening, everyone. I'm Mary Finnegan. I'm the Treasurer and responsible for Investor Relations at Mettler-Toledo. I'm happy to have you joining us tonight. I am joined here by Olivier Filliol, our CEO; and Bill Donnelly, our Executive Vice President.","I need to disclose a couple of administrative matters before we get started. This call is being webcast and is available on our website. A copy of the press release and the presentation that we will refer to today is also on our website.","The safe harbor language is outlined on Page 1 of the presentation.

More detailed information with respect to the use of and differences between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided in our Form 8-K.","Let me now turn the call over to Olivier.","Olivier A. Filliol","Thank you, Mary, and welcome to everyone on the call. I will start with a summary of the quarter, and then Bill will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments before we open the lines for Q&A.","The highlights for the quarter are on Page 2 of the presentation. Local currency sales increased 6% in the quarter, with better-than-expected growth in Europe, despite strong results in this region in the year earlier period.","Americas continues to perform quite well, and Asia\/Rest of World had good growth against easier comparison.","Solid top line organic sales growth combined with our margin improvement and cost control initiatives led to good growth in earnings per share in the quarter. While there is greater economic uncertainty today, we feel good about our outlook for the remainder of this year and for 2015.","I will have some further comments on our outlook later on the call, but now I will turn it to Bill to cover the numbers.","William P. Donnelly","Thanks, Olivier, and hello, everybody. Sales were $629.1 million in the quarter, that's an increase of 6% in local currency. On the U.S. dollar basis, sales also increased by 6% as currency had no impact on sales in the quarter.","Turning to Page 3 of the presentation. We outlined sales by geography. In the quarter, local currency sales increased by 7% in the Americas, by 4% in Europe, and by 7% in Asia\/Rest of World, all as compared to the prior year. For China specifically, local currency sales increased by 4%, which was modestly better than expected and included the delivery of 2 large projects.","The next slide provides year-to-date sales, which increased by 5% in local currency. By region for the 9 months, sales have increased by 5% in both the Americas and Europe and by 4% in Asia\/Rest of World.","Sales growth by product line for the quarter is highlighted on Slide #5. Laboratory sales increased by 6% in local currency, while industrial sales increased by 7% driven by strong growth in Product Inspection. Food retailing was flat in the quarter.","For the 9-month period, which you see on the next slide, laboratory sales increased by 6% in local currency, while industrial sales increased by 4% and food retailing was up 2%.","Now turning to Slide #7. Let me walk you through the other key items in the P&L. Our gross margins were at 54.6%, an 80-basis-point increase over the prior year margin of 53.8%. We benefited from pricing and lower material costs, which were offset somewhat by unfavorable currency and mix. R&D amounted to $30.4 million, an increase of 3% in local currency.","SG&A amounted to $168.5 million, which is an increase of 7% in local currency. Higher variable compensation expense and increased investment in our field sales organization were offset in part by cost savings and lower employee benefit cost.","Our adjusted operating income was $126.7 million in the quarter, and that's a 9% increase over the prior year amount of $116.1 million. Our operating margins were 20.1%, which is a 50-basis-point increase over the prior year.","We estimate currencies reduced operating profit by about $1 million. Without the impact of currency, operating profit would've increased 10%, and operating margins would've increased by 80 basis points in the quarter.","A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $7.2 million. Interest expense was $6 million, while our effective tax rate continued to be 24%.","Fully diluted shares for the quarter were $29.4 million, which is a 3.8% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted earnings per share was $2.95 per share, a 13% increase over the prior year amount of $2.60 per share. Currency reduced adjusted earnings per share by approximately 1%.","On a reported basis, earnings per share was $2.89 as compared to $2.43 in the prior year period. Reported EPS includes pretax restructuring charges of $1.1 million or $0.03 per share, which are primarily employee-related costs. Reported EPS also included $0.03 of purchased intangible amortization.","The next slide provides details on our year-to-date results. Specifically for the 9 months, local currency sales increased by 5%, operating profit was up 7% and adjusted earnings per share have increased by 11%. For the 9-month period, currency reduced earnings per share by about 2.5%.","Now turning to cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter amounted to $106 million, relatively consistent with the prior year amount. We continue to benefit from good working capital management, which offset to a degree by the timing of the tax payments and higher CapEx. Working capital statistics were solid in the quarter with ITO at 5.1x and our DSO at 42 days.","On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow of $235.7 million as compared to $195.4 million in the prior year. This represents a 25% increase on a per share basis.","Now let me turn to guidance. Forecasting is particularly challenging as we have a few different factors impacting our guidance. First, we're coming off a strong third quarter with results better than expected. Second, we feel very good about our market position and our execution. Third, we're continuing to invest in front-end resources, what we refer to as our field turbo programs. Offsetting these positive influences is the high degree of uncertainty in the global economy and the increasing volatility in financial markets, which could ultimately create greater uncertainty in the global economy and in our customers' investment outlook.","These are some general comments, and Olivier will provide some additional comments shortly. Taken all together, we expect local currency sales growth in the fourth quarter to be in the 4% to 5% range in local currency. This should result in adjusted earnings per share in the range of $4.12 per share to $4.17 per share or a growth rate of 8% to 9%.","With this guidance, we expect full year 2014 sales growth to be in the 4% to 5% range and adjusted EPS to be between $11.60 and $11.65, a growth rate of approximately 10%. This compares to our previous guidance of $11.45 to $11.60. The increase reflects our outperformance in Q3. Furthermore, we are absorbing about $0.06 of greater currency headwinds in the fourth quarter as compared to the last time we provided guidance.","Through our margin enhancement programs and cost control initiatives, we're able to offset this negative currency headwind and not lower guidance for the full year.","For 2015, our initial guidance is that local currency sales growth should be in the range of 4% to 5%, and our adjusted earnings per share will be in the range of $12.80 per share to $13.05, reflecting a growth rate of approximately 10% to 12%.","Let me provide you some additional details for your models. First, currency. We would expect currency to reduce sales growth in the fourth quarter by approximately 4%. For the full year 2014, currency will have no impact on sales. For 2015, we expect currency to reduce sales by approximately 2%.","In terms of the impact of currency on earnings, we would expect currency to reduce EPS growth by 2% in this coming fourth quarter. As just mentioned, this is more negative as compared to the last time we spoke to you, principally driven by a weaker yen, a weaker Canadian dollar and a weaker Aussie dollar. For full year 2014, currency is expected to reduce earnings growth by 2%. For 2015, we expect currency to reduce earnings per share growth by approximately 1%.","Okay, one final comment as you update your models. Our full year 2015 guidance is in line with current consensus. However, quarterly numbers are different. We will provide specific quarterly guidance throughout the year in 2015 as we typically do, but I did want to point out that the current consensus for the fourth -- for the first quarter reflects a 22% earnings per share growth, and second quarter consensus is at 16% growth rate. Both of these quarterly growth rates would be above our expectations. At this stage, we anticipate that the quarterly growth rates for 2015 will be in line with our full year EPS guidance that we just provided.","Okay, that's it for my side. And I'd like to turn it back over to Olivier.","Olivier A. Filliol","Thanks, Bill. And let me start with summary comments on business condition. Lab increased 6% in the third quarter with good growth in pipettes, Analytical Instruments, Automated Chemistry and Process Analytics. Balances have also grown in the quarter despite strong growth in the year-earlier period.","We are executing quite well in our laboratory business. Combination of strong product pipeline in Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives. I expect results in the fourth quarter and into 2015 to continue to be solid in lab.","Industrial increased 7% in the quarter. As expected, Product Inspection had very good growth, up 12% in the third quarter. The outlook for this market is favorable, given focus on brand protection in general and food safety in particular. We are well positioned in this business with strong relative market share, the most extensive product portfolio and the largest service network in the industry. We will face tougher comparisons as we get into 2015, but expect Product Inspection to have good growth in the coming years.","Core industrial was up 4% in the third quarter. I'm pleased to see growth in all regions of the world. We would expect low single-digit growth for our core industrial business in the fourth quarter and into 2015.","Finally, retail was flat in the quarter, but I expect some better growth for the remainder of this year and into next year as we have a couple of European orders that will benefit us.","Now let me make some additional comments by geography. As mentioned earlier, European sales growth was a little better than expected and amounted to 4% in the quarter. We have growth in most countries in Western Europe with exception of France, which was down slightly. Eastern Europe was down modestly with Russia particularly weak. We are cautious on this region, given the recent negative news. We will face more challenging comparisons in Europe overall, but I'm happy that we continue to execute very well and are capitalizing on our Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives and strong product pipeline in this region.","Americas had another very good quarter with sales growth of 7%. We had good growth in lab, Product Inspection and core industrial. Retail was down in the quarter against strong comparisons from the prior period. Our outlook for Americas is good. Asia\/Rest of World increased 7% in the quarter. Market conditions in China continued to stabilize and their growth of 4% was slightly better than expectation. In China, we again had very good growth in our core laboratory products offering. Product Inspection, retail and core industrial also had growth in the third quarter.","In general, China remains on track with our previously described expectations. We will remain cautious given the overcapacity in certain segments and the lack of investments in new plants and production life. While we expect conditions to continue to improve, the growth path remains sensitive. We expect China sales to be up modestly in the fourth quarter and expect better growth in 2015, principally due to easier comparisons.","In terms of other emerging markets, India, Brazil and Southeast Asia also performed well in the third quarter, and we expect continued solid performance from these regions.","One final comment on the quarter. Service had good growth in the quarter with revenue up 8% as compared to prior year. We had good growth in all geographic regions and in most product lines.","Let me update you on our field turbo program. We mentioned last quarter that we were selectively adding sales service personnel to capture specific growth opportunities. We worked hard in recent months to identify penetration opportunities at detailed level by product category and geography and customer segment. By benchmarking across various units, analyzing territories' coverage, the size and mix of relevant end-user industry, we can identify gaps where we can invest in additional sales coverage to gain growth and share.","We cannot pursue all these opportunities at once, so we prioritize based on expected return. Investments are not always front-line sales personnel. It can also be segment specialist, inside sales, telesales or telemarketing resources.","The additions are very specific and directed. For example, we are adding service sales personnel in Thailand, a high-end volume sales person in Germany, service technicians and inside sales personnel in Turkey, telemarketing and telesales in Eastern Europe, to name just a few example.","We expect to add more than 200 headcount over the next 12 to 18 months. We also see potential of additional resource additions in the future. These resources combined with our Spinnaker sales and marketing programs are the foundation for our strategy to continue to incrementally gain market share.","One final topic I want to cover today is key account management. As we have discussed in the past, our business is very fragmented with no end customer accounting for more than 1% of sales. As a result, few of our sales are subject to corporate procurement program scrutiny. However, we increasingly see opportunity for growth to global key accounts as multiple -- national seeks to develop global standards for quality of automation in their operations and R&D. Relationships at these customers often involve corporate engineering, R&D, quality control and other functions.","Let me explain this a little more. While a customer decision to purchase our instruments is almost always made at the local level, through targeted programs, we have been able to exploit our global capabilities to gain share in large global companies, especially in our Product Inspection and lab businesses.","Much of these increased efforts are derived through an increased desire by customers to globally control the product quality. In most product categories, the quality of our solution, our global presence and service capability provide hard-to-match value proposition for customers as compared to our competitors. Customers appreciate having out one strong partner globally when they invest in programs to enforce global quality standards and service standards.","We see a growing trend toward enforcement of these global quality standards with our multinational customers, and we believe we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of this trend. This is evidenced by some recent orders that we expect to gain more in the coming years.","That concludes the topics for today. Let me summarize key messages as we look to 2015.","We believe we are positioned well for continued growth. We are cautious on China and emerging markets in general, but we believe we see improved growth in these regions. We expect Americas to continue to perform well. Europe is a bit mixed, good results in the third quarter, but more recent market data is mixed. We also faced tougher comparisons in this region. Taken altogether, we believe we can continue to gain market share by capitalizing on our sales and marketing programs, including our field turbo investment and strong product pipeline.","Our continued focus on margin enhancement initiative combined with our strong cash flow generation and share repurchases should continue to drive earnings growth next year and beyond.","I want to ask the operator now to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Olivier, just qualitatively, can you give us a sense of the trends that you saw in, particularly in Europe and China in the period, and whether you're, I guess, qualitatively feeling directionally better about your progress, and I guess, the broader macro environment in those 2 regions?","Olivier A. Filliol","As stated, I was certainly pleased to see Europe coming in better than expected and our outlook in that sense stays favorable. In particular, when I listen to my team, we were, for example, on a big tour back in September where we visited the units and that was with recent contact also with the General Manager. What I hear from them is actually positive and makes me -- actually encourages me really for the future. What is more difficult is the news that I pick up in the newspapers, and that's certainly a more challenging environment when you read that. But we don't see that challenge in our own numbers at this stage. When it comes to China, I would say that our numbers have also slightly been above what we expected. But the environment stays challenging. I would say, of course, what we hear to the news, but also what I hear from our own managers, there are certain businesses that do really well. For example, the core lab business, where we continue to have very good growth numbers. Similar to Q1 and Q2, we have in Q3, actually, a double-digit growth in core lab. Process Analytics is still challenged, but that's mainly because last year we had a favorable environment Q2 regulation changes. Then when I come to Product Inspection, they had good numbers in China. And I expect them to continue to do well. But in China, we have a smaller piece of Product Inspection than the global average. So I mean it has a little bit less impact. And when it comes to Core Industrial, which is actually a big part of our Chinese business, we had some growth, and I expect actually that business to do okay going forward. But it is a business that is exposed to infrastructure investments, government spending and certainly, I do expect that this will continue to be challenging, because there is still overcapacity in China, and there are industry segments that are still suffering because of that. So all in all, I would say Q3 clearly showed that things gradually get better, but we remain cautious when it comes to China and Europe.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Bill, in terms of the guidance next year, what are you factoring for share repurchases? Should we expect it to be north of 100% of free cash flow next year? And then what are you baking in for local currency incremental margins? Will the field headcount expansions sort of push you to the lower end of what you would otherwise normally expect?","William P. Donnelly","Okay. So on the share repurchases, we're probably going to do something in the range of $75 million to $100 million more than our free cash flow. I go back to what we talked about, I think it's now 2 quarters ago, where we want to pick up on the share repurchase program given our balance sheet position. We just think we could do it a little bit more leveraged in our capital structure. With regard to incremental margins, they should, on a currency adjusted basis, remain in the low to mid-30s. And maybe one thing, I think, one of the things we feel good about with regard to the field turbo program is that it was very much a story of resource allocations. We have a number of cost savings initiatives, productivity initiatives inside the organization that just allowed us to be able to save in other areas of the business and be able to field these additional resources and what I would describe as a normal operating expense budget as compared to our 4% to 5% top line target that we described to you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes. Just -- could you, Olivier, maybe just expand a little bit on Europe? I mean, that was maybe the upside to plan in the quarter. And which of the product lines in particular surprised?","Olivier A. Filliol","It was pretty much across all the product lines that we did well and that we exceeded expectations. I really feel it's the teams that execute very well on the Spinnaker approaches that we talked about. We had also the benefit, for example, lease [ph] growth program that continued to yield very well. At the end of the day, I do feel like we are winning nicely share in Europe in this environment, and this is pretty much true across all the business lines.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And in China, Bill, you referenced 2 large projects in the comp period, Q3 of '13. Is that -- was that in industrial?","William P. Donnelly","No. Just to clarify, we had 2 large industrial projects. The 4% included us having delivered on 2 larger industrial projects within Q3 of this year. One was large -- they're both kind of infrastructure-related. One was a grain project, grain depot project. And the other was a -- some kind of a highway project, I think.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I understand. Okay. And so would it have been a point or 2 of the growth?","William P. Donnelly","It would've been, I think, between 2% and 3% of the growth in China, maybe 2%.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, okay. And, Olivier, did the field turbo program, is it targeted at -- you said basically, there's a lot of opportunities there. And so basically, you're allocating to the highest return. But are -- is that focused on lab or industrial or Product Inspection? Is there a piece of the business that we could zero in on and look for maybe a point of contribution to the growth rate next year to just see the results?","Olivier A. Filliol","And so the lab business gets most of all the businesses, but we do actuals of field turbo for industrial and within industrial, for example, for Core Industrial as well as for Product Inspection. It is so that we give most to businesses with the highest profitability. But, of course, there are also some geographies where we are underrepresented or are building up. I would, for example, namely Turkey. In Turkey, we are building up our presence in industrial business. As for the lab business, we have already done that in the past or we are building up also resources in Indonesia and Philippines. And so when we do such dedicated efforts for a full country, typically, we do it across business lines. But when it's in more mature markets, then it really goes to the business lines with the highest profitability.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, I see. And just maybe just as an offshoot to that, and then I'll jump off here. But when you think about new product spend, new product introductions and you're looking out into '15, could you take a guess at perhaps what the 4% to 5% might include from new products? And I guess possibly, it's less about volume growth and more about price pickup from the new products?","Olivier A. Filliol","Yes. The new products are really important to us because they are driving the replacement cycle. We need to make sure that we have new value proposition so that our customers are -- have good reasons to upgrade the product, replace the products. And of course, it's also important to differentiate ourselves versus competition. That's a key reason why we continue to launch and upgrade our product lines. And we have an excellent pipeline for next year. But I don't want to overstate and suggest that these new product launches will accelerate our growth. It's really more like, I guess described as, the pricing power that we have is not particularly coming from new product launches. The pricing power that we have is the total solution. It is our application specialist that we have. It is the product that is also the service capabilities. And when you look at our price increases that we do, it is pretty much across all the business lines. Of course, we differentiate. There are business lines where we have more pricing powers than others, but it's not so much related to new product. Now of course, when we launch new products, we want to make sure that we have better differentiated value proposition. And often, we want also to make sure that we have lower cost. And so new products help us to expand margins.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And is there a price component in that 4% to 5%? I mean, does it trend that maybe the current 2% or...","William P. Donnelly","Say it again. I don't know...","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Is there a price component in the 4% to 5% growth for '15? I mean, is it trend line out, let's say 2%? Or...","William P. Donnelly","Yes, yes. I think -- we think it could be 150 basis points, hopefully more, approaching 2%, somewhere in that range.","Olivier A. Filliol","Yes, which is about what we have this year. So next year, not a big change. Maybe one additional comment. When you asked before, if there is a particular product line that's more impacted than others from these product launches. If I -- there are 2 business lines that got a lot of new products launched recently or will happen in the next 2 quarter. One is our lab balance business, where we have the high-end as well as the entry line that will have a new product and very, very good product. And the other one is Product Inspection. In Product Inspection, we have, across all the business units, actually new product. This is true for checkweighing. This is true for metal detection. And late last year, we launched also a new platform for x-ray. So we're going to have a very up-to-date product line in this business. For all -- for example, Core Industrial, it's more coming in the next few quarters, where we have promising products, and in essence, differentiation in the market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I know you give some commentary on China in the prepared remarks and thus far in Q&A. But I was hoping to maybe get a little more granularity on why exactly the region did better this quarter than your expectations? And reason for asking is sort of if we look towards next year, I think your prior quarter commentary had suggested you're anticipating a better year in '15. And as a result, planning to invest there. So I just want to confirm that, that's all the case and maybe give us a sense of what you saw in the ground this quarter.","William P. Donnelly","So maybe a couple of comments. So if we divide the business up into the different components, we continue to have a very good year in our peer laboratory instruments. So as you guys know, within the laboratory instrument category, we have our traditional benchtop stuff as well as our Process Analytics business. Our benchtop type instrumentations have grown by -- in double digits in this quarter. And on a year-to-date basis, we continue to think that, that should do well. We're very well positioned competitively there and made great strides in terms of distribution. And we don't run into maybe some of the same hurdles that some of the peer group companies have, because maybe in part I'm sure because our ASPs are a little bit below theirs. The Process Analytics business faces some tough comps the last few quarters because of some regulatory benefits that they had last year that have now expired, and we would expect that business to grow better next year. If we look at our Core Industrial that -- where Olivier made some mentions of infrastructure concerns in certain segments with regard to overcapacity. But if we look, the percentage of our business related to those markets does get smaller. And we see good growth in certain segments like food-related, for example, there. And we would expect to have marginally better business in that sector. And then our Product Inspection business does quite good in China. So I think this year, we're going to end up finishing the year kind of in an apples-to-apples basis with low single-digit growth in China. And we would be surprised if it wasn't somewhere in the mid-single-digits to high single-digit growth rates for next year.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. That's very helpful. One follow-up would be on the service business. You obviously had a nice year there as well so far. And just trying to get a sense of how we should think about the service contribution to growth in '15 versus '14.","William P. Donnelly","So you're right, we did have good growth. I think it was 8% in the third quarter and on a year-to-date basis, a little less than that. We have been investing a lot in our -- in globalizing our service business in recent years and in productizing it, that we can market it and sell it better at the point-of-sale and throughout the product's life cycle. And I think we're really in any ways just scratching the surface in terms of the benefits of those programs, but we think we have a lot of years to run in that regard, and we have a lot of, what I would describe, operational excellence, momentum within that business. And I don't mean it just from a margin enhancement point of view, but the way we sell in-market to products as well. So I would, again, expect that the service business will grow faster than the product business in '15.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Clark from Evercore ISI.","James Clark - Evercore ISI, Research Division","This is James filling in for Ross Muken. Guys, I was just wondering if you could give a sense for pricing during the quarter. And then I think you talked about coming into the year about 150 basis points. And looks like you did 200 and 240 in the first and second quarter. Maybe you can give a sense if pricing is generally coming in better than you'd expected. And how that's impacting gross margin?","William P. Donnelly","Yes. So just to clarify the reference to 150 to 200 basis points was with regard what our assumption is for 2015. With regard to Q3 this year, we realized about 240 basis points of price increases, and that puts us slightly north of 200 basis points on a year-to-date basis. There was a couple areas in the product groups where we tried to push a little bit more price, but not via list price increases, but rather via reduced discounting in the couple product categories midyear where we felt that things were going well. And so that's -- we continue to think the fourth quarter will also be a good quarter pricing-wise.","James Clark - Evercore ISI, Research Division","Okay. And then one more on China. If you could just call out how orders were during the quarter. I know you talked about some orders converting to revs and how that contributed to the 4% growth. But maybe you could talk about sort of how orders track relative to revenue growth?","William P. Donnelly","So back to the delivery of those 2 large products. The -- I'm embarrassed, I keep forgetting the second one. One is grain-related and whatever the second project is. Those 2 were order entry in earlier period and sales in this period. So order entry growth was slightly less than sales growth in Q3. And we would expect sales growth in Q4 to be in line with the order entry growth that we saw in Q3, both single digits.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JP Morgan.","Patrick Donnelly - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is actually Patrick Donnelly filling in for Tycho. Just looking at guidance for 2015, can you talk through geographies a little bit, particularly Europe? I know you're strong this quarter but had some cautious commentary based on the date and headlines that are out there. So maybe just talk through your expectations there for 2015?","William P. Donnelly","Okay. So we would expect Europe to grow a little bit less in '15 and in '14. At least that's our assumption at this stage. We're assuming low single-digit, 2% to 4%, growth coming out of Europe within that guidance. There is one or the other large jab that we have in the comps. And in general, we built a little bit of caution in given the economic environment.","Patrick Donnelly - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just on gross margin, obviously, you called out prices impact this quarter. Can you also maybe just break out the raw materials? And then how much of a headwind was FX? And then do the same thing for 2015, you talked about 150 bps tailwind for pricing in '15. Maybe just talk about what kind of headwind FX would be and also the tailwind from raw materials?","William P. Donnelly","Okay. So with regard to material costs. Material costs were down, let's call it 150 bps in the quarter and for the full year. We're happy with that number. I don't think we can do something like that again next year. But we should have raw material cost flat to down, let's call it, 1%, somewhere in that range for 2015. And so that would kind of give you the -- those components for '14 and '15. With regard to foreign exchange and the operating profit level, which is maybe the, I think, the easiest way to communicate about it. If you take the rates as of beginning of this week, so including that yen move at the end of the last week, we would have -- we would have had a headwind of $10 million on our P&L in 2014 for the full year. And we would expect a $4 million headwind in 2015, again, all based on current rates. So the main drivers there is the yen, the Aussie dollar and the Canadian. And I feel like I've hardly ever said this on our conference call, but I think we even get a modest benefit from the Swiss franc. So thank you, Switzerland. Thank you, Olivier. So yes, I think I answered your questions, Patrick.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Rafael Tejada - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It's Rafael Tejada in for Derik. Actually just a couple more clarification questions on the guidance for the 2015 outlook. I think you just mentioned that Europe, you're anticipating about a 2% to 4% growth. Apologies if I missed it, but what are you anticipating for Americas and Asia Pac?","William P. Donnelly","Probably in Americas, we'll do a little bit better than that. I think mid-single digits. And then Asia Pac should be mid-single to high single digits.","Rafael Tejada - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And the same goes for the product segments. Just trying to get a better sense of what you're anticipating for Q4 and '15?","William P. Donnelly","Okay. So just to be clear, the comments I made on geographies were 2015 comments. And if I make the same comments in terms of the business categories, the lab business should grow mid-single digit, with the PI business growing better than that, high single digits and probably the Core Industrial business slightly under that -- let's call it at 3%, 4% range. And that should get the industrial business also up to the mid-single-digit level. And then food retailing, it's probably got a -- at this point, it's -- a large jab [ph] could make a big difference. But we're assuming low-single digit growth for that business next year. But as Olivier and myself have said on many occasions, we're not trying to trigger growth in that business. If it happens, it happens. The key is that they are -- continue to enhance their margins and minimize their invested capital. And they did an excellent job on that this past quarter, we're expecting continued progress again next year.","Rafael Tejada - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And a few other on gross margin. Just wondering, so we talked about some of the headwinds and tailwinds. But just wondering what other levers the company has to offset the volatility in currencies?","William P. Donnelly","Well, we have a lot of ongoing margin enhancement and cost savings initiatives. I make a couple of specific comments here. We should get more progress again on pricing and material cost, I commented on, we expect them to be flat to down next year. I think one of the most interesting areas of productivity is if you look at the operating expenses, we're assuming in the sales growth targets we've provided, it's really quite efficient if you take into account the 200 people being added via the field turbo program that Olivier has mentioned earlier. Both of us have been here a long time, and we've never added so many people in the front end, particularly in the Western part of the business. And to be able to do that within the confines of the sales budget we described, show you that there's a lot of cost productivity being gained in other parts of the business that allow us to fund that efficiently, fund that type of growth opportunity efficiently. And one other comment to reiterate that I maybe elaborate on something Olivier said during his prepared remarks is that in the first year as a salesman, that's probably their least productive year. And the people that we are adding as part of this program are going to help us down the road as well and get -- and naturally become more productive themselves. And it's -- so that's one of the reasons you may be sensed the excitement we have with what we started here.","Rafael Tejada - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And just one final one on Western Europe. I mean, you cited good growth there with France being the exception. Can you just expand on what's going on there and whether you're anticipating a rebound?","William P. Donnelly","Okay. So yes, in terms of France, they had a relatively weaker third quarter, but I would highlight, it was against a plus 7 in the prior year. So I wouldn't overdo it there. Our general view is that right now the economic condition is maybe uncertain. But if you look at it, it's -- as compared to maybe 2009 or 2012 where you had real buttoning down the hatches in Europe, we just need our customers in Europe to continue on their normal replacement cycles. And that's generally the read we have. And if they do that, we're going to get our own shares of the business. We're going to get some pricing, and we're likely get a little bit of our competitors share as well. And that should position us well in Europe. We feel like that's maybe one part of the world, probably the part of the world that we're best executing on our Spinnaker initiatives and feel really great about their ability to take what the market gives and probably a little more.","Olivier A. Filliol","And on the -- specifically on France, if I look at year-to-date numbers, it's more reasonable. And in France, we have a situation where the retail business suffers because the retail that's in France overall are under quite some pressure, and we see it. But the core business for us actually does quite reasonably in France. And this is actually just proving again that the execution of the team on all of the Spinnaker programs is going actually really well.","Rafael Tejada - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just one final one. If -- with the 4% to 5% outlook for 2015, I'm just trying to get a better sense of what you think the underlying markets are growing. Just getting a better sense of how much the components of market share gains are contributing to the company's growth?","William P. Donnelly","That's always a tough number for us to kind of quantify. But within the 4% to 5%, we think that every year we're gaining some amount of basis points, whether it's 25 basis points up to 100 basis points of market share gain. And then the rest, I guess, would be in your words, the growth in the market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Reggie Miller from Citi.","Reginald Miller - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I was just -- one question for me. Maybe, Bill, could you kind of update us on where you see the plan to kind of optimize the capital structure? Where we are at with any, I guess, at this point? And maybe the kind of the steps that we can expect to see from you guys adding, I guess, going forward?","William P. Donnelly","So I think maybe the first comment would be is that we've always felt that there was a lot of cash flow generation in the business, and that it was stable, stable cash flow, highly predictable cash flow. And we feel that underlying our model and kind of the -- our most promise to shareholders is that we can continue to share repurchase program and invest our full free cash flow back and return that back to them. Recently, we have updated that model to say that we have room to have some extra leverage in the business even if we -- even beyond what we would need to continue to do bolt-on acquisitions here and there. In the course of 2014, we're going to have extra repurchases in $50 million to $75 million range. I mentioned earlier on the call that we'll probably do $75 million to $100 million next year. And sitting here today, it's tough to predict. I think we have to -- it's one of these things we look at regularly. We review with our Board of Directors regularly. But I think we certainly would have room, absent a more sizable acquisition, to continue to do that for some period going forward. We would tend to think that we would be very comfortable with the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1x, and that compares to today -- or north of 1x, sorry. And today, it's about 0.7.","Reginald Miller - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. And maybe your thoughts on adding leverage in the near term?","William P. Donnelly","I guess the leverage we would had would just be these incremental repurchases.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Paul Knight from Janney Montgomery.","Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Olivier, could you talk about the service business. You brought that up a little more, I think, than usual on this earnings call. Is service giving you a little more pricing leverage, customer retention and higher growth than perhaps where you were in past years?","Olivier A. Filliol","So services is going up in our total mix. And today, we have service and consumables together which is about 30% of our total revenue. Service has above group average profitability. So it's certainly, from a financial standpoint, very attractive for us. And then there is this additional strategic benefit that you alluded to, which is we get excellent customer access. It's a great tool for us to understand when customers are thinking about new project or thinking about replacing and upgrading the instruments. So it's a driver also for our product sales. And in that sense, we very much like to expand our penetration for -- with service of our installed base and selectively actually also of competitive installed base. And however, to grow service really needs many different efforts. It's not just adding service technicians, it is really understanding the installed base, developing additional value proposition for our customers on service. And then going off within opportunities to different channels. So point of sales, we need to sell service contracts, but we need also to activate telesales to go back to the installed base that is not yet under contract. And we have also quite a few dedicated sales service specialists that go visit big accounts and to sell bigger service contracts. I feel really good about all these programs that we have around the world. And the results, over the last few years, actually confirmed that we're on the right track. In parallel, what we're also doing is harmonizing our service offering across the world. In the past, every country had their own service products, their own service pricing and their own value propositions. We are more and more harmonizing that also in the context of our promotion program, and the money or the benefit that could cause to do so. So it's kind of a pre-investment for the future that we are in the middle in.","Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","On [indiscernible] I will just conclude, on 2015 guidance, could you -- did you mention what growth rates would be? And added to that, service would be above that level, is that correct?","Olivier A. Filliol","Yes, we expect service to grow above the group average. And that is above the product's growth rates, yes.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to management.","Mary T. Finnegan","Thanks, Kyle. Thanks, everyone, for joining us tonight. As always, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to give us a call. Take care. Good night.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
