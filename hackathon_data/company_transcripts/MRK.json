My name is Andrea, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Merck\u2019s Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","I would like to now turn the call over to your host, Joe Romanelli. You may begin your conference.","","Joe Romanelli","Thank you, Andrea, and good morning everyone. We would also like to say good afternoon and good evening to everyone listening outside the United States. Welcome to Merck\u2019s second quarter 2013 conference call. Before I turn the call over to Ken, I want to point out just a couple of items.","First, there are number of items in the GAAP results, such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded those items in our non-GAAP reconciliation tables and you can see this in our press release in table two. This will give you a better sense of the underlying performance of the business. There are three tables in the press release. The first table is the GAAP results. Table number two reconciles our GAAP P&L to the non-GAAP results for the second quarter and table three provide the sales performance for the company\u2019s business units and our products, both on a recorded basis and excluding exchange.","During the call, we will refer to table two when we discuss the P&L and table three when we talk about revenue performance. Finally, I would like to remind you that some of the statements we make during today\u2019s call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are based upon Merck\u2019s current beliefs of management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. The company\u2019s SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2012 10-K identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made this morning.","Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings can be found on the website at merck.com. You can also find our earnings release and all the tables there as well.","So, with that this morning, I am joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Adam Schechter, our President of Global Human Health, he will update you on our product and geographic performance; Peter Kellogg, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review our P&L and provide an update on our outlook for 2013; and lastly, Roger Perlmutter, our President of Merck Research Labs will provide you with an update on some of our key programs.","With that, I would like to introduce Ken Frazier. Ken?","","Ken Frazier","Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. It\u2019s a pleasure to be here again today to provide an update on our performance and to highlight some of the key events from the quarter. We continue to focus on our core strategy. In so doing, we will build shareholder value by prioritizing investments in our best commercial growth opportunities with key in-line products and in innovative R&D. Second, making disciplined decisions regarding the allocation of resources and managing our cost effectively, this approach is especially critical in a period when we are navigating significant patent expirations and adapting to the global healthcare environment.","This quarter, our business momentum accelerated while we continued to manage our costs. We believe these results more accurately reflect the strength of our underlying portfolio when compared to the first quarter of this year. We are still working hard to improve the competitive position and growth potential of key brands like JANUVIA, which will allow us to drive our top line growth in the future. In addition, we continue to managing our expenses and are maintaining our EPS guidance for the year. Peter Kellogg will provide more detail on our revenue and cost assumption. For the quarter, we delivered an EPS of $0.84. This reflected underlying sales growth of 3% excluding the impact of foreign exchange and patent expiries. The growth was driven primarily by our Global Human Health business, including strong performance from our diabetes, immunology, and vaccine franchises. In total, 7 of our top 10 products grew in the second quarter. As always, Adam will provide more detail on specific product performance. The fundamentals of our complementary businesses, animal health and consumer care remained strong. We continue to view these businesses as important components of our diverse portfolio.","In terms of geographic performance, we grew 10% in emerging markets in the second quarter, excluding exchange. In the past several months, I have had the opportunity to visit Brazil and Korea to see firsthand both the tremendous potential of these markets and the extraordinary enthusiasm of the MSD colleagues there. In Korea, for example, our diabetes and vaccine businesses are performing particularly well. The emerging markets now account for approximately 22% of our pharmaceutical sales with China continuing as a key growth driver.","Moving to the longer-term view, we remain committed to pursuing innovative science that translates into medically important products. To sustain our ability to do so however we are mindful that we must continue to find ways to improve our cash flow and build shareholder value over both the short and long term a commitment we also take very seriously. One way we demonstrate our commitment to building value in the short term is by returning cash to shareholders. Year-to-date we have returned nearly $9 billion to shareholders who both our dividend and stock buybacks. We have repurchased over a 120 million shares including our accelerated share repurchase in May.","Longer term shareholder value is of course driven by innovative R&D and improving the return on R&D investments. Roger will share his views in a moment but I would like to comment on why we believe innovation is the path to sustainable value and needs to remain the cornerstone of Merck\u2019s efforts despite challenges like the recent (inaudible) exit and Sugammadex delays. There is an increasing need for innovative treatments that offer meaningful differentiation of patients and demonstrate value to payers. This is true for chronic diseases like diabetes but also in areas of tremendous scientific opportunity such as cancer immunotherapies and neuroscience.","I\u2019m excited about the program like our anti-PD-1 for oncology and our ACE inhibitor for Alzheimer\u2019s disease to have the potential to alter the course of medicine. With the opportunities we see before us I want to be clear that we intend to aggressively manage our costs in the short term and our fundamental cost space over the long term. We need to do this in order to preserve our ability to invest in our future and have the flexibility to respond to the opportunities and challenges presented by the global healthcare environment. In the second quarter we continue to take out cost and prioritize our investments. We\u2019re doing this while supporting future growth in core brands and in the pipeline.","Let me share two examples, first with Januvia, we continue making the necessary investments behind this franchise to ensure that we maintain our leadership position in the increasingly competitive diabetes market and maximize opportunities for future growth. Second with PD1 we have created a strong expert team which streamline decision making. We committed to making critical investments to ensure that we fully realize the potential of this important product and bring it to patients as quickly as possible.","In summary we\u2019re committed to driving top-line performance with key growth product and key geographies. Advancing and augmenting our pipelines and aggressively managing our cost base. By doing these things well we will preserve the ability to invest in our future, continue to generate strong cash flow and drive shareholder value and return over both the short and long term. I would like to now turn the call over to my colleague Adam Schechter. Adam?","","Adam Schechter","Thank you Ken. Good morning everyone. This morning I will focus my remarks and the performance of our core products and our core markets. Let me begin with the overall performance. Human health sales declined 12% in the second quarter, our top-line results continue to reflect the loss of exclusivity a SINGULAIR, PROPECIA, CLARINEX and MAXALT and weakness in the yen, excluding sales in these products are underlying business grew 4% on a constant currency basis. Two contributors were Januvia and Janumet, Simponi and our vaccine business, only provide some more details. I\u2019ll start with the Januvia and Janumet franchise. The franchise has sales of $1.5 billion and 10% growth excluding exchange. The franchise grew 9% in the United States and 11% in International markets. In the United States, demand price, and inventory contributed to growth. With regard to demand we were able to maintain a 75% TRx share of the very competitive DPP-4 market.","Volume grew slightly by about 1% this quarter, regarding price we did see a benefit this quarter from price. We have increased price over the last year but we have also seen increase rebate and pricing pressures as competitors seek to improve their former position by increasing discounts.","Finally, on inventory, our customers increased their inventory levels by about $30 million in the second quarter. If we exclude this inventory benefit, we believe our sales would have grown by about 5% in the United States in line with our expectations. In the international markets, JANUVIA and JANUMET had good volume growth in every region around the world and retained market leadership with a 70% global market share.","Now, let me touch on our outlook for the rest of the year. We continue to expect mid-single-digit sales growth in the United States, which excludes channel movements that are difficult to predict. We also continue to expect low double-digit growth, excluding exchange internationally. In the United States, we continue to invest and change the current TRx trend. We have focused our resources on JANUVIA to drive demand and to defend our strong leadership position in a highly competitive market. Globally, there continued to be good growth opportunities in the diabetes market and we are positioned well with the market leading DPP-IV inhibitor.","So, moving now to ISENTRESS, ISENTRESS sales of $410 million, which represents about 5% growth? In the United States, we are maintaining our patients here despite new competition. Outside of the U.S., ISENTRESS continues to have good volume growth offset partially by pricing pressure in Europe and timing of emerging market purchases this quarter. In our cholesterol franchise, ZETIA and VYTORIN global sales were up by about 1% over the prior year. ZETIA growth was partially offset by decline in VYTORIN sales. We are currently launching LIPTRUZET, the combination of ZETIA plus atorvastatin in the U.S. This product reinforces the benefit that this family of products can provide to many patients who continue to have high LDL cholesterol despite the wide use of statins.","Moving to immunology, the combined immunology business consisting of REMICADE and SIMPONI grew 11% in the quarter, excluding exchange. The growth was driven mostly by SIMPONI. Sales of SIMPONI grew 60% to $120 million this quarter. We are continuing to see a positive impact in the launch in France and the reintroduction of the autoinjector in Germany. Last week, we received a positive CHMP decision for an additional indication in ulcerative colitis, and we look forward to potential approval later this year.","Moving to VICTRELIS, the global sales of $116 million this quarter. Growth in emerging markets was offset by continued contraction of the Hepatitis C market in many countries, including the United States.","Lastly, moving to our vaccine business, which had another strong quarter. GARDASIL maintained its strong performance with 20% growth year-over-year. Second quarter sales benefited from continued uptake of the male indication in the United States and timing of government purchases in Latin America. Those were partially offset by lower sales in Japan. In Japan, the government recently suspended the proactive recommendation of HPV vaccines. We anticipate this decision will have a significant negative impact on the rest of sales of GARDASIL in Japan. For reference, sales of GARDASIL were $140 million in Japan last year. We are working with and we are providing information to the government on the vast amount of safety and efficacy data available for GARDASIL. On the other hand, we are pleased that the Ministry of Health in Brazil recently announced the National Immunization Program with GARDASIL to begin in 2014.","Moving on to ZOSTAVAX, ZOSTAVAX sales were $140 million this quarter. As we had expected, sales in United States declined sequentially due to seasonality. We expect the second half of the year to be stronger than the first half and the strongest quarter will likely depend on the start of the flu vaccination season. We continue to see ZOSTAVAX as a key growth driver. In the United States, we estimate that a little over 20% of the population ages 16 or older have received vaccine to-date. So, there remains opportunity for growth. Internationally, we are just beginning launches in the few Asian markets, including Korea. And we continue to anticipate our first European launch in the UK this fall with additional markets in 2014.","Now, I would like to touch on our performance on a regional level. In the United States, Europe, and Canada, sales continued to be affected by the loss of exclusivity of SINGULAIR, MAXALT, PROPECIA and CLARINEX excluding these products U.S. sales increased by 7% and sales in Europe and Canada were flat in the second quarter. Japan\u2019s sales declined 4% ex-exchange that was due to an increase in the utilization of generic versus branded products and lower sales of Gardasil which I mentioned earlier. Emerging markets has another good quarter with 10% ex-exchange sales growth that includes 10% growth in China. Growth in the emerging market was broad-based that came from our base business, our new products and our joint ventures. And key emerging markets, our growth is outpacing the overall market and we expect to continue to deliver strong growth in 2013.","In closing the human health business demonstrated growth of our underlying portfolio of key brands. In August we will annualize the SINGULAIR expires in the United States but we also anticipate generic entry in the United States for Temodar, despite the significant number of patent expires we\u2019re facing this year. I\u2019m confident that we can drive growth of our strong and our diverse portfolio. Now I would like to turn the call over to my colleague, Peter Kellogg.","","Peter Kellogg","Thank you Adam and good morning. As you heard from Ken and Adam our core brands performed well this quarter. Furthermore we continue to manage cost effectively while investing for future growth; additionally we executed a significant capital initiative in the quarter. Our confidence and our future cash flows and the historically low cost of debt allowed us to return cash to shareholders in the form of $5 billion accelerated share repurchase. This accelerated repurchase is a key component of our goal to buyback $7.5 billion of shares within the first 12 months of our $15 billion repurchase program announced in May.","These results and actions demonstrate that Merck is committed to improving our performance in the short term, investing for the long term and continuing to allocate capital in a shareholder friendly manner. This morning, I will briefly talk about our performance in the second quarter and now I will discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2013.","My remarks will focus on our non-GAAP financials, starting on the bottom-line we\u2019re a $0.84 per share this quarter compared to a $1.05 in the prior year. On the top-line, total company sales declined 8% in the second quarter excluding an unfavorable exchange impact of 3%. As Adam said sales increased 4% in our pharmaceutical business if you exclude generic erosion and foreign exchange.","Animal health sales increased 1% year-over-year excluding exchange driven by companion animal and poultry businesses. In consumer health we had a onetime unfavorable adjustment to sales this quarter excluding these adjustment consumer health sales would have been up 4% on a constant currency basis. Moving to other revenues we saw an increase in supply sales to AstraZeneca in the second quarter. Despite this we continue to expect the supply sales will decrease as we approach the May 2014 U.S. patent expiration for Nexium.","At the PGM line as previously discussed generic erosion of high gross margin products also created 2.5% headwind on the gross margin this quarter. As a result our non-GAAP gross margin declined on a year-over-year basis to 75.7%. As we indicated previously we expect the full year gross margin ratio to be about 1% lower than 2012 due to this mix shift in our sales. Turning to marketing and administrative expenses, our second quarter SG&A expenses were about $60 million lower year-over-year excluding foreign exchange benefits and some onetime corporate charges, we reduced our SG&A spending by about a $100 million this quarter. Similar to last quarter we continued to proactively reduce spending.","As a result of our cost reductions we continue to expect SG&A spending in 2013 will be lower than 2012. Moving on to R&D, research and development expenses in the second quarter were a $144 million lower than prior year. However we recall that last year we had a significant upfront payment of a $120 million for our agreement within the site excluding this R&D expense would have been relatively flat.","Other income and expense was about a $100 million higher year-over-year primarily as a result of foreign exchange losses and interest expenses. In the month of May we concluded a $6.5 billion debt offering at a blended average interest rate of less than 2%. This debt offering funded our accelerated share repurchase and we now have new interest expense and lower shares outstanding","Moving to tax, our non-GAAP tax rate was 21.9% in the second quarter. We are maintaining our estimated full year tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 23%. The tax rate for the second half of the year will be considerably higher compared to the rate in the first two quarters.","Now, turning to the 2013 outlook, on the bottom line, we are reconfirming our 2013 non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $3.45 to $3.55. On a GAAP basis, we expect to earn between $1.84 and $2.05. Now, for additional color on the outlook for the rest of the year, let\u2019s start with revenue. During the second quarter, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen against many global currencies. If today\u2019s foreign exchange rates persist, we would expect full year 2013 sales to be negatively affected by about 3 percentage points, which is greater than we had previously anticipated.","Given our performance in the first half of 2013, the continued strength of the U.S. dollar and select product trends, we have adjusted our full year revenue expectations. We now anticipate that total company revenue will be 5% to 6% below 2012, including the negative impact of foreign exchange. While we have adjusted our sales guidance, we are maintaining our EPS guidance through cost management and SG&A and R&D. Accordingly, we now expect R&D expenses in 2013 to be lower than 2012.","Moving to the quarters, as we think about the back half of the year, we see improvement in EPS performance compared to the first half of the year. Additionally, we anticipate that the fourth quarter will be higher than the third quarter from an EPS perspective. So, in conclusion, this was a solid quarter, where we successfully executed a major capital initiative to return cash to shareholders. We also drove growth in our key brands while managing costs and we continue to step up our efforts on our key R&D programs. Thank you.","Now, I will turn the call over to Roger who will provide an update on MRL. Roger?","","Roger Perlmutter","Thanks Peter. During the second quarter, we made steady progress in clarifying the registration process for Merck\u2019s next wave of products and advanced our clinical trials in important areas. For SUVOREXANT, our first-in-class orexin antagonist for the treatment of insomnia, the FDA has provided a clear path to registration through their complete response letter, which we received at the end of the quarter. We are making good progress in preparing 10 milligram and 5 milligram SUVOREXANT dosage forms to enable initiation of therapy at lower starting doses, which was the principal change requested in the FDA\u2019s review.","We hope to be able to begin stability testing of these materials in the very near future with a goal of submitting definitive data in response to FDA\u2019s requests in the first half of 2014. As was demonstrated at the FDA Advisory Committee Review in May, SUVOREXANT has distinctive therapeutic properties, which we believe will enable it to become an important treatment for patients suffering from insomnia.","Turning to other regulatory actions, two weeks ago, we announced that the FDA had postponed its Advisory Committee Review of SUGAMMADEX, our parenteral agent for the rapid reversal of certain types of neuromuscular blockage during surgery. This still enable the FDA to complete audits of certain U.S. and European study sites that were involved in generating data contained in our submission. We are working closely with the FDA to facilitate these audits and will have more to say about the registration timeline for SUGAMMADEX once the FDA has completed this review. As you know, SUGAMMADEX is already registered in more than 40 markets around the world.","Also during the second quarter, we had the opportunity to present encouraging data on MK-3475, our monoclonal antibody directed against PD-1 for the treatment of malignant melanoma at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago. This immunomodulatory approach for the treatment of malignant disease is also under study in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. We hope to present preliminary results observed in such patients in October at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer meeting in Sydney. Our data thus far have encouraged us to begin a Phase 2\/3 study in non-small-cell lung cancer for which enrollment is just beginning.","We are also continuing to study responses in patients with other malignancies before we believe treatment with MK-3475 may be beneficial by itself or in combination. New studies have recently begun in patients with hormone receptor negative breast cancer, neuroepithelial tumors, head and neck cancer, and in certain patients suffering from colorectal cancer. In the plenary\u2019s presentations at the ASCO meetings in Chicago, it was noted that immunomodulatory agents offered great promise for the treatment of desperately ill patients suffering from malignant disease. Our portfolio includes not only MK-3475 but other immunomodulatory agents which have emerged following a systematic evaluation of cell surface proteins involved in immune regulation. With respect to MK-3475 OU will recall that we have received breakthrough designation from the FDA for this therapy and we\u2019re in very close communication with the agency regarding requirements for an viable data set in the setting of advanced melanoma.","Meanwhile our MK-8931 program, a small molecule inhibitor beta secretase for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease continues to enroll patients and advance of a safety review which we believe we will complete at the very end of this year.","Satisfactory completion of this review will permit expansion of the study for formal efficacy testing, in this pivotal study patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease will be evaluated for the effect of MK-8931 on a cognitive performance and activities of daily living: following 78 weeks of treatment as compared to placebo.","Finally, during my first few months in this role at Merck I found much to be proud of in terms of the quality of our programs and our people. However, I see the clear need for changes that will strengthen the return on investment in R&D. My review is focused on each critical area of performance, programs, processes and people and I have begun to make adjustments along each dimension.","From the programmatic point of view we\u2019re moving to narrow our focus to make certain that products with unambiguous clinically meaningful advances receive our complete attention. With respect to process the governing structure has been flatten considerably removing some layers of decision-making. Much has already been achieved here, but more will be required to improve our efficiency in providing resources to leading project. Finally, with respect to people we\u2019re moving quickly to build our leadership in R&D and specifically brought our licensing, business development function into my senior leadership area. As for all large bio pharmaceutical companies, licensing plays a key role in the development of breakthrough therapies. I expect Merck to participate fully in this area.","Additional details of our revised R&D strategy will be the subject of future reviews. I'm very much looking forward to sharing this information with you. Ken?","","Ken Frazier","Okay so thank you Roger and thank you and I have thank you letter and thank you, Andrea (ph). So before we move into Q&A, I just remind you that we\u2019re going to try to get to as many questions as possible. If you could keep your questions to one or two and if you have additional questions if you can rejoin the queue this way we can get to as many calls as possible. So Andrea you can go ahead and open up the first line for questions.","","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Yes sir, your first question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS","","Marc Goodman - UBS","Couple of things, first can you comment a little bit more about animal health and consumer both very seem to be a little weak even consumer excluding that one time change you made. You talked about add products for immunotherapy can you talk about how quickly you can get those in demand? And then R&D, can you talk about some of the changes that allowed you to take spending down for the quarter. Thanks.","","Ken Frazier","Let\u2019s start with the animal health and consumer question. So, I would say that overall reflecting on this quarter it was an okay quarter for those businesses but if you step back, you'll see that they grew low single-digits and we look back beyond the third quarter we think both are performing well. So I would not let one quarter be the answer for those two businesses, as I\u2019ve said we continue to think of them as being complementary businesses that will help us over the longer term contributing to our top and bottom line growth.","","Adam Schechter","I would add I think in the animal health business they are in the middle of rolling out the Activel (ph) product line which we\u2019re very excited about as well as SUPRIVA rather and I think I reminded you that last year in the second quarter we actually had some very strong performance as we picked up some business where there were other stocks some of our competitors, so we\u2019re probably are in the animal health business slapping a pretty strong prior year. For the other questions maybe I will pass it over to Roger.","","Roger Perlmutter","Yes just Marc just a couple of things with respect to the immunomodulatory agents there is a whole set of different cell surface molecules that involvement as checkpoint regulators if you will that control the response of limfositosis too stimulus and we have had the opportunity to inventory, we use to develop antibodies directed against the whole set of them and to look at them in pre-clinical setting. We hope to be advancing those into the clinic relatively soon you'll see them come up on clinicaltrials.gov and I have more to say on them in subsequent quarters. With respect to expense there is no single category of expense control that we can point to, but there are whole variety of things that I have been able to do in terms of reassigning resources and in that process have pulled back on some of the spending levers, which enabled us to reduce our expense now and will going forward as well.","","Joe Romanelli","Okay, great. So, next call?","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","","Chris Schott - JPMorgan","Thanks very much. Just had two questions. The first is on JANUVIA, obviously you saw a rebound in reported 2Q growth, but it looks like prescription volume growth left in the U.S. is still fairly low. I guess my question is do you believe you are seeing a benefit from the additional resources you put on the franchise earlier this year? And maybe more broadly you talk about the overall DPP-IV market at this point? I guess, as we start to annualize the TVD benefit, do you believe you can reaccelerate growth for this category? My second question which was going back to some of the comments that Roger had made about the licensing of assets. I guess, I am thinking kind of little bit more, should we think of this as a greater focus on M&A from Merck that we have seen in the past and is that focused more on early stage assets or those that have achieved proof-of-concept? Thanks very much.","","Ken Frazier","Okay, let me start with the second one first. I just would say, Chris that for us, when we think about capital allocation strategy, one of the most important ventures Roger said is to augment the pipeline. And that means looking for the best technology that we can find, the best opportunities we can find that are value-creating opportunities and that will remain a major priority, and I know for Roger, it\u2019s even a greater priority. So, why don\u2019t I turn it over to Roger?","","Roger Perlmutter","Chris, just let me emphasize as I think I did at the first quarter earnings call, that I am really interested and really focused on products. And so it is to me less important that we consider at this stage and more important that we consider what is the potential value of this new therapeutic entry? Does it have unambiguous meaningful clinical impact that can change the practice of medicine and bring important benefit to patients suffering from grievous illness, that\u2019s the critical point? And I am prepared to go after those wherever those exist, and I know Ken and Adam and Peter are completely onboard with that.","","Ken Frazier","And with respect to your JANUVIA question, I will turn it over to Adam, but again we are pleased that we saw the product perform better this quarter versus the first quarter, we think it\u2019s rebounding and we are continuing to provide tremendous support behind it. So, with that, I will turn it over to Adam.","","Adam Schechter","Yes, hi Chris. Let me give you some additional context in the U.S. and also give you a little bit of more color outside the U.S. Now, we are thinking about outside the U.S. So, as I discussed in the U.S., we had 9% growth and I tried to give you some context of that by breaking it down, where we had 1% that was volume, 4% was inventory, and the rest was price. The real key is changing this TRx trend, and that\u2019s what we are frankly focused on. The real issue Chris is that we have a 75% market share in the U.S. despite a very significant number of competitors. So, it\u2019s not about time to gain more market share, it\u2019s really about getting sulfonylurea use over into DPP-IVs of which we have the lion\u2019s share.","Typically, with multiple new entrants in the market, you see a lot of class growth. We don\u2019t see a lot of class growth despite all the new competitors that have come into the marketplace. So, the way for us to change the trend is really to focus on the switch from sulfonylureas. And sulfonylureas still represent about 35% of the patient days of therapy. So, there is still a big opportunity there for us to go after. So, what we have done is we have increased our focus. We now have dedicated sales force and thereafter they are promoting they are engaged. In addition to that, we have increased our promotion spending and our print direct-to-consumer advertising. All of our focus now is on the sulfonylurea utilization up until the first quarter this year most of our focus is on the TVD opportunity, that\u2019s no longer there. So, it really is about sulfonylureas.","The good news is that we have maintained our strong managed care access in the U.S. So, we have access to our products in over 80% of the patients we have preferred access. And now it really is about executing on the sulfonylureas strategy in the United States. Outside the United States, we still have a very significant opportunity in every region outside the U.S. had strong volume growth. The one thing I think is important that although we had 11% growth X effects. The big difference between X effects and FX was the yen. We have a very significant amount of our sales in Japan for JANUVIA. In Japan, you may recall the DPP-IV class is the number one class of oral diabetics in Japan. In Japan, it\u2019s ahead of metformin, it\u2019s ahead of sulfonylureas, and we have by far the leading market share. At the same time on every other quarter we get supply sales from our co-marketing partner which happened this quarter, so when you look at our success in Japan, plus the supply sales coming in lumpy you can see how the yen would have a very significant impact on our sales when you don't adjust for exchange that\u2019s the difference primarily for the underlying business performance being very strong but what you see including foreign exchange.","Outside the US, we continue to anticipate low double-digit growth, and we see that we're getting that volume and I think the opportunity remains very strong there for us.","","Joe Romanelli","Okay thanks Chris. And Andrea can we have the next question?","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein.","Tim Anderson - Sanford Bernstein","On the new guidance changes this is the second time this year that you\u2019re kind of changing guidance albeit here you\u2019re not changing earnings guidance and the revenue guidance that speaker is not just foreign exchange, which is something that\u2019s out of your control, Ken you first took over at Merck you withdrew long term guidance that was standing at the time, so my question is that kind of a higher level here what's happening within the company such that numbers are assuming to move around as much as they are and then going back to outlook for mergers and acquisitions historically Merck did not do big mergers until it did Schering-Plough back in 2009 what\u2019s the outlook for M&A from here in terms of deal sizes, are you going to revert back really only looking at bolt-ons or are you considering mid-sized targets as well or what exactly?","","Ken Frazier","Let me just start by saying we of course maintained our EPS guidance and so I want to make that very clear. In terms of what\u2019s happening with the sales you heard, Adam talk about the foreign exchange but there also have been during the course of this year we took on some I think at the beginning some pretty ambitious revenue targets given the fact that we were facing major patent expires that\u2019s how we try to deal with the situation last year that was undertaking this year. We have seen some things that have impacted product trends this year and including Januvia \u00a0happened and what have you heard out without warning, saying it would also have been arguing the court this year we took on them. I think in the beginning. This is readily talking. Given the fact that we were facing major, naturally, but I would try to deal with the situation last year. That was not undertaken this year we have been found things that have impacted product this year, including Januvia we have seen the, we\u2019re housing an is unique. We are helping HCV (ph) just to pick up couple of major growth drivers that we have seen an impact on this year. So I just want to just underscore that we take our guidance very seriously during the course of the year as you know we have seen negative impact on four year sales of about 3% for foreign exchange but we have also seen some other impacts that it us like this quarter there was a onetime charge for MCC and I would also point out that if you look at our overall you can see that we\u2019re managing cost in order for us to continue to deliver our bottom-line EPS guidance which again I take very seriously.","","Peter Kellogg","On the M&A front, so Tim I guess you kind of went through this chronology of Merck for long time I hadn\u2019t done any really big M&A deals I guess and then (inaudible). I think as we go forward really in many ways we\u2019re thinking a lot about the product portfolio in the business we have I think we reiterate a lot of what Roger commented on relative to making sure we have great two products and really exciting products and if that ends up leading as to business development deals or joint ventures or M&A I think we\u2019re comfortable with any of those. I think as Ken commented earlier we really do talk about our capital structure as having the number one goal of supporting strategic needs of the business and so we\u2019re certainly, all we maintain a position to be able to do that that said we also don\u2019t want to build up inefficient balances on the balance sheet so that\u2019s why we had a more proactive capital structure program recently. But no ways that could say we wouldn\u2019t be doing the right things to build the pipeline and we\u2019re always on the prowl looking for the right things the great assets that are out there.","","Ken Frazier","I will just underscore what Peter just said I think from our standpoint looking for M&A deals that would be sensible value creating bolt-on deals is something that we will be very interested in doing but we have tried to become and remain a very discipline company when it comes paying for assets so that we can actually create shareholder value with them over the longer term. So deals is the number one priority that we can create value, we have enhanced our share repurchase, we obviously remain committed to our dividend but in the long term it's product that drive this business and that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to continue to look for sensible opportunities to augment our pipeline whether it's licensing or bolt-on M&A deals.","Joe Romanelli","","Great, thanks and thanks for the questions. Andrea, next caller?","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs","So, Roger, a question for you, we \u2013 Merck issued a press release about a month ago providing a sort of outline on R&D restructuring which involved removing layers of management. And today you are talking about lowering R&D spending for 2013 versus 2012 and narrowing your focus? Just curious to know if you see this R&D restructuring process as more iterative in nature or should we expect more substantial change ahead involving pairing back on your specific therapeutic focuses meaningful change in the way you allocate capital and R&D? Just wondering if there is more big news to come with respect to what you are doing to improve ROIC in R&D? And then secondly again on PD-1, just wondering if you can update us on your views on combo studies, where you are with that, if you are seeking to combine your drug with a CTLA-4 and when we can expect to see news on that front? Thanks.","","Ken Frazier","Thanks, Jami. So, first of all, with respect to R&D structure and lowering expense, as I indicated the goal is to focus our very substantial resources on the programs that matter the most and give them our complete attention. There will be a series of changes that take place in order to improve the efficiency of the process. And as that goes forward of course, we will communicate that to you, but our expectation is not that they are going to be big, enormous changes that will be announced in the way that you described. With regard to PD-1, we are interested first of all of course in delivering on the monotherapy promise in melanoma and in lung cancer. And as you know when we presented these data at ASCO, there are very impressive response rates that we have seen in patients with melanoma who have refractory disease, who have failed all prior therapies. And naturally, we want to bring the benefits of that therapeutic intervention to those patients. At the same time, we also recognized, because there will be opportunities to combine immunoregulatory modulators, or anti-PD-1 therapy 3475 with other agents both our own internally as well as others of the mother companies, they won\u2019t surprise you to know that a lot of companies are interested in working with us on that. We have had discussions with many of them and we will be talking about those combinations as we would announce more results for the PD-1 program. Okay, thanks Jami. Andrea?","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.","","Tony Butler - Barclays Capital","Thanks very much, Ken and Peter while you have reiterated guidance for the full year, and I may have missed this, what\u2019s the change from Q1 on the GAAP for your guidance, which I think is down now about a dime? And then Roger on 8931, the safety readout, will that be at a clinical meetings CTAB, for example, in November or would you expect that at a press release whether it would be any data coming out on the base inhibitor in the second half? Thanks very much.","","Ken Frazier","I will turn the first question over to Peter, but just from the operating standpoint, we are reiterating our EPS guidance.","","Peter Kellogg","Yeah, hi. So, in the GAAP P&L, there are some items that we actually exclude from the non-GAAP and sometimes, because they can be lumpy and it goes back to many cases the restructuring or the merger accounting. Now, in this case, we actually do have some adjustments to our R&D intangibles that we actually booked in the second quarter and that simply looking at either products as well as commercial intangibles, which is also a highlight. And so that\u2019s all part of the merger accounting. When you go through major merger, you look at the balance sheet and the items that are coming through and you actually allocate value both to the pipeline in the form of in-process R&D intangibles as well as the commercial products, which are intangible commercial assets. And then on a quarterly basis, we work very closely and monitoring that very accurately in terms of R&D expectations, those products all delivering exactly what we saw.","And from time-to-time, something happens to the pipeline perhaps and that causes us to write-down an in-process R&D intangible or conversely perhaps the commercial trends aren\u2019t quite as robust as we had originally bought. And so that would cause us to trigger a write-down or a reduction of the asset value in the intangible of our commercial asset. So, primarily, when you look at the change in the EPS at the GAAP level which what you\u2019re seeing are some of those evaluations that we go through on a quarterly basis where we actually change the value of intangibles and that\u2019s primarily the difference that you see in the gap EPS that\u2019s incremental of what you see in the non-GAAP and I certainly apologize for getting into that much accounting but that\u2019s really what you\u2019re seeing.","","Adam Schechter","And Tony with respect to 8931 the structure of the program is that we have an initial phase in which we analyze, we enroll and analyze a set of patients over a three month period each patient exposed for three months in order to look at dose ranging and to look at safety intolerability and based on those results we then proceed into our large Phase-III study. We believe that we will complete that safety run-in period including the three months drug exposure by the end of this year. Our hope and belief of course is let\u2019s say intolerability will be expected and we will move on into the large efficacy portion of the trial. If there were any problem of course we would let you know and proceed into that we will let you know about that as well and ultimately those data will be presented in the scientific meeting. So you can expect to hear about it at the beginning of 2014.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.","","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group","First of all congratulations to Adam and his team on the U.S. especially on the U.S. (inaudible) you probably know there is a lot of consternation around that number on the street, you guys delivered. So my questions are mainly around that, so number one you said there was a $30 million inventory that in the quarter, can you just remind us I believe there is a $70 million drawn down last quarter so it has been a fair bit of movement here. Has that stabilized? Should we expect further movements going forward? Yes or no and then I heard a couple of numbers thrown around I got a little bit confused just a clarification, what exactly was the price benefit in the U.S. year-over-year and in the ex-U.S. can you update us on what\u2019s going on with AMNOG and Iqwig in Germany there has been some I know movement over there and I guess you guys came out little bit ahead of your competitors but can you walk us through the potential scenarios there? I know no one knows looking at them what are some of the potential outcomes? Thanks so much.","","Ken Frazier","Absolutely Mark it's I would try to give you as much as specific as we can because it's such a big growth driver for us and if you look at the interview (ph) what I said was that off the 9% U.S. growth about 1% was from volume, 4% was from inventory, the rest of it was from price so that makes about 4% price. You\u2019ve to be careful extrapolating that over every quarter because mix can have a significant impact on how much price comes to it at any point in time also the timing of your price increase makes that a little difficult for you to try to predict and look for it to be the same quarter-over-quarter. With regard to the inventory, we did see about $30 million of inventory movement this month which I mentioned. On the base of business that we have it's very, very small $30 million so it's very difficult to predict the channel movements from one quarter to another, we are not seeing large channel movements in terms of how big the product is in the United States. It's relatively small but small channel movements can have $30 million to $50 million impact. So that\u2019s why for the guidance that I gave for the rest of the year I said mid-single digits for the U.S. but I excluded the movement of channel in there because you can\u2019t predict $30 million to $50 million of channel movement, it's within a half a day sales or something like that, so that\u2019s how I think about the inventory moving forward. With regard to Iqwig so on July 1st they announced the outcome of their assessment of Januvia and some other PP Force. We were pleased that they have recommended that there is add benefit for Januvia when added to metformin. We\u2019re very pleased with that.","That\u2019s the beginning of the process, the next step is a decision on the added medical value by the GBA and that\u2019s expected in the fourth quarter of this year. Once that happens you actually go into the reimbursement discussions so we\u2019re happy with where we are today, we\u2019re very pleased with the initial assessment but there is still a lot more work for us to do and it will be another six months before we probably know the final outcome of that. Just to put that in perspective for you Mark, if you look at Germany it represents less than 5% of our Januvia family sales to just give you a sense of the magnitude of that so we\u2019re excited with what\u2019s happened thus far which is still a long way to go.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley","Yes, thanks so much. I have two questions. And they both relate to some cross currents and so Ken, I am hoping that you can clarify for me and I guess for investors on the call. With respect to the animal health and consumer businesses, I think you described them as complementary today, but there has been a lot of hoping and dreaming about Merck divesting these businesses or exiting these businesses on Wall Street? So, can you just sort of set the stage right in terms of how investors should think about them as being core to Merck that you will be building them or you will consider exiting them?","And then second, with respect to R&D cross currents, I think Ken you described how important it was to invest in R&D, but many on the Street have been hoping for significant R&D cuts. So, if you could maybe settle that debate and frame whether you expect R&D to remain flattish over time or whether there are meaningful cuts ahead? Thank you.","","Ken Frazier","Okay. So, let me start with the animal health and consumer conversation that we had today. So, first of all, I have been saying for years that I think that, that is complementary to our business, but I also have been saying that we periodically assess our overall business strategy based on business opportunity. We believe that business diversity can be complementary and contribute to our top and bottom line growth, but if we were to view these assets as being more productive outside the company, we would consider other alternatives. So, I am saying that we constantly reassess and reevaluate our entire portfolio. That\u2019s an ongoing thing for us. When I said that I consider them complementary again, that\u2019s not a new comment, I have made that ever since I have been CEO, but I am also saying that we have to look at the overall performance of the portfolio and decide basically how we can maximize long-term cash flow for shareholders.","With respect to R&D, the first point I would make is that we continue to think innovation is going to be the long-term driver of the company\u2019s success. We are going to continue to invest in programs like PD-1 to ensure that we bring those products to market as quickly as possible and reach their full potential. We are always looking to improve productivity across the company. So, I will let Roger comment on what he sees going forward, but I would say that in every aspect of our business, we are looking for an opportunity as you heard Roger saying he is evaluating programs, processes, and people. I think it\u2019s appropriate though to give him some time to assess that entire equation and decide how he is going to drive better ROI going forward. We also by the way did say that we are lowering our R&D guidance of 2013 versus 2012. So, all those things coming together, I think directionally say something about R&D spending inside the company, but I do again think Roger has the right opportunity to look at the overall picture and decide how he wants to improve ROI going forward. I will just close by saying at the end of the day all of these companies at the end of the day have to innovate and they have to bring forward clinically meaningfully differentiated products the way that Roger has said and that remains to me the major focus of Merck and Merck\u2019s strategy.","","Joe Romanelli","Great, okay. Thanks David. Thanks for the questions. Andrea next caller please?","","Operator","Yes sir. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Baum with Citi.","","Andrew Baum - Citi","Yes, good afternoon. Couple of questions. First on the DPP-IV class within Europe, the Transparency Commission in France just yesterday announced they are going to be focusing on the class and equate well Merck may benefit from the ongoing discussions there, so some of your competitors are going to have the pricing drag down, as far as that (indiscernible) the drug? And healthcare systems (indiscernible) are struggling in DPP-IV makes itself target and obviously you referenced Japan, and am I being too negative there, and I think about the pressures on the franchise outside the U.S.?","And then second question is for Roger, perhaps you could outline what the split in current investment is between research and development within Merck and then following along from that, what scope do you see for downsizing Merck\u2019s current research as opposed to development and research infrastructure. Thank you.","","Ken Frazier","So why don\u2019t I talk a little bit about DDP-4 class, and I will focus outside the U.S. because that\u2019s where you focus and I spoke a lot about the U.S. already. I just want to reiterate that we had good volume growth in all regions and we had good growth if you just look at the five core European markets we\u2019ve very strong growth, not only in volume, but also in dollars. I believe the environment in Europe is tough and I think it will continue to be tough but I also believe that the value that physicians and patient see in a product like Januvia is very strong and also when you talk to the government. I do believe that they see the value that a product like to Januvia can bring into the marketplace. And the marketplace tends to show you the value of the product based upon the utilization and when you look at the utilization of Januvia. I think it's because position, not only the great efficacy that you can see on HbA1C but they also feel comfortable with the safety profile that they have been accustomed to.","And if you look at the cost of the implications of diabetes they are very significant, in Europe typically the DDP-4s are utilized after metformin so it's not threatening the largest generic in Europe, it's actually being utilized after the generics are used in Europe. So I think that it shows that there is a way to try to use a low-cost metformin but since many patients can't get the goal on a low cost metformin sulfonylurea has safety or side effect issues that the physicians are looking for a way to control diabetes such as with Januvia and then the government sees the implications of notching diabetes in terms of the macrovascular disease and microvascular disease in terms of hospital admissions and so forth. So I still think that there is a strong potential for Januvia in Europe. In addition to that we still have markets that we\u2019re waiting for reimbursement outside of Europe such as in China, where we think there is also opportunities for the future.","","Roger Perlmutter","With respect to the split in current investment that we could spend quite a long time talking about the way in which funds are allocated at Merck but let me just point out that has been described in detail by academic analyses of expenditures and pharmaceutical companies, investments and discover research as a fraction of the total investment in R&D have been declining monotonically since 1980 and discovery research is actually a very small component of all large pharmaceutical companies. It represents the simply the fully allocated costs of the people doing the work and the expense associated with clinical trials has been rising progressively, Merck is no different from all other big companies we spent far more on development that we do on research. Having said that you should keep in mind that there is a lot of stuff that is classified as a research that really relates to development, questions are raised by regulatory agencies with respect to products that have long been on the market that require preclinical studies. Its research effort but it actually is contributing to the development role. So there is a lot of complexity in there and with respect to opportunities that exists for reducing expenditure in research I think the real question to be asked is what you do to improve the productivity of the R&D organization to actually create breakthrough products that make a real difference to patients.","Ultimately you innovate or you die and that's what needs to be done, and you need to do it as effectively, efficiently and productively as possible and that\u2019s what we intend to do.","","Joe Romanelli ","Great. Thank you Andrew. Next question please?","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Arfaei with CMO Capital.","","Alex Arfaei - CMO Capital","A couple for Roger if I may, are you doing an core formation work to combine the SGLT2 you got from Pfizer with Januvia as affixed those combination similar to what your competitors are doing and also, could you please provide us an update on your once weekly DDP-4 and is there any possibilities for a core formulation there? Thank you.","","Roger Perlmutter","With respect to the SGLT2 program of course we\u2019re just moving forward with that program. We expect to advance that program into Phase III this year but we also are interested as I said last quarter that you know that one of the things that\u2019s extremely attractive about this program is it's very well behaved pharmaceutical and hence we expect it to play nicely with others. We have always had an interest in the idea that this could be used in combination with our existing programs and so we\u2019re looking at those things very closely that will be something of course, that we would include in our registration programs and we\u2019re making \u2013 we continue to make progress on our once-weekly program. Our Phase 3 program is ongoing, and we are enthusiastic about it and we think it\u2019s a very, very good opportunity.","","Joe Romanelli","Okay, thank you Alex. Next question please?","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Holford with Jefferies.","","Jeff Holford - Jefferies","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Just got two for you. On a margin basis, where do you think the greatest scope for cost saving going forwards on this company over two, three year view would be, would it be in COGS, SG&A and R&D maybe you can rank those for us? And then just secondly coming back to I think consumer health specifically, probably under 4% of group EBITDA in terms it would actually produce it, how do you think of that really as being as an asset to give diversification to the company. It was such a small contribution and how would you assess the margins of that company versus some of its peers of larger scale? Thank you.","","Ken Frazier","Okay. Let me take the consumer question. We have looked at the profitability of our consumer business and we believe its back up well against its competitors. I agree that the asset is smaller compared to our pharmaceutical business. I said before that it\u2019s not global scale, but it\u2019s a very good business that produces really strong cash flow. And we also continue to see that the OTC opportunities, which I control is the most recent example for us do give us the complementary tag to our pharmaceutical business.","","Peter Kellogg","So, Jeff, it\u2019s Peter Kellogg. Let me answer your first question regarding margins and opportunities in our P&L. So, we are a large complicated business, so I can appreciate the targets that we are through, but let me go back to kind of the couple of pieces. First of all, we announced the merger almost four years ago. We did highlight that we had a fairly extensive manufacturing network. Quite frankly, we combined three companies, Merck, Schering-Plough, and Organon, and really had an extensive manufacturing network of over 90 plants. And I think you recall that\u2019s what we highlighted on day one was that required rationalization over time. We have made great progress on that. At this point, the number of plants we have in the network is numbered kind of in the low 70s. And I think that it\u2019s very clear that we are keen to do that as we indicated at the time of the merger. That\u2019s not something we can get done in three or four years. It\u2019s really an ongoing process, so continuing to drive more and more efficiencies. I think there is more to come there.","Obviously, how it shows up on the P&L through the cost of goods eventually, there is always if you measure things in terms of PGM percent, then you get the blend between your efficiencies and productivity coming to the cost of goods sold versus the pricing that you can realize and that really comes down to again the innovation and the exciting new products that we bring forward. So, but I do think that clearly on the cost of goods sold that\u2019s an ongoing opportunity we talked about. In the \u2013 just going down the P&L in the R&D side, I think what I know Roger and I talked a lot about it, it\u2019s really a question of the ROI that we think about there.","We have the right opportunities such as the PD-1. We are going to spend the money on that. And we are intending to have an exciting pipeline. So, it\u2019s not a goal of ours to have unexciting \u2013 not have exciting opportunities and not spend money. Conversely, we do really want to pay close attention to how we are spending and making sure it\u2019s focused on as Roger said the really big things that can make a big difference in the marketplace and then obviously drive the top line. So, R&D, I think is very much of a focus for us from a productivity standpoint with very much from an ROI perspective that we have the great opportunities we are going to go after them. And we will make sure that we are doing efficiently.","And then obviously the last thing is on SG&A, we continue to evaluate that globally at which our footprint look like and how do we operate in the most efficient manner. We made tremendous progress since the merger is I think we highlighted at the end of last year. We actually hit and exceeded all our merger synergy goals that we had which were pretty expensive. I think we highlighted that we achieved a net benefit of $3.5 billion, which actually means that our gross savings were over $6 billion. So, that\u2019s a very, very substantial merger synergy program that we have executed. But I think what\u2019s very important is as Ken said in his talk today, cost management is very important for us to resource that creates on the one hand a more efficient P&L, but quite frankly, it also allows us to spend on the growth drivers, which is so important to our future. So, I don\u2019t want you to conclude that we are simply thinking about our cost structure as how do we take cost out, but it\u2019s also how do we reinvest to drive shareholder value and really create a lot of value in this company, most of the pipeline as well as the commercial assets around the world. So, I think SG&A continues to be a focus for us. But on the other hand, I think we are also going to balance all those savings with where we have opportunities to invest.","So, I am not going very specific answer I realize that but I do want to make a point that while we have opportunities and we are going to continue to pursue them, we certainly executed well in the merger synergies that we have laid out and we\u2019re going to continue on that to through the manufacturing network elsewhere in the organization we\u2019re thinking about we turn on investment and creating value, but we never will be passive about you, as Ken likes to say we\u2019re going to be ambitious in driving performance in the short term but we are never going to back away from investing for long term potential long-term value creation.","","Joe Romanelli","Okay, great. Thanks and Andrea I think we have time for two more callers, so we can start with the next questions.","","Operator","Yes sir. Your next question comes from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen.","","Steve Scala - Cowen and Company","First will the tax rate be so much higher in the second half of the year versus the first half and what does it tell us about the tax rate in 2014, secondly you mentioned 2013 R&D spend will be lower but you haven't quantified it. I guess we should assume it will only be modestly lower, would you like to recalibrate that expectation? And then thirdly why was it up sequentially down in the second quarter it had been sequentially up in the second quarter 2012. Thank you.","","Peter Kellogg","Let me take the first question on tax, so I think you had a couple of question there so let me just take them one at a time if I can. You asked why would the tax rate be higher in the second half of the year than the first half of the year. SO as we went into the first half of the year and I\u2019m just going to take it quarter by quarter and the first quarter we saw some significant tax benefits that came through. I think we highlighted that time and they are very kind of one time in nature, there were R&D tax credit being reimplemented and so forth. We also had a couple of resolution of some tax audit situations allowed us to release some reserves. And so that caused our R&D our tax line to be lower in the first quarter.","In the second quarter we also had a reduction in some tax reserves because we had the exploration of some statute of limitations and so that allowed us to free up some tax reserves and basically some of these benefits were things that we thought about over the course of a full year. We didn't really actually when we first put the plan together just by getting all these things in the first and second quarter quarters. So as you think about how the year comes together, when you think about the full-year tax guidance of 22% to 23% the way you get to that on a full year basis is it ends up weighted average of all the quarter. So the first two quarters were lower that by definition it means the third quarter and fourth quarters will be higher and they will only be higher because we just won't have those one-time benefit pulling the rate down. We can kind of return to a more natural run-rate that we would expect.","And I think that you will recall that we have talked about in the past is the ongoing tax rates the company will be a little higher than what you\u2019re seeing right now and so generally we\u2019ve talked about the long-term tax rate, recognizing that uncertain things can move around, but excluding any unusual items or any items that pull it down or move it up that are kind of unique in nature we expect it to be running that in the higher rate in the range of something like 25% to 26% on an ongoing basis.","But I think we want to be careful that all these years we go into the year we will update you in terms of what we see on the horizon relative to how it's axes are evolving. I think on the second question you were asking about R&D and why would it be lower in the second half and in the first half in fact, you know, how should we think about what we\u2019re looking at.","So obviously in my comments I highlighted that entire year we actually did have a payment for ENDOSITE (ph) in the second quarter of last year so we\u2019re laughing in that sense. But we also basically see as we move forward kind of there is a flow of activity, Roger\u2019s making decisions and so forth and I think that basically we\u2019re using kind of the most recent updated view of R&D as we think about it. So and quite frankly it's ties to productivity, to focus and we\u2019re not talking about the sea change we\u2019re just simply, we previously we thought it will be a little bit higher and now we\u2019re kind of (inaudible) our expectation is based on what we see will be a little bit lower.","The third question was\u2026.","","Adam Schechter","I will take the third one, see this is Adam and with regard to (inaudible) there is definitely a seasonal nature to the business and we have predicting that all along. In 2012 it was up first year with full U.S. supply. When we have full supply the offices were buying the vaccine and they were stocking and getting ready for vaccinations and in addition to that we had just started our direct to consumer proportion in the second quarter of 2012 because we wanted to ensure that we would have adequate supply before we would actually drive demand through the DTC promotions. So I want to use 2012 as a direct year-over-year comparison to 2013.","We expect that the second half of this year will be stronger and the strongest quarter will be dependent upon when flu vaccinations occur, because that\u2019s when we believe we will see many people getting vaccinated for (indiscernible) as well.","","Joe Romanelli ","Great. Thank you for the questions Steve. And I think Andrea, is it time for one last question?","","Operator","Yes sir. Your last question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","","Gregg Gilbert - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Thank you. For Roger, I would love to get your personal view on the opportunity and the risks associated with odanacatib at this point? Secondly, could you be in a position to file LAMBRO in melanoma early next year given the unmet need in that population and your breakthrough status? And maybe lastly, Adam, can you talk about what prompted the GARDASIL decision in Japan and whether that has implications anywhere else? Thanks.","","Roger Perlmutter","Well, but at the same time asks that we continue the study in order to obtain additional efficacy and safety data. We are continuing to study in that way. We do anticipate that we will have the opportunity to look at those data and adapt to distant future, and based on what we see there, we hope to be able to move forward with the odanacatib filing, but we have to see the data of course. With respect to PD-1, again, the information that we have is that as you can see from looking at ClinicalTrials.gov, we have ongoing pivotal studies in melanoma refractory to therapy. We have a Phase 3 study in melanoma versus ipilimumab. Those studies will deliver results either in the latter case at the end of next year or in 2015. If in fact it were the case that there were overwhelming efficacy earlier on there might be opportunities for a more accelerated filing strategy, but that\u2019s something that we really will have to wait to see data on. And of course, we are working very, very closely with the FDA on that. And with regard to Japan, the government suspended the proactive. So, it\u2019s important to say that proactive recommendation of HPV vaccines, the vaccines still remain on the market in Japan. And the MLHW is just looking into some post marketing use that they have seen specific to Japan. We have not seen any significant impact at this time in other markets around that world and MRL continues to monitor the AEs as appropriate and we are confident in that safety profile of GARDASIL.","","Gregg Gilbert - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Yes, absolutely.","","Ken Frazier","Okay, so thanks Gregg. Let me just close by saying I think this was a good quarter, a solid quarter. Going forward, our strong focus will remain on growth for the company as well as driving greater profitability. It was good to see a bounce back in certain sales, particularly JANUVIA. We had good back scenes in immunology sales. It\u2019s great to see that the emerging markets are still moving ahead in a very strong way. As we go further, we will continue to invest thoughtfully in these commercial opportunities as well as our pipeline opportunities. We are very excited about, for example, PD-1s. And as we think about this business going forward, we continue to think that innovation has got to be the key, but we\u2019ve got to be very careful to deliver the right kind of reductions at our cost base that will allow us to do that in a sustainable way. So, thank you very much for your attention, and I look forward to talking to you in future quarters and in future venues. Thank you. Bye-bye.","","Operator","Thank you.

At this time I want to welcome everyone to Merck's Q2 2017 Sales and Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Teri Loxam. Please go ahead.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thank you, Darla, and good morning. Welcome to Merck's Second Quarter 2017 Conference Call. Today I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; Adam Schechter, President of Global Human Health; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Laboratories.","Before I turn the call over to Ken, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation of these in our press release. We've also provided a table in our press release to help you understand the sales in the quarter for the business units and products.","I would like to remind you that some of the statements that we make during today's call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor Provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.","Our SEC filings, including Item 1-A in the 2016 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement. You can see our SEC filings as well as today's earnings release on merck.com.","With that I'd like to turn the call over to Ken.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thank you, Teri, and good morning, everyone. Merck delivered sound operational results in the second quarter with growth on the top and bottom line. We are confident in the underlying strength of our business, driven by our focused execution of key product launches, coupled with the continued contributions from our core businesses, which we believe position us well for the remainder of 2017 and the long term.","Changing gears for a moment. Let me speak briefly about the cyberattack on June 27, which as you know affected Merck, along with many other global companies. The attack impacted our worldwide operations, including manufacturing, research, and sales. However, the cyberattack did not have any appreciable impact on our second quarter results. Overall, full recovery from the cyberattack will take some time. But we are making steady progress.","Now getting back to the core of our business. We're excited by the just announced oncology collaboration with AstraZeneca for a number of reasons. It expands our oncology leadership into the exciting targeted therapies of PARP and MEK inhibition as monotherapy and combination treatment, including with KEYTRUDA, which itself is a foundational treatment in both settings. It also gives us an opportunity to collaborate with our industry colleagues at AstraZeneca on a de-risk basis on the development and commercialization of a first-in-class innovative cancer medicine, LYNPARZA, for multiple tumor types.","The deal structure is strong, with a considerable portion of the payment contingent upon the achievement of significant regulatory and sales milestones. And it enables us to maintain a healthy balance sheet with the flexibility to enter into additional business development deals. This oncology collaboration is an exemplar of the type of business development we find most attractive and will continue to look for going forward.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Rob Davis.","Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Continuing on our momentum from the first quarter, we delivered another quarter of strong results in both our Human Health and our Animal Health businesses. Our continued product launch execution coupled with effective expense management in the quarter drove sales and EPS growth, despite the continuing significant impact from generic competition.","Total company revenues were $9.9 billion, an increase of 1% year over year. Excluding the impact of exchange, second quarter revenues grew 2%. Our Human Health business grew 2% excluding exchange, while our Animal Health business grew 7% excluding exchange.","Animal Health growth was driven by continued strength in our Companion Animal business, primarily BRAVECTO and the contribution from the Vall\u00e9e acquisition.","Looking at the other parts of the P&L, non-GAAP gross margin was 77.6% in the quarter, an increase of 190 basis points versus the second quarter of 2016. Favorable product mix driven by KEYTRUDA and ZEPATIER was the largest factor contributing to the year-over-year improvement.","Non-GAAP operating expenses of $4.2 billion were 2% lower year over year, driven by a decrease in R&D, partially offset by an increase in marketing and administrative expenses. Decreased licensing costs drove the year-over-year decrease in R&D spend.","Recall that our second quarter 2016 results included an upfront payment of $200 million for the Moderna licensing transaction. Adjusting for that transaction in 2016, R&D would have grown modestly. Taken together, we earned $1.01 per share on a non-GAAP basis, up 12% excluding exchange.","Now turning to the 2017 guidance. While we've had a very strong first half of the year, as Ken noted, we are still recovering from the cyberattack. As a result we have been conservative in our guidance ranges, which we believe encompass anticipated downside scenarios.","Given the operational strength and a more favorable exchange environment, we are narrowing and raising our revenue range for the full year. We now expect revenues to be between $39.4 billion and $40.4 billion, which includes an approximately 1% negative impact from foreign exchange using mid-July rates.","While we originally anticipated a moderate year-over-year increase in our gross margin percentage, we now anticipate some additional favorability to this rate, driven by a favorable product mix and lower than expected discards.","We now expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to grow at a mid-single digit rate compared to full year 2016, driven by continued investment in R&D, increased resources behind our ongoing launches, remediation expenses related to the cyberattack, as well as additional R&D costs associated with our new oncology collaboration with AstraZeneca.","We continue to expect the full year non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 22%. And we continue to project average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 2.75 billion for the year.","Taken together, we continue to expect non-GAAP EPS to be $3.76 to $3.88. While we are leaving our EPS guidance unchanged, the strength of the business has allowed us to absorb the potential impact from the cyberattack as well as modest dilution from the AZ collaboration. Also our range includes an approximately 1% negative impact from foreign exchange using mid-July rates.","In summary, our second quarter results demonstrate continued strong operational performance, driven by our ability to deliver value through prioritization of resources and execution on the launches that will contribute to long term growth. While we work to fully remediate the temporary impact from the cyberattack, we remain confident that the underlying fundamentals of our business continue to be strong.","With that I'll turn the call over to Adam.","Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. This morning I'll provide highlights on the performance of Global Human Health for the second quarter. And my comments will be on a constant currency basis. Global Human Health delivered another solid quarter. Worldwide sales of $8.8 billion grew 2% with contributions from launched products including KEYTRUDA, ZEPATIER, and BRIDION as well as our vaccine portfolio more than offsetting the continued impact from LOEs.","We also had another strong quarter outside of the U.S. with growth of 8%. I'll highlight a few of our key franchises and product launches, starting with KEYTRUDA.","We continue to build our leadership position in immuno-oncology, as we execute on the great opportunity we have with the launch of KEYTRUDA. In the second quarter we added to our momentum with four new indications in the U.S. and an additional indication in Europe. Sales grew to just over $880 million, a very significant increase over prior year. In the United States, KEYTRUDA sales continued to build across multiple indications with lung cancer now contributing to roughly half of the sales.","Sales in the fourth quarter \u2013 or sales in the second quarter also reflect favorability of approximately $40 million due to the timing of customer purchases.","In first-line lung cancer, KEYTRUDA is the only approved anti-PD-1 therapy. And we've seen a strong adoption of KEYTRUDA as monotherapy in high PD-L1 expressive populations. And KEYTRUDA has quickly become standard of care in that setting.","While still early days for the KEYTRUDA\/ALIMTA combination, feedback from oncologists has been positive following the FDA approval in mid-May. In fact, the combination was added to NCCN guidelines a couple of weeks ago as a recommended therapy in first-line non-squamous lung cancer regardless of PD-L1 status.","We've also start to see a greater contribution from lung cancer outside of the U.S. KEYTRUDA is now approved in the first- and second-line lung cancer settings in more than 60 countries. We continue to achieve reimbursement in more markets. And we're seeing a steady increase in patients being tested for PD-L1 status.","In addition to momentum in Europe, we've also seen strong uptake in both first- and second-line lung in Japan. That follows our launch in the first quarter.","Outside of lung cancer, KEYTRUDA continues to be the leading anti-PD-1 therapy in metastatic melanoma in the United States and in many markets around the world. We've also seen strong launches across bladder cancer, head and neck cancer and classical Hodgkin lymphoma as well as early interest in MSA-high (sic) [MSI-high], the first tumor agnostic indication.","We are excited about the continued growth of KEYTRUDA across indications. We believe our breadth of approved and future indications across tumor types will continue to establish KEYTRUDA as a foundation for the treatment of cancer.","In addition, we are very much looking forward to collaborating with AstraZeneca in oncology as announced yesterday. We believe LYNPARZA can be a very important product in different indications over time. And the combination of our proven commercial success in oncology launching KEYTRUDA, with AstraZeneca's strong experience, will enable us together to make this product a tremendous success.","Moving now to JANUVIA. Global sales for the JANUVIA franchise were $1.5 billion, a 7% decline, primarily driven by the U.S. In the second quarter, we saw solid volume growth of 3% in the U.S. But we also saw continued pricing pressure as we've discussed before. There was also lower inventory levels being held in the channel.","JANUVIA continues to maintain DPP-4 leadership and to be a preferred add-on after metformin. We look forward to the opportunity to broaden our diabetes portfolio with the SGLT2 inhibitor monotherapy and in combination with JANUVIA, partnered with Pfizer. That has a PDUFA date at the end of this year.","Moving now to our Vaccine business. Sales of $1.4 billion grew 11% due to strength in GARDASIL and approximately $70 million of sales from the terminated joint venture with Sanofi. In the United States, GARDASIL continues to see good underlying demand with very strong first dose coverage rates. But we're starting to see some impact from the transition from a three-dose to a two-dose regimen. GARDASIL sales outside of the U.S. grew this quarter, primarily driven by the JV termination.","Moving now to Hospital and Specialty. Successful launches of ZEPATIER and BRIDION more than offset declines in CUBICIN, REMICADE, and ISENTRESS. ZEPATIER sales reached nearly $520 million, driven by strong underlying demand in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. We will continue to focus on expanding ZEPATIER's utilization globally, but recognize that uptake may be impacted by the ongoing decline in overall patient volumes in many markets and increased competition.","BRIDION had another good quarter with growth of more than 40%, driven by strong demand across ex-U.S. markets and the continued success of the launch in the U.S. The U.S. remains the largest opportunity for BRIDION moving forward.","In closing, we drove solid performance across many products this quarter, delivering growth despite a more than $800 million headwind from loss of exclusivity. We continued to execute well on our product launches. And we look for additional opportunities across our broad portfolio to drive growth through the remainder of 2017.","With that I'll turn the call over to Roger.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Adam. As Ken has outlined, the malware that infected our computational environment had a very substantial effect on our activities during the last few days of the quarter. However, in the following weeks, through a very substantial effort by both IT and MRL personnel, we've been able to maintain our clinical trial execution plan. And although there's still a great deal of restoration work to do, we continue on track to complete previously outlined priorities for the year.","During the second quarter we had the opportunity to see the results of REVEAL, our 30,000 patient study testing whether anacetrapib, when added to optimal care, could reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events, composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarctions, and coronary revascularization, as compared with the placebo control.","The study was conducted by Oxford University and was distinguished by the long duration of the trial, permitting careful analysis of treatment effects over a period of years, and very complete follow-up. As we announced earlier, the REVEAL study met its primary endpoint. The actual data will be presented at the European Society of Cardiology Congress next month. We also plan to review the results of the trial with external experts and will consider whether to file new drug applications with the FDA and other regulatory agents.","Also during the second quarter we obtained the results of our second Phase III study documenting that that doravirine, when administrated with lamivudine and tenofovir, was non-inferior to a similar efavirenz-containing regimen with respect to the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA levels less than 50 copies per ml, following 48 weeks of treatment.","In addition, patients treated with doravirine reported fewer neuropsychiatric adverse events and had fewer abnormalities in serum with the protein profiles than did patients treated with the efavirenz-containing regimen. These results strengthen our view that doravirine will represent an important new element of combination regimens for the treatment of HIV infection. We have a broad program in this area that includes interesting clinical candidates with high potency and long pharmacological half-lives.","I should note that doravirine is not the only important new antiviral in our arsenal. In addition, our cytomegalovirus-directed therapy, letermovir, which has been studied for the reduction of CMV disease in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant, has been assigned priority review status by the FDA with a PDUFA date of November 8.","Turning to Oncology. During the second quarter we received U.S. approval for KEYTRUDA when used in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed in the first-line treatment of non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, based on the KEYNOTE-021G study. These same data were also recognized earlier this month by the NCCN compendia, as Adam mentioned, in guidelines for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.","We also gained approval for KEYTRUDA in the second-line treatment of urothelial malignancies, based on improved overall survival in patients treated with KEYTRUDA as compared with chemotherapy. And in first-line treatment of such patients who are ineligible for platinum-based chemotherapy, based on overall response rate and the durability of these responses. The Committee on Human Medicinal Products of the European Medicines Agency adopted a resolution in support of these indications earlier this week.","During the second quarter, we also received approval for a broad indication in patients whose tumors harbor an unstable DNA microsatellite profile, suggestive of DNA repair deficiencies, irrespective of the underlying histology of the tumor. This approval represents to us a landmark in personalized medicine, since it focuses attention on the mechanism of action of KEYTRUDA, rather than correlating KEYTRUDA activity with the less predictive surrogate marker, tumor histology.","Separately, two late-stage studies of KEYTRUDA in patients with multiple myeloma, KEYNOTE-183 and -185, were placed on full clinical hold by the FDA, because of unfavorable imbalances in overall survival that were detected during review by our independent data monitoring committee. While we have not had the opportunity to analyze complete data sets from these studies, we note that our clinical trials of KEYTRUDA often address the needs of desperately ill patients in some of these situations. Especially where novel drug combinations are used, unexpected toxicities may sometimes emerge.","We announced earlier this week that our second-line study of KEYTRUDA monotherapy in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck failed to meet its primary endpoint of overall survival. I cannot comment in more detail on this interesting and important study, except to say that a detailed examination of the study results will be presented at an upcoming scientific meeting.","I have spoken frequently about the breadth of our KEYTRUDA program, which now includes more than 550 studies, including more than 300 combination studies. I note that we have now received 11 breakthrough designations for the use of KEYTRUDA in the treatment of malignancy, including four recent breakthrough designations for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma in combination with axitinib, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, and for the treatment of high-risk, early-stage, triple-negative breast cancer, in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We are working closely with the agency to determine how best to advance these new indications.","Lastly, we are very excited about our new collaboration with colleagues at AstraZeneca on LYNPARZA, the leading poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor, which they have advanced for the treatment of BRCA-mutant ovarian cancer. Recently presented data from their SOLO-2 study demonstrated a 70% improvement in progression-free survival in patients with platinum-sensitive, relapsed, BRCA mutant ovarian cancer, when LYNPARZA was used as maintenance therapy with a very manageable adverse event profile.","Similarly, data from the OlympiAD trial presented last month at the American Society for Clinical Oncology meetings demonstrated that LYNPARZA treatment improved overall responses and extended progression-free survival as opposed to traditional chemotherapy in women with hormone receptor-positive or triple negative BRCA-mutant breast cancer, who had receive prior chemotherapy. Substantial preclinical data support the view that PARP inhibition, by defeating one component of the cancer cell's DNA repair machinery, can sensitize tumors to the effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors.","Hence, we are very excited to be able to work closely with our colleagues at AstraZeneca, both to explore broader indications for LYNPARZA as monotherapy, and as well to examine the utility of LYNPARZA when used in combination with KEYTRUDA to improve the lives of patients suffering from malignant disease.","I'll now turn the call back over to Teri.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Roger. Darla, we're ready to move onto our Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Oh great. Thank you very much, folks, and congratulations on the good quarter. A couple on diabetes if I may for Adam. How should we think about the rate of price erosion for JANUVIA? And just overall, in terms of your strategy, you developed \u2013 you had filed (22:10) approved in Europe in January and you haven't launched it yet. You developed it once with the JANUVIA, but you didn't proceed with it. So I guess we're all waiting for ertugliflozin. Just help us understand how we should think about how you plan to position that drug, given the substantial lead by JARDIANCE on their cardiovascular benefits data. Thank you very much.","Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Sure, Alex. Good morning. So if you look at JANUVIA, the IMS-2X (22:37) volume growth in the U.S. was strong. It was about 3%. However, it's not as strong growth as what we experienced last year, where it was about 4.5%.","I've been saying for a couple years now that each year, the pricing pressure gets a little bit harder than the year before. And this year is harder than last year. And I expect next year will be harder than this year. It's not discontinuous. It's just continuous pressure that builds in the channel, particularly in the United States.","As we look forward, we're excited about the SGLT2 and the SGLT2 combination with JANUVIA. I believe that JANUVIA will continue to be the first choice for add-on therapy after metformin. And I think that will remain the case around the world.","But a lot of patients still don't get to their HbA1c goals even with metformin plus JANUVIA. So there are many patients where they look to add on an additional oral agent, of which the SGLT2 sometimes are the right product to add. Therefore, I believe having a combination with an SGLT2 with by far the market leader in the DPP-4 class will be a competitive advantage for us. And that's why we look forward to launching that with a PDUFA date in the United States later this year.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Next question please, Darla?","Operator","Is from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. I have three questions. The first is, could you please provide a little bit more color on the downside scenarios that you factored in for the cyberattack in the second half of the year? And also what guidance would've been if not for the cyberattack?","Second, with respect to KEYTRUDA chemo combo in lung, could you talk about expectations for ex-U.S. approval and launch timing?","And then finally, could you discuss the 15-valent pneumococcal vaccine? And your level of enthusiasm for that? And when we will see data later this year? Thank you.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Why don't we start with Rob on the cyberattack. Rob?","Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.","Yes. Good morning, David. So as you look at the cyberattack, we are still assessing the full impact. And we do not have a specific estimate at this time. So I can't give you the specific downside related to that. But I will tell you we have anticipated there will be temporary delays in fulfilling orders And we will incur expenditures related to the remediation efforts.","However, based on what we know today, we have considered all of those scenarios into the range of guidance we provided, both sales and EPS. So we feel like we've captured the anticipated scenarios in what we've told you.","And I think it's also important to point out that despite the temporary challenge of the cyberattack, our operational momentum is strong, which has enabled us to raise our revenue guidance. And we did maintain EPS guidance for the year, while absorbing both the impact from cyber as well as the dilution from the AZ collaboration. And then with your second question, would guidance have been higher but for cyber? The answer is yes.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Over to you, Roger.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Right. Okay. So, David, a couple of questions. First, KEYTRUDA-chemo combo in lung outside the United States. Obviously we're pursuing the registration of the 021G data in a variety of jurisdictions. Haven't provided any updates on this. We are going through the usual motions. And as more information becomes available, we'll certainly let you know.","And we're very enthusiastic about V114, our pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. We have already data from a variety of studies, some of which we've had a chance to present. And we hope to be embarking on registrational studies with V114 in not too long a time. So things are moving along extremely well in that area.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Okay. Next question, Darla?","Operator","Is from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen.","Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. Would you provide an estimate of the percent penetration for KEYTRUDA and ALIMTA in first-line lung cancer?","And secondly, similar to the deal Merck is doing with AstraZeneca for LYNPARZA, did you consider doing a similar deal for tremelimumab? And if not, perhaps you could tell us why? Thank you.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","We'll start with Adam.","Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Yes. So with regard to first-line lung cancer, a couple things are important. First of all, we are certainly seeing a strong uptake overall. And in the United States, KEYTRUDA is now the leader in terms of market share in first-line lung cancer.","With regard to the combination with ALIMTA, we're certainly starting to see some uptake. But it's still too early to give any specific market share for that portion of the business. But as I mentioned on the call with NCCN recommendation and reimbursement, we think that will continue to be helpful.","So we are very pleased right now. About half of the sales for KEYTRUDA in the U.S. are in first-line lung. And that was the largest increase in terms of a percent of our sales. So we continue to believe that KEYTRUDA will be a mainstay for the treatment in lung cancer first-line.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.","And as far as our deal with AstraZeneca goes, we really like the PARP inhibitor and the MEK inhibitor. And that was our primary reason for wanting to engage them in terms of a potential deal. We have our own CTLA-4 in development. And I'll turn that over to Roger for any more comments.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Yeah. I mean the LYNPARZA situation and our partnership with AstraZeneca was a very special transaction that reflects the genuine alignment of the two companies.","With respect to CTLA-4, we have an interest in CTLA-4. We do believe quite strongly that there will be opportunities for a range of different combinations with KEYTRUDA that will improve \u2013 we hope will improve outcomes in individual patients. And it will become very personalized. But we do have our own CTLA-4 antibody MK-1308. And so there's really no reason under the circumstances for us not to pursue. We put a lot of work into developing that molecule. No reason not for us to use that one if that turns out to be the right agent.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Great. Next question, please, Darla.","Operator","It's from the line of Andrew Baum with Citi.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Two questions please. Firstly, for Roger. Could you just outline your longer term commitment to HIV? It seems that you have many of the building blocks, the legacy business, the Organon business, and several promising interesting molecules, such as EFdA. Could you outline the overall strategy there, in particular the plans for EFdA for both treatment and prep?","And then second, could you address the question of PD-L1 cut-offs for the combination with CTLA-4. When I look at the 021 data with pembro [pembrolizumab] and YERVOY, it seems to be an inverse relationship if anything in terms of efficacy and PD-L1 expression. So how are you thinking about that as you develop your own CTLA-4 for combination with KEYTRUDA? Thank you.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Right. Thank you, Andrew. First of all, we see a lot of opportunity to improve on therapeutic options in HIV. Of course I spent some time talking about doravirine. And we've published those data.","And we've also put quite a bit of effort into developing as I mentioned potent long-acting molecules, which potentially could be given with \u2013 in an unusual formulation, whether that's depot or something else, to provide a mechanism for infrequent dosing. For EFdA, what we call MK-8591, that molecule has very unusual characteristics.","We had the opportunity to present some of the data at the Paris meetings just earlier this week. And first of all, it's enormously potent. But secondly, even single-dose data results in dramatic suppression of viral load that can persist for a long period of time. We actually have the sense that we may be getting at something very important there in terms of the reservoir of HIV infection. But that's for the future for us to investigate. I just \u2013 I think we're very enthusiastic about the totality of the portfolio to provide better therapy for HIV infection.","And with respect to PD-L1 cut-offs, frankly in the 021 study the sample sizes weren't large enough to be able to look at different PD-L1 levels and try and infer from that which patients would benefit most. And as you know the data that become available from others, including ourselves but also Bristol-Myers [Bristol-Myers Squibb], from other studies, have been a little confusing about how best to use the combination of a CTLA-4 directed therapy in a PD-1-directed therapy.","Nevertheless, we continue to study that and to try and develop better indices for which patients would benefit most. The agents are quite different. They have different activities. They have different adverse effect profiles. And we're hopeful that we'll be able to define a patient population that will benefit especially from such a combination.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Roger. Darla, we'll move onto the next question, please.","Operator","It's from the line of Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much and congrats on a great quarter. Just a couple of quick questions. Roger, can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment that you see in first-line lung cancer, more from a additional data perspective? We know there's a lot of additional clinical studies coming. But just wondering if you could give us your thoughts on the prospect of showing a survival benefit in the KEYNOTE-189 study, and its relative importance in the overall landscape? Is it something that you think is likely to be demonstrated and perhaps not demonstrated by other studies?","And then separately, Adam, it's our understanding again that the first trial coming from the competitor, Roche, is actually using an Avastin-based regimen. Could you just help us understand a little bit the commercial dynamics that could either impact KEYTRUDA or perhaps have that be a somewhat understated potential regimen if that trial is successful? Thanks.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Right. So, Seamus, with respect to the competitive environment, there will be a lot of data coming out for various combination studies, chemo combination studies, combinations with other biologic agents, et cetera, in lung cancer. I think in the general comment, and just you're aware of this, but just to be sure that we highlight it, the general comment is that it becomes increasingly difficult over time to show overall survival differences comparing KEYTRUDA or any other PD-1 or PD-L1 directed agent with chemotherapy because of the crossover problem.","In essence, because of the known activity of KEYTRUDA in particular in the lung cancer setting, patients who would fail a chemotherapy regimen will likely be crossed over. And indeed one has to \u2013 it is always ethical to pursue studies of a new agent versus standard of care. But the data set is becoming extremely strong with respect to lung cancer and the power of KEYTRUDA. So that's going to make it difficult over time, because patients will be crossed over where studies began some time ago. And we expect that.","On the other hand, when you look at what we have achieved previously for example with KEYNOTE-024 and in other areas, the hazard ratios for PFS and for OS are so impressive that there's a real chance that nevertheless we'll succeed. So we're optimistic about those trials going forward. But we recognize that it does become harder over time because of the crossover phenomenon.","Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.","And this is Adam. So I feel very good about our position in first-line lung cancer today. And if you look at the data that we have, not just as a monotherapy but also in combo with ALIMTA, it's very, very strong.","And if you think about the utilization, it's not just in academic centers for treatment of first-line lung. It's also in the community-based physicians. There, they're very comfortable using chemotherapy. So I think the combination of KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy with the strong efficacy data that we have will continue to be a very strong position for us.","Obviously we have to see what data comes out and what the results would be. But as Roger said, the bar is very high with the data we have. And I feel good about our position in lung today and as we move forward.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks. Darla, next question, please.","Operator","Is from the line of Tim Anderson with Bernstein.","Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. Can you confirm the timing of KEYNOTE-189 data? Are you confident that we'll see that top line release before the end of the year? And is there any chance that we'll see the full data release in 2017?","Second question is going back to your development question \u2013 your development plan with CTLA-4 and with YERVOY specifically. Earlier in the year you seemed to be leaning towards initiating pivotal trials with a KEYTRUDA\/YERVOY combination. And I'm wondering if you've disposed with that or put that on ice? I understand you have your own internal CTLA-4, but it's a YERVOY-specific question.","And then on 021G, is there pushback in the prescriber community just based on the facts of that Phase 2 data? And do you think the Phase 3 is really needed to open the floodgates in terms of broad utilization?","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Why don't we start with Roger?","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Okay. Tim, with respect to KEYNOTE-189, the \u2013 as always I mean these are event-drive trials. So as time goes on we look at events. And we ask ourselves when we think the data are going to become available.","We do our best to update ClinicalTrials.gov and give our best estimate. Our expectation is based on what we're seeing, that the 189 top line will become available this year. I would think it would be difficult to get full data out in a scientific meeting, just because of the time required once the top line is available to actually prepare the material for presentation. But I can't say. It's just it's event-driven.","And with respect to the KEYTRUDA-YERVOY combination. Yes. You're right. We've done quite a number of studies and published them with respect to the combination. And we have had discussions with regulatory agencies about a KEYTRUDA-YERVOY combination. Haven't pulled the trigger on it, in part because we continue to accrue additional data from others as well as ourselves. And also as you can appreciate, we've just got an awful lot of studies going on. And we have to prioritize among those in terms of starting time. So that one is on the block. But we haven't yet pulled the trigger on it.","Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.","And then, Tim, this is Adam. So anecdotally, we're hearing very positive comments. And we're hearing the comments on 021G not just from academic centers and physicians, but also in the community-based area. And the key is that we have an approved FDA indication and we have NCCN recommendation. So I don't have data yet to support anything other than what we're hearing from the field. But everything we're hearing is positive at this point. And I would expect that the combination will be used increasingly more often as we move forward.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Great. Next question please, Darla?","Operator","It's from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher T. Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much for the questions. Just two here. Maybe \u2013 and maybe both for Roger. First on the PARP deal. Can you just \u2013 I appreciate the comments about how you see PARPs fitting into the I-O landscape. Any tumors in particular where you see the strongest rationale to pursue a combo there with KEYTRUDA?","My second question was just on the MYSTIC failure and just some of your thoughts here. KEYTRUDA was obviously able to show a PFS and OS benefit in high expressors. We didn't see that signal with your competitor. Just any thoughts here of this as a trial design issue? A PD-1 versus PD-L1 issue? Or just something more specific to the molecule? Just any comments there would be much appreciated. Thank you.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Chris. First of all, with respect to LYNPARZA, as I indicated, the data already for LYNPARZA are quite robust in the ovarian cancer setting and the recently presented data at ASCO in lung cancer.","They have now \u2013 and I guess I should say we have, since it's the two of us together \u2013 10 ongoing registrational trials in a variety of different areas in 14 different tumor types that are being pursued. There's more than 120 studies, many of which are investigator initiated. But nevertheless a lot of studies on ClinicalTrials.gov, so a lot to pursue.","I think one of the things that impressed us in our conversations with our colleagues at AstraZeneca is how well they thought through the issue of DNA repair defects generally. And as we know, the expectation is that in tumor cells that have crippling mutations in various parts of the DNA repair process, they should accumulate mutations which are potential targets for immune cells to recognize. And so the logic behind the combination is compelling as we see.","The interesting thing is that using the kinds of analyses that they've done, we can sift through tumors more directly and ask, which ones are more likely to have impediments in DNA repair as a result of PARP inhibition. And hence, which ones are more likely to be those that we could benefit by adding KEYTRUDA as well.","My sense is that this will once again turn out to be something that is less about histology and more about molecular definition of tumor type. And to me that's the really exciting part, because again it represents further personalization of therapy.","And then with respect to the failure of the MYSTIC trial. We learned about it at the same time that you did. And we have access to the same material that you have, which is just what has been presented in terms of study design at ClinicalTrials.gov.","I really don't know what the nature of the patient population was in detail. I don't really know what the data looked like, and hence, it's not fair for me to comment. Suffice it to say it was not what they had hoped for in terms of a progression-free survival result. But it's impossible for me to explain why that happened.","As you know when you look at the KEYNOTE-024 data in the first-line setting in a PD-L1 enriched population, the hazard ratio for progression-free survival was 0.5 with a p-value that had two zeros to the right of the decimal point.","So that indicates that there's quite a lot of power in that study. And so to really understand it, and it's not so different from trying to sort through what exactly happened in other studies that haven't been successful, you really need to look very carefully at the patients that were enrolled and what their characteristics were. I'm sure we'll be hearing a lot more about that as the data are presented.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Roger. Next question, please, Darla.","Operator","It's from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. Perhaps first, maybe for you Roger. I just wanted to zoom in on any important differences in trial conduct? So conduct specifically between 021G and how KEYNOTE-189 is being conducted. And perhaps things like whether patients are having to give fresh biopsies, their prior radiation exposure, time from diagnosis to first dose, smoking history. That sort of thing. I just wanted to understand that, number one.","And then secondly, in the AstraZeneca deal, a couple follow-ups. One, how do think about the Astra PARP versus some of the other unencumbered PARPS in the marketplace? Just wanted to understand your thought process behind finalizing this specific one. And secondly, just for our housekeeping could you just help explain what will be the biggest trigger of the $6 billion plus in milestones? Just so we understand and model the cash flows appropriately. Thank you.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Okay. So we'll start with Roger, and then we'll end with Rob on that question.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Okay. First of all, with respect to trial conduct of KEYNOTE-189 versus 021G, not a lot to comment on there. I mean the study is pretty straightforward. It's a substantially larger Phase III study. But once again focusing in the same way as we did before on all comers in a comparison of carboplatin, pemetrexed with KEYTRUDA combined. So they're fairly similar kinds of studies in terms of what we're looking at. I don't think there are major differences in terms of trial conduct that should draw your attention.","With respect to the AstraZeneca deal, the question you ask is, which PARP? And why we'd want to look at one PARP or another.","So let me just tick down. That with respect to LYNPARZA, let's talk about what we know. What we know is, they gained approval first of all with their capsule formulation some years ago in a fourth-line setting in mutant \u2013 BRCA-mutant ovarian cancer. And have gone on in the SOLO-2 study to show that the new formulation of LYNPARZA has really a very profound effect.","And when you look at that with a central review hazard ratio of 0.25 in the maintenance setting for these BRCA-2 mutant ovarian cancer patients, that's a very impressive, really very impressive result. And in many cases, because now that the molecule has been on the market for some time and has been in study for some time, you have a lot of evidence of durability in that patient population with many patients who have been on for a lot of years.","And again when you look at the OlympiAD data, which they presented at ASCO, that the effect in breast cancer were also very powerful. And so when I look at the total weight of data, what we know about the molecule in the ongoing studies, to me it's just an extremely attractive. If we're going to choose a poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor to study in combination with KEYTRUDA, it's an extremely attractive molecule. And that's of course what drew our attention.","And I guess now we have to talk about the triggers. Rob?","Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Yeah. Good morning, Umer. So if you look, the contingent payments in the deal were about $6.15 billion. And as Ken mentioned in his prepared remarks, we see this as a de-risked stretch from our perspective. And to that end if you look at the $6.15 billion, about two-thirds are tied to sales milestones across various sales levels. And one-third are tied to approval milestones across multiple tumor types.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Great. Next question, please, Darla.","Operator","It's from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Just a few. Rob, firstly, you posted a $0.14 beat this quarter. Yet you didn't raise guidance, and understandably due to the uncertainty around the cyberattack. But if you could just kind of share with us what proportion of the absorbing the $0.14 beat for the year relates to the one-time cyberattack? And what proportion relates to additional expenses or second-half comparisons or competition that we should be aware of?","Secondly, Roger, we now have a handful of PD-1, PD-L1 drugs on the market. And specifically in lung there's two PD-1s and one PD-L1. Are you seeing at all \u2013 or do you believe there is a difference between these two agents? There have been interesting \u2013 we've had different outlooks or different results from some of these different trials, some of which have been surprising, some of which haven't been. But just wondering if you could share with us your perspective on whether or not you see a clinical difference between PD-1 and PD-L1?","And then just lastly, if you could give us an update on when you plan to initiate your Phase III IDO inhibitor with KEYTRUDA in frontline tumors, including lung? And what would be the comparative? What are you going to compare that combination with? And does the MYSTIC failure help to guide that decision in any way? Thanks.","Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.","Morning, Jami. Thanks for the question. I don't want to get into specifics, because as I said in \u2013 to the prior question, we're still assessing the full impact. But what I would say is as we prepared our guidance and in effect maintained the EPS guidance while raising sales guidance, we did it looking at a variety of downside scenarios.","It's important to note that we have both an anticipation that there will be some expenditures for remediation cost as well as the fact that there could be some sales impacts due to the temporary delays in fulfilling orders for certain products in certain markets. And those are really the items that we have factored in.","But beyond that I don't want to try to split it out, because it is really range bound. So I would end with just saying we're confident that the guidance we've given should encompass what we see as those anticipated scenarios.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","And, Jami, with respect to the difference between antibodies directed against PD-1 and those directed against one of the ligands, PD-L1, as you know \u2013 and there are no head-to-head studies. And without head-to-head studies, it's extremely difficult to reason from one to another as you point out. The clinical results have been variable even in any particular class, and in fact even for a particular agent.","So it's very difficult I think to draw general conclusions about, is one better than the other? My sense is that it would be not surprising that there were differences, just because of the different patterns of expression and because of the fact that there is promiscuity in terms of the ligand relationships of PD-L2 binding to PD-1,and similarly PD-L1 having other ligands besides PD-1.","So it would not be surprising. But I don't see clinical data that tell me unambiguously that one is different from the other. Various people sum over the results in the different trials and try and draw conclusions. I think without head-to-head information it's hard to know.","And secondly, with respect to the IDO1 inhibitor, again we do have an ongoing Phase III study in melanoma that's been going on for some time. We're continuing to pursue that combination.","And the central question is, okay, does adding epacadostat actually improve outcomes in a KEYTRUDA treated population or not? That is the question. And that's the central question that we are addressing in all these other studies. We have as you know a lot of small, relatively early studies that suggest that indeed it will. We love the fact that epacadostat is relatively well-tolerated and it has a good adverse effect profile, which enables it to partner well.","We have good Phase III study designs. Our Phase III study designs will not be affected by the MYSTIC data, which of course we've only seen the top line. Because they're already complete, we've reviewed those Phase III study designs with the FDA and with other health authorities. And we've begun to socialize those designs with clinical trial sites and get to work on the whole issue of clinical operations and site feasibility and how we actually engineer these things. So we're expecting those studies will be starting very, very soon.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thank you. Next question please, Darla.","Operator","It's from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Morning. And I also wanted to say congrats on the second quarter. For Adam, just a couple. For first-line lung in the U.S., can you talk a little bit about share and testing trends for monotherapy KEYTRUDA? I suspect that most of the sequential uptick was 021G but wanted to check that, versus broader adoption from 024.","And then, Roger, with all the tumor types you're exploring in KEYTRUDA, is there something specific on myeloma that makes I-O less attractive as a strategy? I guess more color on 183 or 185 would be helpful. Thanks.","Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Good morning. Hi. This is Adam. So if you look at first-line lung. First, let me give you a sense of testing. Right now in the United States we believe that more than three-quarters of patients are being tested. If you look at Europe, we believe that it's two-thirds of patients are currently being tested, where a country like the UK is about 90%, Germany is about 65%. So there's no doubt that we are seeing on a global basis, including Japan, significant increases in testing. And it's really becoming standard of care to test patients for their status.","With regard to first-line lung, we are the leader right now in first-line lung for new patient starts. And we have about a 26% overall share, which is higher than any of the other products in first-line setting. And the majority of it I believe is based on -024, because we're just in the midst of launching the 021G results.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","And, Geoff, it's Roger. With respect to myeloma, probably not too much additional color I can add beyond what I mentioned in the opening remarks. I mean certainly we were very sad to see the \u2013 to hear it first from our data monitoring committee and to review the information that was then shared with FDA on the imbalance in deaths seen in the 183 and 185 studies. That of course flew in the face of earlier information that we had from Phase I studies in melanoma, which we presented at the American Society for Hematology meeting, suggesting that adding KEYTRUDA to IMiD therapy could be very effective.","Without having a chance to really look at the data, which of course now we're cleaning and locking databases. And we'll really step through all of that. Without being able to see those data, I can't explain what happened. We haven't given up on the idea that there will be opportunities in myeloma. But clearly we have to look carefully at the accumulated adverse effects that occurred in the context of this combination therapy that's aggressive therapy used in a very brittle patient population with advanced multiple myeloma.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Darla, I think this is going to be our last question as we're running out of time. But we'll move onto this last question.","Operator","Your final question is from Tony Butler with Guggenheim.","Tony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yes. Thanks very much. Adam, you alluded to in MSI-high for KEYTRUDA, that there was initial interest. And I'm really asking if you could just explore what initial interest means? Because it seems like such a broad indication, I would think that a number \u2013 initial interest would be met quite handsomely with open arms. But I'd love for you to explore that. And more importantly what testing really is on that front? Much like for PD-L1. Thanks.","And then, Rob, just briefly on the expenses related to cyber, are those one-time in nature? In other words, do you have that as a soft fixed cost for effectively the rest of the calendar year. Or does it actually leak into 2018? Do you \u2013 would you know that? Thanks.","Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Okay. So let me talk about MSI-high just a bit, Tony. So first of all, we're really working hard to increase the awareness for MSI testing and the value of KEYTRUDA across the tumor types. And after the June approval, there's certainly health care professional awareness that were hearing. But it's too early to see that translate into sales. It's really been detected across a lot of different cancer types. Some that are uncommon, like biliary tract cancer. And some that are very common, like colorectal cancer.","If you look, MSI-high, it really is an established biomarker. And it's used often in something like colorectal cancer or endometrial cancer. But it's not really done in many of the other tumor types.","So we have still a lot of work that we have to do to educate the importance of testing for those other tumor types. And I would expect over time that this will continue to be an interesting and important indication. But it's going to take time to build, frankly.","Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.","Great. And, Tony, thanks for the question. The majority of the expenditures are one-time in nature remediation costs. Although I would say that as we move into 2018, two things. One, the timing of which we're able to get anything remediated is still being worked through, so I think we can't rule out that it could bleed into 2018 at this point in time. We just don't know. We'll give more information on that as we move forward.","And then secondly, while the majority of the costs are one-time, yeah, I do expect that we will see incremental investment in IT going forward that could drive our expense in that area up a little bit. But I don't see it at a magnitude that would materially change the way we'd look at our overall expense base. And clearly we'll manage that as we look at total expenses and be able to give more guidance on that as we get to the end of the year, looking at 2018.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.","Okay. In closing, we're really pleased with the operational strength that our business has shown in the first half of the year. We think we have great momentum, particularly with our product launches. And we think that positions us very well for the long term. So thank you for your interest.

Now this morning, I\u2019m joined by Ken Frazier, Peter Kellogg, Adam Schechter, Roger Perlmutter and Rob Davis, our newly appointed CFO. So with that I like to introduce Ken Frazier. Ken?","Ken Frazier","Thank you, Joe. Good morning everyone, and thank you all for joining the call today. As expected we delivered another solid operational quarter with growth in several key brands and disciplined cost management. The fundamentals of our business remained strong which we believe will keep us on track and deliver on our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance.","Looking beyond the first quarter this is an exciting time at Merck as we prepare to commercialize the next wave of innovation coming out of our labs over the next few years. Our commitment to innovation remains strong as it\u2019s only by bringing to market new products that make a meaningful difference to patients, healthcare providers and payers that we will continue to create value for society and shareholders.","This quarter we delivered on this commitment in a number of important areas including oncology where we continue the rolling submission of a BLA for MK3475, our anti-PD1 immunotherapy in advanced melanoma. MK3475 is currently being studied in 17 clinical trials estimated to enroll over 4,000 patients across more than 30 types of cancer. Earlier this month we presented pharmacy Phase II data from our investigational Hepatitis C treatments which have accelerated our path to Phase III development.","We also presented Phase II data for MK1439 our investigational next generation HIV therapy which will move into Phase III development by the end of the year. Each of these candidates represents the kind of innovation that has the potential to make a meaningful difference to patients. Roger will talk more about our pipeline and the status of our regulatory applications for our near term candidates later in the call. We look forward to providing a more comprehensive update regarding these and our other promising pipeline programs at our upcoming investor meetings on May 6th at our Research Campus in Boston. For now, I will reiterate that, we are excited by our pipeline and what\u2019s to come.","Turning back to the first quarter, we saw growth in many key areas of our human health portfolio including diabetes, immunology, vaccines and Isentress. We are preparing for many upcoming product launches. In March, we announced the appointment of Robert Davis, as Chief Financial Officer, succeeding Peter Kellogg who has served in that role since 2007. Peter has been an important member of our leadership team and instrumental in helping guide Merck during a period of significant change in our company and in our industry. Peter will leave Merck a stronger company and we are grateful for his many contributions. As we announced previously, Peter will remain at Merck through mid-May to ensure a seamless transition and is with us today to discuss our first quarter results and to answer your questions.","Rob joined us from Baxter where he most recently served as Corporate Vice President and President of that company\u2019s medical products business. He previously served as the company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Rob is an accomplished executive with significant financial expertise both in pharma from his time at Lily and in broader healthcare from his time at Baxter. I believe his broad, global, business, financial and healthcare experience make him a great addition to our team. Rob?","Robert Davis","Thanks Ken and good morning everyone. I must say, it\u2019s a privilege to be a member of the Merck team. I spent many years in the healthcare industry and I have long viewed Merck is a premier research company in the pharmaceutical industry. There is a strong legacy here of translating science in to medicine so when Ken called to discuss the opportunity with me, I jumped at the chance. I look forward to working with the management team and leading the financial organization. This is my fifth day on job but know am excited to be here and I look forward to seeing of you next week at the investor briefing in Boston. Ken?","Ken Frazier","Thank you, Rob. We are also excited to have you here. In closing, our strategy of focusing on our best opportunities while being disciplined about managing our costs continues to deliver bottom line performance. Our robust pipeline contains many promising candidates representing a suite of near and long-term opportunities that will continue to drive growth and shareholder value. I look forward to seeing all of you at our upcoming investor briefing where we will share more about how we are sharpening our commercial and R&D focus bolstering our innovative pipeline and preparing to launch and commercialize on many long-term opportunities. And with that I would like to turn the call the call over to Adam.","Adam Schechter","Thank you. Ken. Good morning everyone. This morning I will provide you with an overview of first quarter Global Human Health results. My comments will be on a constant currency basis. As we anticipated, immunology, diabetes and vaccines continue to be areas of growth. Sales growth in these areas were offset by few things, the continued impact from loss of exclusivity of several brands, product divestitures that we previously announced and the biannual price declines in Japan.","We continued to take action to focus our resources on areas that provide the greatest potential for long-term growth. Those include our top markets, our core therapeutic areas and our launch opportunities. We are making critical choices and we are prioritizing our resources and you can see these efforts reflected in our reduced expenses.","Let me provide more details on the performance of our core products and core markets and I will start with the Januvia franchise. The franchise has sales of $1.3 billion and 5% growth in the first quarter. In United States, sales increased by 4%. Our international market sales, which now represent about 50% of our total sales grew 6%. We drove double-digit growth in Europe and the emerging markets but we also saw the impact of customers reducing their inventory levels in Japan ahead of the April 1st price reductions.","Globally, the diabetes market is significant and the macro trends support our growing markets. We will continue to focus resources around the world to ensure continued leadership in the branded global diabetes market.","Moving to Isentress, we had another good quarter with Isentress with 8% global growth, that\u2019s despite new competition. Turning to immunology, the combined immunology business consisting of REMICADE and SIMPONI grew 13% in the quarter. Sales of SIMPONI alone grew over 40%. SIMPONI is the fastest growing immunology biologic in the market where it\u2019s available. Sales of REMICADE grew 7% and that\u2019s despite biosimilar entry in some of the smaller EU markets. As an important reminder we maintained patent protection for REMICADE in markets that represent 80% of our sales until early 2015.","Lastly, moving to our vaccines business. In the first quarter, vaccines sales grew 4%. Demand for vaccines portfolio remained strong and there are many global growth opportunities. Gardasil sales increased by 2% in the quarter, 10% sales growth in the U.S. and strong sales in the emerging markets were offset by the loss of sales in Japan.","Looking now at Zostavax, Zostavax sales were $142 million this quarter. As expected, sales in United States declined sequentially due to seasonality. As you may recall last year, we saw benefit to sales from flu season extending into the first quarter. This year, the flu season did not extend into the first quarter. In addition we are continuing to educate customers on the broad managed care coverage for Zostavax and the process for getting reimbursement. Internationally, we\u2019ve launched Zostavax in select Asian markets and the UK and we are seeing good uptick in those markets.","Now I would like to briefly touch on our performance at regional level beginning with the United States. In the U.S. growth in our core areas of diabetes and vaccines was offset by the [inaudible] loss of exclusivity, revised cholesterol guidelines and the changes in in the HCV market. In Europe, we drove strong growth in immunology in diabetes and with Isentress. We also saw generic entry for Nesonex and pricing pressure continues throughout the region, Japan sales \u2013 and Gardasil.","Sales in emerging markets grew 3%, strong growth in key emerging markets like Brazil, Turkey and Korea was partially offset by declines in this quarter. The timing of tenders affected our performance this quarter as well. Looking ahead this year, we continue to expect that the emerging markets will be strong growth drivers for us. In summary in the first quarter, Global Human Health drove growth of key franchise including diabetes, immunology and vaccines.","As we anticipated there were headwinds including loss of exclusivities, divestures and buying patterns in anticipation of the biannual price declines in Japan. We continue to prioritize our investment. We\u2019re sharpening our focus on the best opportunities for long-term growth which includes our core products, our core markets and launches. We have multiple near-term launch opportunities and I look forward to discussing these with you next week at our investor briefing.","Now I would like to turn the call over to colleague Peter Kellogg.","Peter Kellogg","Thank you Adam and thank you Ken for the kind words. Good morning everyone. Our first quarter results demonstrate that we are on track in executing against our plan to reshape and refocus the company for future growth. This morning, I will provide additional color on our accomplishments in the first quarter and I will comment on re-confirming our outlook for the rest of the year.","My remarks will focus on our non-GAAP financials. On this basis we earned $0.88 per share in the first quarter as compared to $0.85 per share in the prior year. EPS growth was driven by growth in key brands effective cost management and contributions from asset sales.","Now I would like to walk through P&L, starting with revenues. On an ex-exchange basis, total company revenues in the first quarter decreased 2%. As expected this decline reflects several moving parts including the impacts of divestures, loss of exclusivity of certain brands, partially offset by growth in core products. Building on Adam\u2019s discussion of Global Human Health results I will speak to the other revenue elements in the quarter on an ex-exchange basis.","Animal health revenues were flat year-over-year, however excluding Zilmax sales in animal health grew 5% in the quarter. Consumer care revenues declined by 3% as a result of product divestures and the shortened allergy season in North America this quarter. Other revenues increased by approximately $85 million this year driven by proceeds from the divesture of U.S. Saphris rights. These proceeds were partially offset by the continued decline in supply sales to the AstraZeneca joint venture.","Regarding the joint venture we continue to expect AstraZeneca to exercise its option which would bring the longstanding partnership to a close on June 30th.","Moving to expenses and starting with product gross margin. PGM was 74.1% this quarter which was slightly higher than expected due to exchange and the Saphris proceeds. As noted in February, we still expect the 2014 full year gross margin ratio to be slightly lower than in 2013 full year ratio of 74.3%.","Our SG&A expenses were about $250 million lower than prior year, driven by reductions and promotions, direct selling and administrative expenses as well as some foreign exchange benefit. While we are focusing our resources on key markets and core products, we are also preparing for several launches this year. While we will invest in launches to maximize these opportunities we do remain on track for full year SG&A reductions versus 2013.","Similarly research and development expenses were about $340 lower year-over-year, as a result of continued prioritization of R&D programs and some phasing of spend that we now expect to occur in the second half of the year. As communicated in the last few weeks we are initiating a broad Phase III program for our investigational hepatitis C regiment and we are continuing to invest heavily in immune-oncology. But as with SG&A we continue to expect full year reductions in R&D spend compared to 2013.","Moving other income and expense, this quarter we had other income of $39 million reflecting a gain from divesting Sima. Also recall that in the prior year we had significant foreign exchange losses as a result of the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar.","Moving to tax, our non-GAAP tax rate was 26.1% in the first quarter. This is in line with our expectations for the year. We continue to anticipate the tax rate for the full to be between 24% and 26%.","Now turning to the outlook for the rest of the year, on the top-line we continue to expect revenue of $42.4 billion to $43.2 billion at current exchange rates. Similarly we are maintaining our bottom line guidelines for earnings of $3.35 to $3.53. On a GAAP basis we expect to earn between $2.15 and $2.47. Both of these EPS guidance ranges reflect a potential devaluation in Venezuela this year. Although the timing and magnitude of such a devaluation remains uncertain as we indicated in February.","Also as noted earlier both SG&A and R&D expenses will be lower than 2013 but the timing of some of these expenses has shifted from the first quarter into the second-half of the year. However we still expect earnings for the second half of the year to be stronger then the first-half of the year.","Now touching briefly on capital allocation, a year ago we announced a new $15 billion share repurchase program with the intension to repurchase $7.5 billion over the first 12 months. We have now accomplished that milestone. In fact over the past 12 months we have returned over $12 billion in total to shareholders through these repurchases and the dividends. These accomplishments place Merck as one of the top performers in the industry in returning cash to the shareholders.","So in conclusion. Merck is entering a new phase of innovation and launches and we are preparing to drive growth in the future. You can see results of our efforts in the form of a lower cost base, growth in core product franchises and acceleration of key pipeline assets such as our anti PD1 and hepatitis C programs. With our first quarter results in hand we are on track to accomplish the goal set forward to reshape Merck for future growth.","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Roger. Roger?","Roger Perlmutter","Thanks Peter. The first quarter was an especially busy one for the regulatory approvals group at Merck Research Laboratories. During the last two months we obtained FDA approval both for GRASTEK our sublingual desensitizing tablet for patients suffering from grass induced allergic rhinitis, and RAGWITEK, a similar tablet for patients suffering from ragweed allergy. Both agents developed in collaboration with our colleagues at Alcatel have demonstrated a significant efficacy in alleviating the troubling symptoms of patients suffering from seasonal rhinitis. As with some other desensitizing agents patients prescribed these drugs to have access to [ertapenem] to assure that these severely allergic patients are protective against the possibility of a hematologic reaction.","Also in the first quarter the committee for additional products for human resource or CHMP or the European medicines agency provided a favorable opinion regarding the conditional approval for vintafolide for the treatment of advanced fully receptive positive Platinum-Resistant Ovarian Cancer when used in combination with pegylated doxorubicin. We are developing vintafolide in collaboration with colleagues at Endocyte, the lead responsibility for our companion imaging reagent, used to assess the degree of folate receptor expression on tumor cells.","Vintafolide binds to the folate receptor and thereby delivers a cytotoxic vinca alkaloid resulting in significant tumor cell destruction. Conditional approval of vintafolide require ratification by the Europe Commission which should provide an opinion in the second quarter.","Meanwhile we are making good progress advancing the review of Vorapaxar with the FDA. As you will recall, Vorapaxar an antagonist of the thrombin receptor on platelets was evaluated in a large outcome study in combination with aspirin and Plavix as a means of reducing atherothrombotic events in patients that have previously sustained a myocardial infarction and they were considered to be at high risk for subsequent events. Details of potential vorapaxar labeling language are currently review. We are optimistic that it will be possible to agreement on this language in the very near future.","There are numerous other products for which regulatory evaluation is proceeding. The FDA has accepted our application for V503 our New 9-valent Papilloma Virus vaccine which we have demonstrated can expand the protection offered by Gardasil to five additional viral cerotypes. We are ready to bring this important new vaccine to patients around the world. Also in the first quarter we have resubmitted our application for Suvorexant and the rexant antagonist for treatment of Insomnia for which we received a complete response letter last year. Our resubmission provides data regarding new, lower starting doses for this drug in the quarter with the FDA recommendations.","Suvorexant is also under review in Japan and other jurisdictions. And in Japan we are pursuing registration for vaniprevir for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection when used in combination with peginterferon and ribavirin. We have received priority review from the Japanese PMDA into this agent.","Finally we made very good progress in the first quarter advancing the submission of MK-3475 our PD1 specific antibody for the treatment of patients for the advanced melanoma refractory to other therapies. Detail about this program will be presented as part of our Business Review Meeting next week. So I\u2019ll not cover them here. I do wish to say however that the finalization process that we introduced last year is clearly very improved, as can be seen in the reduced R&D expenses that we are reporting this quarter. These expense reductions were not achieved without substantial effort. And I am grateful to all of my colleagues for their diligence in focusing on investments on programs that can make a real difference for the patients who we serve.","Finally, we are looking forward to the business review next week where we intend to review some of our most important programs addressing metabolic disease and diabetes, hepatitis C virus infection, improved therapies for patients suffering from human immune efficiency virus infection and cancer. We are building in each of these cases on our long legacy of scientific achievements which positions us well to make further contributions to human health. Joe?","Joseph Romanelli","Great. Thank you, Roger. And before we open up the call to your questions Stephanie just please as a reminder please limit your questions to one or two, so we can get to as many callers as possible. So with that, Stephanie if we can open up the line for the first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.","Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group","Thanks a lot for taking the questions. First of all, hats off to Peter. Thanks for everything you have done of the biotech and now the pharma community and welcome Robert we all are looking forward to working with you. Number one, maybe on PD1 if I may, I suspect you are going to give me an unsatisfying answer to this Roger but I am going to try anyway. But we learned today that Bristol is going to file for lung cancer around the end of the year it sounds like, probably in 4Q. And I am just wondering if you could give us any kind of update, I know we\u2019ll hear about this next week but on your potential filling timelines in lung cancer base case and upside case.","And then maybe for Peter, these assets sales that helped to reduced EPS this quarter, was that something that you had planned for when you issued 2014 guidance? And then maybe for Ken just big M&A obviously what\u2019s going on at Pfizer has created a lot discussion around the merits of big M&A. Merck\u2019s a big company capable of doing big M&A I think it would be good time to here to get your updated views on such transformative deals.","Ken Frazier","Thanks Mark for the questions. Let me take a crack at the third question. So, our strategy is to remain true to who we are, a research intensive biopharmaceutical company that seeks to make a long-term difference through cutting edge size science. I prefer therefore to driving long term shareholder value through innovation rather than consolidation. And we believe Merck is at its best when it\u2019s inventing new treatment such as anti-PD1. Therefore we will remain focused on those opportunities that are right before us in advancing our pipeline.","We also announced a new global initiative last October as you know to sharpen our commercial and R&D focus and we are making critical choices about the areas where we look complete new investments that are required. In doing so we are also reducing our cost base by 2.5 billion and this is on top of the $3.5 billion worth of synergies for the merger. As you heard this morning the initiative is already showing progress and we are divesting assets and making structural changes to increase our operating leverage. And we are also exploring strategic options for consumer and animal health. So while we continuously evaluate external opportunities our preference is to enhance our pipeline and commercial business with smaller bolt-on acquisition versus large mergers for consolidation purposes.","On the other hand of course we carefully monitor and evaluate what is happening in the industry and we\u2019ll continue to be objective and comprehensive in our assessments. But to be clear our strategy is one of innovation.","Joseph Romanelli","Thanks Ken. So Roger?","Roger Perlmutter","Yeah Mark. With respect to non-small cell lung cancer we have a quite a lot of studies going on as you know with nearly 1,500 patients under study. We have the opportunity to go through all of that and to describe our registration strategy next week and I think that\u2019s probably the right way to approach this. Suffice it to say that we look for every opportunity that we can to bring the benefits of MK3475 to patients who need this drug and where we see substantial evidence of efficacy we are going to pursue the most accelerated kind of registration program that we can imagine we think it\u2019s that important.","Peter Kellogg","Mark, this is Peter thanks for your comments. And so relative to the asset sales and the sale of the commercial right for Saphris, yes we did as you recall last fall we announced our strategy of focusing on growth opportunities whether it be by franchise or geography and we also at that time announced that we will be taking some of our lower prioritized areas and potentially divesting them let\u2019s say we are better off in someone else\u2019s hands. I mean as we put together guidance for this year we are well aware of all these transactions and we incorporated that into our guidance.","And so on the one hand we are getting some benefits from the sale of the U.S Saphris rights in the other revenue line and the gain from sales of Serna in the other income expense. The flip is of course we are giving up the revenue of some of these assets that we are divesting. So just as an example for Q1 the loss of revenue on divested assets was about a $120 million and on a full year basis this year which is incorporated in our guidance the total is about $600 million based on 2013 sales.","So as you implement this sort of focus portfolio strategy you are going to end up little bit of period where you are getting some reductions in revenue and the other hand you gain the impacts of the transactions in the P&L.","Joseph Romanelli","Great thanks Mark for the questions and Stefanie next caller?","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Chris Schott \u2013 JPMorgan Chase","Thanks very much and Peter just want to wish you best of luck with everything. It\u2019s been great quite working with you. So a couple of questions here. Maybe first coming back on the capital deployment priorities, there\u2019s obviously been a lot in the press about the potential to sell the consumer franchise. Can you just give us an update of should we think about repo as the preferred use of capital to the extent that you ought to monetize one of these businesses? And the second question was on the HCV program and can you just comment on how you see differentiating your combo relative to the two primary competitors are going to little bit of a head start in terms of time to market here?","And just the one would you be comment on type of market share targets that you think you will be able to take as you look to commercialize this product looking out a few years, thanks very much.","Ken Frazier","Thanks Chris I will take your first question. So as you know it\u2019s pretty well established and we\u2019ve said that we are going to evaluate our consumer care business and our animal health business. We\u2019ve also been clear that we might reach very different conclusions about the two businesses. So with respect to your fundamental question that you asked. I don\u2019t think we are positioned to comment on hypotheticals at this point. In general, our frame work for the utilization of [hatch] has not changed.","First, we will allocate resources to those areas that we feel presents the highest potential growth opportunities, for example our anti PD1 program which we intend to be studying for multiple tumor types overtime. Second, we will execute on compelling business development opportunities to strengthen our pipeline and that can create value. Third, we plan to return a high level of free cash flow to shareholders through both the dividend and the stock buyback and just note that we have returned over $12 billion in cash to shareholders over the past 12 months.","Joseph Romanelli","Great, thanks Ken. Roger?","Roger Perlmutter","So with respect to the HCV combo Chris just as you have the opportunity of course to see the data that we presented at the European Meetings. 5172-8742 has very desirable properties as a fixed dose combination and in particular we showed really quite impressive sustainable logic responses in patients with \u2013 who are quite difficult to treat, those who have Cirrhosis, who are co-infected with HIV and the other thing to note about the combination of course is that that the drugs are \u2013 can be used in patients with substantial comordities which is really quite important it\u2019s something that I mentioned before. So as a single agent in those settings I think there is quite a lot of differentiation and obviously we are looking at every possible means of accelerating the process of completing the registration enabling trials and the registration of these drugs for we have breakthrough designation. And with respect to the market share I guess I\u2019ll speak for Adam.","Adam Schechter","No, Chris let me say that we are taking a hard look and we know this market pretty well. We think it\u2019s a very large opportunity that\u2019s been a play out over many years. It\u2019s not going to play out in just one or two years and it\u2019s going to play out over years across the globe. There are some drugs obviously that are ahead of us but we are not thinking that as a winner take all scenario in just a couple of years. So there is going to be plenty of opportunities for promising drugs in our pipeline as we move forward we will be talking a bit more about that next week.","Joseph Romanelli","Great, thanks Chris for the questions. Stephanie, next caller.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Just a follow-up on some of the M&A related questions Ken. I mean what\u2019s going on the industry is obviously very exciting companies are getting more aggressive, increasing their focus on areas that they are good at, getting out of businesses where there is less focus and you know as you said we are all anxiously waiting to see what happens to your animal health and consumer business. But beyond those two businesses which are relatively small contributors to your top line, are there other strategies that you can pursue, other carve-out opportunities that you see that would allow you to accelerate your shift and focus from primarily care to specialty biological and we are seeing a lot of this activity from many of your peers?","And then secondly, Peter to you. And again I wish my congratulations to you as well and best of luck in your next opportunity. But why wouldn\u2019t you raise at least the bottom-end of your guidance, very wide range at this point, you beat on the first quarter. Just what are \u2013 what should we be thinking about as we think about the rest of the year. You did say I think second-half would be stronger which is I think how we have always modeled it. But just wondering why you wouldn\u2019t take the opportunity to raise the bottom end of the guidance? Thanks.","Ken Frazier","Well, thanks Jami for the questions. Let me just go back to what we have said back in October, which is that we intended to sharpen our commercial and R&D focus as we move forward. You have seen some of the things that we have already done and I think we will continue to look for those opportunities to focus in those areas where we know that we can compete and make investments, where we know we can bring forward innovation PD1 and where we think we can run in the marketplace. So we\u2019ll continue to do that. There are going to be opportunities.","And at the same time, on the other side of the ledger we are also looking to M&A to enhance our pipeline through the right types of value creating opportunity that maybe out in the marketplace.","Peter Kellogg","Yeah, thanks Jami. This is Peter. See you are right. In the guidance range we gave for this year obviously we had a lot of factors incorporated. We recognized that we will be doing a certain matter of investment to launch into the pipeline. We understood that the AstraZeneca joint venture would go away and that was included in our calculation. We did know about the divestitures that we have announced so far, that was also put in there as well as the loss of exclusivity for certain products. The bottom end of the range though is defined actually by our trying to estimate what might happen with Venezuelan bolivar.","So quite frankly you can think of the high end of the range as sort of our performance ex that impact and the low end of the range is just trying to make some estimate as to what might be the case.","You know you recall the last year that devaluation took place in the first quarter and it was about $0.07 per share impact on us and we have tried to make some estimate. It\u2019s very hard to estimate what that is. So that\u2019s why we have left the range fairly wide. And as we see what happens in Venezuela we\u2019ll make \u2013 we\u2019ll adjust, we\u2019ll how kind of what that means to our P&L and if necessary or appropriate we will adjust our EPS range accordingly.","Joseph Romanelli","Okay, great. Thanks Jami. And Stephanie, can we open it up to the next caller please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Anderson with Bernstein.","Tim Anderson \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","On JANUVIA it seemed a little bit weaker I guess than what we and I think consensus were looking for in the U.S., I mean I believe more than 20% in price increases at least on a list price basis, maybe you don\u2019t report that obviously in the U.S. number. So I am wondering if you can just talk about net U.S. pricing trends going forward where the DPP-4 is.","And then internationally sales seem to be on the weaker side. I am wondering what the driver was of this. And then can you talk about the timing of top lining the [Chikos] trial. Can we think about that possibly as a third quarter event? And can you discuss the what-if scenario whereby [Chikos] may show heart failure signal like we have seen with one or more other DPP-4 inhibitors in that category?","Adam Schechter","So, Tim let me start with the JANUVIA performance and ex-ForEx we had 5% growth. And if you look at the U.S. we had 4% growth. We had a couple of points that came through on price and we had some increase in the inventory as well that was partially offset by a small decline in TRX volume. If you look at TRX volume in the U.S. we have seen this month better than the last month and last month better than the prior three months.","So we have certainly seen a stabilization of the TRX volume when you look it year-over-year and now we are looking to see if we can actually turn it around. If you look at new to brand share we are actually doing better and if you look at new to brand volume we have actually seen an increase in the month of March which is the first time we have seen an increase in the new to brand volume in a very long time. So it\u2019s still early yet but we feel we have certainly stabilized the U.S. now we are looking to see if we can actually grow TRXs again.","If you look outside the U.S. we had very good growth in the emerging markets and in Europe. If you look where we saw some softness it was in Japan and the reason why is because wholesalers stopped purchasing or reduced purchases prior to the re-pricing that took place and we have seen the wholesalers began to purchase again after that re-pricing occurred in March they are beginning to repurchase again in April.","Overall, the diabetes market continues to show reason for strong growth. If you look at the epidemiologic incidents, if you look at governments around the world and the importance that diabetes plays in the overall healthcare expenditure the markets certainly shows why it should grow. And we continue to invest strongly in the marketplace to now with the success outside the U.S. to do everything that we can to increase the success in the U.S.","Joseph Romanelli","Great, thanks Adam. Roger?","Roger Perlmutter","Yeah, Tim. With respect to the Chikos trial you know we continue on track with that trial for [14,000] patient study but I need to point out of course that it is eventually a trial and so those events ultimately drive timing. We are not seeing anything that suggests to us that there will be an acceleration in terms of the read out of that trial earlier this year.","So it continuous on track. And then with respect to any signals that one might see in that trial you know there has been an interest in the question of the specific finding of heart failure hospitalization based on other studies understandably, we have looked at it both in terms of our Pharmacovigilance activity as well as the data safety, monitoring board has looked at it with respect to the chikos trial because these adjudicated events.","At their most recent meeting which was at the end of year just a few months ago they reported no reason not to continue this study as planned and we have seen no evidence of a signal on our Pharmacovigilance study so we are not seeing anything there. We will wait to see the final data we are hopeful that the trial will complete at the end of the year.","Joseph Romanelli","Okay, great. Thanks Tim and Stephanie next caller.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Boris with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","John Boris \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thanks for taking the questions. Just have two. First question for Roger. If I look at your competitors PD1 clinical development plans by trying to piece those together from clinicaltrials.gov you can certainly see where there\u2019s certainly home in some indications where you might be able to use your breakthrough designation to be able to file additional early stage data if it comes out well.","So let me just focus on a couple of areas like hematology or head and neck as examples where you might be presenting data at ASCO. Is there an opportunity to potentially file those additional datasets with the FDA and by using your breakthrough status getting potentially an accelerated approval on those?","Second question has to do with M&A for Ken, certainly tax inversion very important not only company issue but certainly policy issue just your thoughts about large scale M&A versus franchise enhancing, either asset swaps and\/or franchise enhancing acquisitions versus large scale M&A. Just your thoughts on that and then your thoughts on tax inversion and then certainly want to wish the best to Peter Kellogg in his new endeavors and welcome Rob Davis and look forward to meet him. Thanks.","Ken Frazier","Well thanks for your questions John. You know I just have to repeat what I\u2019ve said before for us the major consolidation of the industry type has actually is not our preferred strategy. The best way for us to create sustainable value is through innovation and that\u2019s why we are focused on value added bolt-on opportunities as a priority for us.","With respect to the policy implications of inversions and business implications I think we\u2019ll just all have to wait and see how that plays out. And I don\u2019t have any particular comments on the strategies of the companies or what the government\u2019s reactions might be. So I think that\u2019s it from me.","Roger Perlmutter","Okay John again as I said before in response to Mark Schoenebaum, that we are eager to bring the benefits of MK-3475 to patients wherever we can demonstrate them. We have breakthrough designation in the Melanoma setting, based on the data that we obtained in patients who had advanced small number of refractory to other therapies. That\u2019s not a broad breakthrough designation for any cancer. And nevertheless opportunity exists always to pursue an accelerated approval where the results are favorable, where you have patients who are refractory to other treatments have no other options and where you can bring something of real benefit, meaningful benefit rapidly to the market place.","So we\u2019ll continue to look at that. We\u2019ll have the opportunity and talk about the totality of our program next week at the business review and we\u2019ll touch on a lot of these issues that you raised particularly with respect to squamous carcinomas, head and neck and homological exigencies.","Joseph Romanelli","Great thanks, John. Stefani next caller.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez \u2013 Leerink Swann","Thanks for the questions and again congratulations Peter and good luck in your future endeavors. Just very quickly as it relates to Roger, the question around HCV is there any chance in your view to see this product actually achieve an 8-week duration? And is there a material difference in your opinion between an 8-week and a 12-week duration for an HCV dual combination?","Second question, can you help us understand why you chose to work with Agenus for these Merck targets. So may be if you can just walk us through the Agenus transaction and help us understand why Merck wouldn\u2019t be the one generating those targets internally. And then lastly is there anything written into your immunotherapy collaboration announced earlier this year with Pfizer, Incyte and Amgen that will allow you to continue working together? And why I am asking this question is do you have something written into these agreement to prevent a pharma set like outcome where one company helps generate lots of great data and then another companies swoops and basically prevents you from advancing those combinations? Thanks.","Roger Perlmutter","Okay. Let me try and get out these here. First of all with respect to HCV treatment you know I think we are always, we and the entire community are always looking for more rapidly affected regiments that can in these patient populations and of course there are a lot of patients infected with hepatitis C virus. You know a sustained biologic response that can be achieved rapidly is a good thing, we and the entire community have moved that back substantially from where we were previously and we have the expectation that we are going to be able to continue to drive that process using our drugs and we\u2019ll have a chance to talk about the additional molecules that we have in the HCV space as the business review next week.","So I think that will be a good time to get into that. You asked about the Agenus transactions which we announced earlier this week. We\u2019ve been talking for some time now or quite a lot time with 4-Antibody which is a Swiss company that Agenus acquired in February. So the transaction really was one that we spent a long time talking with 4-Antibody about.","They have a technique that enables them to generate human antibodies of high affinity against a variety of different targets and we have worked with them to look at that technology and to see if we could apply it to some of the more difficult targets in the immuno-oncology space. This goes back a while that we\u2019ve been doing this. And so we were prepared to go forward with them to try and explore whether or not those antibodies could actually be used for, they of course were acquired by Agenus and that led to the transaction that was announced but no other special details I think to be concerned about there.","And then with respect can some one swoop in and take the data, I guess is the question from our ongoing collaborations with respect to combination parts. Really I don\u2019t think so. I mean these data will give us the opportunity to ultimately see which kinds of combination can be most effective with MK3475. And we hope if there are some very effective ones to commercialize MK3475 in combinations in those indications. So no special things were written in that would have an impact on that.","Joseph Romanelli","Okay. Great thanks Seamus for the questions. And Stefanie I think we have time for two more callers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen.","Steve Scala \u2013 Cowen & Company","I have two questions. On the Q4 our call the company said that H1 EPS would be lower than H2 and of course that was repeated today. But at that point it was also said that Q1 would be the lowest quarter of the year. Is Q1 also still expected to be the lowest quarter of the year? Or if not is Q2 now expected to be the lowest quarter of the year?","And secondly I am just curious what are your plans for full Remicade data what meeting is being targeted and will we get important new data at the meeting next week? Thank you","Joseph Romanelli","So Peter why don\u2019t you go ahead.","Peter Kellogg","Thanks Steve, for the question. Steve, everything you said is correct relative to second half still remains at the higher EPS quarter. Really what happened in the first quarter was that our expenses came in even more favorably than we anticipated. I think everything else was pretty much in line with our plans and our thinking. Some of those are true efficiencies that will help us and some of them will be things that is timing related that will show up in the second half of the year.","Very specifically to your second question which is Q2, we didn\u2019t actually provide any specific update on that, so I am going to hesitate to do it right now. But in general I think you can kind of see that the operating expense benefit allowed Q1 to look a little better and so I think we are very much on track to be in the range for the full year. So we haven\u2019t given specific guidance for Q2.","Ken Frazier","Great thank you Peter. And Steve with respect to Remicade we do have the full dataset in house. And so we are in the process of now looking through that, cleaning up that dataset and evaluating it with \u2013 assuming things go well, I hope we will be in a position where we can say something at the business review about it because we have the data set and that\u2019s what we are trying to do and then we\u2019ll be able to give a full discussion of what our plans are with respect to that molecule book. We need to make our decisions here first.","Joseph Romanelli","Great thanks Steve. And I think Stefanie we have time for one last caller.","Operator","Your final question comes from Mark Goodman with UBS.","Mark Goodman \u2013 UBS","Peter congrats from me as well, good luck. Just a follow on to the last comments you are making about expenses. Can you give us a flavor for the beat was more in efficiencies or was it that your timing of things, can you, was it 50-50. Just give us a sense on how we should think about the spending and the gating throughout the year will be helpful. And then on the allergy tales I was kind of curious what the strategy was for that product. I mean no one really talks about the product and then your level of excitement and obviously the doctors make money on these shots, I was curious how what the strategy is with this product?","Peter Kellogg","So let me take your OpEx question first Mark thanks. So there is lot of moving parts obviously in the operations of companies the size of Merck. Let me take first R&D I think R&D in general Rogers\u2019 managing quite a broad portfolio. I think there is probably more timing related. That said he\u2019s still targeting to be below prior year overall but he is got a lot of \u2013 so there is \u2013 I won\u2019t speak up for Roger but a lot of things gearing up in the focus areas both in oncology as well as hepatitis, there is lot of clinical work going on.","In SG&A I think we have made a lot of effort that we announced last fall to take to kind of retune our cost structure and take headcount out as well as take some operating expenses out that\u2019s a very global effort. I think that we made a big effort to try to move ahead of schedule if you will, we went through this year. So I think so that\u2019s very broad based in SG&A.","That said as we go through this year we do anticipate we already know we\u2019ve got a couple of launches we anticipate perhaps more and so we are recognizing we have to make the investments to really launch these products extremely well. So I would think in terms of overall efficiency in SG&A and then some very focused efforts to drive growth opportunities as we go through the second half of the year.","Adam Schechter","And Mark to answer your question regarding GRASTEK and RAGWITEK our launch strategy is really focusing on introducing those two products to specialist audience of allergists and \u2013 doctors. We are trying to do that where we get access quickly with the payers and we have some education and market development work that we have to do. I think that we missed the grass season this year so we\u2019ll have to try to do a lot of work to get ready for the grass season next year.","But as you look at the overall market there is about 25 million people that have severe allergy, moderate allergies in the United States and only about 3 million people get immuno-therapy shots today. But if you look at that there\u2019s still we estimate about 3 million people that refuse shots all together. So the 3 million that refuse shots are definitely a target for us. But of the 3 million that get shot it\u2019s estimated about 50% of those stop getting their shots after one year. So that will be another target audience for us as we move forward.","So every launch is important to us. I am actually heading up to a launch meeting this week and we are looking forward to doing a lot of market development work as we go through this year to prepare for next.","Joseph Romanelli","Great, thanks Adam and I turn it over to Ken.","Ken Frazier","Let me just summarize very quickly. So in the first quarter we ended up more or less where we expected to be and we are on track for the full year. We saw a solid growth from Januvia immunology vaccines and Isentress and we are also seeing strong progress on our initiative to sharpen the focus on our commercial and R&D expenditures including evaluating what assets are core to our strategy. So more exciting thing for us as we look to the future we see steady and substantial progress in the pipeline. And so we are looking forward to meeting all of you at the business briefing on May 6th so that we can talk about our future in more detail. Thank you very much and we look forward to seeing you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect."],"13693":["Merck & Co., Inc.

My name is Darla, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Merck's Q1 2016 sales and earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Teri Loxam. Please go ahead.","Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Darla, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Merck's first quarter 2016 conference call. Today I'm joined by: Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; Adam Schechter, President of Global Human Health and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Labs.","Before I turn the call over to Ken, I want to point out a couple of items. First, you will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items. You should note that we've excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provided a reconciliation of these items in Table 2 of our press release. We've also provided a table to help you understand the sales results in the quarter for the business units and products, which can be found on Table 3 of our press release.","Second, I would like to remind you that some of the statements we make during today's call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current belief of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.","Our SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2015 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, and you can see our SEC filings as well as today's earnings release on Merck.com.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Teri. Good morning. Thank you all for joining the call today.","We're off to a good start this year with our first quarter performance. Our KEYTRUDA program expanded as we continued to launch this important cancer medicine around the world. Also in the first quarter, we launched our new hepatitis C medicine, ZEPATIER.","In addition to the ongoing product launches, our key inline brands performed well, particularly JANUVIA, which continues to command predominant share within the DPP-4 class. Adam will provide context on this shortly.","We remain committed to delivering long-term growth and shareholder value. To do so, we will stay true to our goal of becoming the premier research intensive global biopharmaceutical company, bringing forward medically important products that address many of the world's greatest health needs. And above all, it is critical that we do this in a sustainable manner that enables us to continuously reinvest in R&D.","Business development remains one of our most important priorities, and we are very actively engaged in finding the best external innovation that will help grow our portfolio and pipeline. We are confident that our scientific discernment coupled with financial discipline will allow us to identify and acquire the right assets at the right valuation to create long-term value for shareholders, consistent with our innovation strategy.","Before I conclude, let me also emphasize that we are fully engaged in the challenging policy environment that our industry experiences now. We are actively addressing the key policy issues that can have an impact on our ability to fund the discovery and development of the next generation of innovative and differentiated medicines and vaccines, most notably pricing and tax reform in the United States. We are engaging key stakeholders in the healthcare environment to seek constructive solutions and to ensure that they understand the therapeutic and economic value Merck's products and business operations provide.","In closing, we remain committed to our innovation strategy and our focus on advancing and augmenting our broad pipeline, both through internal and external means, as well as driving marketplace success with our launches and key inline brands.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.","Robert M. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone.","Our performance in the first quarter reflects our focus on execution and continued productivity improvements. We again delivered P&L leverage, with growth excluding exchange on both the top and bottom lines.","Total company revenues were $9.3 billion, a decrease of 1% year over year. Excluding the impact of exchange, first quarter revenues grew 3%, driven by both our Human Health and Animal Health businesses. Venezuela negatively impacted Q1 revenues by approximately $240 million, reflecting the reduction of our operations in the country. As a reminder, we recorded $625 million of sales in Venezuela in 2015, which were more weighted to the first half of the year, so the year-over-year impact will be greatest in the first two quarters of this year.","Looking to the other parts of the P&L, non-GAAP gross margin was 77% in the quarter, an increase of 50 basis points versus the first quarter of 2015. Lower discards were the biggest driver of the year-over-year improvement. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $3.9 billion was 3% lower year over year, but roughly flat excluding foreign exchange favorability. Higher promotional spend behind our new products drove a slight increase in marketing and administrative, while lower licensing expenses contributed to a decline in research and development.","Taken together, we earned $0.89 per share on a non-GAAP basis in the first quarter, delivering 10% growth excluding exchange, which reflects our continued commitment to delivering a leveraged P&L.","Turning now to our outlook for the rest of the year, we are narrowing and raising our revenue and EPS guidance for 2016. While we are experiencing more favorable exchange rates versus our original guidance, we are facing a few headwinds, in particular, the entry of generic NASONEX in the United States earlier than originally assumed, which we expect will partially offset the exchange rate favorability this year.","We now expect full-year 2016 revenues to be between $39 billion and $40.2 billion. This reflects an approximately 2% negative impact in foreign currency at mid-April rates. We continue to expect our non-GAAP 2016 product gross margin and operating expenses to be roughly in line with 2015, and we still anticipate the non-GAAP tax rate for the full year to be between 21.5% and 22.5%.","In terms of our 2016 EPS outlook, we are raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance range from $3.65 to $3.77. This reflects an approximately two percentage point negative impact from foreign currency at mid-April rates.","To summarize, we demonstrated strong performance, leveraging top line growth to deliver 10% growth in non-GAAP EPS excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We benefited from the contribution of new product launches while continuing to sustain growth in our key franchises and driving operational improvements across the company.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Adam.","Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President & President-Global Human Health","Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. This morning I'll provide highlights on the Global Human Health performance for the first quarter, and my comments will be on a constant currency basis.","We are off to a solid start to the year. Total Human Health sales reached $8.1 billion, growing 2%. And we drove growth across our core areas of diabetes, vaccines, hospital specialty care, and oncology. What I'll do now is highlight a few of our key franchises and product launches, and I'll start with primary care.","The JANUVIA franchise had a strong quarter, growing 4% globally. In the United States, sales grew 9%, driven primarily by volume increases and some benefit from customer buying patterns. Outside of the U.S., we saw strong growth in Europe and Japan, offset by emerging markets, which was impacted by Venezuela. Excluding Venezuela, JANUVIA franchise sales grew 5% outside of the U.S. First quarter results for JANUVIA demonstrate that we can continue to grow volume and maintain strong market share of about 75% in the United States and 65% globally. We continue to expect global JANUVIA franchise growth ex-exchange in 2016.","Now I'll move on to our vaccine business. Sales of our vaccine portfolio grew 1% and reached about $1.3 billion, on steady growth from GARDASIL and pediatric vaccines, partially offset by declines in our adult shingles vaccine, ZOSTAVAX. ZOSTAVAX sales declined in the first quarter, resulting from a weaker flu season in the U.S., which means that less people go to get vaccinated in general, but also the recent changes to ACIP [Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices] recommendations for pneumococcal vaccines. We are actively working with customers to help them navigate the reimbursement for ZOSTAVAX, and expect this to be less of a hurdle over time.","Global GARDASIL franchise sales grew this quarter, on continued strength from GARDASIL 9 launch in the U.S. We are encouraged by the recent CDC publication that reported a significant decrease in vaccine-type HPV prevalence since the introduction of HPV vaccination in the United States. The reduction was 64% in females age 14 to 19 and 34% in females age 20 to 24. If you consider that this report shows an impact only through 2012 and does not yet include males, it becomes apparent that we really can make a difference to help prevent certain HPV-related cancers in the United States.","Next in hospital and specialty care, our acute care portfolio performed well in the quarter on steady growth from antibiotics, antifungals, and BRIDION. We are also pleased to be adding to our specialty care business with the launch of ZEPATIER. Sales in the first quarter were $50 million. While we're still early in the launch, we are seeing positive signs that ZEPATIER will play an important role in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C.","Our team is working to secure access for ZEPATIER, with conversations currently ongoing with many different public and private payers. The addition of ZEPATIER to the formulary at the Veterans Administration and with other customers reinforces our belief that our payer and our pricing strategy will maximize revenue and market share, and it will also broaden and accelerate patient access. Customers value ZEPATIER's profile, which offers high cure rates across a diverse group of patients, and we continue to be enthusiastic about the opportunity for ZEPATIER.","Finally in oncology, we see significant potential for KEYTRUDA, which positions us as a global leader in immuno-oncology. In the first quarter, sales reached approximately $250 million, and they continue to be driven by our melanoma indications as well as early traction in the U.S. in lung cancer. We are working to integrate PD-L1 testing as part of the routine treatment of lung cancer by continuing to demonstrate the value testing brings to physicians, to payers, and to patients. Testing rates in the United States continue to increase, which is important not only for our second-line indication, but we believe also for when we have a first-line indication.","We also see very strong performance outside of the U.S., which represented nearly half of first quarter KEYTRUDA sales. We are launching in melanoma in approximately 50 markets globally, and in some markets we are the market leader despite being second to launch. Given the strong survival results we've demonstrated in melanoma and second-line lung cancer, the early data we've seen in more than 20 cancer types, as well as the breadth and the depth of KEYTRUDA's development program, we remain confident that KEYTRUDA will become foundational to the treatment of cancer over time.","In closing, we're off to a good start in 2016. This year we'll have to offset generic penetration of products including NASONEX and CUBICIN. However, our investments in JANUVIA, in KEYTRUDA, and in ZEPATIER and other core areas are delivering results and positioning us for future growth.","Now I'll turn the call over to Roger.","Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - Executive Vice President & President-Merck Research Laboratories","Thanks, Adam.","The momentum that our clinical development and regulatory groups established last year continues in 2016. I'll briefly review the highlights of the first quarter.","As has already been mentioned, beginning in January we obtained regulatory approval for ZEPATIER in Canada, the United States, and Switzerland. In speaking with hepatologists and infectious disease specialists, there's general enthusiasm for the high cure rates observed with ZEPATIER and the ability to use ZEPATIER in patients with compromised renal function, including patients undergoing hemodialysis. Public health organizations are increasingly embracing a goal of large-scale elimination of hepatitis C infection. And we have been developing data, some of which we presented at the Liver meetings in Barcelona last month, documenting the ability of ZEPATIER to assist in this process, including in very difficult to treat patients who suffer from opioid addiction.","As Adam indicated, we have successfully launched ZEPATIER in the United States and are seeking approval in many markets around the world. In the course of our European review for ZEPATIER, the European Medicines Agency cited Merck's third-party manufacturer for issues largely related to inadequate record keeping and the need for improvement in their quality management systems. We're working assiduously with regulators to resolve these issues.","I should note that we do not believe that the problems identified at our third-party manufacturer affect the safety, efficacy, or quality specifications of the product, and we do not believe that these problems will affect the supply to the U.S. market. Nevertheless, we take all matters related to good manufacturing practices very seriously, and we're working with regulatory agencies and the manufacturer to resolve these issues as expeditiously as possible.","We continue to believe that EU approval can be achieved according to the midyear timeline that we previously disclosed. However, our European launch will be delayed until the fourth quarter or perhaps until the end of the first quarter of 2017, depending on how quickly these matters can be resolved.","While the registration process with ZEPATIER continues, we are also completing Phase 2b studies of MK-3682, our uridinal nucleoside polymerase inhibitor, when used in combination with ZEPATIER or in combination with another advanced NS5A inhibitor, MK-8408. Data from these studies which will emerge over the next few months will permit definitive selection of the appropriate registration-enabling regimens that will provide additional options for the estimated 150 million people around the world who are infected with the hepatitis C virus.","During the first quarter, our studies of KEYTRUDA also advanced significantly. In April, we announced that the FDA has accepted our filing on a Priority Review basis for the use of KEYTRUDA in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer following platinum-based chemotherapy, with a PDUFA date in early August. This filing makes use of the unit dosing of 200 milligrams every three weeks. We have shown that this dose yields exposures comparable to those observed using weight-based dosing, and unit dosing obviously relieves providers of the responsibility of calculating patient-specific dose volumes.","Our head and neck cancer filing is reinforced by an exceptionally broad array of ongoing studies in this disease, including a controlled second-line study, the KEYNOTE-040 study, and our first-line study, KEYNOTE-048, which will provide data in 2017. We're also testing the use of KEYTRUDA in combination with irradiation, with radiation plus chemotherapy with the TVEC oncolytic virus in collaboration with our colleagues at Amgen, and with an IDO1 inhibitor in collaboration with our colleagues at Incyte.","A substantial amount of important new data from our KEYTRUDA program will be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meetings next month, including results in head and neck cancer patients who have failed both platinum and rituximab therapy, and the long-term survival data in melanoma patients from our original KEYNOTE-001 study.","Also in April, we announced that the FDA granted a fourth Breakthrough Designation for KEYTRUDA in the treatment of classical Hodgkin's lymphoma. As Margaret Shipp and colleagues from the Dana Farber Cancer Research Center showed in a paper published last month in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, amplification of the chromosomal locus, including both PD-L1 and PD-L2 ligands, is very common in Hodgkin's lymphoma, and may represent a critical factor in the malignant transformation of Reed-Sternberg cells, the characteristic cell type in this cancer. This observation may help to explain why the very high response rates following KEYTRUDA treatment in Hodgkin's lymphoma patients are observed.","Meanwhile, we continue to pursue registration for KEYTRUDA in second-line lung cancer in Europe, and our KEYNOTE-010 study which will improve understanding of how best to use KEYTRUDA in this disease, is under review in the United States. You will recall that in the KEYNOTE-010 trial, KEYTRUDA treatment meaningfully improved overall survival in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer in any histology where tumors expressed the PD-L1 biomarker in 1% or more of tumor cells as compared to what can be achieved using conventional docetaxel chemotherapy. Our first-line study of KEYTRUDA, KEYNOTE-024, comparing KEYTRUDA treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with PD-L1 strongly positive tumors, remains on track to deliver data at midyear.","Finally, progress continues across a broad range of other programs. Bezlotoxumab, our therapy designed to reduce recurrences of C. difficile associated enterocolitis, achieved Priority Review designation from the FDA, with a PDUFA date in July. The FDA will hold an Advisory Committee meeting to review the bezlotoxumab filing on June 9, and our file is also under review in the European Union.","Clinical data are beginning to emerge for ertugliflozin which will support our comprehensive filing for this new molecular entity as both a single agent and in combination with JANUVIA or metformin by the end of the year.","Separately, the long-awaited adjudication of our Phase 3 odanacatib data is now almost complete. With these data in hand, we will at last be in a position to assemble regulatory dossiers supporting the registration of this important once-weekly treatment for osteoporosis. And among the many programs for which considerable interest is expressed when I meet with external clinicians and scientists is our Phase 3 trial setting letermovir as prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus activation in patients receiving bone marrow transplants. We expect to have data in house from this study by the end of the third quarter.","Now I'll turn the call over to Teri.","Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks, Roger. Darla, I think we're ready to go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Geoff Meacham with Barclays.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Just on ZEPATIER, I wonder if you can go into a little bit more detail about where you are with commercial formularies and what opportunities you have to expand that prior to the cycle next year. And then also on Hep C on next-gen regimens, how much value do you guys place on a shorter four-week regimen in terms of differentiation in the market? Thank you.","Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President & President-Global Human Health","Hi, Geoff. This is Adam. And I'll start off with the update on ZEPATIER regarding how we're doing in the marketplace. I'll start by saying we really are pleased with the progress that we're making since the launch. We're still early in the launch, but we have been working really hard to secure access. And we have conversations ongoing across all segments, many different customers. Many of them are for access in 2017, but some of those such as the VA we're hoping to have access sometime in 2016. So it's still a little bit too early to give you exact accounts and names of accounts, but I can tell you that we feel good about potential access for 2017, and then we'll see where we end up for 2016, but I do think that there is opportunity there.","And then if you look at how we're approaching the marketplace, we really are focusing on having access, and it's important that we have parity with the competitors. So we're spending a lot of time trying to get access at parity across the different segments in the United States so that there's physician and patient choice.","Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations","Roger, do you want to answer the...","Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - Executive Vice President & President-Merck Research Laboratories","I think with respect to shorter regimens, we'd love to be in a position to provide treatment that would massively shorten the regimen because adherence is a problem in this patient population, and many patients who are infected with hepatitis C lead somewhat chaotic lives. Unfortunately, I think there's really very little data to support the use of an oral direct-acting antiviral regimen at four weeks, and there are reasons to be concerned that that might not be possible. Over time, additional advances in other approaches, which could for example involve long-duration implantable therapies, that sort of thing, could improve that. And there are of course other kinds of intervention, for example, at the transcriptional level, that could help that. But right now, four weeks seems like a reach.","Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks, Roger. Darla, can we go on to the next question, please?","Operator","It's from Steve Scala with Cowen.","Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you so much, a question for Dr. Perlmutter. All companies are analyzing I-O data with the FDA-required Cox stratified proportional hazard statistical test. However, Bristol implies that it analyzes I-O data in a unique way, which emphasizes the non-proportional aspect of the I-O curve. And I guess in support of their view, they have stopped more studies early than any other company. And it's also true that Bristol's studies generally are longer than competitors' studies. Does Merck understand what Bristol is doing? Does Merck believe it is doing the same thing? And if not, how is what Merck is doing different? Thank you.","Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - Executive Vice President & President-Merck Research Laboratories","Hey, Steve. There's no mystery here really. The","mechanisms for statistical analysis of these kinds of studies have been refined over a period of many decades. And while the statistical literature continues to advance in ways that are quite intriguing, the reality is that we have a lot of data based on all of the prior studies that we've done with KEYTRUDA and with OPDIVO, the studies that have been done and published with OPDIVO as well that provide a substantial amount of positive predictive value. So in a Bayesian sense, one can predict outcomes fairly comfortably, and we know therefore we can put that information into our power calculations. We have pretty good understanding of where we're going and when we have to look. Of course, you can get surprises in different tumor types.","But I guess one thing to stress is the general consistency of the responses that we've seen across a very large number of tumor types, both with respect to response rates and durability. So we don't find it mysterious. I think the explanation for the early stopping of the Bristol-Myers studies is largely related to the size of the studies more than anything else and there's nothing special about non-proportional analyses.","Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks, Roger. Darla, next question, please.","Operator","It's from Tim Anderson with Bernstein.","Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. On KEYTRUDA, so obviously you and Bristol will both have first-line data this year in lung and that is in patients that need to be tested for the biomarker. Bristol of course points out that their testing encompasses a much greater proportion of patients than your testing. I'm wondering how you see that playing out commercially. Won't there be an advantage in their favor, the fact that it will be applicable to more patients? Do you think that's going to make a difference?","And then what were sales of KEYTRUDA in the quarter in lung, so what proportion of sales were in lung? And then were there any wholesaler shifts or timing impact of purchasing that could have impacted what the results were? If I look at U.S. sales, they were flat versus Q4. Internationally, they continue to ramp. Is that reflective of demand in both geographies, or were there some timing issues?","Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President & President-Global Human Health","Hi, Tim. This is Adam. So if you look at KEYTRUDA, as we said, we reported about $250 million of sales for the quarter, so we're now trending if you just look at about a $1 billion product just based on where we are today. About half the sales were outside the U.S., half the sales in the U.S. And we continue to see growth in the U.S. There are really not inventory issues to any large degree for this product, frankly.","If you look at where sales are coming from, the vast majority of the sales are still coming from melanoma indications. And if you look at that, a lot of it is still coming in second-line, although we see first-line continuing to grow. Internationally, the sales are coming primarily, obviously, from our melanoma indication.","As you start to think about lung, we are seeing increases in the number of physicians that are testing patients now. And a lot of those increases are actually coming from patients with first-line lung being tested. So the fact that we continue to encourage testing I believe is only going to help us ultimately when we launch in first-line lung. And then the first thing that you want to do is you want to see who gets to market first, and I think that that always matters. So let's see who gets to market first in first-line lung and that will be an important milestone.","Secondarily, as you said, we have to see what the cutoff points are. But in addition to that, even with cutoff points, we also have to see what the guidelines say and how the reimbursement works. So I feel pretty good about where we are today. I feel optimistic about first-line lung. I can tell you I'm thrilled that we're only one of two PD-L1s in the marketplace today, and I think that sets us up for very good growth in the future.","Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks, Adam. Darla, next question, please.","Operator","It's from Colin Bristow with Bank of America.","Colin N. Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. So maybe just switching to anacetrapib, can you update us on your level of optimism for the CV outcomes study in light of the data we saw for Lilly's evacetrapib? And can you perhaps comment on the baseline HDLs in the involved population at least relative to Lilly's ACCELERATE study, since this is potentially an important consideration for the realization of a treatment effect? Thanks.","Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - Executive Vice President & President-Merck Research Laboratories","Hi, Colin. It's Roger. So my feeling about the anacetrapib","study really isn't much changed. We knew, of course, about Lilly's evacetrapib study. It's nice to have the data now in much more detail. The differences between the two studies have been discussed in terms of the patient populations that were enrolled and in terms of the duration of the studies, which the follow-up duration is important since you do expect that as you manipulate lipid profiles, the effects should accrue over time. So that's probably the biggest impact.","I think that when we look at this, because of the dramatic lowering in LDL cholesterol, the dramatic increase in HDL cholesterol, the changes in Lp (a), the expectation is that patients who are receiving anacetrapib should do better in terms of major cardiovascular events. That's what we're testing. It's a 30,000-patient study. And we're going to have the data next year and we'll have a chance to look and see. We're approaching the end of the treatment period, and at some point the clouds will part and the sun will shine and we'll have a chance to see what the landscape looks like. At the moment, there's no point in speculating. This study is nearly complete.","Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations","Next question, please, Darla?","Operator","It's from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking the questions. Apologies if I missed this, but did the extra calendar days in 1Q benefit the quarter in any way?","And, Adam, do you think that PD-L1 testing will be restricted to a specific test by treatment, or do you anticipate that it will basically be at the discretion of the labs and that we will eventually see that the labs basically concentrate towards one that's the preferred one, arguably the more sensitive test? Thank you.","Robert M. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Alex. This is Rob. To your question on the impact of the days of sales, we did see some benefit from that impact in the U.S., but it was largely offset by channel, so it did not materially change our results.","Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President & President-Global Human Health","And with respect to PD-L1 testing, first of all, what we're saying is that PD-L1 testing is not specified in the label of the products for any certain test, so it just says if you have a PD-L1 positive patient in the label. So therefore, it doesn't matter what test the lab uses in order to designate whether the test is PD-L1 positive or not. I don't think that is going to change. I think it will be up to the labs to decide which testing that they use and then how they determine it to be positive or not.","I think that there are two other points that are important. First of all, we're already seeing about 30% of patients with lung being tested, and about 70% of those are in first-line. The other thing that's important is that when patients are being tested, if it's positive right now, the vast majority of those patients are going to KEYTRUDA. So therefore, I do think that the testing irrespective of what test they use is occurring more often and actually over time could be helpful.","Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations","Next question, please, Darla.","Operator","It comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, a few questions. Ken, first to you, I was intrigued that in your press release you highlighted business development as a high priority. If you'll recall, at our CEO conference back in January, you highlighted your high priority to complete deals, being more aggressive this year, moving up the risk curve. Can you provide a little bit more granularity as to specifically what you're looking for? Clearly, we've seen a major derating of valuations of biotech stocks, yet we haven't really seen any motion or rumors or anything out of Merck. What are you looking for specifically? Are they late-stage assets? Are they early-stage assets? What compelled you to highlight that early on in your press release? That's my first question.","And second questions are for you, Roger and Adam, if you want to comment. There's been a lot of focus on this call today on monotherapy. Obviously, we have first-line lung monotherapy. But our expectation is that monotherapy is rapidly going to move to combination therapy. And as you know, oncologists believe that the best way to treat cancer is with cocktail or combination therapy. And clearly, your competitors have all pursued combinations either with I-O or chemo combo. So just you have pursued a monotherapy strategy and are behind the curve on combination. What is your strategy to catch up? And then just as a corollary to that question, the market wisdom is that you have to own a combination to speed them to market. What is your strategy to do that? Thanks very much.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Jami, thanks for the question. Let me start by saying what I was trying to say earlier this year and what I'm saying today are exactly the same thing. We feel it's very important for us to access the best external innovation, and we're very actively engaged with companies that we think have good science. You haven't seen the deals come through quite yet, but that doesn't mean that we're not very, very much engaged in active discussions with those companies.","You mentioned the issue around valuation. I think that a lot of those companies are looking at their current stock prices and trying to decide whether those are indicative of where they're going to be in the future. So I think those boards or those management teams are going through the process of letting the new reality, if you will, settle in with them. But from our perspective, I guess what I'm trying to highlight is, first of all, we have a strong balance sheet and we can go after deals across the whole spectrum, early, middle, and late-stage compounds. And we will look for those deals consistent with good science and financial discipline. So we want to be aggressive in going after deals, but we want to do deals that create value for our shareholders.","Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - Executive Vice President & President-Merck Research Laboratories","Right. And, Jami, on the general approach to how one treats cancer, I actually don't agree with your assessment of our strategy, so let me try and reinterpret it a little bit for you. First of all, what I've always said was in order to understand the benefits of combination therapy, you have to understand how monotherapy behaves. And we launched a very broad program in monotherapy with more than 30 different tumor types and many lines of therapy. But we've not shorted the combination studies.","If you look on ClinicalTrials.gov right now, about something over 270 studies on ClinicalTrials.gov with KEYTRUDA. I haven't checked today. But more than 100 of those are combination studies. And they include studies that are potentially registration enabling. If you look at the KEYNOTE-189 study, for example, which will be delivering data next year in combination with chemotherapy, in addition to of course a combination with chemotherapy data that we've already presented, there's quite a lot going on in combinations. And we have combinations with radiation therapy, combinations with immunotherapies, combinations with traditional chemotherapies, and combinations with targeted chemotherapies. And in addition, we have in the clinic GITR, LAG-3, IL-10, and cCAM, which are our own Phase 1 programs that provide immuno-oncology molecules that could potentially be used in combination.","So in totality, we have a very, very broad combination program, which includes both things that we own and things that either shouldn't be owned because they're in essence generic or that we're doing in collaborations with others. And for example, in the IDO program we're both collaborating with Incyte, and we have our own programs that we own as well, so a lot of work going on in combinations. Our goal absolutely is to identify the very best possible regimens from the many thousands that you and I have discussed previously, the many thousands of regimens that potentially we could employ in treating cancer patients.","Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President & President-Global Human Health","And, Jami, if you think about it, both Roger and myself and our teams work very closely identifying potential combinations and uses. And with regard to having to own them all, I don't think you have to, particularly if they can't be combined into a similar dosage form or have the same type of dosing regimen. And I get asked that all the time in diabetes for many years where people said don't you have to have an insulin and a GLP-1 for JANUVIA to be successful? And we've shown that JANUVIA can be successful even if we don't have some of those combinations.","It doesn't mean that we don't want a GLP-1 potentially or other types of diabetes medicines, but we look at those as their own opportunities. At the same time, the reason that we think that the combination of our SGLT2 with JANUVIA can be successful is because you can put them into one tablet with the same dosing regimen. So that's the way we look at the combinations, and I think that our strategy is a good one.","Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks. Darla, next question, please.","Operator","It's from Andrew Baum with Citi.","Amalan R. Selvarajah - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Hi, this is Amalan Selvarajah on behalf of Andrew. Thanks for taking the question. I have just one left. How does the pricing and rebate dynamic on your biosimilars work between you and your partners? And more specifically, does Merck have the ultimate decision, or can Samsung advise the list price? Thanks.","Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President & President-Global Human Health","So this is Adam. And if you look at Europe for the pricing","and rebates on biosimilars, it's determined by the Merck team and our European team. And what we've done is we've been very successful competing for patients that are on existing therapy, but we have lost many new patient starts. Hence, you see a decline year over year for REMICADE, and we expect that that decline will continue over time. But what we see right now is that existing patients are able to maintain on therapy in many of the European markets.","Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks, Adam. Next question, please, Darla.","Operator","It's from Tony Butler with Guggenheim Securities.","Charles Anthony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yes, thanks very much. Roger, back to an earlier comment you made on IDO, I wanted to explore IOmet and the acquisition rationale for that relative to what you had with your partner and where you're going in melanoma. I assume only with IOmet you were thinking about a broader set of tumors. Was that the rationale?","And second, Rob, to generic mometasone for NASONEX, how much pressure does that put on your gross margin? And more importantly, because that's a reasonably large product, would your tax rate not actually see a benefit because of the change earlier than you would have expected, or is it just marginal? Thank you.","Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - Executive Vice President & President-Merck Research Laboratories","Tony, thanks for the question. On IOmet, we have data that we have presented for the IDO1 inhibitor from Incyte in combination with KEYTRUDA that is very suggestive with regard to a treatment effect in melanoma. And one of the good things about it is that the adverse experience profile for the combination of the IDO1 inhibitor along with KEYTRUDA really looks very favorable.","With that in mind, we wanted to explore more fully the landscape of IDO1 and PD-L1 inhibitors. We have an opportunity with IOmet to gain access to actually quite a large set of starting materials and new chemistry, which enables us to think about how we would design an optimal molecule that could be used in a whole variety of different tumor types. We have a very good collaborative relationship with Incyte, and we're eager to see those programs advance just as quickly as possible for the benefit of patients. But we think there's some running room as well and an opportunity for us to use our chemical insights potentially to improve treatment regimens in that regard. And that was the driving force behind it.","Robert M. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And with regards to your question about generic NASONEX, if you look at NASONEX, it is a high gross margin product for us, but it does have a fair bit of discounting. So it will be a slight drag in the back part of the year to our gross margin, but it was fully reflected in the guidance we gave on gross margin. And as you look at the tax rate, this really has no meaningful impact to our tax rate to speak of.","Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks, Rob. Next question, please, Darla?","Operator","It's from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks very much. I just had two quick ones here. One, just coming back to business development. I think you used the term bolt-on acquisitions in your release. Can you just help us understand a little bit how large a deal could be and still considered to be a bolt-on for Merck? I guess, for example, would Cubist or something a bit larger have been considered a bolt-on, or should we think about Merck targeting some smaller transactions here?","My second question is on ZEPATIER and just the HCV marketplace in general. I think one of your competitors cited some pricing pressures in the space emerging again this year. I guess how do you see the pricing environment evolving over time with three main players in the space? And I guess specifically, should we think about price continuing to erode here over time, where you'll get","more access, but we should think about a downward trend on price overall? Thanks very much.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So starting on the business development question, thanks, Chris. When I talk about bolt-on acquisitions, I think I'm not signaling anything specific with respect to the size of the deal any more than I was earlier with the stage of development. We want to find the best assets at the best valuation to help us grow our pipeline going forward. And so I guess what I'm signaling is I'm not focused on a large consolidation type merger such as we've seen in the industry in the past. But I also think that bolt-on acquisitions can be larger than, for example, a Cubist. It depends on what the company brings, what their pipeline brings, what level of scientific innovation they have internally, and how we believe it can complement our portfolio and pipeline going forward.","Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President & President-Global Human Health","And, Chris, this is Adam. As we look at the hepatitis C market, we continue to be optimistic about our potential within the market. I think that price will continue to be under pressure over time in this market. But despite that, I think the lower prices have expanded access to some degree. And I think a good example of that is the VA and the removal of the fibrosis score restrictions. So there will continue to be price pressure in the marketplace. We will continue, as I said before, to try to get parity access. But we have to see where our competition and where the payers go. And the more they try to push for restricted access or exclusive formularies, we have to watch that closely.","Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great, thanks. Darla, next question.","Operator","It's from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks. Can you hear me?","Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations","Yes, we can, Seamus.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay, great, thanks for the questions, a couple of quick questions. Just, Roger, can you clarify the update on ZEPATIER in the EU with regard to the manufacturing issues that you mentioned? I think I missed a little bit of the facts there.","The second question, again, Roger, you mentioned a number of internally developed assets and collaborations. Can you talk a little bit about GITR? We're hearing and seeing a lot of additional companies pursue this target. Enthusiasm amongst thought leaders is building. But there are questions about this target as to whether or not, A), it's an agonist at all, and also how efficiently one can actually develop antibodies to this target.","And my last question is for the team overall. In terms of the areas of greatest interest for","business development, should we anticipate that your focus is mostly on oncology specifically, or how broadly and what areas are of greatest interest to you on the BD side? Thanks.","Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations","Why don't we start with Roger?","Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - Executive Vice President & President-Merck Research Laboratories","So, Seamus, just to reiterate that in the course of our European review, the European Medicines Agency cited Merck's third-party manufacturer for issues that were largely related to inadequate record keeping and the need for improvement in their quality management systems. The problems do not affect, we do not believe, the safety, efficacy, or quality specifications of the product, and hence we don't believe the problems will affect the supply to the U.S. market. But we take these good manufacturing practice issues very seriously, and we're working with both regulatory agencies and the contract manufacturer to resolve the issues as expeditiously as possible.","Secondly, with respect to GITR, as you know, our program has been in the clinic for quite some time, but we have been advancing it very slowly because of concerns on our part and on the part of regulators too. We share these concerns that an agonist antibody could stimulate a fairly profound immune activation response, and those responses can be difficult to manage. So we're just getting to the point in advancing that program where we believe we're in the therapeutic range. We certainly do have data that our anti-GITR antibody behaves as an agonist. I think one of the issues has to do with cross-linking and which Fc receptors are engaged by the therapy. As you know, we have two GITR antibodies that are in the clinic. There is a lot of enthusiasm in the community, but it will be some time I think before we understand whether to what extent GITR antibodies will be useful.","Robert M. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And, Seamus, maybe I can just add on the comments around ZEPATIER. I think it's important also to understand. That was fully reflected in our guidance. And in fact, just to give you a little bit more color, as you look at ZEPATIER in particular, thinking about roughly where consensus is now, which ranges bilitates (47:08) around $650 million, we're very comfortable with that and, as I said, was reflected in our guidance. I just want to make sure that we get that out there.","Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations","Okay, and do you want to comment on BD, Ken?","Kenneth C. Frazier - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Thanks, Seamus. I think as we look at BD, we look at it in two different ways. First of all, obviously we're very eager to build on areas of leadership like immuno-oncology. And you saw us do deals, for example, with cCAM Biotherapeutics. You saw us do the deal earlier with IOmet that we talked about. So we'd like to build on those areas where we already have leadership.","But it's also important for us not to be too blinded to the fact that there's important science going on in other areas. And so what we want to look for are significant opportunities to have leading positions in growing areas of therapeutic significance going forward. Obviously, immuno-oncology would be one leading area, but we are also willing to do business development if we think we can get an asset that we can leverage inside our portfolio for leadership positions.","Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks, Ken. Darla, let's move on to the next question.","Operator","It's from Jeff Holford with Jefferies.","Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC","Hi, thanks very much for taking my question. I wondered if you can just give us an update on your insulin glargine program. We were maybe expecting to see your pivotal data coming up with that program, perhaps a filing later this year. So an update there would be useful.","And then we get a lot of commentary from your competitor on how entrenched the use of nivolumab is amongst particular lung cancer oncologists. That would seem to be the case from the commercial data you're giving us in Q1 versus their data. Can you just go through in a bit more detail why you think that isn't going to be a barrier for you in first-line lung cancer given the relatively close potential timing of the launches? And if it is more of a barrier than you think, what could you possibly do to change that? Thank you very much.","Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations","Roger, do you want to start with...","Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - Executive Vice President & President-Merck Research Laboratories","So with respect to glargine insulin, you'll be seeing data later in the year. We're filed in Europe and going through the process of gaining approval for that MK-1293 molecule. Probably not much more to add, I think, to that.","Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President & President-Global Human Health","And if you look at KEYTRUDA, the first thing I'd say is right now, we're the ones that have to talk about PD-L1 testing for second-line therapy, and we're the ones that are training physicians and getting physicians to understand the utilization of PD-L1 testing. When you think about first-line lung, all competitors will be talking about PD-L1 testing. So I believe that barrier will go away because all of us together will be talking about it. And the other thing that I think is important is if the playing field is equal in lung and all else is close, every three-week dosing is an advantage versus competition. And therefore I think that the dosing for first-line lung patients could end up being an advantage for us if PD-L1 testing is communicated by all companies.","But the other thing I want to emphasize, as I've said all along, this is a long-term view of this market. There will be multiple competitors that can do really well in this market. I don't think we should look at any one quarter or short period of time. This market over the next several years with the number of tumor types that we're studying, with the amount of \u2013 how well that we're continuing to develop combination products, we can continue to do really well.","The last thing I'll say is that if you look at Europe, in countries in Europe, we actually came to market after competition. And in many markets, including big markets like Germany in melanoma, despite that, we now are the market leader. So I believe it shows our strength outside of the U.S., where I believe PD-L1 testing will be even more relevant and accepted by payers than potentially in the U.S. for second-line.","Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks, Adam. Next question, please, Darla.","Operator","It's from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much, so I have a couple questions. First, with respect to the timing of the upcoming first-line lung readout, Roger, I think you mentioned at the middle of the year. But could you just talk a little bit more about more specifically the timing that you expect and the factors that you are assessing to be able to convey that timing?","And then with respect to ASCO, could you just talk a little bit about the chemo combo data that you'll be conveying? Obviously, it will be longer duration data that supports your move into Phase 3 for the chemo combo. If you could, shed some light on that.","And then finally with respect to REMICADE biosimilar adoption, obviously REMICADE is an infused drug used by hospitals and clinics. Do you believe that that route of administration and those customers have been more inclined to adopt biosimilars than the marketplace would be for a self-injectable therapy? Thank you.","Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations","Roger, do you want to take the first one?","Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - Executive Vice President & President-Merck Research Laboratories","Right, yes. So let me start with respect to the KEYNOTE-024 study, the first-line study in PD-L1 high patients in lung cancer. Again, it's important to recognize that this is an event-driven trial, and they have about 300 patients that are enrolled in the study. We've powered the study based on a certain number of progression events. Progression-free survival is the primary endpoint. So it's actually just a question of when we hit the event number. From the time we hit the event number to the time we get to database lock involves polling the sites, and there are a variety of questions that have to be answered. And then once the database is locked, the statistical analysis takes relatively little time. So there are no other factors that go into this. We're not in any way manipulating it. We're just waiting until we hit this pre-specified event trigger, which defines the power for the study. And once that's available, then we'll be able to do that.","Just with respect to ASCO, since you mentioned it, I didn't have a chance to go into it, but there's going to be a lot of new material presented at ASCO. We have 84 currently abstracts, including 13 oral presentations that will be presented at ASCO. We're going to be discussing data from 20 different tumor types. We'll have additional data that we'll be presenting with respect to chemo combinations, and in particular, the data that comes from the KEYNOTE-021 study, which is combinations with traditional chemotherapy, carbo [carboplatin]\/pemetrexed, where overall response rates are really very high, nearly 60%. So there's a lot of information that will be communicated at ASCO.","Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President & President-Global Human Health","And, Dave, with regard to REMICADE biosimilar adoption, I think it has more to do with price differences for new patients and tenders than it does with the way in which the drugs are administered. So I wouldn't expect a very significant difference.","Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations","Next question, please, Darla.","Operator","It's from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my questions. The one I just have one on the guidance, just to clarify, on the sales side, I believe you said you went from a 3% negative headwind on sales from FX to a 2% negative headwind. So I think there's about a $400 million benefit. But you only raised the guidance, the midpoint of your guidance by about $100 million. So I wondered if you could just confirm that I have the facts straight. And if so, what is it that's bringing down the sales guidance by about $300 million if you take out the impact of the currency moves?","And then the second question I have is on Alzheimer's, and I would love to just get Merck's perspective on this. Obviously, there has been a lot of discussion around endpoints with the changes Lilly made recently to their solanezumab study. I know for yours, for your base inhibitor, in prodromal you have CDR [Clinical Dementia Rating] Sum of the Boxes as your primary, I believe, in the prodromal study. In the mild to moderate, you have ADAS-cog and ADCS\/ADL as co-primary. So if you could just talk through those endpoints and how you think about the pros and cons of each in the different patient populations, I think that would be helpful just given all the investor interest in that area. Thanks.","Robert M. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Vamil, this is Rob. Good morning. So to your question, you are correct that, as we set original guidance at the beginning of the year, we expected three percentage points of negative impact from foreign currency. Using the mid-April rates, we now expect for the full year an approximately negative two percentage points of impact from foreign currency. And as you look at the guidance we provided, we flowed part of that benefit through in the guidance, but not all of it. And the single largest reason we did not flow all of it is the fact that we face earlier than expected generic entry on NASONEX, which is the largest driver of the number you quoted.","Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - Executive Vice President & President-Merck Research Laboratories","Vamil, it's Roger. With respect to Alzheimer's endpoints, of course there has been a lot of discussion over a long period of time about how to best measure the deterioration that occurs as a result of Alzheimer's-related neuro-degeneration. There are at least two different things to be concerned about. One, of course, is direct measurement of cognitive function by whatever tools one has, typically things like mental status examinations. And the other is the functional capability of individuals who are unfortunately suffering from Alzheimer's.","Typically, the agency has asked to see both of those things assessed directly and often as a primary endpoint, as a composite endpoint. In clinical trials, it is possible of course to do that, seriatim and take a single endpoint. Our view with respect to mild to moderate is that the best strategy is to look at both of those aspects of Alzheimer's-related performance, and that's the way we've handled it. We understand Lilly's thinking with respect to their earlier study, and we continue to look at these questions. But at the moment, I think we feel comfortable with where we are with our endpoints.","Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks, Roger. Darla. I know we're hitting up against the top of the hour. We're going to try to squeeze in one more question.","Operator","And that's from Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Emerging markets, we see the numbers in the press release. Can you give us a little more flavor on what's going on in the different areas, China, Latin America? How is it doing ex-Venezuela? Eastern Europe looked tough. How much of this is currency and how much of this is just underlying stuff?","And then can you just comment on omarigliptin? I thought I had read that you're not going to be pursuing this in the U.S. and Europe. If you could, just comment on that.","And on JANUVIA, were there any inventory changes? It wasn't clear from your comments. Thanks","Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President & President-Global Human Health","So I'll get those quickly. If you exclude Venezuela, sales in emerging markets ex-foreign exchange were up about 5%. And we're seeing good growth in countries like China, where we had about 11% growth outside of foreign exchange. And we're seeing good success in the areas of vaccines, our diabetes franchise, and so forth. Where the pressure was primarily was Venezuela, but obviously there's some turmoil that's happening in some markets, particularly in the Middle East, that have some impact. If you look at emerging markets over time, there has been a slight decline in growth, but we still expect there to be growth as we move forward into the future.","With regard to JANUVIA, I said in the U.S. we had 9% growth versus prior year. But the best way to understand that is to look at underlying volume growth, which was about 5% versus prior year. And therefore, we did see some inventory movement of JANUVIA. It's important to note that just like last year the quarters will fluctuate to some degree from one quarter to the next quarter. But overall, across the year, we expect growth for the JANUVIA franchise.","And then the last thing I'll say is with regard to omarigliptin, for business reasons we decided not to move forward submitting the applications in the United States or Europe, and it did not result from concerns on efficacy or safety. It was really for business reasons, for two primary reasons. Number one, we have a very high share of JANUVIA in those markets, so a lot of the product would have been cannibalizing our own DPP-4 share. We have a 75% share in the U.S. and a 65% share globally. The second reason is we're excited about launching not just the monotherapy SGLT2 but also the combination of an SGLT2 with JANUVIA, which we would have anticipated would be launched not too far after omarigliptin. And in order to focus more on growing JANUVIA but then also the SGLT2 mono and more specifically the combo with JANUVIA, we felt it was a better place for us to focus.","Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - Executive Vice President & President-Merck Research Laboratories","And if I could, I'd just say that this was a very hard decision for Adam and me \u2013 we. Omarigliptin has very desirable properties as a once-weekly DPP-4, nearly superimposable over daily JANUVIA. But as Adam indicated, these decisions have to be made by putting our resources against those things that matter most.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, I just want to thank you all for hanging in there with us this morning. We're off to a promising start this year with our growth of 3% ex-FX. I think we also continued to deliver our leveraged P&L with 10% FX on the bottom line, and we are looking forward to data readouts in areas like KEYTRUDA and other areas of our pipeline. So we're very excited and we look forward to speaking to you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Merck's Q1 2016 sales and earnings conference call.

In addition, I'm also joined by Frank Clyburn, our Chief Commercial Officer; and Mike Nally, our Chief Marketing Officer, who will be available for the Q&A portion of the call.","Before I turn the call over to Ken, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. You should note that we've excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation in our press release.

We have also posted a presentation to the Investors section of merck.com, which includes some of the highlights from our results and announcements.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken.","Ken Frazier","Thank you, Peter. We're very pleased to speak with you this morning as we close out what we consider to be an exceptional year for Merck. And we're excited to announce our intention to create two leading growth companies through the spinoff of our Women\u2019s Health, Legacy Brands and Biosimilar Products into a new company.","As you can see from our results and our 2020 guidance, Merck had an extraordinary year and is in a position of operational and financial strength, driven by strong execution of our strategy and focus on our key growth drivers and innovative pipeline. It is this position of strength, born of that focus that gives us the confidence to do what we believe will best position us to deliver even greater value to patients and shareholders.","Throughout my entire tenure as CEO, we have consistently focused on science as core to our strategy to not only benefit the most patients, but also as a means of creating the most value. As you\u2019ve seen, Merck's portfolio has evolved from one focus largely on primary care products to one focus on oncology, vaccines, hospital and animal health. It is this purposeful shift, coupled with greater prioritization and focus on key growth drivers that has led to the unprecedented growth that we are now experiencing.","Going forward, we see even greater opportunities to invest behind our innovative growth drivers. In placing greater focus and prioritization behind these products, we must also think carefully about how to make the best possible use of the remainder of our expansive Human Health portfolio, which is comprised of more than 160 products in total.","Our responsibility to patients and shareholders has led us to think about how we can maximize the impact of this vast array of Human Health products. Therefore, after careful consideration, over time, we've made the decision to separate into two companies: One, a research intensive biopharmaceutical leader; the other, a new company, focused on becoming a leader in women\u2019s health, with the capability to realize the full potential of a portfolio of trusted and medically important legacy products and a rapidly expanding biosmilars business.","By spinning off NewCo as a distinct business, we can better prioritize and support a set of products that no longer fit in Merck\u2019s strategic framework but which remains important to public health and the patients who rely on them, and which if managed and resourced appropriately, present real opportunities for growth.","We're also mindful of the changing industry landscape and believe that evolving our operating model in this way will allow Merck to benefit from an even more intense focus on breakthrough science and innovation.","As I stated on our Investor Day in June, our mission and rich legacy of inventing to save and improve the lives is the foundation of our Company. The separation of NewCo will help us in our aspiration to be the premier research intensive biopharmaceutical company by allowing us to focus on innovations that prevent and treat diseases. And over the past two years, we have seen how more focus and more prioritization leads to more growth, more efficiency and more value-creation.","The spinoff will also create significant opportunities for NewCo. As an independent company, NewCo will pursue its strategic intent of becoming a global leader in women\u2019s health, an area where the future opportunities are significant. In addition to the growth potential in women\u2019s health NewCo's growth will be fueled by more fully realizing the full potential of a portfolio of trusted legacy brands in pain, dermatology, cardiovascular and other areas, as well as its rapidly expanding biosimilars business. This new company will have a strategic freedom to pursue additional growth opportunities through lifecycle management and targeted acquisitions and partnerships in women\u2019s health, dermatology and other fields.","NewCo will be led by a highly experienced leadership team including Kevin Ali, who has been named Chief Executive Officer. Kevin has a proven track record of leadership at Merck with deep experience in global pharmaceutical markets and diverse therapeutic areas. In addition, NewCo's Board will be shared by Carrie Cox, who has extensive experience in pharmaceutical commercialization, particularly in Women\u2019s Health as well as broad leadership and board experience, including as former chairman and CEO of Humacyte, former chairman Array BioPharma And as president of Global Pharmaceuticals at Schering-Plough, prior to its merging with Merck.","We are confident that NewCo will be in experienced and capable hands with this leadership team.","Our industry faces emerging challenges such as the rising cost of innovation and increasing pressures around pricing and market access. In this environment, we must maximize our opportunities to access greater operational agility, efficiency and productivity. As separate, more focused companies with more optimal resource allocation, both Merck and NewCo will be better positioned to continue to positively impact the lives of patients, improve global public health and achieve faster growth. As a result, we expect Merck\u2019s shareholders to benefit through ownership of two focused companies, each with attractive financial characteristics and growth profile.","In summary, we are seeing the benefit of focusing our organization on its best growth opportunities. As we look at out to 2024, we believe the strength of our business is under appreciated. We are more confident than consensus on every key financial metric, including revenue, operating margins and EPS growth. Our commitment to maintaining and growing the Merck dividend is evident of the confidence we have in the long-term prospects for our business.","Our fundamental operating and financial strength allow us to take bold steps to stay ahead of the curve by reshaping our operating structure, focusing and streamlining Merck, enabling Merck to become an even stronger, more agile and faster growing company. I strongly believe that this is the right thing for patients, for public health and for shareholders.","With that, I'll now pass it on to Rob to discuss our results and provide more details on the spinoff. Rob?","Rob Davis","Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone.","I'm excited to speak to you this morning about our 2019 results, as well as our decision to spin off a portion of our Human Health business, a decision that will enhance the value of both Merck and NewCo. 2019 was a year of exceptional growth for our business with revenues increasing 13% and non-GAAP EPS increasing 21%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Our strong performance reflects the continued execution of our science-led strategy, and we expect our business momentum to continue, particularly as we enhance our focus on our key growth drivers through the spinoff.","I'll start by highlighting our strong fourth quarter results before providing more details on the transaction and 2020 guidance. Total Company revenues were $11.9 billion in the quarter, an increase of 8% year-over-year, or 9% excluding the negative impact from foreign currency. Both our Human Health and Animal Health divisions contributed to the growth this quarter. The remainder of my comments pertaining to sales will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our Human Health revenues grew 8%, led by products in oncology and hospital. In oncology, KEYTRUDA fourth quarter sales were $3.1 billion and for the full year sales exceeded $11 billion, representing 58% growth versus 2018.","In the U.S., growth was driven by strong demand across all indications. KEYTRUDA continues to lead across many indications, including lung, bladder, and head and neck cancers with strong momentum in adjuvant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma where we're seeing strong uptake across all patient subgroups. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA sales in the quarter grew 15%, driven by lung globally was reimbursement for KEYNOTE-189 now secured across all major markets in the EU, and strong uptake in lung, following approvals in Japan and China.","We're also seeing positive uptake from early launches in both, renal cell carcinoma and adjuvant melanoma in the EU and expect to see strong global growth as these and other new indications continue to roll out.","Our results also reflect continued strength for both Lynparza and Lenvima, important products from our collaborations with AstraZeneca and Eisai, respectively. Lynparza continues to have strong growth in ovarian cancer, and maintains a greater than 60% total patient share in the PARP inhibitor class in the United States. Growth at Lenvima benefited from the launch of the endometrial carcinoma indication, in combination with KEYTRUDA and continued strong demand in first-line hepatocellular carcinoma, where Lenvima is now the leading treatment agent.","Our vaccines business declined this quarter due to the impact from the replenishment of GARDASIL to the CDC stockpile in 2018, and our borrowing from the stockpile in the fourth quarter of 2019, which negatively impacted the year-over-year comparison of GARDASIL revenues by $245 million on a combined basis. Excluding these impacts, GARDASIL revenues grew 16%, driven by continued strong underlying global demand.","Our hospital business benefited from 24% growth in BRIDION, which reached $1 billion in annual sales for the first time this quarter. Growth was largely driven by an increased share in the U.S. reversal market. For the full year, we achieved strong growth of 14% in our Human Health business, driven by our growth pillars across most geographies. Animal Health revenues increased 10% this quarter to $1.1 billion. Growth for quarter was driven largely by the products acquired in the Antelliq acquisition.","Now, turning to the rest of our P&L, my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 72.6% in the quarter, a decrease of 240 basis points year-over-year, primarily reflecting the impact of unfavorable manufacturing variances and higher inventory write-offs. Operating expenses of $5.2 billion increased 10% year-over-year. Administrative and promotional expenses drove higher SG&A costs in the quarter, while clinical development spend and cost associated with our discovery efforts were responsible for the increase in R&D expense. Other income and expense was positively impacted by income from our equity securities portfolio, partially offset by higher net interest expense. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.9%, driven by lower and favorable earnings mix. Taken together, we earned $1.16 per share, an increase of 12% excluding exchange.","Now, turning to our announced spinoff. As Ken noted, by further evolving our operating model and separating into two simpler, more focused and agile companies, both will be better positioned to respond to the changing external landscape, improve efficiency and accelerate growth, creating greater value for patients and shareholders than would be achieved as a single company.","Spinning off NewCo accelerates Merck's revenue growth by up to 1 percentage point on a compounded average basis through 2024. But more importantly, it allows Merck enhance focus on its key growth drivers and robust pipeline. This gives us confidence that Merck will realize even greater incremental revenue growth over time.","We will also benefit from more streamlined processes in operations, enabling further operating model efficiencies across the value chain. For context, the products to be spun off into NewCo represent about 15% of Merck's Human Health revenues, based on 2020 forecast, while consuming a much larger share of our operations and resources. In fact, separating NewCo will reduce Merck's Human Health manufacturing footprint by about 25%, the number of products by 50% and the number of SKUs by 60%. As a result of the more optimized operating model, Merck will achieve even higher operating margins over time, creating additional headroom to invest in innovation, which we continue to believe is the key to our long-term growth and value-creation, as Ken has referenced.","Merck will continue to benefit from broad commercial scale, driven by its key growth pillars in oncology, vaccines, hospital and animal health as well as our diabetes franchise. Merck will continue to have a strong balance sheet with significant cash flows and financial flexibility, which will allow for investments and innovation and meaningful business developments to augment its pipeline and portfolio, while continuing to return capital to shareholders.","We expect to complete the transaction in the first half of 2021. Until then, we will remain focused on continuing to successfully execute our strategy and maintaining our strong financial and operational performance.","Now, let's move to our outlook for 2020, a year in which we continue to operate as a combined entity. My remaining comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. We expect full year 2020 revenue to be between $48.8 billion and $50.3 billion, which represents 4% to 7% growth versus 2019. This range assumes a negative impact from foreign exchange of less than 1 percentage point using mid-January rates.","Our gross margin will be roughly 75.5%. We expect operating expenses to increase by low-single-digit rate year-over-year due to higher R&D spending as we remain committed to fully funding the meaningful opportunities in our pipeline. SG&A expenses will remain tightly managed.","We expect other expense of roughly $200 million, driven by higher net interest expense. We expect our tax rate to be roughly 17.5% to 18.5% for the year. We project average diluted shares to be 2.54 billion for 2020. And we expect EPS to be between $5.62 and $5.77, which represents growth of 8% to 11%, including a roughly 1.5 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange, using mid-January rates.","Longer term, Merck continues to expect strong revenue growth, driven by growing demand for innovative products. And looking out to 2024, we believe our revenue growth potential is underappreciated, even more so as we begin to realize the benefits of this transaction.","We continue to expect meaningful operating margin expansion over time. The separation of NewCo enables $1.5 billion in pre-tax operating efficiencies, ratable over three years. While initially Merck's operating margins will decline slightly, we expect to achieve operating margins of greater than 40% in 2024, higher than Merck would have achieved as a combined company.","The transaction is expected to result in $8 billion to $9 billion of proceeds from a special tax-free dividend from NewCo. Merck's capital allocation priorities remain unchanged, and we expect to maintain a very solid financial and credit profile. First and foremost, we will fund our best growth opportunities through investments in R&D, product launches and capacity expansion. And we believe the spin-off allows us to better focus on these activities.","Merck's dividend will be unaffected by this transaction. And we anticipate future dividend increases from the current 2020 dividend of $2.44 per share, post separation with the goal of achieving 47% to 50% payout ratio over time. We will continue to have ample capacity for value-enhancing business development. And finally, we will continue to repurchase shares as a way to return excess cash to shareholders.","Turning now to NewCo's financial profile. The products represented by the new company portfolio are expected to achieve 2020 revenue of approximately $6.5 billion with an operating margin of approximately 45% as part of Merck. As an independent company, NewCo is expected to achieve the low-single-digit revenue growth off of a 2021 base of $6 billion to $6.5 billion. Taking into consideration the cost to operate as an independent Company, operating margins for NewCo are expected to be in the mid-30% range and increase over time. And finally, we anticipate EBITDA margins to be in the low to mid-40% range in 2021 and also increase over time.","NewCo will have strong cash flows and a balance sheet positioned to invest in growth opportunities and expects to pay a meaningful dividend, which will be at least as competitive as any likely peer company and entirely incremental to Merck\u2019s dividend.","In total, we expect combined EPS of the NewCo and Merck together to initially be nominally lower than what Merck would have achieved without the spinoff. But, as a result of the incremental growth that NewCo will achieve standalone, combined with the benefit of the operating efficiencies that Merck will realize, we expect that shareholders owning both companies will realize higher EPS within 12 to 24 months.","In summary, we are confident that through the spinoff both companies will have strong prospects for future success and sustainable profitable growth, given the clear benefits each will realize as independently operated entities, including enhanced strategic and operational focus on our key drivers to accelerate growth, improved agility to anticipate and respond to customer needs in evolving market dynamics, simplified operating models with reduced complexity and improved efficiencies, optimized capital structures and resource allocation to pursue their distinct strategic agendas, and improved financial profiles, making for unique and compelling investment cases.","We are excited by this opportunity to create two patient focused growth companies and look forward to continue to deliver significant long-term value to our patients and shareholders.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Roger.","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","Thanks, Rob.","Looking back on 2019 and in particular on our fourth quarter results, there is much to celebrate. In December, our KEYNOTE-057 data were reviewed at an FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee meeting, which was followed three weeks later by FDA approval of KEYTRUDA as monotherapy for the treatment of certain patients with high risk, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. This represents the 23rd FDA-approved indication for KEYTRUDA, broadening still further the benefit that can be expected from the use of KEYTRUDA in the urologic setting.","KEYTRUDA also gained three new approvals in Japan during the fourth quarter as combination therapy and the first line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma based on the KEYNOTE-426 study and for the first line treatment of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, either as monotherapy or when combined with chemotherapy, based on results of the KEYNOTE-048 trial. The KEYNOTE-048 data also permitted approval of KEYTRUDA in Europe with the similar indication. Finally, we gained approval of KEYTRUDA in China for the treatment of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the lung in combination with chemotherapy, based on data obtained in the KEYNOTE-407 study.","Substantial progress was also made in the registration of Lynparza, our leading PARP inhibitor that we are developing in collaboration with colleagues at AstraZeneca. At the December FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee, a majority of committee members supported the use of Lynparza as first line maintenance therapy for patients with germline BRCA-mutated metastatic pancreatic cancer whose disease had not progress after at least 16 weeks of first line platinum-based chemotherapy, all based on data from the Phase 3 POLO trial, which demonstrated a 47% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in the Lynparza treatment arm. FDA granted approval for Lynparza in this setting at the end of 2019.","I should also note the data from our PAOLA-1 trial of Lynparza were accepted by the FDA for priority review with the PDUFA date of the second quarter of this year. In PAOLA-1 maintenance Lynparza plus bevacizumab treatment of women with advanced ovarian cancer that had responded to first line platinum-based chemotherapy plus bevacizumab, reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 41%.","Additional trials supporting the use of Lynparza in the treatment of men with the mutation selected metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer based on the results of the Phase 3 PROfound study was also accepted by the FDA for priority review with the PDUFA date in the second quarter of 2020.","While we're certainly very active in advancing new cancer treatments, during the fourth quarter, we also made important progress in other areas. For example, in the management of highly resistant bacterial infections, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion for RECARBRIO, our novel combination of imipenem, cilastatin, and relebactam for the treatment of infections due to aerobic gram-negative bacteria with demonstrated resistance to other agent. RECARBRIO is also under priority review by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with hospital-acquired or ventilator associated bacterial pneumonia caused by susceptible organisms with the PDUFA date of June 4th.","Important progress is also made in cardiovascular medicine with the completion of the Phase 2 VICTORIA study, in which vericiguat, a novel guanylate cyclase activator being developed in collaboration colleagues at Bayer, was found to reduce the composite risk of heart failure hospitalization, or cardiovascular mortality as compared with placebo, in patients with worsening heart failure with the reduced ejection fraction who are receiving standard heart failure therapy.","Time does not permit me to list the many other regulatory and clinical milestones that we achieved in the fourth quarter. However, I cannot fail to note that ERVEBO, the first effective vaccine against an ebolavirus was approved by the FDA and received conditional approval from the EMA for the prevention of disease caused by Zaire ebolavirus.","We have now provided more than 275,000 doses of this vaccine by experimental and use protocols to support the efforts of the World Health Organization and other agencies attempting to halt the spread of Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Approvals have also been obtained in certain African nations, including Burundi, Zambia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo itself, which should greatly improve the process whereby individuals at high risk can be immunized. It has taken many years to reach this important moment. My colleagues and I feel privileged to have contributed in this way from the control of an otherwise fatal disease caused by the Zaire ebolavirus.","Lastly, I wish to comment on the spinoff of the new company that we\u2019ve announced this morning. I\u2019ll begin with a deep belief in the power of simplification to enhance productivity. My colleagues and I have important objectives over the next few years that will, we hope, improve treatment for malignant disease and heart failure and provide vaccines that reduce suffering from infectious diseases.","Simplification of our corporate structure can only sharpen our focus on these critically important programs. I have confidence that we can achieve this increased focus internally, while providing the near-term support necessary to implement NewCo to establish itself as a highly effective separate entity.","I will now turn the call back to Ken.","Ken Frazier","Thank you, Roger.","And before turning the call over to Kevin, I'd like to take a few minutes to share with you some details on his background. Kevin brings a wealth of knowledge to NewCo, based on three decades of pharmaceutical and commercial experience at Merck. His experience ranges from leading different regions including our entire international Human Health business, and the emerging markets region to leading markets such as Germany and Turkey. Most recently, Kevin has been instrumental in evaluating Merck's options to optimize the entire Human Health portfolio and in envisioning what success looks like for NewCo, while providing invaluable counsel to me and the rest of the senior management team. I'm confident that under Kevin's leadership, NewCo will reach its full potential and drive great value for patients, shareholders and employees.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin Ali","Thanks, Ken, and good morning. I'm excited to share with you today the creation of our new company, which we believe has a remarkable opportunity to unleash the potential of a leading portfolio of assets in women's health, a rapidly growing biosimilars business and a portfolio of trusted and medically important legacy brands.","NewCo revenue was expected to be flat to declining through 2024 within Merck due to limited investment focus. However, we believe that by allocating the appropriate resources and by focusing management's attention, NewCo will achieve sustainable growth and create value outside of Merck. Although revenues are expected to decline in 2021 versus 2020 to a base of approximately $6 billion to $6.5 billion, largely due to the loss of exclusivities of Zetia in Japan, and NuvaRing in the U.S. The new company will be well-positioned to achieve low-single-digit revenue growth off of that base. As no new LOEs loom and we have identified lifecycle management and commercial investment opportunities, some already underway. NewCo will have a strong global scale and geographic diversification and as a standalone entity will be better positioned to capitalize on attractive opportunities across this portfolio.","NewCo will pursue global leadership and sustainable growth in women's health to its growing contraceptive and fertility business including Nexplanon, which grew 14% in 2019, and is the leading implantable long-acting reversible contraceptive worldwide with U.S. patent protection through 2027. In fact, we expect Nexplanon to be our first billion-dollar women's health product.","The growing $40 billion women's health market is highly fragmented, with over 400 products in development industry-wide. NewCo will be well-positioned to capitalize on this attractive market opportunity to become an industry leader through investments in both organic growth and business development opportunities, and to deliver better and more innovative and holistic care to women.","NewCo growth will also be driven by biosimilars business in the early stages of a long-term growth opportunity, with three products currently on the market through its partnership with Samsung Bioepis. Revenues of the three currently marketed products are expanding rapidly and were approximately $250 million in 2019. NewCo is well-positioned to benefit from increased biosimilar demand as markets around the world continue to seek healthcare cost savings through greater biosimilar adoption in a growing market.","The women's health and biosimilar businesses will represent a larger proportion of NewCo's revenues over time and are expected to account for more than 50% sales by 2024. NewCo will also have the opportunity to realize the full potential of its portfolio of globally trusted legacy brand through increased focus and targeted investment.","Importantly, the infrastructure and cash generation within this broad portfolio provides the scale, geographic reach and capital to support the growth opportunities that the women's health and biosimilar businesses present. In addition to its strong product portfolio, NewCo's global scale and geographic reach will serve as an important competitive advantage. The Company will have the capability to potentially commercialize and distribute for other innovative industry players.","Finally, NewCo will be a highly profitable with stable and strong cash flows. As a standalone company, it will be able to make the capital allocation decisions that best suit its long-term interests, including organic and inorganic growth opportunities, paying a meaningful dividend, debt pay-down or returning cash to shareholders through share repurchase.","In summary, I'm very excited about the future of NewCo and the opportunity to work with Carrie Cox. This Company will have a distinct opportunity to address the health needs of women around the world and to build off of important growth pillars such as Nexplanon, pain and dermatology and biosimilars. As a focused company with dedicated resources, a strong global footprint and talented and experienced employees who embody the shared values of the Merck culture, NewCo will be better positioned to create value for patients and shareholders.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Peter.","Peter Dannenbaum","Thank you, Kevin.","We recognize today's upfront comments ran longer than normal. So, we're prepared to extend the call beyond 9 a.m. if necessary. So, Carlo, will you please line up the queue for Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Chris Schott from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Chris Schott","Great. Thanks very much for the questions. Obviously, a lot of news there today. I just had two really, both related to the spin. I guess, first on this. You mentioned you've been considering a deal like this or some structure for these assets for quite some time. I guess, why now on the timing? Is there something that\u2019s either happened with the business or the pipeline that made this -- make particular sense now versus I guess when you've worked at this in the past? And my second question is, I just want to make sure I'm understanding the $1.5 billion operating synergies correctly. Should we think about that as a net reduction in OpEx relative to what the combined Company would have spent or is that savings that goes to RemainCo and should be balanced against some of the stand-up costs that you're referring do with the NewCo? Thanks very much. ","Ken Frazier","This is Ken Frazier. Let me start with the why now. The reason why we're doing this now is that our fundamental and financial strength, which is being driven by the focus on our best opportunities for growth, allows us now to do what\u2019s strategically correct for the company in the long term. This is about taking actions today that will assure the long-term growth and viability of Merck, as well as allowing products that no longer fit into our strategic framework to prosper in a new organizational structure. So, from our standpoint, this is the right time. A few years ago, when we were looking at this, we saw the opportunity, but for example, the cash flow generation of our legacy product was being employed at that time and standing up our oncology business from which we grew from the ground up, and as you know, have been extremely successful. That success has been due to our ability to allocate capital to a business that we didn't have before and getting the entire organization focused and aligned around an opportunity that we had around KEYTRUDA and other compounds behind KEYTRUDA. So, that is why we can do it now.","And I said before, we are confident about our long-term growth prospects. And one of the ways in which we try to manifest that is by saying we will maintain and grow the dividend on the Merck side, irrespective of losing these brands.","Peter Dannenbaum","Okay. Rob on the efficiencies?","Rob Davis","Good morning, Chris. On your question, so the way you should think about is the $1.5 trillion of operating efficiencies, our incremental cost savings in Merck after the spin-off is completed, the stand up costs that are required to support the new companies are really contemplated -- if you take the fact that we commented that there's 45% operating margin for the new company within Merck and it goes to 35%, roughly mid-30s after the stand up. That 10 percentage point delta is really the stand up costs. So, those are not -- those are separate independent from the $1.5 billion of net benefits, net synergies that will be joined by Merck going forward in its operating results.","Peter Dannenbaum","Next question, please, Carlo?","Operator","Next question is from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Go ahead, please.","Tim Anderson","Thank you. A couple of questions on spin and then a science question. On the new company to be spun out, will that be doing real R&D and have its own R&D engine? When you talk about sustainable growth, I'm just wondering if part of that\u2019s going to come from genuine R&D? And then, on RemainCo, updated views on Animal Health. Should we assume that this new split means that the remaining parent Merck company is even more likely than ever to keep Animal Health in perpetuity? And then, last question is on the adjuvant IO opportunity. Roger, in my past discussions with you, you've been highly confident the PD-1s will work in adjutant setting. Recently, we saw Roche failed in bladder. There's been some timeline slippage, we haven't seen any adjuvant trial timelines pulled forward, no trial stopped at an interim, unlike we have with metastatic disease in the PD-1. So, my question to you is, are you still highly confident that PD-1s are going to work broadly across tumor types and adjuvant?","Peter Dannenbaum","Thanks. Kevin, on the research and development capabilities of NewCo.","Kevin Ali","Thanks. Good morning, Tim. Yes. NewCo will have a high quality development capability, and is really well-positioned as a partner of choice for other biopharmaceutical innovators who are looking to realize commercial growth through our global scale and presence in selected international market to increase patient access. Over time, NewCo will build a research capability in selected therapeutic areas starting with women's health as a core pillar of its business development strategy, and then will move further from there.","Ken Frazier","Tim, on your question about Animal Health, I'll start by saying, we never say what's going to happen in perpetuity, because we regularly review our entire portfolio and make decisions about which parts of that portfolio belong in our portfolio and which ones would be better off. As we look at our Animal Health, we believe, if you look at its growth, if you look at its profitability, we continue to believe that we are in effect advantaged owners of that business going forward. We also believe that that is an important key growth pillar that actually helps us in the long run. As you know, there are ups and downs in the pharmaceutical business. And having a business like vaccines, having a business like Animal Health gives us the long-term stability that actually allows us to confidently pursue our R&D mission.","Peter Dannenbaum","Okay. Roger, on adjuvant?","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","Tim, on the question of the immuno-oncology in the adjuvant setting, I can't speak generally about PD-L1 and PD1 antagonists, but I can talk about KEYTRUDA. First of all, of course KEYTRUDA is already effective in the adjuvant setting as we\u2019ve shown in melanoma. And we also showed the effects in the neoadjuvant setting in breast cancer in the I-SPY 2 study and as well in the 522 study most recently, and that is a combined neoadjuvant, adjuvant study and we'll be seeing the adjuvant data in not too long time.","And you shouldn't really expect adjuvant data to be pulled forward, because by definition, patients who are receiving adjuvant therapy are patients who have better overall survival over a longer period of time. So, one expects to see those adjuvant results roll out with a more defined cadence. And I think that's exactly what we'll see. And based on our success in two prior settings, I would think KEYTRUDA should be successful in these settings as well, in general. It works better when used earlier.","Operator","Next question is from Steve Scala of Cowen. Go ahead, please.","Steve Scala","One of the concerns investors have with Merck is the view that its outlook is heavily dependent on KEYTRUDA, and formation of NewCo would seem to increase this risk and concern. So, Merck appears to not agree that this is a concern, and I'm wondering if you can elaborate on why. And then, second, what was the rationale for leaving Januvia within Merck as opposed to NewCo? It seems placing Januvia within NewCo would have made Merck\u2019s outlook appreciably clear going forward. Thank you very much.","Ken Frazier","Well, let me start on Januvia question. We continue to believe that our diabetes franchise is going to be an important contributor to Merck now and into the future. We're also continuing to do significant research in the whole cardiometabolic area. So, that's an area of focus for us going forward.","In terms of the issue around KEYTRUDA concentration risk, we are mindful of that. We think KEYTRUDA revenues as a proportion of total revenues only increase by a small amount, because of this. I think, the most important thing that I would say about KEYTRUDA is that right now we continue to see the benefits of our focus both in terms of R&D and commercial execution going forward. We see it as driving more growth going forward for the Company. But we also see the benefits of our other opportunities in oncology. We have more than KEYTRUDA, we have Lenvima and Lynparza. We also have 20 molecules behind that. We also have our vaccines business, our hospital and specialty business. So, we're looking to optimize our entire portfolio and augment our pipeline through business development. That's how we see our future growth, not so much these brands, which as Kevin said, left to their own, would probably decline more steeply than they are in the NewCo.","Peter Dannenbaum","Great. Rob, anything to add?","Rob Davis","Yes. Steve, just to kind of build on your point about why Januvia in Merck as opposed to NewCo. As we look at it, clearly, we continue to benefit from the fundamental cash flow and strength that that business gives. While it\u2019s not a growing business, it still is generating a lot of cash flow. But, in the near term, as we approach LOE, it will continue to be important for Merck. This is an important brand for us. And frankly, if you look at the NewCo company, while the loss of exclusive to Merck frankly does not affect our ability to deliver growth, as we've already commented, even through the loss of exclusivity in 2023, 2024, we grow each and every year through that period. So, we're able to absorb the loss of exclusivity, benefit from the cash now, that type of clip would be insurmountable to the new company.","And then, finally, and Roger can comment on it in more detail. But, we continue to do some pretty interesting science in the cardiometabolic area. And so, exciting opportunities are there. So, continue to see from a scientific perspective fit as well. For all of those reasons, we felt keeping it within Merck made more sense than moving that over to the NewCo.","Operator","Next question is from Andrew Baum of Citi. Go ahead, please.","Andrew Baum","Couple of questions, please. Firstly, you initiated your islatravir dual oral combination trials. Is there any possibility within that? And being able to differentiate your combination versus Victoza on the back of less weight gain, given the absence of an integrase inhibitor? And whilst you\u2019re waiting for the long-acting trials to complete, does that provide any kind of commercial advantage?","And the second question relates to Tigit. One of your competitors Roche has indicated they are opening a Phase 3 program. They've already run a head to head data in combination with that PD-L1 and non-small cell lung. I know that you have a program ongoing and have had for some time. Could you talk to your relative levels of excitement with the molecule and perhaps give us some timelines, and when it may be able to enter registration trials? Thank you.","Peter Dannenbaum","Roger?","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","First of all, with respect to the islatravir combination, in realty, we really have to wait for the data. I think that we're very confident in the behavior of islatravir, which we demonstrated through our reasonably large Phase 2 studies and also the work that we\u2019ve done with impactable person. [Ph] It's a terrific molecule and behaves extremely well. How it will behave with this in combination study? We have pretty good evidence that indicates to us that it will be a leading combination, and especially valuable in treatment. We also know islatravir either by itself or potential combination is a good preventive regimen. But, we need to see the data from all of those. And that's what we'll be getting. And with regard to what I call Tigit, but you can call Tigit. We do have a program. We have been working on this for some time. We have studies going on where we had tried to ask a question of whether this molecule in combination with KEYTRUDA behaves better than KEYTRUDA alone, and is there any circumstance under which it can be used? We recognized that KEYTRUDA is a very impressive compound in a whole variety of different settings. And we have to find the right place in which to use it. So, we're enthusiastic about it, and we're moving forward.","Operator","Our next question is from Louise Chen of Cantor. Go ahead, please.","Louise Chen","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, my first question to you is that you noted in the call that you're more confident than consensus on every metric through 2024. Just wondering if you could elaborate more on what you think the street is missing here. And then, second question is just on KEYTRUDA in Japan. Curious what kind of impact do you assume for price cuts this year for KEYTRUDA in Japan? And is there another potential price cut coming? Thank you.","Peter Dannenbaum","Rob?","Rob Davis","Yes. Louise, this is Rob. Thanks for the question. Really, if you look at the comments that Ken made, he said we feel confident that the Street under-appreciates our revenue, our operating margins and our EPS growth as we look forward through time. And if you look at in the components, clearly on revenue, we continue to believe all of our growth pillars have meaningful growth opportunity, and in most cases, continue to be underappreciated across oncology platform, within the vaccines platform, given GARDASIL and Animal Health, just to name a few. So that story, which we've been talking to you about over the last several quarters, continues.","And then, as you look beyond that, clearly with the spinoff, getting up to 1 percentage point improvement in our growth rate as a result the spin itself, that's even further growth that\u2019s not appreciated, not to mention the fact that we think through core focus and really directed efforts by our leadership team, we can run at an even faster growth. So, that is an important part as well.","And then, as you look an operating margin, today, we've indicated that by 2024 or in 2024, we expect operating margins now as a result of what this spin enables, which enabling $1.5 billion dollars of incremental cost efficiency on top of the already improving natural mix we've been benefiting from in our business, we're going to achieve an operating margin of greater than 40% in 2024. And if you take that acceleration in operating margin, combined it with potentially accelerated EPS, when you think about us deploying $8 billion to $9 billion of proceeds from this transaction, if you put that share repurchase for instance, you even get further acceleration. So, as you look out to 2024, that's why across those select factors, we believe this under-appreciates revenue under-appreciates operating margin, under-appreciates EPS growth.","Peter Dannenbaum","And Frank on the Japanese price cuts? ","Frank Clyburn","Hi Louise, it's Frank. In Japan, we did see or we will be seeing, I should say, in February of this year, a huge sales re-pricing of 17.5%. We\u2019ve seen significant strong performance based off of our lung cancer indications in Japan. And because of the sales projection, February will see the price reduced 17.5%. It's also important to note that we will face another significant reduction in April. That significant reduction is going to be within the same range as the first cut in February. Important to note that will have an impact likely on our Q1 results in Japan, but also as we take a step back, when you look at the rollout of renal cell carcinoma and our other indications in Japan, we do believe despite the price cuts, over time, we will be able to grow in Japan. And I want to reinforce that if we elevate outside of Japan, we still see very significant growth in 2020 and beyond as we continue to roll out many indications globally, very strong uptake continuing to see in Europe. And as Roger mentioned, we now have 23 indications in the U.S. So, we feel very good about our outlook for KEYTRUDA. Clearly, the Japan re-pricing will have the near-term impact in Japan, we\u2019re confident, as we go forward.","Operator","Next one is from Umer Raffat of Evercore.","Umer Raffat","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions and I\u2019d appreciate you bearing with me a little bit on it. I guess, let me start with this, a simple one, which is, can you confirm that the standalone EPS goes down by about $1? That's first. Second, if I add up Women's Health, cardiology and diversified, that's about $6 billion, which is roughly what you're saying is what's being divested to the NewCo. But, if the goal is to focus on the innovative and pharma in the RemainCo, I noticed there's a $5 billion line for your other pharma, which is not being included. And I'm curious why that is. And finally, I think it's very interesting that you're not doing a split, you're doing a spin, very specifically. And I also noticed when you talk about the proceeds, you're mentioning BizDev, before you mentioned share repurchase. So, it almost seems to me that they might possibly be interested in replacing that last dollar. So, my question is, are you looking at a company which is more on the pipeline side or is the focus more on a accretive deal, which gets to that dollar EPS back immediately? Thank you very much.","Rob Davis","Yes. Thanks for the question, Umer. So, as you look at thinking about what is the subtraction, if you will, away from Merck by pulling out this business, and I know the math you're doing to get to roughly the dollar. The only thing I would advise you on is I don't think you're giving any credit for the operating efficiencies, the $1.5 billion which we said, we will give relatively. So, that's $500 million, even in 2021, the first year, which is I think where your math is coming from, and you're not giving any credit to what we're doing with $8 billion to $9 billion of cash proceeds. But, if you deploy that to share repurchase, in reality, that dollar you're quoting, then goes down to $0.60 to $0.70 in the range. So, thinking of in terms of percentage, you're closer to 15%. And we believe the answer is probably closer to 10%.","Peter Dannenbaum","Great. And Umer asked as well, what's included in NewCo?","Rob Davis","Yes. So, if you look at the other line, the other pharma line picks up a lot of our hospital and specialty products and picks up our products like ZERBAXA, which is still early in its launch, but a product, which we are very excited about. So, as we look at the portfolio, those products that are sitting in the hospital's specialty space are ones that we continue to believe long-term create value for us, and we want it to maintain. And then, there's other to be launched revenue numbers sitting in their or products that are smaller in there as well. So, it really is the profile of products different than what we put into the NewCo and are really aligned with the core growth drivers that we've already identified.","Peter Dannenbaum","And then, I think, Umer\u2019s last question was capital allocation priorities combined with the question about what our interest in BD might be. So, let's start with Rob and then turn it over to Ken.","Rob Davis","So, if you look at the capital allocation priorities, they really remain unchanged. First and foremost, we're going to ensure we appropriately fund research and development. We're going to fund the opportunity to launch new products. And we're going to fund the capacity expansion that we have underway to ensure we have the capacity to meet what is very strong demand across all of our growth pillars in vaccines, oncology and animal health. We remain committed to the dividend. We talked about that. You heard today, very importantly. We are not lowering the dividends as a result of the spin-off of NewCo. We're going to hold our dividend at $2.44, which is in 2020, and they grow it off of that base with the goal to get to 47% to 50% as a payout ratio. So, you're actually going to see a maintained dividend growing over time. And then, you have the benefit of the incremental dividend that NewCo is going to have. So, all-in-all, you should have overall more dividend, if you hold those stocks that we do today.","And then, finally, as we've always said, our goal is to use excess cash flow first and foremost for value-creating business development. To the extent though we can\u2019t find those or we don't find ones that bring us a combination of strategy and value, we will return excess cash to shareholders moving forward. And specifically, as you look at the $8 billion to $9 billion of special dividend we're going to receive from NewCo as result of this transaction, as we said in the comments, it will be deployed either to business development or to share repurchase and will not be used for debt pay-down. That's why we believe it\u2019ll be accretive over time.","Ken Frazier","Umer, this is Ken. I think, you also asked about spin versus split. We chose spin, because we thought that was the quickest path and a tax efficient way of doing this for our shareholders. As it relates to business development, I'll just say, as we\u2019ve always said, it's an important priority. And first and foremost, we are always looking for the best science and innovation that will drive long-term growth and value for shareholders. So, we're still very much focused on those deals right augment our pipeline. And you saw last year, we did a number of deals, about 80 transactions spanning licensing, technology deals and clinical collaborations. We\u2019ll continue to look for those opportunities to augment our pipeline with the best science.","Operator","Next one is Geoff Meacham of Bank of America.","Geoff Meacham","Just have a few. Rob, on the spin, I get the operating margin benefit to Merck longer term, but did I hear you right that op margins to be lower this year and post spin initially? And then, with freed up capital, does the spin effect where you guys have previously discussed on the moderation of R&D investments, looking to 2021, 2022? And then, Frank, real quick, you talked about the growth strategy in China for IO at this point with the NRDL decision in first line lung. I know you guys just got approval in this indication in November.","Rob Davis","So, on your question about operating margin, if you look at what NewCo is within Merck today, it's about 45%. So, it's obviously higher than the Merck's operating margin. So, it will be initially normally dilutive, when we pull it out in the first year. But, importantly, because of the fact we are getting the operating efficiencies, starting even in the first year of $500 million and then growing with an additional $500 million year two, another $500 million year three, so cumulative $1.5 billion. That offsets a lot of that dilution. And from that when you look at it, it's only about 1 percentage point of dilution to our op margin in the first year. And then, very quickly, you're going to see our operating margins continue to grow. And by the time we get to over 40% by 2024, we will be at a rate higher than we would have achieved as a combined company, largely as a result of that $1.5 billion operating efficiency.","And so, that was I think first question. The second one was what's happening with I think R&D as we look at going forward. So, we have never been capital constrained in what we're doing in R&D. What's driving the inflection point we talked about, which was the slowdown of growth in R&D in 2021 as a percent sales. It's still going to grow, it's going to grow, it\u2019s just going to grow slower than sales in 2021. That inflection point is driven more by where we see the clinical programs at this is time. If we find opportunities to invest and I'm confident given the productivity that we\u2019ve seen from the labs thus far that they very well might do that. We will obviously increase our investment as those opportunities present themselves. But as of right now, our expectation is that inflection point continues to happen in 2021.","Peter Dannenbaum","Frank?","Frank Clyburn","Geoff, in your question on China, I first wanted to make sure that we do mention that our primary focus is on ensuring the safety of our employees\u2019 families and supporting the people of China. I think, that's on all of our minds and also the continuity of supply of our Human Health medicines and vaccines and products. And we're going to have to see how China evolves, will likely see some impact in Q1 to really to quantify. As far as your specific question on IO, our overall strategy, as we discussed, in particular, as we rollout in the self-pay market, we still feel very confident on our position. We are still the only IO therapy that's approved in non-small cell lung cancer. We recently got approval for KEYNOTE-407 in the squamous cell carcinoma population. And we feel as though we have a very significant opportunity in the self-pay market. And we've also adjusted our patient assistance programs in China to increase the affordability for patients that we're trying to provide access to as we move forward. So, we feel confident going forward in our growth prospects for KEYTRUDA in China.","Operator","Next one is Seamus Fernandez of Guggenheim. Your question, please?","Seamus Fernandez","Thanks for the question. So, maybe just a follow-up on one of Steve's questions. The concentration of the business -- Merck's business to KEYTRUDA going forward. Can you just talk a little bit about the competitive pressure points that could emerge going forward, to talk a little bit about China. But, there also are potential Chinese assets that could be introduced into the U.S. following successful lung cancer clinical program. Just trying to get a better sense of the growth opportunity for KEYTRUDA and where you see potential pressure points? And if you could also comment on some of the administration's efforts around international pricing, again, a potential risk point for KEYTRUDA that would be helpful. And then, just as a follow-up on for Roger. Roger, how quickly the Company emphasized a lot of vaccines, opportunities for the business going forward. But most of them were Phase 1. How quickly could we see some of those programs advancing and potentially coming to market? And maybe you could just tell us, which one or two you're most excited to see in the near term? Thanks.","Peter Dannenbaum","Thanks. So, first, Frank, kind of the performance and outlook for KEYTRUDA.","Frank Clyburn","Yes. So, on KEYTRUDA, as far as -- if we look back at 2019, we're, one, very pleased with our growth of 58% excluding exchange and almost $4 billion and eclipsing $11 billion in sales. We feel very well positioned as we've been saying with regards to KEYTRUDA, not only with regards to our significant penetration in non-small cell lung cancer within the U.S., but also the significant impact that we're having for patients with renal cell carcinoma, adjuvant melanoma, head and neck, as you heard Roger mention are recent approval non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. So, the breadth of our indications and the strength of our data, gives us a lot of confidence to continue to grow, in particular, not only in the U.S., but ex-U.S. and especially as we roll out our broader indications in non-small cell lung cancer. And we're now reimbursed in Europe in all markets for lung, which I see is an important aspect of our growth in 2020.","The other thing I would add on the concentration piece too. I think, we tried to highlight that it\u2019s not just about KEYTRUDA, it's Lynparza, it's Lenvima, it's our pipeline in oncology that we've discussed. We also feel very good about our vaccine performance this year. GARDASIL this year grew 21%, as well as our hospital and specialty products. We continue to see good growth with BRIDION. So, from a concentration perspective, we feel very confident on the portfolio, not only KEYTRUDA, but the breadth of opportunities that we have going forward.","Peter Dannenbaum","Right. Ken, on pricing?","Ken Frazier","Okay. So, on that question specifically, we understand the administration's concerned that certain countries don't pay their fair share of the cost of innovation. We do keep continuing to make the point that incorporating additional price control is not the solution to the problem. We continue to work with the administration, the Congress and other stakeholders to provide a perspective. I think, patient groups are also providing very strong perspectives on these issues as it relates to that. But, if you take a step back and think about what we announced today, the reason why we're taking these kinds of proactive steps now is because we want to make sure that we position the Company for long-term growth and viability in the future environment. That's about being much more focused on innovation and it's about driving efficiency within our operating model. So, this is about staying ahead of the curve, rather than waiting until something happens in the pricing environment that we have to react to.","Peter Dannenbaum","And Roger on vaccines?","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","Right. Seamus, thanks for the question. On vaccines, first of all, as you recognize, we have an enormously large program in pneumococcal conjugate vaccines with V114 program having 15 Phase 3 studies that are rolling out over the next 18, 24 months. We're going to see a lot of those studies coming this year in fact. And so, you\u2019ll be hearing a lot of data from those studies, which will ultimately permit filing. So, that's a very near-term opportunity.","We have a lot of enthusiasm about our dengue virus vaccine. That vaccine incidentally is -- we are collaborating with colleagues at Butantan, where they have a registration-enabling study ongoing. And that study will deliver results at some point. So, that's pretty exciting as well. In addition, of course, we have our CMV vaccine. We have a lot of interesting things going on, respiratory syncytial virus. And those programs are actually fairly advanced. So, things are moving along quite well.","I can't fail to mention the fact that the demand for GARDASIL, GARDASIL 9 remains enormous. And we have invested a huge amount of capital together with our manufacturing colleagues in building the additional capability to meet that demand and that will be rolling out in not too longer time and it will be very important obviously for the Company.","Peter Dannenbaum","Great. We have several more questioners in queue. We're going to have a hard stop at 9.15, but we're going to keep going. Next question, please?","Operator","Next one is from Daina Graybosch of SVB Leerink. Go ahead, please?","Daina Graybosch","Thanks for the question. Two of them, first on NewCo. What do you see as the long-term relationship between NewCo and Merck? And then, the next question for Roger. As you reflect on all the internal and external immuno-oncology data that came out in 2019, what novel mechanisms are you most excited about, to add on top of KEYTRUDA to provide further benefit for patients?","Ken Frazier","Well, in terms of long-term relationship, that's to be decided as both companies look to their future and decide how they want to make sure that they optimize their best opportunities. So, I can't say anything other than what we've announced today in terms of the products that are going over. But, obviously what I would say about NewCo that makes me excited is I think they will have many of the same standards and values that Merck has going forward.","Peter Dannenbaum","Roger?","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","Yes. Thanks for the question, Daina. In many respects, so things we're most excited about, you can tell by looking at the things that we're investing in. You can see that quite remarkably, the Lenvima and as it's been demonstrated in the endometrial cancer registration combination with KEYTRUDA most recently, but we've also seen really spectacular data in renal cell carcinoma, we presented those Phase 2 data, and we have ongoing Phase 3 data, demonstrate that the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors with special characteristics can combine very effectively with KEYTRUDA. We also have data which we presented in combination with Lynparza that are very impressive. Let me have this very large set of new molecules, which -- some of which we referred to already that include antibodies directed against other potential checkpoints Lag-3, Tigit and a whole bunch of other things. And there really are quite provocative data available now already in those settings. We're hopeful that we'll begin to tease out how best to use those things in combination. So, lots of exciting things going on here.","Operator","Next one is from David Risinger of Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please.","Peter Dannenbaum","David, are you on the line?","David Risinger","Sorry. Yes. Can you hear me now?","Ken Frazier","Yes.","David Risinger","Great. So, I have a few questions. First, could you provide an update on where GARDASIL manufacturing supply stands and the GARDASIL revenue growth prospects in 2020? And then, Roger, could you discuss potential proof of concept results for Merck's early to mid stage pipeline to watch in 2020? And in addition, could you provide a framework for the timeline for the second pneumococcal vaccine that Merck is developing for infants, which would be added to V114 to offer broader coverage longer term? Thank you.","Peter Dannenbaum","Great. I think, the first question is on GARDASIL supply and outlook. So, Frank?","Frank Clyburn","Yes, Dave. So, with regard to GARDASIL, we do continue to see very strong demand around the world. Currently, our supply is not able to meet that demand. As we mentioned, we saw a growth of 21% this year. The growth we do believe will continue in 2020 will be slightly tempered from the rates you've seen in 2019 and 2018. And we're focused with our manufacturing colleagues to do everything we can with contract manufacturers in the near-term to try to help our supply. And then ultimately in 2023, as we've been mentioning, we'll be bringing on two new bulk manufacturing facilities that will really allow us to ramp our supply up to meet the strong demand that we're seeing globally.","Peter Dannenbaum","Roger?","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","David, on the early to mid stage pipeline, well, we've already discussed that in a lot of programs in oncology in combination with KEYTRUDA, but we have a lot of other areas as well that are moving forward. Of course, building on the results of vericiguat in heart failure, the Phase 3 data which will be presented in the results for the near future and which are quite interesting. We actually have a lot of other interesting things going on in soluble guanylate cyclase activators. So, that's an important area for us and something that we expect to see quite a lot of data on. And we're going to be seeing a lot of data on of course our vaccine programs that I mentioned just a few minutes ago. So, there will be a lot of data coming forward in 2020.","And speaking of vaccines, you mentioned the additional vaccine program. I think, you were referring to V117 in the pediatric context, which is not an add-on, but a separate and independent vaccine, all by itself. And that program, which we\u2019ve just given the name to, will be moving forward shortly. I\u2019d reemphasize that the V11 core program is very far advanced with lots of Phase 3 data coming forward this year and next year and will be a leading program in both adult and pediatric settings, ultimately V116 and V117 will provide further coverage. So, more to discuss there.","Operator","Next one is from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, please.","Terence Flynn","Just maybe a couple on the spin as well. Does this change at all how you approach M&A and business development from a timing perspective? Just wondering, if we shouldn't expect any sizable bolt-ons until after the spin's completed. And then, are there any tax rate implications that we need to consider? And then, any update on the path forward for KEYTRUDA in neoadjuvant breast cancer regarding discussions with FDA? And then, when can we expect your Phase 3 frontline data in metastatic triple-negative breast. And is that important in terms of the conversations with the regulators? Thank you.","Peter Dannenbaum","Okay. I think, we'll start with Ken and the timing of BD and our strategy around that.","Ken Frazier","I expect to see no change in our approach to BD from a timing or strategy standpoint, as a result of the spin. We still see the need to augment our pipeline going forward, and we see opportunities and we're going to be very focused on that.","Rob Davis","Yes. And I would add to that point, and then I'll address the tax question. As I said in the prepared remarks, but it's worth reemphasizing, we will have ample capital to do anything we want to do. So, this also in a way constraints us from a capital perspective. But, with regards to the tax rate, generally speaking, you should not see any meaningful change to our tax rate as a result of this transaction.","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","Right. And Terence, with respect to neoadjuvant breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, of course the 522 data we presented at ESMO, the effective neoadjuvant in that setting, in terms of pathologic complete response is very clear. And we also had very provocative event-free survival data that we discussed. There is more data that will be coming forward in that. And we continue to have conversations with regulatory agencies about that study. And you're right, as we have an ongoing Phase 3 study in triple-negative breast cancer 355 that could yield data in principal, that would have an impact on thinking with regard to the neoadjuvant study, but of course we have to wait to see the data. So, that should be coming forward sometime relatively soon as well. It's event-driven, of course. I don't know exactly when.","Peter Dannenbaum","Great. We're going to squeeze in one last question please, Carlo.","Operator","Last one is Mara Goldstein from Mizuho. Go ahead, please.","Mara Goldstein","Great. Thanks very much. Just a quick question on NewCo spin-off and the targets around achieving an R&D organization and how should we think about that from a metric perspective? And then, just quickly on China, I know we've covered it, but Merck has spoken to China as a component of growth strategy on a go-forward basis. And understanding that KEYTRUDA has been a part of that but Merck has other portfolio of products in China, so I'm wondering how much of NewCo's business is responsible for the growth in that region and how RemainCo will be able to advance its growth initiative in the absence of NRDL listing, which didn't occur as expected?","Peter Dannenbaum","So, the first question I believe was on R&D metrics around NewCo. Rob or Kevin, I don't think we have much to add there at this point.","Rob Davis","No. And clearly, I would just say that as we think about the 35% operating margin growing over time that contemplates investments in research and development in the business. And so, it is fully covered. There is an assumption that they will be doing R&D moving forward. And we feel like it's been adequately covered in a way we resource the investments in the business. And, I don\u2019t if Kevin wanted to add anything about the R&D other than what he said earlier.","Kevin Ali","I think just to recap what we said earlier that over time we'll build more of the research and development capabilities as we start to do meaningful business development and start to see opportunities to start to do development.","Peter Dannenbaum","Great. And the second question?","Kevin Ali","China growth.","Peter Dannenbaum","China growth. Yes.","Frank Clyburn","This is Frank. With China, as we\u2019ve discussed, we're very pleased with the growth this year of 58%. And our growth, to your point, is very broad based, it's KEYTRUDA, it's GARDASIL, it's Lynparza, it's Lenvima, it's our innovative portfolio has done very well, Januvia is on the NRDL, Zepatier, Zepatier was recently placed on the NRDL. So, we see our growth going forward in China and we see significant opportunities. Obviously, as I mentioned, we're all thinking about the coronavirus, we'll have to see how that unfolds, but nothing has changed in the mid to long-term about our opportunities in China.","Ken Frazier","Thank you all for joining us today. As I said in our third quarter call, we are confident but we're not complacent, and this separation is evidence of just that. We are convinced that the decision is the right one for the business and we believe that now is the right time to capitalize on a position of strength to secure even stronger future for Merck. As a more focused research-intensive biopharmaceutical company, we'll be better positioned to carry out our mission of inventing to save and improve lives and drive lasting value for the patients and shareholders we exist to serve. Thank you very much.","Peter Dannenbaum","Thank you all.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for attending.

At this time I'd like to welcome everyone to the Q3 2015 sales and earnings call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Teri Loxam. Please go ahead.","Teri Loxam - Investor Contact","Thank you, Darla, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to Merck's Third Quarter 2015 Conference Call. Today I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; Adam Schechter, President of Global Human Health; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Labs.","Before I turn the call over to Ken, I want to point out a couple of items. First, you will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items. You should note that we've excluded these items from our non-GAAP results and provided a reconciliation of these items in Table 2 of our press release. We've also provided a table to help you understand the sales results in the quarter for the business units and products, which can be found in Table 3 of our press release. During the call we may refer to Table 2 for the P&L and Table 3 as it relates to revenue.","Second, I would like to remind you that some of the statements we make during today's call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current belief of Merck's management and are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.","Our SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2014 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that cause \u2013 that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements and you can see our SEC filings as well as today's earnings release on merck.com.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Teri. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining the call this morning. Before we review our third quarter results, I want to reinforce a few fundamental points about Merck. Our company has had a long history of success in translating scientific discoveries into novel and highly differentiated medicines and vaccines that provide major therapeutic and economic value. Our R&D-focused strategy aims to drive future growth and shareholder value in the same manner. We believe that the evolving characteristics and dynamics of global healthcare increasingly underscore this ability to provide high-value innovation is what will be \u2013 what distinguishes successful companies going forward.","This approach is evidenced by our late-stage pipeline and ongoing launches, which reflect scientific and therapeutic progress in some of the world's most challenging area's unmet medical need including cancer, antibiotic resistance, cardiometabolic disease, hepatitis C, and Alzheimer's disease, all areas where we have both near- and longer-term opportunities to create beneficial returns for patients, society, and shareholders. Our broad, global, and balanced portfolio of medicines and vaccines allows us to weather periodic volatility within a particular therapeutic area or region while consistently focusing on the best scientific and medical opportunities.","Speaking of focus, we've been investing our resources to grow our strongest brands and to support the most promising assets in our pipeline while, at the same time, lowering our overall cost base and delivering a leveraged P&L. We restored the JANUVIA franchise to growth. We established an oncology business unit and accelerated the development of KEYTRUDA, which was the first anti-PD-1 to market in the U.S. We reinforced our leadership in hospital acute care, specifically in antibiotic resistance, and have continued to drive positive results in vaccines. We are executing well on our strategy, advancing our pipeline in commercial portfolio both internally as well as externally through business development, all while delivering significant capital returns to shareholders.","In the third quarter, we reported solid top line performance achieving strong results in our core focus areas, which coupled with thoughtful cost management, translated to bottom line growth. Rob and Adam will provide more detail on our financial, operational, and commercial performance this past quarter. On the R&D front, our research organization continues to make major strides, accomplishing several important milestones this quarter, which Roger will review in detail in a few minutes. Progress in our oncology and hepatitis C programs underscores and exemplifies our ongoing commitment to pursuing science in the areas where we can have the greatest impact while driving long-term growth.","On a separate but meaningful note, we were especially proud to mention that, recently, our own William Campbell, Dr. William Campbell, was jointly named the 2015 Nobel Prize winner in Physiology or Medicine for his work in the discovery of MECTIZAN. More than 2 billion free treatments later, the results speak for themselves as river blindness is in the process of being eliminated around the world. As you may know, this honor is rarely bestowed on a scientist whose research was conducted in a company setting. We are delighted for our retired colleague, Dr. Campbell, who is an inspiration for our Merck colleagues around the world.","In closing, Merck is well positioned for a solid finish in 2015. Our results for the quarter and year-to-date reflect the company's disciplined focus and investment of resources on the internal and external opportunities that can generate sustainable value for society and shareholders. In doing so, we intend to continue to play a leading role in helping to shape the future of health for populations around the world.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to my colleague, Rob Davis.","Robert M. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Our performance for the third quarter is evidence of our continued focus on execution. We delivered solid financial results and a leveraged P&L in the quarter as we saw a return to growth as exchanged on both the top and bottom lines. Total company revenues of $10.1 billion in the quarter decreased 5% versus the third quarter of 2014. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, total revenue grew 2% this quarter and grew 4% if you further exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. In addition to strong results for Global Human Health, which Adam will discuss in a few minutes, Animal Health grew 7% in the quarter excluding exchange. This growth was driven by an increase in sales of companion animal products, primarily BRAVECTO, as well as new aqua and swine products.","As a result of our performance in the first nine months of the year, we are narrowing our revenue guidance range and increasing the midpoint. We now expect full year 2015 revenue to be $39.2 billion to $39.8 billion at current exchange rates.","Turning to the other parts of the P&L. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 75.1% in the quarter, an increase of 80 basis points year-over-year primarily driven by lower inventory write-offs. We remain focused on driving additional productivity through improvements in our operating model as total non-GAAP operating expenses were approximately $160 million lower this quarter. Marketing and administrative expense, which declined 7% versus prior year, was partially offset by a modest increase in research and development. We continue to expect full year 2015 non-GAAP operating expenses will be lower than they were in 2014. In addition, we are pleased to report that we have met and will exceed our annual target of $2.5 billion in net savings versus 2012 by the end of this year.","Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.6%. Given our results year-to-date, we expect the full year rate to be at the lower end of our overall guidance range of 23% to 24%. Taken together, we earned $0.96 per share on a non-GAAP basis in the third quarter, delivering 7% growth on the bottom line and significant P&L leverage. This marks our second sequential quarter of year-over-year earnings growth taking into account headwinds from foreign exchange for net acquisitions and divestitures, and is continued proof of our efforts to manage our business and execute on our strategy. Given our continued expectation of strong operational performance in the fourth quarter, we are increasing the top and bottom ends of our full-year non-GAAP EPS guidance range to $3.55 to $3.60.","Finally, in addition to investing in our business and looking for opportunities to bolster our pipeline with external innovation, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases. To that end, we were able to take advantage of market conditions in the latter half of the quarter and repurchase additional shares opportunistically, nearly doubling the amount of repurchases in the prior quarter. Given these additional repurchases, we now expect to return approximately $4 billion to shareholders via share repurchases in 2015.","The third quarter was another demonstration of strong execution. We remain committed to delivering a leveraged P&L through our focus on expense management, while also ensuring we make appropriate investments on our broad portfolio of commercial and pipeline opportunities.","Now I'll turn the call over to Adam.","Adam H. Schechter - Executive VP & President-Global Human Health","Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Excuse me. This morning I'll discuss the third quarter results for Global Human Health and my comments will be on a constant currency basis.","This quarter, we continued to drive growth within our core business while executing on our new product launches. As a result, worldwide Human Health sales increased 6%, driven by sales growth in the United States and emerging markets, partially offset by declines in Europe and Japan. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide sales grew 3%. Our global growth was primarily driven by our diabetes, hospital acute care, and oncology businesses.","Beginning with diabetes and our JANUVIA franchise, our results continue to reflect the strength and the importance of these products and our commitment to grow JANUVIA and the DPP-4 class. With nine years on the market, physicians are comfortable with and confident in the efficacy and safety that JANUVIA offers to patients with type 2 diabetes. In the third quarter, JANUVIA franchise sales reached approximately $1.6 billion and grew 17%. In the United States, sales grew 22%. Timing of customer buying significantly benefited the third quarter by approximately $100 million. This will have an adverse impact in the fourth or subsequent quarters. The best way to understand the underlying performance is through TRx trends.","Through continued execution of our strategy, we drove underlying volume growth of about 4%. We are encouraged by the volume trends as we head into the fourth quarter and into 2016. In the international markets, which represent nearly half of our diabetes business, JANUVIA franchise sales reached approximately $675 million and grew 12%. We drove double digit growth in Europe and emerging markets, which was partially offset by slight declines in Japan. Diabetes is a progressive disease that affects hundreds of millions of patients worldwide. Many patients require more than one medication to treat the disease. We continue to see opportunities to grow JANUVIA as a preferred add-on therapy in global markets.","Next, in immunology. Combined sales of REMICADE and SIMPONI were approximately $620 million, a decline of 5%. SIMPONI grew 25% but growth was offset by 13% decline in REMICADE sales. As expected, we continue to see additional competitive impact from biosimilars across Europe. We expect declines in REMICADE will continue to accelerate in the fourth quarter and throughout 2016. In hospital acute care, global sales reached approximately $985 million. Excluding the impact of our acquisition of Cubist, sales grew 7%. We drove growth for BRIDION and our portfolio of antibiotic and antifungal treatments. We continue to see this segment as a growth driver and expect to solidify our position as a global leader in hospital acute care with our emerging pipeline products. Additionally, our teams are preparing to launch BRIDION later this year in the U.S.","Turning now to the vaccine business, vaccine sales were approximately $1.6 billion, a decline of 3% versus the prior year. GARDASIL franchise growth was more than offset by declines in PROQUAD due to the timing of sales activity related to the CDC stockpile and continued near-term competitive pressure for PNEUMOVAX. Combined sales of GARDASIL and GARDASIL 9 grew 7% to approximately $625 million with continued growth in the U.S. GARDASIL 9 accounted for approximately 80% of HBV sales in the U.S. This result is a testament to our team's strong execution in securing managed care access and their ability to transition customers to the new 9-valent vaccine.","ZOSTAVAX global sales increased 1% to approximately $180 million. Growth in ex-U.S. markets was partially offset by a slight decline in the U.S. resulting from a delayed start to the flu season. As we've indicated previously, we do see some seasonal fluctuations in ZOSTAVAX sales with increases in vaccination rates when patients visit their doctors or their pharmacists to receive a flu shot. Now that the flu season has begun, we have launched a new DTC campaign to drive future growth. Outside of the U.S., we continue to launch in more than 25 markets and there remains significant opportunity for ZOSTAVAX globally. We remain confident in the proven efficacy and safety that comes from the single dose regimen of ZOSTAVAX.","Now I'm excited to share with you some updates from a few of our launch products, and I'll start with KEYTRUDA. We continue to be pleased with our execution of the KEYTRUDA launch. Global sales for KEYTRUDA were approximately $160 million in the third quarter, an increase of 45% compared to the second quarter of this year. Importantly, our strong launch in melanoma has provided physicians with valuable experience using KEYTRUDA, with its durable efficacy results and convenient dosing schedule of every three weeks. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA retains approximately 70% of anti-PD-1 patient share in melanoma. And it's the number one therapy to treat melanoma in the United States across all classes of treatment.","Internationally, KEYTRUDA is launching in approximately 40 markets including the EU, with a product that's approved for use in advanced first and second-line melanoma. Our teams are working tirelessly to secure pricing and reimbursement, and recent recommendations from NICE in the UK are helping to secure timely access for patients.","Additionally, we are enthusiastic about expanding our launch of KEYTRUDA to patients suffering from lung cancer. In the few weeks since FDA approval, our teams have reached a majority of high-volume prescribers for this important new indication. Early customer feedback is encouraging and we're confident about the uptake of KEYTRUDA over time, as customers build in PD-L1 testing as a common practice in lung cancer diagnosis to inform treatment decisions.","We are still in the very early days of the KEYTRUDA launch and life cycle. With approvals in lung cancer and melanoma, and one of the broadest clinical programs in the industry, studying over 30 different tumor types, we are very excited about the promise KEYTRUDA offers to patients suffering from cancer now and in the future.","Moving to BELSOMRA, we continue to be encouraged by the early days of the BELSOMRA launch in the U.S. and Japan. In the U.S., we initiated a branded DTC campaign in August and we're already seeing steady demand increases from both new and current customers. Brand awareness continues to increase for both physicians and for patients. Finally, our teams are preparing for the launch of our hepatitis C doublet in the U.S., the EU, and other global markets. Merck has an important legacy in bringing innovative treatments for HCV to the market. We have maintained our global footprint and our relationships in the HCV community. Our teams are ready and they're extremely excited to launch.","In summary, Global Human Health delivered another solid quarter. We grew through execution in core areas of diabetes, hospital acute care, and oncology, and we continue to gain momentum with our key new product launches.","Now I'll turn the call over to Roger.","Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - EVP & President-Merck Research Laboratories","Thanks, Adam. The third quarter saw continued progress in late-stage development, especially in our oncology and infectious disease programs, with new results, new regulatory approvals, and new partnerships. First with respect to KEYTRUDA, our PD-1-directed monoclonal antibody designed to promote activation of tumor-directed immune responses, at the end of the quarter, we obtained accelerated approval from the FDA for the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer in the salvage setting. This approval was based on the response rate seen in patients with advanced disease whose tumors expressed PD-L1 in 50% or more tumor cells.","Accelerated approval of KEYTRUDA required that we have a confirmatory study underway, and this study was called KEYNOTE-010. The final top line results from KEYNOTE-010 study were announced yesterday. Briefly, the KEYNOTE-010 study randomized 1,034 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who had failed at least one prior systemic therapy to treatment with either docetaxel, a standard chemotherapeutic agent used in this setting, or to KEYTRUDA. Patients enrolled in this study were quite ill, typically with stage 4 disease and evidence of metastases, including brain metastases in many cases. KEYTRUDA was administered either at the approved dose of 2 milligrams per kilogram given every three weeks or an investigational dose of 10 milligrams per kilogram every three weeks.","All patients enrolled in the study had tumors that expressed PD-L1 in at least 1% of cells. However, statistical testing for the primary endpoint was performed first in the population of individuals whose tumors had very high expression of PD-L1, that's equal to or greater than 50% which permitted the subsequent analysis of the entire population, including all of those whose tumors expressed PD-L1 in at least 1% but fewer than 50% of tumor cells.","As we announced yesterday, the KEYNOTE-010 results were unambiguous. The administration of KEYTRUDA as compared with docetaxel improved the overall survival of patients with non-small cell lung cancer, irrespective of the proportion of cells that expressed PD-L1 as judged by immunohistochemistry. There was no meaningful difference observed between the 2 milligram per kilogram dose of KEYTRUDA, the approved dose, and the investigational 10 milligram per kilogram dose. A result that mirrors what we have previously seen in the melanoma setting.","I should emphasize that the KEYNOTE-010 study enrolled patients with both squamous and non-squamous cell histologies in about the ratio that one would expect on the basis of the epidemiology of lung cancer. KEYNOTE-010 is a large multinational randomized controlled clinical trial and, of course, there's a great deal more information relevant to the outcomes of patients treated with KEYTRUDA as compared with docetaxel that can be distilled from the study.","We anticipate presenting the results of KEYNOTE-010 at a scientific meeting in the near future and expect to submit the data for review by regulatory authorities before the end of the year. Beyond KEYNOTE-010, we continue to explore the utility of KEYTRUDA therapy and patients with non-small cell lung cancer at an early stage in the evolution of the disease. We have two ongoing first-line studies addressing this issue. Our KEYNOTE-024 study is now fully enrolled and our somewhat larger KEYNOTE-042 study is enrolling well.","We have previously shown that KEYTRUDA improves overall survival when used as first-line therapy in patients with advanced melanoma. These data are included in our European label for KEYTRUDA and are currently under review on a priority basis at the FDA. We expect to complete label discussions with the agency regarding both our KEYNOTE-002 and KEYNOTE-006 studies in the fourth quarter.","In evaluating KEYTRUDA, we have sought to broaden the impact of this therapy still further by combining with other immune manipulations. Along these lines, we recently announced the expansion of our collaboration with Incyte Pharmaceuticals (sic) [Incyte Corporation] testing whether their IDO1 inhibitor could increase tumor regression in patients simultaneously receiving KEYTRUDA. Early data from this collaboration will be presented at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer meetings in November.","Lastly, I should again note that we have an exceptionally broad program exploring the utility of KEYTRUDA treatment. We have embarked upon registration-enabling studies in more than 10 different tumor types, are exploring the utility of KEYTRUDA treatment in 20 additional cancers, and have evidence of tumor responses in about two dozen different types of malignancies. Earlier today, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan announced the first set of so-called SAKIGAKE products, those given fast-track review status, which included KEYTRUDA for the treatment of advanced unresectable gastric cancer. Clearly, the spectrum of activity of KEYTRUDA appears to be extraordinarily broad.","Turning now to infectious diseases, during the third quarter, the European Commission ratified the use of ZERBAXA for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal or urinary tract infection. Also during the quarter, we had the opportunity to present the results from bezlotoxumab, our monoclonal antibody directed against a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile. As we discussed at the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, a single intravenous administration of bezlotoxumab significantly reduced recurrence of C. difficile infection as compared with standard therapy. We anticipate submitting these data for regulatory review before the end of the year.","As we announced last quarter, our combination therapy containing grazoprevir and elbasvir for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection is undergoing priority review in the United States with a PDUFA date of January 28 and accelerated assessment in the European Union. Regulatory agencies are making good progress in reviewing our files and we are responding to questions from both FDA and the CHMP. Additional data from our hepatitis C virus program will be presented at the Liver Disease meetings [The Liver Meeting] next month, including the efficacy of grazoprevir\/elbasvir in more challenging patient populations, and Phase 2 data from the analysis of our nucleoside polymerase inhibitor, MK-3682, used in combination with grazoprevir\/elbasvir and other agents in our antiviral arsenal, including MK-8408, an especially potent NS5A inhibitor.","Our program is based on the idea that we can advance an antiviral regimen with broad activity across HCV genotypes, and that can be used in patients irrespective of comorbidities with shorter courses of therapy designed to improve adherence. Using this approach, we are optimistic that substantial control of HCV-imposed liver disease can be achieved for tens of millions of infected patients around the world.","During the third quarter we received marketing authorization in Japan for MARIZEV, our once-weekly DPP-4 inhibitor generically known as omarigliptin. We continue to assemble data supporting the filing of omarigliptin in the United States, which we plan to complete before the end of the year.","In the area of cardiovascular medicine, we are working with our partner Bayer to evaluate data obtained from Phase 2b study of vericiguat in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. We expect to have the opportunity to present these data at upcoming scientific meetings and are considering various options for registration-enabling clinical trials.","With respect to anacetrapib, our potent once daily CETP inhibitor, we are obviously aware of the termination of Lilly's Phase 3 study of evacetrapib, another CETP inhibitor, for futility. In a sense, this result increases the importance of our large Phase 3 outcome study called REVEAL. Our IMPROVE-IT data, which became available a year ago, demonstrated that reductions in serum LDL cholesterol levels, whether achieved using statins or using the cholesterol absorption inhibitor, ezetimibe, had predictable and similar effects on the risk of major cardiovascular events.","Since CETP inhibitors also dramatically reduce serum LDL cholesterol levels, it is now especially important to know whether this biochemical effect is associated with lower cardiovascular risk. Our REVEAL study is explicitly powered to see this effect. Six months ago, we reported that the REVEAL Steering Committee wished to adjust the primary endpoint to substitute ischemic stroke for revascularization, reflecting evidence from IMPROVE-IT where a benefit was observed on the incidence of this more easily adjudicated endpoint.","After discussions with regulatory agencies, however, this change was deemed inadvisable. Hence, as of today, the Steering Committee plans to continue along the path originally outlined in the study protocol. There will be an interim analysis before the end of the year. In light of the results obtained with evacetrapib, it is anticipated that a futility component will be included in this analysis.","We achieved meaningful progress in many other important programs in the third quarter, including completion of enrollment in our Phase 3 Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease study with Verubecestat, our highly potent BACE inhibitor, completion of enrollment of all 11 of our Phase 3 studies for ertugliflozin, a collaborative effort with Pfizer, to develop a novel SGLT2 inhibitor, and commitment to regulatory filing of two new diabetes programs, omarigliptin in the United States and insulin glargine, which we are pursuing in collaboration with our colleagues at Samsung Bioepis.","However, I would like to close by again acknowledging Dr. William C. Campbell who will receive the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for research conducted in collaboration with Dr. Satoshi Omura of Japan. Dr. Campbell performed his Nobel Prize-winning work, identifying the parasiticide, ivermectin, here at Merck, where he was employed from 1957 until 1990. Dr. Campbell's steadfast commitment to fundamental research has preserved the sight of millions of people around the globe. People who were otherwise condemned to early blindness from onchocerciasis. My colleagues and I at Merck Research Laboratories, including quite a few who overlapped with Dr. Campbell at our Rahway site, offer our congratulations for this important and well-deserved recognition of his accomplishments.","I'll now turn the call back to Teri.","Teri Loxam - Investor Contact","Thanks, Roger. Darla, we're ready to move on to the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher T. Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much for the questions. The first one is can you just elaborate a little bit more on your view of JANUVIA and the broader oral diabetes landscape following the recent SGLT2 outcomes data? I guess, do you see incremental pressure to this franchise as that data is reflected on competitor labels? And then maybe as a follow-up to that, can you just update the timelines of your SGLT2 and when you'll have outcomes data?","And my second question was on KEYTRUDA in lung and the commercial dynamics based on the recent approval and now the KEYNOTE-010 study. I guess how do you see the dynamics playing out here relative to Bristol, given the label differences between the products and just given the various moving piece of these two products? I'd just like to understand a little bit how you're thinking about the coming quarters on that one. Thanks so much.","Adam H. Schechter - Executive VP & President-Global Human Health","Yeah, so this is Adam, Chris. I'll start off by reviewing JANUVIA and I'll give some color on lung. But I'll also ask Roger to jump in on your SGLT2 question. If you look at JANUVIA, we continue to be pleased with the underlying demand in the U.S. where we're seeing about 4% TRx volume growth. And that's been consistent since before EMPA-REG and after EMPA-REG. And if you look at the most recent current week, it's just over 3% still. So we're seeing the underlying volume continue to be strong. If you look at what's occurring in the marketplace and you look at NBRx data, which is like real early data to try to understand the dynamics early in the marketplace, we see switching that's occurring within the SGLT2 class, but we do not see switching occurring across classes at this point in time.","We believe that this market is very big. It requires multiple medications for people over time, and we believe that JANUVIA will maintain a very strong add-on position as we go into the future. So we remain optimistic about the promise of JANUVIA into the marketplace. We're not giving 2016 guidance today. As I look at managed care, those decisions have been made for 2016 and I'll say that our formulary position in 2016 remains strong and very similar to what it was in 2015.","Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - EVP & President-Merck Research Laboratories","Yeah, and, Chris, it's Roger. With respect to the timing of SGLT2 results for ertugliflozin, as I indicated, all 11 of our studies are fully enrolled and data will begin to roll out from those studies in 2016. We do have a cardiovascular outcome study. Those studies obviously take a longer period of time. The expectation for those studies is that data will be available around the 2019 timeframe. But of course in light of the results that were obtained by Lilly, BI and the EMPA-REG study, as we look at those results, there's interest in asking the more explicit question of whether ertugliflozin has the same kinds of effects on cardiovascular mortality, which could result in a slight change in the way we conduct our outcome study. And we'll have more commentary on that later, we're reviewing those issues. But that's basically where we stand at this point.","Adam H. Schechter - Executive VP & President-Global Human Health","And then, Chris, with regard to your question on lung for KEYTRUDA, so when we built the oncology business unit, we built it to maximize KEYTRUDA over the long term. And just like you saw, we were ready to launch melanoma, we were just as ready to launch lung. So we think that lung cancer's a very significant opportunity for KEYTRUDA and we think there is room for multiple products with KEYTRUDA and OPDIVO in that market.","If you look, we're still early in the launch but we're encouraged by customer feedback and just days after the approval, we got to 100% of our top 150 accounts, and we had over 5,500 customer interactions. And we're confident that the uptake will be good over time as customers build in PD-L1 testing as a common practice. And I think that's probably what your question is getting to with PD-L1 testing versus not testing for lung. And what I'd like to say about that is as you think about diagnostic testing, it's very common today for lung cancer. It's become standard and widespread for HER2, ALK and EGFR. So we believe that it will be standard over time for PD-L1 and it's just going to take time for it to become standard.","But our execution by our teams and the partners at Dako was very strong, along with our leading diagnostic centers. And we actually had the companion diagnostic available and accessible for patient sampling day one at the time of launch. So it allows the physicians to really have a different conversation with patients, depending on their PD-L1 expression. And I think that's important when you start to see the differences between low PD-L1 expressers and high PD-L1 expressers. It allows physicians to have better conversations.","So as we've said before, this is going to play out over time. Lung is an important indication. We think there's room for multiple drugs. We think PD-L1 testing over time will become increasingly important. And we're confident about KEYTRUDA moving forward.","Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - EVP & President-Merck Research Laboratories","And just to emphasize what Adam said, there is no doubt that a PD-L1 expression, while an imperfect biomarker, does have predictive value in the lung cancer setting with respect to responses to anti-PD-1 therapy. And that has been observed. Although we've pioneered those studies, that's been observed by everyone who's looked at this kind of therapy.","Teri Loxam - Investor Contact","Darla, if you can move on to the next question, please.","Operator","It's from Tim Anderson with Bernstein.","Timothy M. Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Going back to KEYTRUDA, do you anticipate that in the U.S. you'll get reimbursed either by Medicare or by private payers in PD-L1 negative patients? The NCCN Compendium came out just in the last couple of days, and it recommends your drug in PD-L1 positive patients. It doesn't specify any cutoff for that positivity. So it's a fair chunk of patients. But I'm wondering from here if you can actually \u2013 if you think you can negotiate with payers such that you'll actually get broad coverage, which would go above and beyond what NCCN recommends or what your label actually recommends.","And then another question on hep C. Just talking about commercially how the doublet might kind of play into existing therapies that are out there, can you make any directional comments at all on pricing, for example? My guess is that as a later entrant in the category, you might have to come in at a discount. Ken, I think on certain settings you've implied that that may not happen and that you may not play the price card. But can you talk about how you view the competitive dynamics in that category with your doublets, specifically as you go into 2016?","Adam H. Schechter - Executive VP & President-Global Human Health","Hi, Tim. This is Adam. So I'll start with, obviously, the NCCN Guidelines were just updated. We received the information last Friday evening, and it's done by an outside agency with no input from us. And we did see that they recommended KEYTRUDA side-by-side with nivo as a preferred option in treatment of algorithm for second-line non-small lung.","The updates are very recent. We expect that payers will take some time to interpret the guidelines on how they'll reimburse the use of KEYTRUDA. But anecdotally, when we talk to our customers, they are going to follow NCCN. They will not go outside of NCCN. So we think that this is positive. We also think the fact that we now have the new KEYNOTE-010 data will help us in the future as well, because these guidelines were issued Friday night before we even put the top line results out on Monday. So that's where we are with NCCN.","What I'd like to do now is give you a sense of hepatitis C. And we know this market, and we know the players, and we know the managed care organizations very, very well. We have a very long legacy in HCV with interferon. And I think you saw our ability to execute with VICTRELIS. And we've had great success in the past. We expect to have success in the future. You see from the Phase 3 data, we believe we have an innovative, broadly competitive regimen, and there may be some advantages in some patient types, particularly CKD patients. And we believe that our data in cirrhotics is particularly strong.","So I don't want to give specifics about pricing strategies and contracting strategies, as I'm sure the competition would love to know what we're thinking there. But what I would say to you is that we intend to be serious about coming into this market strong, and we think there's a real opportunity for us.","Teri Loxam - Investor Contact","Next question, please, Darla.","Operator","It's from Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI.","Mark Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. Actually, I just had some IMAX questions for Teri. Is she there? I've been having trouble getting tickets to the latest Avengers movie and -anyway. Thank you very much for calling on me, and welcome Teri. It's great to have you there. A lot of my questions have been asked. So what I'll do is try to re-ask some to see if I can get better answers and ask some different ones.","First, on hep C pricing, Adam. Obviously, you're not \u2013 it's not in shareholders' interests or your interests to tip your hat on this, but the reason people are asking is that AbbVie, weeks before their negotiations with Express Scripts was saying \u2013 Rick Gonzalez was saying things like, we don't think we're going to really be using pricing, Mark. And then they cut price 50%.","So I guess when \u2013 I guess I'm just asking you, can you reassure the market that when you think about the hep C pricing, your internal hep C pricing scenarios, that something like a 50% cut, it isn't what you're thinking. It's more incremental. And you don't have to give us that number. Even that I think would relieve a lot of the, perhaps, pressure.","And then a question biosimilar REMICADE. I may have missed this. I had to hop off the call for a few minutes. But can you update us on market shares, Pan-European market shares for biosimilar REMICADE and what the average price discount is to branded REMICADE in tender and non-tender markets, or perhaps even both combined?","And the last one is for Ken and just big balance sheet, M&A, a lot of targets out there. You guys have been quite inactive since Cubist. I'd like to know if you, now that prices have come down 30% in biotech, if you're revving the engines. Thank you.","Adam H. Schechter - Executive VP & President-Global Human Health","Okay. So let me give it a start, Mark. And I'll say with hepatitis C, I don't want to give specifics. But all I'll say is when you have what's perceived to be an inferior profile in the marketplace, as I think AbbVie's product was, you may have a different strategy when you have a product that you think is competitive in the marketplace. And we believe that we have a competitive profile to be able to be successful in the marketplace.","With regard to biosimilar REMICADE, we're seeing most discounts of 30% to 45%. Maybe a little bit higher in some of the countries where there's been biosimilars for a longer period of time than in Core Europe. If you look at our market share, we have about a 90% market share as we go through the third quarter. That's down from about a 95% market share the prior quarter. And we believe that the pressure will continue because we've been able to hold on to a lot of the existing patients that are well-controlled and physicians don't want to switch. But we're starting to lose more and more new patients, and new patients, as you know, become more of a percent of the total as you go longer over time. So it would be a bit gradual, but it's going to continue to have impact. About 10% to 20% of the business per year is in new patients, just to give you a sense.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Mark. And on business development, let me just be really clear. We are very committed to doing the right kind of deals to create value for our shareholders and that augment our pipeline with programs that, as Roger would say, provide an unambiguous promotable advantage. That's what we've been doing over the past couple of years. You've seen Idenix, Cubist, OncoEthix, cCAM Biotherapeutics, just to name a few.","We're also today very confident that we have the right balance sheet to do whatever size deal we need to do, whether it's M&A or licensing. We've been very clear in the past that our preference is for bolt-on deals rather than the large consolidation-type mergers. But the fact of the matter is we will continue to pursue pipeline assets on a selective basis, meaning they have to be really important scientific breakthroughs and they also have to be capable of being acquired at a price that's valuable for our shareholders. And to your point, we have seen values go down over the last few weeks. And we're going to continue to look for those opportunities. So we are committed to it. Don't think if you haven't seen anything in the last couple of quarters that, that reflects any change whatsoever in our perspective.","Teri Loxam - Investor Contact","Thanks. Darla, we'll go on to the next one.","Operator","It's from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Ken, question for you. Just given the increasing pricing debate in the market, I'm just wondering if you can \u2013 I'm interested in your perspective on what you think happens to drug list price versus realized price. I mean clearly we have seen price increases increase over time. But we've also seen the phenomenon of increased rebates and discounts. So just given the increased focus on pricing, given the campaign rhetoric, which doesn't appear to be dying down any time soon, how do you expect the industry to respond to this growing debate? And I'm also surprised that the industry has been so silent given all the headline news. And I know that you have a leadership position within the industry and what your plans are to defend industry practices.","And, Roger, for you, just on the anacetrapib interim later this year, I guess, did you say later this year or early next, the interim on futility, are we going to \u2013 if the decision is to continue with the trial, are you going to let us know? Or I mean is no news good news in this case? How should we think about it? Thanks very much.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Teri Loxam - Investor Contact","Why don't we start with pricing?","Kenneth C. Frazier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So let me start with pricing. Good morning, Jami.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let me first remind everybody what I think is the most important thing, which is that we are, at Merck, entering a period of unprecedented advances in human biology, and we have immense opportunities to advance patient care as well as public health. Unfortunately, I think the current discussion around pricing fails to account for the fact this industry is hardly homogeneous. There are a lot of companies, as you know, that purchase drugs, many of them older drugs. They raise the prices to whatever they feel the market will bear while significantly reducing or eliminating investment in R&D.","Merck has not been that kind of company. Obviously, we invest in R&D to bring forward important products like KEYTRUDA. But we've also tried to approach pricing from the perspective of value. And I recently had the opportunity to actually meet with the President of the United States in his office and we had this conversation. And I think there's a lot of rhetoric around the industry. As a leader of pharma, I try very hard to distinguish between the innovation-based companies that do take a value approach to pricing, and a few companies that I think are unrepresentative of the entire industry.","If you don't see it in the newspapers, recognize that there's a little bit of a filter between what we say and what actually gets reported in the newspapers, but we're going to continue to make that point. And I have to say that I believe that while there's a lot of noise out there, my experience in Washington is that people do recognize that this industry is important, that these innovations are critical to society, that we, for example, need a disease-modifying agent for Alzheimer's. People see what these immuno-oncology drugs are doing and they know that, that's just the beginning of what we can do as an industry.","So I think you have to separate a little bit of the rhetoric and the newspaper reports from the fact that I think there's a lot of rationality in public policy. And people recognize that this is an industry that contributes greatly to global society as one of the strongest industries in the U.S. economy.","Teri Loxam - Investor Contact","Thanks, Ken. Roger, do you want to comment on anacetrapib?","Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - EVP & President-Merck Research Laboratories","Yeah, Jami, in light of the evacetrapib futility results, there will be a futility analysis incorporated into the interim analysis of anacetrapib, which will be conducted before the end of this year. And if \u2013 obviously, if we were to decide that \u2013 if our Steering Committee came back and said that it is futile, obviously, we will announce that. If they don't, then we will announce in the appropriate forum that the study is continuing.","I wouldn't overinterpret that, though. I wouldn't look at that and say, oh, well, that means it must be working. What it means is it's not futile. It could work. And so it will be one or the other result. I think it is important to include \u2013 and I've made the point in talking with the Steering Committee members that it is important to include this kind of analysis, because we wouldn't want to be exposing people to the drug if there's no hope of showing a benefit.","Teri Loxam - Investor Contact","Thanks, Roger. Darla, let's move on to the next one, please.","Operator","It's from Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. First, you mentioned the diabetes franchise was a little weak in Japan. Can you talk about what's going on there and is that because you have this new product, the once-weekly, that just got approved? Was that having any impact? And how you think that plays out over there? And then second, can you talk about the gross margin a little bit, just the underlying gross margin, what's being impacted by currency, what's going on there and how you're thinking about that? And no one has really asked about expenses. Maybe you can talk about just the underlying numbers. I mean is this a good run rate to be thinking about for how Merck is spending? What are some of the push pulls on spending over the next 12 months?","Thanks.","Adam H. Schechter - Executive VP & President-Global Human Health","Sure, Marc. I'll cover the question on diabetes in Japan. Japan remains a very important market. In fact, if you look at DPP-4 inhibitors, it's one of the few markets in the world where DPP-4 inhibitors actually have more patient days of therapy than metformin does or (47:51). So it's always been a fast uptake market for DPP-4 use. And for JANUVIA we have a very high share. So the issue there is it's harder to grow because you can't take share away from (48:03) as much because you already have the leading product in the marketplace.","We are launching our once-weekly and we think that could be a very important product. It's under two-week prescription limit right now, but that, over time, will be removed. And we think that, that will help us potentially expand the DPP-4 class even into earlier lines of treatment. Overall, it was down about 2% versus prior year in Japan, so it wasn't a significant decrease versus the prior year. And part of that is also customer timing.","Robert M. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And with regard to your question on gross margin, so if you look at the drivers of gross margin, by far the largest driver was the fact that we had lower inventory write-offs than we've had in the past. So that was the single biggest item. FX was favorable in the quarter in the margin, but again, the bigger driver was inventory write-offs. And also recall that part of why we're seeing a lift in gross margin year-on-year is the fact that with the divestitures we did last year, primarily at MCC, you do get a favorable lift as a result of just the mix of those businesses.","If you look from an expense perspective, recall that as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did meet and we are exceeding our target of $2.5 billion of expense reduction relative to our 2012 base. So we've delivered on what we expected to do there. If you look at what's happening on a spend basis, obviously, we are investing in R&D and, in fact, R&D was up a little bit. It was funded by overall reductions across marketing and administrative spend.","I don't want to get into specific guidance as you look forward, but to say we continue to be committed to driving a leveraged P&L as we look into the future, balancing the need to drive cost reductions as an ongoing part of the business, really, with a focus more on how do we drive productivity as we invest in the future around key new product launches and, obviously, the R&D pipeline and what we have coming there. So I would say our story is really shifting from absolute cost reduction to productivity and leverage going forward is the way I would look at it.","Teri Loxam - Investor Contact","Thanks, Rob. Darla, let's move on to the next one.","Operator","It's from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good quarter on the KEYTRUDA progress. Just following up on KEYTRUDA, do you anticipate that most of the PD-L1 testing in lung cancer will be done with the diagnostic test that was approved with KEYTRUDA? Or will it depend on which test the lab chooses? Because your label is obviously not restricted. And a follow-up for Roger if I \u2013 apologies if I missed it. But when can we expect data for your next generation immuno-oncology product? Thank you.","Adam H. Schechter - Executive VP & President-Global Human Health","Yeah, so I'll start off with the question on the testing. I think \u2013 right now, I think a lot of the PD-L1 testing, particularly outside of the large hospitals, institutions, will be done through the approved PD-L1 tests that are available. I do think even today some of the large institutions are doing their own PD-L1 testing. So I think, over time, it's very common for multiple tests to be available in the marketplace for various things like HER2 and so forth and I think that there'll be multiple different tests and the hospital and physicians will choose which ones they use in the future.","Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - EVP & President-Merck Research Laboratories","Yeah, and, Alex, it's Roger. I assume you want clinical data for next generation immuno-oncology products and we have several. But, for example, we have an anti-GITR antibody, which is an agonist antibody immune manipulator. We also have the CEACAM antibody that we acquired. And both of those are in Phase 1 clinical studies, the GITR antibody also in combination with KEYTRUDA. So we'll have the opportunity to see those data in 2016.","Teri Loxam - Investor Contact","Thanks, Roger. Darla, let's move on to the next one.","Operator","It's from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC","Oh, thanks very much for taking the question. So just a few here. First off, could you guys update us on why the Incyte agreement didn't include lung? Should we assume that lung is excluded from this? Or is that something that may require some additional negotiation going forward? Or is that, should we think of that as still a potential shot on goal for Merck? Second, can you talk a little bit more about the SGLT-2 programs? When might we see data from those? And should we expect a filing in 2016? And if you could, just let us know if that would include the single pill combination or if that would be filed separately, that would be great.","And then the last question really is on other indications for KEYTRUDA. You guys have an awful lot of patients in clinical trials and ongoing. Roger, you mentioned the opportunity to potentially see gastric cancer approval of KEYTRUDA in Japan sooner than I think many of us expect. So what other areas should we be thinking about in terms of additional KEYTRUDA filings? Or at least additional data or tumor types where you think Merck has a lead or a potential advantage?","Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - EVP & President-Merck Research Laboratories","Right. So, Seamus, first of all, with respect to the insight agreement, we have the bulk of data from the combination of KEYTRUDA with their IDO1 inhibitor in melanoma. And based on those data, you'll have a chance to see some of those data at the Society for Immunotherapy and Cancer meeting, as I mentioned in November. Based on those data, we, together, wanted very much to proceed into a late development. And that's what we're going to do. The agreement that we announced is about that. But it doesn't preclude doing other kinds of studies. And indeed, we have ongoing studies looking at other tumor types. So we'll get more information about that, and that will be helpful.","With respect to ertugliflozin, our SGLT-2 inhibitor program with Pfizer, again, all of the Phase 3 programs, all 11, are enrolled. Data will start rolling in. We'll have data in 2016. The filing will include the combination. It's not just by itself. And we do expect \u2013 we will decide on it, the filing, based, of course, on what the data looked like. But certainly we hope that if the data looked good, that we would be able to file the entire package in 2016.","And then the last question was other indications for KEYTRUDA. And there again, we have registration-enabling studies going on in more than 10 different tumor types. And an awful lot of new data become available actually on an almost weekly basis because we have so many different studies going on. But I would highlight to you that we have a lot of good data already in head and neck cancer, in bladder cancer. We're developing the drug in triple negative breast cancer. We're dropping the drug in classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, as I mentioned.","So as you could see, there's a lot going on. And where we see opportunities to pursue an accelerated approval pathway, we're certainly interested in that. But we're also, of course, doing more conventional studies, including studies in which we're looking at the question of whether or not we can identify biomarkers like micro-satellite instability that permit us to gain access to and bring benefit to an awful lot more patients with other tumors. So it's a broad portfolio.","Teri Loxam - Investor Contact","Thanks, Roger. And Darla, I know we're starting to run out of time. We're going to try to squeeze in two more questions if we can keep them short. And then if we have time, we'll try to squeeze in another one. But let's move on to the next one.","Operator","It's from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. I will cut my eight-part question to six. Just kidding. So very quickly, so could you just rephrase what the proposed anacetrapib study change was that \u2013 I think, Roger, you said was rejected by the FDA or something like that? Second, with respect to the base interim look, when is that interim look and does it include a futility analysis? And then third, could you just update us on the timing of GARDASIL safety updates in Japan and the U.K.?","Teri Loxam - Investor Contact","Roger, you want to start with the question?","Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - EVP & President-Merck Research Laboratories","Yeah, so, David, with respect to anacetrapib, the critical issue was to change the primary endpoint of the REVEAL study to include ischemic stroke as a component of the composite endpoint rather than revascularization, because ischemic stroke is both a more explicit endpoint to test, and in addition, is something that we know from the IMPROVE-IT study was associated with cholesterol reduction.","Regulatory agencies were not comfortable with the idea of changing the primary end point, perhaps not surprisingly. While it is at the sponsors' discretion to do those kinds of things, I think the feeling after the discussions on the part of the steering committee was that, that wouldn't be the way to go forward and we would stick with the primary endpoint as originally constituted. So that program moves forward. And with respect to the base program, we have completed enrollment in the mild to moderate study. I should \u2013 I would expect that study to proceed to completion. So you can anticipate that, that study will proceed to completion. We would hope to have data available in the 2017 timeframe.","Adam H. Schechter - Executive VP & President-Global Human Health","And, David, with regard to GARDASIL, we continue to work with our customers and the government in Japan. We are confident in the efficacy and the safety of the product. And we continue to have active discussions with them and provide them whatever data they would like to have.","Teri Loxam - Investor Contact","And I think we are almost out of time, but let's try to squeeze in one more really quickly. And then I want to be sensitive to the time given all the other calls going on today.","Operator","And your final question comes from John Boris with SunTrust.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions, and congratulations on the results today. One thing that appeared to be really robust in the quarter were obviously JANUVIA, JANUMET sales relative to how we projected them. It just has to do with realized sales and your contracting strategy in the U.S. Have you recently implemented anything on that in the way you're accounting for discounts and rebates? And are you an able to realize a higher level of net sales as a result of anything that you're doing on the accounting on JANUVIA and JANUMET? And then secondly, on ertugliflozin, can you maybe just outline what you view, aside from developing combo pills, as the key points of differentiation relative to the other competitors? And just any thoughts on how you're designing your outcome study that would be required for that product? Thanks.","Adam H. Schechter - Executive VP & President-Global Human Health","So, John, this is Adam. And I want to make sure I'm really clear about JANUVIA. What I look at first is TRx volume growth. And in the United States, we saw 4% TRx volume growth. But we also saw timing of customer buying patterns that caused about $100 million of increased sales in this quarter, and those will come out in the fourth quarter or subsequent quarters. We had increased price last year in the third quarter. And we saw customers draw down their inventories. This year, in the third quarter, we did not increase price. So we saw inventory levels remain at higher levels. And JANUVIA is just a very big product. And a few days of inventory in one direction or another can impact reported sales significantly.","So that's why you saw that difference of $100 million from \u2013 versus the prior year. And then with regard to \u2013 and by the way, there's no change in terms of accounting or the rebates or discounts. Those are all consistent. What you're seeing is this timing of when we took price last year versus this year. That's all. It's just, that's why I say to monitor the volume, and we're very pleased with the volume. We feel good about the volume going into fourth quarter and the volume going into 2016.","Teri Loxam - Investor Contact","Roger, you want to comment really quickly on...","Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - EVP & President-Merck Research Laboratories","Yeah, John, with respect to ertugliflozin, what I've said from the very beginning is when we partnered with Pfizer on the drug, this is a drug that has extremely good pharmaceutical properties, and hence, it can be paired easily. It plays nicely with others. And so the most important attribute of the drug is our ability to formulate it together with JANUVIA and develop it in that context. With respect to the outcome studies, the data that are available from EMPA-REG obviously influence the way we think about those outcome studies. And so we're looking at that carefully to ask the question, what do we need to do to ensure the outcome study provides a satisfactory test of whether ertugliflozin also reduces cardiovascular mortality in the way that was seen in EMPA-REG.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So just in closing, this quarter saw very strong performance from key drugs like JANUVIA and KEYTRUDA. We are looking forward to launching in the hepatitis C space and the lung space, and we feel there's good momentum for the business. Take care. Thank you."],"13870":["Merck & Co., Inc.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Merck & Company Q2 Sales and Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Teri Loxam, SVP, Investor Relations and Global Communications. Please go ahead.","Teri Loxam","Thank you, Darla and good morning. Welcome to Merck's second quarter 2019 conference call. Today, I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Labs, who will read our prepared remarks. In addition, I'm also joined by Mike Nally, our Chief Marketing Officer; and Frank Clyburn, our Chief Commercial Officer, who will be available for the Q&A portion of the call.","Before I turn the call over to Ken, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results, such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation of these in our press release. We have also provided a table in our press release to help you understand the sales in the quarter for the business units and products.","I would like to remind you that some of the statements that we make during today's call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.","If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2018 10-K identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements. You can see our SEC filings, as well as today's earnings release on merck.com. We have also posted a presentation to the investor section of merck.com which includes some of our highlights from the quarter.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken.","Kenneth Frazier","Thank you, Teri. Good morning and thank you all for joining the call. Our science-led strategy together with our clinical and commercial execution drove another quarter of accelerating revenue growth with strength across our global portfolio.","Our results demonstrate the continued momentum of our business through the first half of the year and further show that our focus on the kind of innovation that significantly improved health outcomes is paying off.","As highlighted at our recent Investor Day, we are confident that our innovative portfolio of product and significant pipeline opportunities supported by unparalleled R&D and commercial execution will continue to drive strong growth while we invest in cutting edge science to deliver breakthroughs over the next decade and beyond.","Over the past quarter, we continue to advance our pipeline and presented encouraging data across our programs, including two additional regulatory approvals and a filing acceptance for KEYTRUDA. Two new regulatory approvals in infectious diseases, as well as new clinical data on the V14 - V114 pediatrics trial, MK-8591 and many others.","Our clinical and regulatory progress reflects Merck's unwavering commitment to biomedical research aimed at bringing forward products that can make a meaningful difference in the lives of patients around the world.","In addition, we continue to strategically invest in business development to strengthen our pipeline through value enhancing external opportunities. This quarter alone, we announced two acquisitions that will bolster our oncology pipeline with Peloton Therapeutics and Tilos Therapeutics respectively.","We also successfully completed our tender offer for Immune Design and closed on the acquisition of Antelliq and animal health. We remain confident that our strategy, growth prospects, outstanding scientific and commercial talent and leadership team, together with our focus on execution will enable us to drive significant value for patients and shareholders this year and for years to come.","And with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Rob to review the details of our quarterly performance. Rob?","Robert Davis","Thanks, Ken. And good morning, everyone. As Ken mentioned, our performance in the second quarter is a clear testament to the strong momentum and growth potential of our business. Our result over the last several quarters continue to reinforce the confidence we have and our ability to drive sustained long-term revenue growth and meaningful operating margin expansion, while maintaining a disciplined capital allocation strategy focused both on investing in the business and returning capital to shareholders.","Now turning to our results. Total company revenues were $11.8 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year or 15% excluding the negative impact from foreign currency. This growth was led by our Human Health business which increased 17% this quarter excluding exchange. Animal Health grew 9% excluding exchange. The remainder of my comments pertaining to sales will all be on an ex-exchange basis.","The increase in Human Health revenues was led by key products in our oncology, vaccines and hospital businesses. In oncology, KEYTRUDA sales exceeded $2.6 billion this quarter, an increase of 63% year-over-year. Growth was driven by increased adoption globally in the first-line lung setting, as well as uptake in recently approved indications.","In the US, strong demand across all indications continues to drive performance. KEYTRUDA is firmly established as the standard of care for indicated patients in first-line lung and we continue to further penetrate segments of the population, including low and non PD-L1 expressing patients.","In addition, we are encouraged by our recent launches in metastatic renal cell carcinoma and adjuvant melanoma where we are already seeing strong adoption by oncologists.","We're also excited about our opportunity in first-line head and neck cancer for which we received approval in June. With 20 indications currently approved in the United States we are further establishing KEYTRUDA as a foundational cancer treatment. Outside the US, KEYTRUDA sales grew 73% driven by long as we continue to gain reimbursement for the chemo combo in more countries in the EU.","In Japan, we are now the leading anti PD-1 agents, which speaks to our execution and the breadth of our indications. And in China, we have seen very strong growth given the recent launch in first-line lung and continued uptake in melanoma and our growth should continue as we reach more patients and expect to launch additional indications.","KEYTRUDA is changing the way in which cancer is being treated and we are still in the early days of the KEYTRUDA journey. We remain very confident in the long-term growth potential, given our established IO leadership and our expectation for many additional approvals around the world.","Our results also reflect continued strength in both Lynparza and Lenvima, products we market in collaboration with AstraZeneca and Eisai respectively. Lynparza revenue more than doubled this quarter driven by further uptake in ovarian cancer based on the results of SOLO-1 in the United States, as well as strength in Europe, China and Japan.","Lynparza continues to lead the PARP inhibitor class in the United States, with nearly 60% total patient share. We look to further establish Lynparza as the PARP inhibitor of choice in additional tumor types and in combination with KEYTRUDA.","Lenvima revenue also more than doubled as we continue to drive sales in HCC in the United States in China and launch in several other markets. We believe the Lenvima will be an important product for our oncology portfolio and look forward to the potential for additional indications, across our broad development program.","Turning to vaccines. Our vaccines business reflect strong growth in our pediatric portfolio, as well as strength in GARDASIL which was driven by public sector purchases and greater demand in the adolescent cohorts in the United States, as well as continued demand across Europe and the emerging markets, especially China.","Our hospital business benefited from 20% growth in BRIDION which is annualizing at over $1 billion, reflecting strong performance in the United States as we continue to increase share within the reversal market.","Animal Health revenue increased 9% this quarter to $1.1 billion. Livestock grew 13% primarily due to the contributions from the products acquired in the Antelliq acquisition. Companion animal sales grew 4%, as volume growth in vaccines and insulin products were partially offset by the timing of customer purchases in the prior year for BRAVECTO.","Turning to the rest of our P&L, my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 75.4% in the quarter, an increase of 100 basis points year-over-year. Recall that the sizable catch-up adjustment for an accrued sales milestone related to Adempas was included in the second quarter of 2018.","Operating expenses of $4.8 billion increased 9% year-over-year. R&D drove a large portion of the increase in spend and reflects higher expenses in support of our discovery in clinical development efforts, as well as business development transactions during the quarter. SG&A also grew year-over-year, reflecting continued investments to accelerate our key growth drivers and the launch of new indications.","The decrease in other income this quarter reflected the unfavorable year-on-year impact of mark-to-market income on equity securities, as well as higher net interest expense.","Taken together, we earned $1.30 per share, an increase of 25% excluding exchange. This growth demonstrates the continued momentum in our business as we drive strong top line growth combined with disciplined resource allocation enabling operational leverage.","Turning to our outlook for the year. Given the confidence we have in our strong continued performance we are narrowing and raising both our revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance ranges for the full year of 2019. We now expect revenues of $45.2 billion to $46.2 billion, which represents 7% to 9% growth versus 2018 driven by strength across our key growth pillars.","This range assumes a negative impact from foreign exchange of just over 1 percentage point using mid July rates. We expect OpEx to increase by mid-single digits, primarily driven by investments in R&D. We now expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $4.84 to $4.94, which represents growth of approximately 12% to 14% versus 2018. We now expect a slightly negative impact from foreign exchange. All other elements of our guidance provided in April remain unchanged.","In summary, we are operating from a position of strength as reflected in our second quarter results and our updated guidance. We are confident in our ability to drive strong revenue growth in the near and long term, and we remain committed to delivering a leveraged P&L, while balancing the need to invest in innovation, all of which we expect will deliver significant and sustainable value to patients and our shareholders.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Roger.","Roger Perlmutter","Thanks, Rob. The second quarter was a very important one for Merck Research Laboratories with meaningful progress made in every part of our organization. First, we received numerous approvals from the US Food and Drug Administration, including as previously mentioned supplementary approval for the use of KEYTRUDA both as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of squamous cell carcinoma, head neck, and supplementary approval of KEYTRUDA as monotherapy for third-line treatment of small cell lung cancer.","We also received supplementary approval for ZERBAXA in the treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by sensitive bacterial strain. This represents an important advance in the treatment of a life-threatening illness especially when caused by for example resistant pseudomonas species.","More recently we obtained approval of RECARBRIO, our combined independent cilastatin, relebactam therapy for complicated urinary tract or intra-abdominal infections.","Relebactam was specifically engineered to enable extended activity of imipenem against certain otherwise resistant bacterial species expressing the form of beta-lactamase, and as part of our efforts to address the increasing threat of antimicrobial resistance.","During the second quarter, we also had the opportunity to review exciting new data from our anti-retroviral program including 48 week data from the combination of Doravirine with our new nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor, islatravir for the maintenance of low-viral burdens and patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.","These data which were presented last week at the International AIDS Society meetings in Mexico City were complemented by studies of a subcutaneous islatravir implant that might permit long term perhaps once a yearly prophylaxis against HIV infection.","In the infectious disease space, we also presented data on the immunogenicity [ph] of V114, our new 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in pediatric populations. We are very enthusiastic about the V114 for which Phase 3 data from our comprehensive development program will become available beginning towards the end of this year.","Returning to the oncology space, just yesterday we announced that the data monitoring committee supervising our KEYNOTE-522 Phase 3 studies of neoadjuvant and adjuvant KEYTRUDA combined with chemotherapy found that KEYTRUDA treatment was associated with an improvement in pathologic complete response rates, one of two dual primary endpoints of this study as compared with chemotherapy alone.","I wish to make two key points regarding this study. First, neoadjuvant therapy occupies an increasingly important role in the treatment of breast cancer, especially in the triple-negative subset, which represents between 15% and 20% of breast cancers. In this setting, the use of neoadjuvant therapy can reduce tumor burden from a less aggressive surgical resection and provide improvement in long-term outcomes.","Second, achievement of a pathological complete response in which examination of the surgical specimens shows the tumor cells have been eliminated has been repeatedly associated with improved of event-free survival and overall survival and is often quite aggressive malignancies. Hence we are very encouraged by the interim analysis demonstrating successful achievement of this endpoint.","In this context, the KEYNOTE-522 data monitoring committee recommended that the study continue unchanged. And so the data become mature enough to assess event free survival. In the meantime, we look forward to discussing the KEYNOTE-522 data with regulatory authorities and to presenting our data in an upcoming scientific meeting.","Finally, I wish to notice that we anticipate risk pace of regulatory approvals in major jurisdictions that we have achieved during the first six months of the year will continue, especially in the oncology space. I look forward to sharing these notifications with you in due course.","Now, my colleagues and I will take your questions.","Teri Loxam","Thanks, Roger. Darla, we'll turn it over to the Q&A portion. And I'd like to remind everyone if they can keep their questions to a maximum of two to allow as many questions on the call as possible.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question is from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Ken, there's obviously been a more significant focus on larger deals in this space following some of the recent announcements. I would just welcome your latest thoughts here on Merck's capital allocation strategy. I know you touched on this a little bit at your Investor Day about a month ago, but just wondering if you could provide us an update there. Thank you very much.","Kenneth Frazier","Thank you very much for the question, Terence. We have launched some of the activity around us in the sector. I think each one of those companies is evaluating their own growth prospects over the next few years. We feel very, very confident in our growth prospects going forward.","As we have said in the past, given all of that, we are not interested particularly in a large merger that we believe could be disruptive to the company, including R&D. We continue to look at bolt-on deals. We do look across the spectrum in terms of size for bolt-on, we don't divide it by $1 amount. But at the end of the day, we think the operational complexity, the cultural disruption, the R&D disruption, that has been associated with large mergers counsel that we should not go there, particularly, because we feel very confident about our ability to grow our company organically supplemented by bolt-on deals.","Teri Loxam","Great. Thank you. We'll take the next question please.","Operator","It's from Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim.","Seamus Fernandez","Thanks very much for the question. So maybe just two very quickly. On the first one, some spectacular growth in the pediatric vaccines across the board, as well as GARDASIL, could you guys just help us more fully understand the sustainability of the kind of growth that we saw this quarter. And then, and just incremental to that, if you could just comment on what happened with NuvaRing this quarter in particular?","And then the second question, just broadly speaking for Roger, 8591, the data looks solid for the doravirine combination. Obviously the PrEP information is quite impressive and exciting, particularly if you can get to annual dosing with the implants. But just wanted to better understand how you guys are working towards finding a better partner than doravirine for 8591. And if you're willing to work with other companies and collaborate on those programs.","That was -- those were some concerns raised by physicians that other great products are out there and that unfortunately it doesn't look like the companies are collaborating with each other on that front. So I just wanted to ask on that front. Thanks so much.","Teri Loxam","Great. Thanks, Seamus. We'll start with Frank.","Frank Clyburn","Sure, Seamus. So let me start first with NuvaRing. No really new news there, no generic entry this quarter. Seamus, so we continue to promote NuvaRing as we have done in the past. With regards to vaccines, a couple of things.","Let me start with GARDASIL. GARDASIL had a very strong quarter growth of 50% if you were to exclude exchange on a global basis. We did see in the US, we did see CDC purchases in Q2 of this year, which actually took place in Q1 of last year. So, you do see some bumpiness with some of our vaccine sales. But I would ask them to take a look at Seamus, on a year-to-date basis vaccines for GARDASIL globally is up about 35%.","So we're seeing very strong demand expressing 11 year to 12 year-old cohorts in the US and some in the 19 to 26 cohorts. We're also seeing very strong ex-US demand as we talked about our Investor Day in particular in China, in Europe and a lot of the general neutral programs are rolling out. So we're still very confident in our growth prospects for GARDASIL.","The pediatric vaccines did also see a very strong quarter, this quarter. That was driven by demand as well. There was some buoyant to the private sector within the US. This quarter based on some of the Measles outbreaks that you've read in the news and we do believe that we'll continue to see growth for our pediatric vaccines going forward.","So the durability of our vaccine business, we feel very good about both for near term and long term growth as we mentioned just on Investor Day.","Roger Perlmutter","All right. Seamus, this is Roger. With regard to islatravir MK-8591, I mean, first of all, I would say, again, the performance of islatravir is quite remarkable and especially in the implant setting the durability is remarkable. And it's important to note that the very long intracellular half life of islatravir and the very impressive resistance profile.","I would take nothing away from doravirine in terms of its capabilities for many in the market that used the previous non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, in particular, which had a lot of adverse events associated with them. Doravirine is superior to those and is a very effective agent. And I think the combination of islatravir, doravirine will be good.","That said, we are also considering a lots of other combinations and lots of other conversations. And over time you will have the opportunity to see the broader impact of islatravir in a variety of different settings.","The important thing to emphasize is, it can be administered on a daily, weekly or monthly or even a longer duration regimen, which offers great possibilities. I think for change in treatment patterns in HIV infected individuals. Thanks.","Teri Loxam","Thanks. We'll take the next question please.","Operator","It's from Andrew Baum with Citi.","Andrew Baum","Thank you. Couple of questions, please. Firstly interested in your thoughts on the tenant proposal to fund catastrophic coverage given your exposure to Lenvima, Lynparza, Januvia and others.","Second on, islatravir, question for Roger, thinking about PrEP, both with the implants as well as the once-monthly, do you think the FDA is ready to accept anything other than traditional non-inferiority trials or what do you think that could do to the timelines in order to bringing islatravir to market as PrEP? Thank you.","Kenneth Frazier","Okay. So let me just comment generally about what's happening with the various things that are going on and some of these proposals that were included in the Senate finance package.","Let me start by saying that as a company, we are very supportive. The kinds of changes that will relieve patients in terms of their out-of-pocket costs. I think the catastrophic changes are step in the right direction, but that's a very small number of people who actually progress through the system and get the catastrophic.","So we continue to work with people as part of the legislative process and the administration, because we support lowering costs for seniors at the counter and not just at the catastrophic portion and so with respect to the impact on our own portfolio. I'm going to turn it over to Frank.","Frank Clyburn","Yeah. So just on the oncology front, I think you heard from our colleague at AstraZeneca, Lynparza for Part D is, approximately 25% of our business flows through Part D.","To remind everyone with regards to KEYTRUDA, that is reimbursed through Part B. So it is not a Part D product. So we feel as though we're balanced across our oncology portfolio going forward. Roger?","Roger Perlmutter","Yeah. And Andrew with respect to PrEP regimens. I think it's a great concern to the community as a whole that if one has to do active comparator controls, because of [indiscernible] that's understandable. The event rates are so low that you will need very, very large populations and very difficult to execute clinical trials.","FDA and other regulatory agencies are not aware of this. There have been discussions among a variety of sponsors and particularly in the very active patient community about this and what could be done.","And we have a lot of ideas in mind that thus far, we don't really have a novel trial design that would permit more rapid registration, watch this space, I mean, we're very concerned about decision.","Teri Loxam","Thanks. We'll move on to the next question.","Operator","It's from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Chris Schott","Great. Thanks very much for the questions. Just two here. Maybe first elaborate a little bit more on the China dynamics that are driving that 51% growth. I guess what products in particular behind this and can you just remind us the overall size of your China business at this point?","My second question was just KEYTRUDA in RCC, could we just get a quick update in terms of - uptake you're seeing so far. Where in the market you're seeming to get the most traction with the data, et cetera. Just, I know it's obviously an important new indication for you guys. Thank you.","Frank Clyburn","Hi, Chris. It's Frank on China. And China is about $725 million this quarter and it grew to 0.50%, really being driven by a number of products. As we mentioned we have pivoted to innovation. So our oncology portfolio, Lynparza, Lenvima, KEYTRUDA is driving the growth.","GARDASIL has had a significant uptake in China. We have NRDL listing also for Januvia. So it's a broad base innovative portfolio that is driving that 50% growth and we believe that will continue in China. With regards to RCC we're very excited, Chris about where we are to-date.","As we mentioned when we rolled out the data for RCC, it's important to note that KEYTRUDA plus axitinib shows a benefit across all three risk groups, which differentiates us from the competition. So we are seeing uptake across all three risk groups and it's really based on the strong overall survival, progression-free survival and very strong response rates.","80% of our chartered accounts in the US have adopted this regimen into their guidelines, which I think is a very strong early indicator. And we're seeing and hearing very strong feedback from both community and academic physicians.","So I feel really good Chris about RCC in the US. And as you know, we also plan to be rolling that out around the world. So we see this as a key indication, key growth drivers for us going forward.","Teri Loxam","Great. And Roger, on 522? My bad, sorry. I thought - I missed out the question, apologies. Next question, please.","Operator","It's from Navin Jacob with UBS.","Navin Jacob","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Two, sorry if I missed this. But, would it be possible to quantify how much of the US GARDASIL public sector buying pattern was if you could actually quantify, that amount that would be helpful.","And then just on KEYTRUDA plus Lynparza and first-line lung, could you remind us where those trials are when we could expect to see readouts there. And as a corollary to that KEYTRUDA in prostate cancer, you're going to be starting a three Phase 3 trials there as well. I'm wondering when we could hear updates from those trials as well. Thank you very much.","Teri Loxam","We'll start with Roger.","Roger Perlmutter","Right, okay. So as we have discussed and we've showed some data from our Investor Day, this is quite a large opportunity for combinations KEYTRUDA with Lynparza and in one of those cases, it's prostate cancer. We have indicated that we will study registration enabling studies for those. And US as we're starting to move forward obviously they take some time to conduct, we'll then have a chance to update you on the results.","But we are enthusiastic about the opportunity of the combination and believe that there will be many circumstances. I should point out that not only, the Lynparza combination, but the Lenvima combination as well - we're, we just received breakthrough designation for the hepatocellular carcinoma first-line indication 2. So there is an awful lot going on in combination studies with both agents.","Frank Clyburn","Yeah. And on GARDASIL as I mentioned, we had a CDC purchase in Q2 which was not purchased in Q2 of 2018. It was actually purchased in Q1 of '18. So the way in which I would characterize GARDASIL is in the US, year-to-date we have grown 20%, when you look on a six month basis.","I think that's the best way to look at it from a GARDASIL perspective. So think of the US growing about 20% right now versus prior year for the half year mark, because you are going to see different timing with regards to the CDC purchases.","Teri Loxam","Thank you, Frank. Next question please.","Operator","It's from Umer Raffat with Evercore.","Umer Raffat","Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. I had two if I may. First can you mentioned low complexity as being a key consideration for bolt-ons, you're looking at. And in that vein, I guess my question is, are you open to therapeutic areas like orphan and also if there is a company with let's say $50 billion market cap or value, is that still a tuck-in, as long as the complexity is low?","And secondly on gross margin, so I see two big drivers going forward. One, of course, being KEYTRUDA's Bristol-Myers royalty reduction in 2023. But also anything you may be baking in on pricing reform. I was curious if you could add numbers around each of those. Thank you very much.","Kenneth Frazier","So I'll start with the PD question. Thanks, Umer for your questions. I don't think the size is the issue necessarily for complexity. I think it has to do with whether or not the two companies overlap and whether or not we are spending a lot of our time integrating IT systems manufacturing systems.","So if it's a true add-on, a separate kind of business, a true both-on, then I don't think that the size drives the complexity at all. As it relates to orphan versus other types, our preference is to do the most good for the most people.","But having said that, we are not against the right kind of therapy, even including orphan indications or orphan approaches to therapy. What we care about is are we getting good science that we can leverage together with our internal efforts to actually create value for our shareholders as well as patients.","Robert Davis","Good morning, Umer. This is Rob. To your question, just to remind everyone, for gross margin, over time, as we indicated at the Investor Day, we do expect to see gross margin generally flat, because while we do see product mix benefits flowing from products like KEYTRUDA and our vaccines business, we also, as we mentioned have assumed negative price going forward.","The impact of royalties, you've had, obviously, the one with KEYTRUDA that does step down in 2023 and the impact of the collaborations, which in the near-term will be a drag on margin or the long term, they become accretive.","We haven't given specific dollar numbers to those. And frankly, we don't want to give that specific guidance, but clearly how those interplay will determine whether you see our product gross margin slightly up, slightly down or flat over the period with most of what's driving our operating margin expansion, as we've talked about coming from reducing growth in operating expense relative to sales.","Teri Loxam","Thanks, Rob. Next question please.","Operator","It's from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger","Yes. Thanks very much. I guess first I'd like to start with, actually the last comment and I know that this was mentioned previously, at the analyst meeting. But in terms of Merck's projection of negative price going forward that's a bit different than some of your peers. I think for some of your peers, talk about flat pricing, so maybe you could provide some more color regarding what you see as the biggest downward pressures on price for Merck going forward.","And then second, could you just provide an update on the - growing meningitis concerns. I jumped on the call late, so I don't know if this is addressed, but wanted to hear about that topic. And then also the durability of Merck's PROQUAD MMR-II revenue line strength. Thank you.","Teri Loxam","Great. We'll start with Rob.","Robert Davis","And morning, David. So thanks for the question. With regard to the pricing, again, I think the important thing to focus on is, how we see the mix going forward. And I can't speak to what our competitors are implying that, recall we've actually seen negative price quite some time outside the United States.","So that's not a new phenomenon. We've been absorbing headwinds and price outside the United States for several years. Historically that was offset by price increases in the United States.","As we look going forward, we no longer see the benefit of those price increases in the United States because of obviously the changing dynamics. And so as you look in total, we do continue to believe we're going to see declining price as we look forward, impacting our margins.","Teri Loxam","Thanks. And Frank on the pediatric vaccines.","Frank Clyburn","Yeah. So on the pediatric vaccines, we are continuing to see very good demand within the pediatric vaccines. And clearly the measles outbreak has driven some of that demand expression in the private sector. We also did see buy-in this quarter in Q2. We do anticipate that some of that buy-in will come out in Q3 and Q4.","But as I mentioned before, we see our pediatric vaccine business as a very strong part of our growth story. And we see it as a very durable business going forward.","Teri Loxam","Thanks. We'll take the next question please.","Operator","It's from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.","Tim Anderson","Thank you. A couple of questions. A longer-term question on KEYTRUDA, we published an analysis while back claiming that cancer drugs, very often ultimately sell much more outside the US and in the US as they mature to the tune of 50% more or so, when I look at how we and the analyst community at large models KEYTRUDA and other PD1s for that matter. No one ever really seem to have ex-US even surpassing the US.","And I'm wondering if you can tell us what your long-term model assumes from this regard, could ex-US markets eventually kind of blow away, the US market over time. It could be billions of dollars more potentially.","Second question, Bristol recently top-lined part 1 of 227 as positive, which I think was a surprise. Can you remind us where you are with your CTLA-4 combination program specifically what are the latest stage trials and then what tumor types. I guess as you may have kind of backed off this initiative that you started maybe a couple of years ago? Thank you.","Teri Loxam","So let's start with Frank on KEYTRUDA.","Frank Clyburn","Yeah. So for the KEYTRUDA as we look long term, we do see significant opportunity outside the US in particular markets like China, especially when you look at some of the GI malignancies in the actual prevalence there. We are seeing obviously very strong uptake in Japan as well, not going to give a specific number, but we clearly do see ex-US opportunity is very significant in fact this quarter alone, we sold $1.1 billion outside the US and grew 73%. So we see both ex-US and US KEYTRUDA opportunities. But clearly, China is the one I would highlight as significant potential growth for us going forward.","Teri Loxam","And Roger?","Roger Perlmutter","And Tim, with respect to CTLA-4 directed therapy, our interest has been in demonstrating or assessing whether or not adding CTLA-4 directed therapy actually has an impact over KEYTRUDA alone, that is powering the study to see whether CTLA-4 plus KEYTRUDA is in fact superior to KEYTRUDA in any setting and we have done that both with adalimumab and also with MK-1308, our own CTLA-4 directed therapy.","And so registration enabling studies are going on in both setting and with both kinds of combinations, which includes, for example, the KEYNOTE-598 study and a couple of others, and we could go through the details with you, I think, find them usually on clinicaltrials.gov.","Teri Loxam","We'll move on to the next question please.","Operator","It's from Jason Gerberry with Bank of America.","Jason Gerberry","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First, just a follow-up on the Bristol Opdivo, Yervoy data, just curious, Roger, how do you think oncologists are going to benchmark the CheckMate-227 data against the already approved either Merck combination or KEYTRUDA monotherapy in the PD-L1 greater than 1% populations?","And then my second question maybe just for Frank, can you frame the importance of NRDL listing for KEYTRUDA in the lung setting? And what I'm specifically curious about is the percent of the market accessible with and without the listing? Thanks.","Teri Loxam","We'll start with Roger.","Roger Perlmutter","Well, Jason. It's pretty hard to comment on the data from the CheckMate-227 program, because we haven't actually seen it. We have the top line announcement that one part of it was in the PD-L1 greater than 1% did succeed in the combination with adalimumab, but we don't know what that success looked like in overall survival. We don't know the hazard ratios look like and there is a - it's complicated study as you appreciate because the study was broken down into most parts and a part of it was predicated on a tumor mutational burden analysis and then subsequent PD-L1 directed such that.","So we're not actually seeing the data, pretty hard to know how oncologists will respond with time, the data will become available. And I think people will want to have a look at it and understand what the meaning of that might be.","I think our own data, I think are extremely strong of course, with KEYTRUDA and the combination of KEYTRUDA plus traditional chemotherapy with typically on the order of a doubling of overall survival.","So there is an important value that can be gained there and we are optimistic that we're going to continue to be able to advance therapies that will improve overall survival of this disease.","Teri Loxam","Thanks, Roger. Will go to Frank on the NRDL.","Frank Clyburn","Yeah. And just one additional pointed to what Roger was saying commercially with regards to lung, I do believe we're in a very strong position with our data. And as you mentioned with monotherapy on the PD-L1 high population with very strong overall survival as well as KEYNOTE-189 reducing the risk of death in half.","That data is playing very well around the world, and it has helped us to penetrate now 8 out of every 10 new eligible patients in lung. So we feel as though will - there'll be a lot of data readouts here from competition, but we feel as though our data positions us well in lung today and in the future.","NRDL, we are waiting to see if we'll be invited to - actually participate for next year. It is an important potential listing. It does expand the population in China fairly significantly. There is 5 to 600,000 lung cancer patients in China. There is probably 300,000 of those that are a part of our labeled indication and NRDL gives us a chance if invited to expand into that patient population.","We'd also like to highlight, we expect to expand our label in China. China is going to be important for us, not only for 2020, but 2020 and beyond and we are also seeing good self-pay market uptake in China as well, but clearly we will keep you informed as the NRDL process unfolds.","Teri Loxam","Thanks. We'll move on to the next question please.","Operator","It's from Steve Scala with Cowen.","Steve Scala","Thank you. A couple of questions, both for Roger. If you could clarify your KEYNOTE-522 comments, I think you said you needed EFS to file, but that you would share the PCR data with regulators. So were you implying you would seek to file and potentially garner approval on PCR? That is why you're going to share in the first place, or are you saying you absolutely definitely need the EFS.","And then secondly if Bristol's 227 delivered a percent of patients alive greater than the 69% that KEYNOTE-189 reported at 12 months, just wondering how Merck would respond or do you think that is extremely unlikely? Thank you.","Roger Perlmutter","All right, Steve. So with respect to KEYNOTE-522 you know the goal I'm discussing, the data with regulatory agencies is to ask whether or not they think that represents a finding of sufficient importance to consider making the drug available for patients in that setting. So that's the reason to do it.","As I indicated pathological complete response is associated with favorable outcome, particularly in the breast cancer setting and his been repeatedly demonstrated to have that impact in the triple negative breast cancer setting. On the other hand, this is something that agencies have to look at, and with regard to the totality of the data. So that's -- that's basically where we are there.","And with regard to 227, pretty hard to respond to hypothetical without actually seeing what the data look like. I really, I don't know what to say about that. I know I'm - I think there is some interest in seeing what the subset data look like, obviously there - the flip side of that was, but, and maybe unsurprisingly that in light of what we've seen, beginning with the CheckMate-026, I mean, the combination of nivolumab plus chemotherapy was not successful.","In part 2 which for us KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy, obviously gives very impressive results in terms of overall response rate, progression-free survival, overall survival. As we've demonstrated repeatedly and in non-squamous and squamous cell, non-small cell lung cancer. So you know those of these are behaving differently in these settings for whatever reason.","Teri Loxam","Thank you. We'll move on to the next question please.","Operator","Your next question is from Louise Chen with Cantor.","Louise Chen","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is on KEYTRUDA in China. Just curious if you will disclose sales there. We get that question a lot, seeing if you can provide any color. And then how will you compete with the local players that are much less expensive on a price basis at least for now?","And then second question is just on potential competition for KEYTRUDA from some of the upcoming trial readouts in second half ' 19 and beyond that will be a non-small cell lung cancer RCC and melanoma? Thank you.","Teri Loxam","Frank?","Frank Clyburn","Yeah. So we don't intend to actually share our sales number for KEYTRUDA in China. As far as competing with the local players, we feel as though oncology is a data-driven market there, clearly our local players that are entering the market at a lower price, they are penetrating into some segments of the market.","However, we're continuing to see very good penetration and very good growth in China there are clearly, patients that are in the self-pay market is where we compete today, they can afford KEYTRUDA. We have our patient assistance programs and we have a very strong commercial presence in China. So I feel really, really good that we'll be able to compete with the local players going forward.","Teri Loxam","Great. And then the KEYTRUDA positioning in the US given peer file.","Frank Clyburn","Yeah. I think as we mentioned, it is going to be a lot of competitive data readouts in lung and across many different cancer types. What I would say is, right now we are in a very strong first mover advantage in many of those cancer types. When you think about 20 indications across 12 different tumors, we right now have build a wall of data that we feel very comfortable with, and in fact many of the community oncologists are getting significant real world experience using KEYTRUDA.","So we'll have to see how the data unfolds with the competition, but as Roger and I have just mentioned, we feel as though our data right now, strong overall survival across many different cancer types, bladder, renal, cell carcinoma. I haven't even spoken about adjuvant melanoma, which is a very important launch for us right now. Head and neck, the teams are just launching that indication of strong overall survival in the first-line setting.","So we know it's going to be competitive, we feel as though we're very well positioned based on our strategy and the data that we have as well as what you heard at our Investor Day, the significant amount of data to come, not only in the metastatic setting, but also in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting going forward.","Teri Loxam","Thanks, Frank. We'll take the next question please.","Operator","It's from Mara Goldstein with Mizuho.","Mara Goldstein","Yeah. Thank you, can you --","Teri Loxam","Mara we can't hear your - we couldn't hear your question. If you wouldn't mind, repeating that.","Mara Goldstein","Sure. Thank you very much. I have two questions. And the first is on the KEYTRUDA plus Lynparza trials and non-small cell lung cancer. And I'm just wondering what the expectation is in terms of expanding patient population based on that clinical trial.","And then the second question is one around regulatory strategy in Europe, just understanding that yesterday or the day before heard that the CHMP had removed accelerated status for Novartis' Zolgensma, but we've also seen this is not an isolated incident with other drugs and in particular oncology drugs being taken off that accelerated track. And I'm wondering if the Company can share any thoughts around this dynamic and any potential impact on your own regulatory plans in Europe?","Roger Perlmutter","Right. Mara, the underlying logic behind KEYTRUDA plus Lynparza and a whole variety of settings is that where there are defects in DNA repair and there are - those are included a whole variety of different defects, not just the BRCA 1, BRCA 2 indication for the whole variety of different molecular defects.","The effect of Lynparza can be to increase the representation of epitopes that potentially could be recognizable by immune cells and release of constraints with KEYTRUDA and combination with that should be beneficial. Thus far hypothesis that's being tested, whole variety of different settings and quite broadly. So we are enthusiastic about it. We're encouraged that this could be extremely important.","As one of the things I would point out with respect to Lynparza is it's extraordinarily well tolerated, people stay on it for years, and the ability to maintain a treatment effect as has been shown for example in the ovarian setting is really quite remarkable. So that's extremely promising.","With regard to EU strategy, the regulatory strategy really hasn't changed there. The EU has a prime program for - within CHMP in order to permit more rapid review. In general a good thing about EU reviews is that they now go along a very well defined timeline which we understand extremely well. And at this point, we are moving forward with those EU reviews as we've announced, even just this week. So all of that is going very well for us.","Teri Loxam","Thanks, Roger. And we were able to get to all of the callers' questions. So I'll turn it over to Ken for some closing comments.","Kenneth Frazier","Okay. I want to thank you again for joining us today. As you can see our strong second quarter results reinforce, why we're still confident in our ability to deliver sustained strong growth not only this year, but beyond. And as we mentioned in Investor Day, we have a de-risked portfolio of innovative asset, together with our differentiated, scientific commercial, our capabilities and our ability to execute, we believe that uniquely positions Merck to deliver strong results for patients and shareholders well into the future. So, thanks again. We look forward to joining you in the future.","Operator","This concludes the Merck & Company Q2 sales and earnings conference call.

Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Teri Loxam, please go ahead.","Teri Loxam - Investor Relations Contact","Thank you, Darla and good morning. Welcome to Merck's second quarter 2016 conference call. Today I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; Adam Schechter, President of Global Human Health; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Labs.","Before I turn the call over to Ken, I would like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. You should note that we've excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation of these items in our press release. We've also provided a table in our press release to help you understand the sales results in the quarter for the business units and products.","I would like to remind you that some of the statements that we make during today's call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor Provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Frazier - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Teri. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call this morning. Our performance this quarter reflects our continuing progress in advancing our priority products and programs. As we accelerate the launch of KEYTRUDA around the world, our researchers are continuing to study KEYTRUDA with an extensive clinical development program that spans a multitude of cancer types. We're confident that KEYTRUDA will be a key treatment in cancer for many years to come. We also made good strides in the launch of ZEPATIER, our new hepatitis C medicine, during its full first quarter on the market.","Our key in-line brands such as JANUVIA, whose sales are still growing nearly 10 years after its initial launch, also significantly contributed to our performance this quarter. We remain committed to our innovation strategy and our mission of delivering important medicines and vaccines that address many of the world's foremost health challenges and global unmet medical needs. Business development continues to be a priority and we are committed to finding the best external science to enrich our pipeline and portfolio. As I've previously outlined, we're taking a disciplined approach both financially and scientifically to identify and acquire opportunities at the right financial valuation.","In addition to acquisitions, we also are engaging in scientific and commercial partnerships to pair our best internal innovations with the best external innovation available. As a recent example of our efforts, earlier this year we closed on the acquisition of Afferent Pharmaceuticals which will complement and enhance our primary care pipeline. Last month we began a new scientific collaboration with Moderna Therapeutics to develop personalized cancer vaccine by combining KEYTRUDA with Moderna's vaccine technology. Additionally, we recently announced our intent to acquire Vall\u00e9e of Brazil to fortify our Animal Health business in Latin America.","In closing, our performance in the quarter positions us well for the second half of the year. Looking forward, we will remain focused on executing on our launches and driving the performance of our strongest brands as well as advancing and augmenting our broad pipeline to deliver a balanced and differentiated portfolio of valuable medicines and vaccines. We believe this strategic focus will create long-term growth for the company and sustainable value for both society and shareholders.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.","Robert M. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Our results in the second quarter reflect continued execution across the organization with our broad portfolio of products contributing to growth both on the top and bottom line. Total company revenues were $9.8 million, an increase of 1% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of exchange, second quarter revenues grew 3%. Our human health and animal health businesses performed well in the quarter delivering growth despite an approximately $210 million headwinds in sales in Venezuela in the second quarter of 2015.","As you'll remember, we scaled back our operations in Venezuela toward the end of last year and therefore recorded negligible sales from the country in the second quarter of this year.","Partially offsetting growth in human and animal health this quarter were lower contributions from our revenue hedge program and third-party manufacturing sales versus the prior year. While our revenue hedging program continues to contribute to the top line, it's expected to have a negative impact in each quarter this year on a year-over-year basis.","In terms of revenue guidance, we now expect full year revenue of $39.1 billion to $40.1 billion including an approximately 2 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange at mid-July rates.","Looking to the other parts of the P&L, non-GAAP gross margin was 75.7% an increase of 30 basis points versus the second quarter of 2015. Foreign exchange and product mix both contributed to the year-over-year improvement as growth in higher-margin products such as KEYTRUDA and ZEPATIER offset the declines in lower margin products such as REMICADE. On a full year basis, non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be roughly flat versus last year.","Non-GAAP operating expenses of $4.2 billion increased 4% year-over-year with lower marketing and administrative expenses and an approximately two percentage point benefit from foreign exchange partially offsetting higher research and development expenses in the quarter. The increase in R&D reflects a $200 million upfront payment to Moderna for our recently announced collaborations on the development of personalized cancer vaccine as well as higher investments in our clinical programs.","We continue to expect non-GAAP operating expense for the full year to be generally in line with the prior year. We anticipate incremental spend in R&D will be partially offset by lower marketing and administrative expenses.","Our non-GAAP effective tax rate this quarter was 19% primarily driven by the beneficial impact of orphan drug federal income tax credits for KEYTRUDA reported in the quarter. We continue to anticipate the full year rate to be between 21.5% and 22.5% which includes the impact of the R&D tax credit.","Taken together, we earned $0.93 per share on a non-GAAP basis in the second quarter delivering 8% growth or 12% excluding exchange and another quarter of P&L leverage.","On a GAAP basis we reported $0.43 per share in the quarter. For the full year, we're raising the lower end of our non-GAAP EPS guidance, narrowing the range to $3.67 to $3.77 per share. We now expect foreign exchange to have an approximately one percentage point negative impact in mid-July rates. On a GAAP basis, we now expect to earn $1.98 to $2.08 per share for the full year.","Altogether, we delivered growth both nominally and excluding exchange on the top and bottom line. We continue to have a number of opportunities in our pipeline with new product launches and with the potential for business development. We remain disciplined in our approach expense management recognizing the need to balance delivering in the short term while making the appropriate investments to drive long-term growth.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Adam.","Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President, President-Global Human Health","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. This morning I'll provide highlights on the performance of Global Human Health for the second quarter and my comments will be on a constant currency basis.","Global Human Health delivered another quarter of growth with sales of $8.7 billion, a growth of 2%. We drove increases in core areas on oncology, diabetes, vaccines and hospital and specialty care which were partially offset by declines in REMICADE and NASONEX.","I'll now highlight a few of our key franchises and product launches, and I'm going to begin with oncology. This is an exciting time for Merck as a leader in immuno-oncology and as we work to make KEYTRUDA foundational to the treatment of cancer. We're launching our melanoma indication in more than 50 markets globally and we are preparing for launches in additional tumors.","In the United States, we are maintaining our strong position in melanoma and we're launching a second-line lung cancer. And we are ready \u2013 we are ready to launch imminently in head and neck cancer and we're preparing for the launch in first-line lung cancer.","In the second quarter, sales of KEYTRUDA reached approximately $315 million on continued strength in the melanoma indication. In the U.S., we're also seeing increasing sales contributions from progress we're making in second-line lung cancer. Importantly, PD-L1 testing rates continue to increase, with approximately two-thirds of physicians now testing to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from PD-1 directed therapy. This is very important as we prepare for a potential first-line indication, where we recently announced that KEYTRUDA offers an overall survival benefit compared to chemotherapy in patients whose tumors expressed high levels of PD-L1. Customers are eagerly awaiting the opportunity to treat lung cancer in a first-line setting with KEYTRUDA.","We also believe that all of the work that we've been doing to drive testing for second-line use will position us well in first-line when we come to market. With the broad and deep clinical program that continues to grow and continues to generate positive monotherapy and combination data, we remain very excited about the long-term opportunity for KEYTRUDA.","Next, in primary care, the JANUVIA franchise grew 2% this quarter. In the United States, we continue to drive TRx growth of 4% to 5%. As you recall, we saw 14% and 22% growth in the second and third quarters of last year, respectively. These tough comparisons had an impact on the year-over-year changes this quarter and will also impact year-over-year changes in the third quarter. But I continue to focus on the underlying TRx volume growth, and it remains strong in the United States.","Outside of the U.S., we generated strong growth in Europe and Canada and in emerging markets. We remain confident in our diabetes franchise for the remainder of 2016, and we're pleased with our continued strong access that we expect in 2017.","Moving to our Vaccine business. Sales in the Vaccine portfolio reached about $1.3 billion. Growth of 7% came primarily from our pediatric vaccines, which was partially offset by GARDASIL. Overall, GARDASIL sales declined 7%. In the U.S., sales of GARDASIL grew only 2% due to lower CDC buying. Outside of the U.S., sales were impacted by the timing of public-sector purchases in Brazil.","We're celebrating the 10-year anniversary of the launch of GARDASIL. Real-world data that was recently published continued to show the benefits of HPV vaccination and we are seeing increased uptake and utilization of our HPV vaccine around the world. Also, influential organizations, including the CDC, ASCO and the WHO have expressed strong support for HPV vaccination.","It is worth noting that many markets are moving toward implementing a two-dose regimen of GARDASIL, and there are discussions ongoing in the U.S. as well. We anticipate this change to a two-dose regimen could go into effect in the U.S. by the end of 2016 or early in 2017.","Finally, in Hospital Specialty Care, sales grew 3% to $2.1 billion. Growth in acute care and contributions from launch products were partially offset by declines in REMICADE and ISENTRESS due to competitive pressures that we expect will continue going forward. We are making good progress with the ZEPATIER launch. We're having favorable conversations with payers and we've garnered some early wins in both the public and the private sectors for 2016 and 2017.","In the VA, utilization of ZEPATIER is ramping up nicely, and we've also started to see some advancement in Medicare Part D, in managed Medicaid and in commercial segments. Customers see the value that ZEPATIER can offer, with high cure rates in a broad and diverse set of patients. It will take some time for ZEPATIER to ramp up as formularies come online, but we are pleased with the access that we've achieved so far.","Finally, BRIDION is growing well on strong global demand and early contributions from the U.S. launch. In the U.S., our teams are rapidly securing formulary access, and initial indicators of use by physicians in the surgical suite are encouraging. In closing, our teams delivered another quarter of solid performance. We have momentum in our four focus areas and strong execution for our key launches. This positions us well for the second half of 2016 and for 2017.","Now I'll turn the call over to Roger.","Roger M. Perlmutter - EVP & President-Merck Research Laboratories","Thanks, Adam. During the second quarter, we made significant progress in gaining registration for important new products and also advanced a number of new programs. On the infectious disease front, in June the FDA antimicrobial advisory committee agreed on a vote of 10 to five with one abstention, that substantial evidence of the safety and effectiveness of bezlotoxumab, now called ZINPLAVA, in preventing recurrence of C. difficile infection in patients 18 years and older had been presented.","Subsequently, the FDA has requested additional information to enable their review of the ZINPLAVA file with the result that a new action date of October 23 has been set. We are working closely with the FDA and its other regulatory agencies to make ZINPLAVA available to patients at risk for recurrent C. difficile infection.","Considerable progress has also been made in advancing curative therapies for hepatitis C virus infection, the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, known as the CHMP, adopted a positive opinion regarding the approval of ZEPATIER for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection noting its high efficacy against HCV genotypes 1 and 4 including in patients with compensated cirrhosis and severe kidney disease. This recommendation has now been ratified by the European commission. I will remind you that ZEPATIER is not cleared by the kidney and can be used in patients irrespective of baseline renal function.","As I mentioned during the first quarter earnings call, we are working to supply the European market. We've made good progress on this front and still expect that we'll be able to launch ZEPATIER in the EU in the fourth quarter or at the latest, in the first quarter of 2017. Reviews in other jurisdictions are also proceeding.","Meanwhile, we are continuing to explore additional treatments for the more than 150 million people with hepatitis C virus infection around the world. Progress is made in advancing our triplet regimen incorporating MK-3682, a urodonal nucleoside polymerase inhibitor, along with the protease inhibitor grazoprevir and a novel NS5A inhibitor MK-8408. We now have substantial experience with this combination with more than 1,000 patients enrolled in clinical trials, and results from our extensive Phase 2b program will be available later this year and will be presented at major scientific meetings. Because of the favorable properties of MK-3682, we're also exploring a doublet regimen employing just this polymerase inhibitor along with MK-8408. Together, we believe that these combinations can offer broad efficacy for HCV infected patients irrespective of HCV genotype and in a variety of clinical settings.","Lastly, on the infectious disease front, I note that our V920 vaccine to prevent Ebola virus disease received FDA breakthrough designation and prime designation from the EMA, permitting close regulatory interactions to optimize development and facilitate review of this important, potentially life-saving agent.","Turning now to oncology, this was an extremely active quarter for KEYTRUDA our PD-1 directed immunotherapy for malignant disease. I have said repeatedly that I expect that KEYTRUDA, by virtue of the spectrum of its activity, will prove to be foundational in future cancer care. At the American Society for Clinical Oncology meetings last month, we presented data demonstrating the activity of KEYTRUDA as monotherapy in 15 different tumor types. We also presented data from multiple studies where KEYTRUDA has been used in combination with conventional chemotherapy, with targeted therapies and with immunotherapies. In all, we now have more than 300 clinical studies underway exploring the activity of KEYTRUDA in more than 30 different tumor types. More than 100 of these studies employ KEYTRUDA in combination with other agents.","In Europe, the CHMP adopted a positive opinion for the use of KEYTRUDA in the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in patients who have failed at least one prior therapy and whose tumors express the PD-L1 biomarker. We have championed the view that because patient outcomes from the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer are correlated with the extent to which PD-L1 is expressed on the tumor, it is important to assess the status of this biomarker prior to initiating therapy with a PD-1 directed agent. The data supporting our dossier were derived from the KEYNOTE-010 study which showed that KEYTRUDA treatment in populations with 1% or more of tumor cells expressing PD-L1 yielded superior overall survival compared with the results of traditional chemotherapy. These data are also under review by the FDA with an action date of October 24.","During the quarter, we also reported topline results of our KEYNOTE-024 study which compared KEYTRUDA monotherapy to platinum-based chemotherapy in the first line treatment of patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. KEYTRUDA treatment demonstrated superior progression-free survival and superior overall survival in this setting. A manuscript describing these results has now been accepted for publication and hence, should appear in the near future. We've also begun to work with regulatory agencies to enable supplementary filing of these data to our existing KEYTRUDA labels.","Beyond treatment of melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, we have pursued accelerated approval for KEYTRUDA for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. The PDUFA date for this review is August 9.","Based on our current trial enrollments, we have several additional potential filings for KEYTRUDA over the next 12 to 18 months, including bladder cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer in the setting of microsatellite instability, and relapsed refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma, an indication for which we received breakthrough designation from the FDA in the second quarter.","Moreover, data continue to provide intriguing evidence of the broad spectrum of KEYTRUDA activity. Earlier this month, for example, Julie Graff and colleagues at the Oregon Health Sciences University published a preliminary report demonstrating meaningful responses in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer who had progressed on enzalutamide.","As Rob noted, R&D expenses increased this quarter, in large part owing to the establishment of our business partnership with Moderna on the development of novel immunogens with the goal of further improving the efficacy of our immunomodulatory agents, including KEYTRUDA. While we have, through the Moderna investment, as well as our funding of key clinical trials, increased our support for KEYTRUDA in immuno-oncology, we continue to pursue other important new therapies.","For example, this week we announced the closing of our acquisition of Afferent Pharmaceuticals, which gives us access to a set of P2X3 receptor antagonists. Their lead program, AF-219, is currently under study in a fully-enrolled Phase 2b trial for the treatment of chronic cough, and is also being investigated in a Phase 2 study for the same indication in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. I look forward to updating you on this and other programs in the coming months.","Meanwhile, we continue to support the development of ertugliflozin, both as monotherapy and in combination with JANUVIA. We have presented important Phase 3 data on this program and will submit regulatory dossiers before the end of the year. Also, we expect to receive the adjudicated cardiovascular safety data from odanacatib from our external evaluators in the next few days, which will then be analyzed over the next several weeks. It is my expectation that the U.S. odanacatib file will be submitted in the fourth quarter.","I'll now turn the call over to Teri.","Teri Loxam - Investor Relations Contact","Thanks, Roger. As we move forward with Q&A, we would like to get in as many questions as possible this morning on the call, so we'd appreciate it if you'd limit yourself to just one question each.","Darla, if we can move forward with Q&A, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Your first question comes from Tim Anderson with Bernstein.","Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. I have a commercial question on the PD-1s. So Bristol's first line trial results coming up, in your opinion, if they hit PFS and possibly OS in all PDL-1 expressors, not just the high expressors, how much of a benefit do you think that gives them commercially? Already they're obviously much more penetrated in lung in the second line setting. They're already getting usage in first line to some degree off-label, and I'm wondering if they were to hit in a broader population, if you think that makes a substantial difference?","And can I just clarify the comment about publication timeline for 024? Sounds like, if I heard you right, that's already been accepted. You said that it would be published in the nearer term. I'm assuming that doesn't get published before ESMO, but ESMO would be the likely venue for concurrent publication.","Roger M. Perlmutter - EVP & President-Merck Research Laboratories","Hello, Tim. It's Roger. Just the manuscript was accepted for publication. I don't have a publication date so I can't really speculate on when it would be published vis-\u00e0-vis ESMO, but we have an accepted manuscript. And I'll let Adam comment on the commercial question.","Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President, President-Global Human Health","So, Tim, I think it's a very important question and I'll walk you through how I think about it. The first thing is, I will be very glad to be first to market. Being first to market for a new indication matters. And I remember when we were first to market with melanoma, people were asking if you have progression-free survival but you don't have overall survival? They come out with overall survival, will it matter? And I kept saying I just want to be first, and as long as we have the studies underway to show that ultimately we can show overall survival, that we should be okay.","If you look at first line lung, the first thing I'd say is we're glad to be first. The second thing is, the issue that we have right now with PD-L1 testing in second line, where the competition has all comers, I think that will go away in first line, because everybody will be doing PD-L1 testing. So that obstacle that we face today goes away with first line. The second question will become not only what the indication is but what reimbursement occurs and even today, you start to see reimbursement occurring even where you don't necessarily have the indication and the good news is at the time of the first line launch, we should have data in second line showing a positive results in the PD-L1 plus one positive. So we'll have data in plus one to 50 for second line. So we still have to see how it plays out, but I'm pleased to be first to launch hopefully and then we'll see how the reimbursement works out over time.","Teri Loxam - Investor Relations Contact","Great. Next question, please, Darla?","Operator","It's from Geoff Meacham with Barclays.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. Roger, you've downplayed the chances of achieving an OS benefit in the past and now that you have it, I was hoping that you can put it maybe in clinical context, especially given the crossover.","Roger M. Perlmutter - EVP & President-Merck Research Laboratories","Yeah, Geoff, I don't think I downplayed the possibility. I think it's always the case that it's uncertain what the results of clinical trials will be and their experiments and we don't know the answer in advance. Certainly we're very pleased with the results that we saw in the 024 study. There's meaningful crossover of course as there is now in any such study. And the fact that we achieved overall survival even in the context of meaningful crossover I think gives a sense of how powerful the benefit is. Keep in mind that we had a small amount of first line data that we had obtained in the 001-F cohort so we knew that there was benefit in that setting. And in that sense, it's not surprising to see impressive PFS results. The overall survival obviously was something that we'd hoped for and it's nice to see it come through.","Teri Loxam - Investor Relations Contact","Great. Thanks. Darla, next question?","Operator","It's from John Boris with SunTrust.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions. On the Bristol and Lilly calls, they indicated that OPDIVO was seeing up to 15% to 20% use in first line lung. Can you comment at all, Adam, about use of KEYTRUDA in first line lung? And then a tangential question to that one for Roger. It would seem that, based on the CheckMate-012 data that an objection that your sales reps might be getting is that has KEYTRUDA been studied in lung cancer across all PD-1 levels with a CTLA-4 type mechanism like a YERVOY. Can you help me understand why a physician would use KEYTRUDA in first line lung or across second line lung if its next step is, and it believes that it needs to go on to an IO-IO combo versus an IO-chemo combo? Thanks.","Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President, President-Global Human Health","Yeah, so, John, with regard to KEYTRUDA, right now in the U.S., about 70% of the use is still melanoma and then there's somewhere between 10% to 15% that we believe is in second line lung and then the rest is amongst a whole host of different uses. So the utilization of first line lung right now is very low. But what's important is we're seeing PD-L1 testing start to occur more and more often. And I mentioned that two-thirds of physicians are now testing. And what we see is when physicians test, they tend to use KEYTRUDA and that's where we see the utilization of KEYTRUDA for lung right now. The good news is the work that we've been doing on testing I think is going to pay off for us as we get the first line indication and the obstacle goes away for second line so I'm very encouraged and excited about the opportunity to launch in first line for sure.","Roger M. Perlmutter - EVP & President-Merck Research Laboratories","Yeah, and John, it's Roger. The truth of the matter is we really, as I've said, need to understand how well KEYTRUDA works as monotherapy and for that matter, OPDIVO, in order to be able to understand how to proceed with combination therapies. The combination therapy work is all extremely early. We do not have any data that tell us that any combination provides superior overall survival versus monotherapy. Indeed, we have the first data in first line lung that show that KEYTRUDA is superior to traditional chemotherapy. And that, again, it needs to be reviewed. But when people have a chance to look at the data, that represents a real sea change in the way people treat lung cancer.","Combination chemotherapy has been the mainstay of therapy for decades. So that's going to be a pretty big deal. If you look at response rates, an imperfect indicator of course, the best response rates that we see are the combination of KEYTRUDA with chemotherapy like pemetrexed where we reported small number of patients, 71% overall response rate in the lung cancer setting, which is obviously very provocative. With time, I think we'll discover how best to use these agents in combination. Whether that's an immuno-oncology combination with a CTLA-4 directed molecule, with other molecules. We have 10 of them in development on our own, or with chemotherapeutic agents, time will tell.","Teri Loxam - Investor Relations Contact","Thanks, Roger. Darla, next question please.","Operator","It's from Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore Group LLC","Hey, guys. Thank you very much for taking my question. I appreciate it. I guess I'll follow up on the last question, Roger, if I may. When I think about the market for immuno-oncology, what I always tell clients is lung is where the money is and if you could really figure out lung, you'll probably figure out the space. The other tumors \u2013 lung is probably bigger than all the other tumors combined. So, I imagine you're very focused on this too. So my question is, specifically, what do you think of the data that Bristol has put up on YERVOY plus nivolumab? And that will be out next year. And what are you doing to hedge against that risk, that that becomes a standard of care?","Roger M. Perlmutter - EVP & President-Merck Research Laboratories","Well, Mark, I mean, first of all, lung is not larger than all other tumors combined. I mean, it's an extremely important cancer, but again, I keep trying to point out that we are at a very early point in the evaluation of the use of PD-1 directed therapies in malignant disease. Just again, as an example, the fact that we're seeing prostate cancer responses, remember that previously, it was thought prostate cancer was refractory to PD-1 directed therapy, OPDIVO treatment. There were really no results. That shows you that we're still learning a great deal about how to use this as monotherapy.","Combinations, a lot of combinations appear to be showing early signs of signals, whether that's combinations of chemotherapy or combinations in the case of OPDIVO and us as well, with ipilimumab with CTLA-4. Time will tell which is the best combination. If it turned out that ipilimumab was the best combination, then that would be the way to go forward and we obviously have studies using that combination, as do others. Our combination studies with targeted chemotherapies and traditional chemotherapies are also very far along, and that will be extremely interesting. We'll have a chance to see those data relatively soon. We'll finish the first of those sets of studies in the third quarter. So we'll have to see the data very soon.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks, Roger.","Teri Loxam - Investor Relations Contact","Thanks. Darla, next question please.","Operator","It's from Steve Scala with Cowen.","Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. Regarding the upcoming KEYTRUDA PDUFA in head and neck cancer, should we assume approval will be only for third line PD-L1-positive patients, given that that was the population studied? Or should we expect a broader label than that? And how should we think about the size of the opportunity as well? Thank you.","Roger M. Perlmutter - EVP & President-Merck Research Laboratories","Well, first of all, with respect to the approval, I cannot comment on what exactly the label will look like except to say that in general, of course, you get the label for the population that you've studied, and that's what we would expect. And so this is the first and it's an accelerated approval in the head and neck cancer setting. There's a lot of additional information that will be coming up from our other studies going forward. In terms of the size of the opportunity, I'll let Adam speak to that.","Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President, President-Global Human Health","Hi, Steve. So if you look at head and neck, it's a few thousand patients in the United States. But again, it's not about any one indication. It's about KEYTRUDA becoming the foundational therapy. And when you listen to Roger's introduction and you hear all the different indications and the tumors and combinations that we're studying, it's going to be all those together that we're preparing for every day that's going to make KEYTRUDA a foundational for the treatment of cancer in our view.","Teri Loxam - Investor Relations Contact","Thanks. Darla, let's move on.","Operator","It's from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Chris Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just switching gears a little bit. Can you elaborate on the ZEPATIER launch thus far? Any surprises that you're seeing? And when we think about market sizing over time for HCV, how do you see the number of patients treated annually trending from here? Do you think overall market volumes can increase or do you think we've hit a peak? Thanks.","Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President, President-Global Human Health","Hi, Chris. This is Adam. So we're six months into the launch of ZEPATIER and we're encouraged by the progress that we're seeing. Obviously, the first thing we're doing is trying to secure access. And as I mentioned, we have early wins, so in Medicare Part D for example, we have United and Express Scripts where they've added us at parity to their Medicare Part D formulary effective July 1. In Medicaid we're making significant progress in not only getting our formulary, but some of those Medicaid formularies have increased the number of patients that they're making eligible for treatment. We're working very closely with our commercial customers and access is progressing. We still have some negotiations that are ongoing as we speak.","And as I said, the VA continues to ramp up nicely. So we're encouraged by the access that we're getting and now we have to work to build market share and that's what we're going to focus on as we move forward. In terms of the overall market, it's a large market. There's about 3 million patients in the U.S. that still need to be treated so it's going to be a market that'll be around for a while. We're currently seeing just over 200,000 or so patients per year treated in the U.S. That's a lot more than if you would have gone back five years ago where there was somewhere between 120,000 to 150,000. So we've certainly seen an increase, but that increase I think has maxed out and I think we'll see more of where we are as a steady state as we move forward and really, the size and the pace of the market's going to depend on getting more patients diagnosed and through the system as we move forward.","Teri Loxam - Investor Relations Contact","Thanks. Next question please, Darla.","Operator","It's from Colin Bristow with Bank of America.","Colin N. Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking the questions. So on KEYTRUDA in first line, and on Tim's question, just given the lack of PD-L1 testing harmonization and therefore the need to test for the drugs you want to use, if Bristol does show a PFS and OS benefit across a broader PD-L1 expression population, what would drive physicians to test for KEYTRUDA given it would carry a low probability of a positive result? And then just a follow on for KEYTRUDA, could you give some details around the current performance in terms of share in each indication? Thank you.","Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President, President-Global Human Health","Yeah, so let me start. First of all, the label says for KEYTRUDA that it's based upon a PD-L1 test by an FDA-approved test, it doesn't have a specific test assigned to KEYTRUDA versus OPDIVO. So I'm not concerned, and frankly, most of the commercial labs that are measuring PD-L1 and\/or the individual institutions that do it themselves are not having designated tests for designated products. So that's not a concern frankly. In addition to that, with first line lung, I believe everybody's going to start to measure PD-L1 right from the start, so even for the competition, I think they're going to be advocating the importance of measuring PD-L1 moving forward. So that obstacle will go away.","And then ultimately I believe it's going to come down to the market share that you're able to achieve within the lung segment and therefore I'm very pleased that we'll be the first one to launch. If you look specifically at our share of our business, about 70% of our business is in melanoma, 15% is in lung and then the rest is in all other indications. And then you can kind of extrapolate that if you look at \u2013 we have about, if you look at the dollar sales reported, about 30% of the dollar sales in share right now.","Roger M. Perlmutter - EVP & President-Merck Research Laboratories","And, Colin, it's Roger. The blueprint project demonstrated that PD-L1 diagnostic test that's used by Bristol-Myers for OPDIVO and our diagnostic tests are actually very similar in terms of their results and can be used almost interchangeably.","Teri Loxam - Investor Relations Contact","Thanks. Next question, please, Darla.","Operator","It's from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC","Oh, thanks for the question. So just a couple of quick ones. Number one, can you just remind us again what the benefit on tax was this quarter? It seems quite a bit lower than I would've anticipated this quarter.","The second question is, as it relates to the manuscript that's in place, obviously we don't know the timing, but one would presume that that could impact NCCN guidelines and obviously uptake in the front line setting. So am I thinking about the commercial impact of that publication? And what would be the second publication to sort of validate the effect that obviously you're going to see an overall survival benefit in that patient population?","And the last question is, relative to the transcript, obviously you don't want any surprises with the FDA's filing and evaluation so one would presume that the filing, in fact, could be with the agency at this point. Would that be a separate filing per se, or is it possible that that could be incorporated into the existing filing for KEYNOTE-010? We have seen the agency moving that way before, but should we think of this as a separate and distinct filing, or is it possible that it could be incorporated into the KEYNOTE-010 file? Thanks a lot.","Robert M. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Seamus. It's Rob. I'll answer the tax question and then turn it over to Roger. What the benefit relates to is the IRS allows you four orphan drug clinical trials. So if you have a drug that has a validated orphan status from the FDA, the clinical trial expenses related to that drug can be taken as a credit against your tax. That's what we refer to as the orphan drug tax credit. This relates to certain indications within, and stages within malignant melanoma that did receive a designation. I think we got it back in 2013 and then we spent the majority of times since then accumulating the data and validating the expense, and that led to the accrual you saw in the quarter. So that drove the vast bulk of the one-time benefit that we saw in the quarter.","Roger M. Perlmutter - EVP & President-Merck Research Laboratories","And, Seamus, it's Roger. With respect to the manuscript, as you say, the first manuscript which describes the results of the 024 study, you asked about what would be the second publication. And there will be a number of publications that will come out of the study. Although it's not an enormous study, there's still a lot of data there. And the first thing is to step through the primary and secondary endpoints and the characteristics of the treatment results. And thereafter, there'll be a lot of color and shading that will be added in other publications. It's important data to get out there. My view, looking at the data, is that they're potentially practice-changing and it's important that there be a chance to review that. Those data of course wouldn't be available for review by NCCN or other agencies until such time as publication takes place.","Then you also raised a question about our interaction with regulatory agencies. And all I can say about that is we've done our discussions. We're working closely with regulatory agencies to understand the basis for filing supplements in the context of having multiple reviews.","And maybe if I could elevate just a little bit, I would say that the workload for regulatory agencies, given the very large number of studies that we and our competitors are doing in this field, is quite substantial. And how best to manage that workload and evaluate all these new data that are coming in is something I think that FDA and other regulatory agencies are wrestling with.","Teri Loxam - Investor Relations Contact","Thanks, Roger. Darla, we'll move on to the next person, please.","Operator","It's from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Just a couple of questions. First, you talk about the advantage of being first, which I agree with in front line lung. But do you expect that there will be off-label use for KEYTRUDA in patients with less than 50% PD-L1 expression? And when are those trials that the all comers, or the over 1% expressors and above, when are they expected to read out? Then I have a question for Ken. On almost every conference call or meeting you've hinted at the desire to do deals, business development, the importance of that to your long-term strategy, yet we really haven't seen much in the way of deals this year. The deals have been relatively small in nature. Is that what the hint is today, that the types of deals you're likely to do are likely to be like the Moderna deals or the smaller deals? Or should we still expect that Merck is likely to announce a major transaction, which is something that I think you signaled earlier in the year? And when you think about the company's outlook over the next five years with a number of LOEs, how important is a large transaction to your growth strategy? Thanks very much.","Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President, President-Global Human Health","Yeah, so, Jami, this is Adam. So first of all, being first to market does matter. And as you said, I think it is an advantage. We will only obviously be able to promote it based upon the label that we have, and therefore be in expressors greater than 50%. Whether there's off-label use, we'll have to see what NCCN decides and what individual physicians decide. It wouldn't surprise me if they decide that, but again, it's nothing that we would ever try to encourage or promote.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And on business development, thank you for the question, Jami. What I am signaling is that business development remains a very important priority and we're very actively engaged in trying to find the best scientific innovation. Our main focus is to continue to augment our Phase 2 and early-stage pipeline. We remain very active with new partnerships and collaborations and we're also looking actively for bolt-on acquisitions in key growth areas.","Now from our perspective, I think it's important to remember that for us, a bolt-on acquisition is not defined by size. When we talk about a bolt-on, we're focusing more on finding the right assets that can augment our pipeline as compared to doing a large deal just, for example, cross synergies. So all of that being said, we are looking very carefully. We're taking our time and we're being diligent in seeking out the right assets at the right valuation. And I think that's what you should read into this. And I think if you look across what's happened in the industry, there has been a re-rating of certain assets, but those boards and management teams are also taking time to assess what they actually think will happen going forward in their future. So I wouldn't read anything into it other than the deals we've done and the ones that we think can add value, and we'll continue to look at all kinds of deals going forward.","Teri Loxam - Investor Relations Contact","Thanks, Ken. Darla, can we move on to the next question, please?","Operator","From Tony Butler with Guggenheim Securities.","Tony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yes. Excuse me. Good morning. Roger, brief question. In the Julie Graff data, did she actually see responses in prostate cancer patients who were PD-L1 negative, and\/or was that what informed you to decide to do three cohorts in the 199 trial? And then briefly, Adam, on ZEPATIER, can you say to date what percentage of sales are government, from government channels versus those from commercial channels, realizing that may change over the next six months? Thanks very much.","Roger M. Perlmutter - EVP & President-Merck Research Laboratories","Tony, it's Roger. The Graff data are \u2013 it's a very small study and you're talking about just a handful of responders. It's unknown in each one of these settings whether the PD-L1 biomarker, and this is part of a large set of biomarkers that we look at, whether the PD-L1 biomarker is relevant to that particular tumor type and if it is, whether the relevant index is the tumor proportion score, or more broadly, the combination of both tumor cells and inflammatory cells. So still a lot of work being done in the area of biomarkers and how predictive they are. Stay tuned. I think the important thing to note is that in a tumor type that was previously believed to be refractory, that is where an immune-oncology would provide no benefit, there's clear evidence there could be some.","Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President, President-Global Human Health","And Tony, this is Adam. So we've sold $112 million of ZEPATIER for the quarter and again, we're still early into the launch. I mentioned that we have some Medicare Part D wins that start July 1, so obviously you won't see a lot of sales from those in the quarter. Most of the sales in the quarter came from the VA and some other segments where we had utilization for patients with renal insufficiency. But as we move forward, I would expect that the mix is going to change substantially. And as Medicaid \u2013 I'm sorry. As Medicare Part D commercial ramps up, I think you'll see a very different mix.","Teri Loxam - Investor Relations Contact","Thanks, Adam. Darla, move on to the next person please.","Operator","It's from Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Adam, do you have any comments on REMICADE dynamics and that rate of erosion and how you've chose to play defense there? And maybe you could comment on how that experience so far shapes your view on the potential for biosimilars from an offensive standpoint. And Rob, since we don't have the 10-Q, would you mind providing cash flow from ops and receivables if you have those handy? Thanks.","Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President, President-Global Human Health","Hi, Gregg. This is Adam. With regard to REMICADE, our strategy all along has been to try to hold onto as many existing patients that were currently treated as we can. And I think we've done a very good job with that. Most of our loss of revenue came from reference pricing due to lower prices from the biosimilars. However, we're certainly starting to see that we're not only losing new patients, but there are some countries in Scandinavia, and even some other larger countries, that are beginning to think about substituting therapeutically even existing patients. So I do believe that we're going to continue to see erosion for REMICADE, that the biosimilar impacts, they are accelerating and they're going to continue as we go through the year.","As I think about biosimilars in the future, I think the key is going to be what your order entry is into the marketplace and being first or second in the marketplace will matter. Each market molecule's going to be different and we're going to deploy different strategies based upon those markets. You see a different strategy, for example, that you might use in the UK and France versus Germany. And we'll have to be very specific by market how we launch our biosimilar portfolio. At the same time what I'd say is SIMPONI grew 16% ex-exchange. So even though you see an impact on REMICADE, you haven't seen that go over into the other anti-TNFs, and therefore we expect to continue to see good growth from SIMPONI.","Robert M. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And Gregg, this is Rob. We don't have the specifics for cash flow and the working capital you're asking for this morning. We're still finalizing some of those parts. But in general, we tend to continue to see strong trends in cash flow and continue to see overall working capital improving across inventory and payables. And then on the receivables side, there's a little bit of a swing back. But I think part of that's due to just as we're launching new products, the mix of the receivables on those relative to what we're seeing on the others. But there's nothing new or significant, continuing trends, and you'll see the exact numbers when you see the Q.","Teri Loxam - Investor Relations Contact","Thanks, Darla. We'll go to the next question, please.","Operator","It's from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks very much. I was hoping, Ken, that you could paint a picture of how you see the next couple of years unfolding. Obviously you don't provide long-term revenue guidance, but you have some big growth drivers in KEYTRUDA and ZEPATIER and at the same time, you'll be experiencing the patent expirations of VYTORIN and ZETIA and CUBICIN. And so I guess I'm asking, could you help frame for us how you see the evolution of Merck's revenue base and what other key revenue contributors you see to help offset the patent expiration pressures? Thank you.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, obviously we're not in a position, as you suggested, to give any 2017 guidance yet. But we are actively looking across our portfolio at the best ways, as Rob said, to balance in the near term investments while continuing to drive long-term growth. We do anticipate some headwinds from several LOE's as you suggested ZETIA, VYTORIN, CUBICIN and NASONEX. But we're also pleased that we are maintaining the steady growth of JANUVIA as a foundation to launch these products like KEYTRUDA and ZEPATIER.","Beyond that, as you know, we have things that are coming out of our pipeline. Roger made reference to building onto our diabetes franchise with ertu [ertugliflozin] as well as odanacatib. Next year we're looking forward to being unblinded with respect to our base inhibitor and anacetrapib. So those would be some of the internal things.","And then, as I mentioned in response to an earlier question, we continue to look at business development and inorganic growth as an important critical part of our strategy going forward. As I sit here today, obviously I haven't anything new to announce to you. But I just want you to know that we're actively pursuing value-creating, inorganic growth opportunities.","Teri Loxam - Investor Relations Contact","Thanks, Ken. Darla, we'll move on to the next person, please.","Operator","It's from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, folks, and thank you for taking the questions. Adam, I know you're well aware of the significant price erosion in the hep C market as a result of increased competition. As you look at the immuno-oncology market, how comfortable are you with long-term price sustainability there as the number treatment options increase over the next few years? Thank you.","Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President, President-Global Human Health","yeah, so I would look at them as separate and distinct markets and I think the big difference is Medicare Part D versus the way in which the hepatitis C products are reimbursed. So I think there's different dynamics in those two markets. With that said, as you look forward and you think about combinations of potential immunotherapies or combinations with other therapies, we have to find additional ways to think about contracting with customers and working with customers differently than the way in which you do today. It's remarkable when you think about the number of indications that we're studying KEYTRUDA for and we think about how we're building this huge wall of data. It's going to be real hard for followers to match us with the data that we're going to have over time. And we're going to have to find ways to work with payers so that they can really find the right way to ensure the patients that need our monotherapy or our combination therapies in the future have access to it. So we're going to continue to think about the right ways to do pricing and contracting. But I feel pretty confident, as I sit here today, that we'll be able to maintain good contracts and access as we move forward.","Teri Loxam - Investor Relations Contact","Thanks, Darla. We'll move on.","Operator","To Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Yes, morning. Adam, can you talk about the emerging markets broadly, what's going on there with your products? Obviously excluding Venezuela, which we know what is going on. And then secondly, can you talk about the JANUVIA, JANUMET franchise overseas? And just give us a flavor for how those products are doing relative to all the changes going on in the broader diabetes market. Thanks.","Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President, President-Global Human Health","Yeah. So, first of all, with regard to emerging markets, ex-Venezuela, ex-foreign exchange we grew about 6%. So we continue to have good growth in the emerging markets. And if you look at China, we had 11% growth ex-foreign exchange. So the growth, albeit not as good as it was couple years ago, it continues to be robust.","With that said, lumping emerging markets together today is not a good idea because you have very different dynamics in terms of what's occurring in a market like China versus what's occurring in a market like Russia or what's happening in Argentina. So we really do focus market by market what our opportunities for growth are, and then we titrate our expense base in those markets based upon the opportunities. But I do believe that the emerging markets will provide growth going forward and remain an important opportunity for us as we move forward.","With regard to JANUVIA outside the U.S., we continue to see good growth in Europe and Canada and that growth is coming from volume. And the volume growth in most of those markets is very strong. I'd say the biggest issue we're facing is the fact that our market share is so high in countries like Germany that it's hard to grow market share so we have to continue to find ways to grow from sulphonylureas and ultimately from metformin.","But there's hundreds of millions of patients that need to be treated outside the U.S. If you look at the emerging markets, we have strong double-digit growth of JANUVIA. I think that's going to continue over time. And we really have not gotten NRDL approval for JANUVIA in China yet. So once that's achieved, I think that that represents another opportunity for us for growth of the JANUVIA franchise outside of the U.S.","Teri Loxam - Investor Relations Contact","Thanks, Adam. Darla, I know we're getting to the top of the hour and there's other calls in this space today. We're going to try to squeeze in one more question.","Operator","It's from Andrew Baum with Citi.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you. Pivoting towards HIV, from the data you recently presented, it looks like you have once daily ISENTRESS. Could you talk to both the defensive properties of having that molecule given the erosion of that (57:45) market from Gilead and GSK or (57:49) as we've seen historically? But also can you talk about the potential offensive strategies given you now have a base for a single tablet once-a-day regimen? Thank you.","Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President, President-Global Human Health","Yeah, so as you look at our HIV franchise, obviously we've been losing dollar share and volume based upon what's occurring in the competitive set in the marketplace, so we are really glad that we're going to have a q.d. ISENTRESS. And I think it will be very helpful for us. The key is generally speaking we don't give guidance at a product level, but it's unlikely that the introduction of q.d. ISENTRESS is going to be able to return the franchise to growth. I think it's going to enable us to be able to compete better within that marketplace as it exists. But I wouldn't look for very strong growth moving forward based upon that product for the franchise.","Roger M. Perlmutter - EVP & President-Merck Research Laboratories","And if I could just say \u2013 it's Roger \u2013 we have quite a number of compounds that we have developed that have been treating properties with respect to HIV therapy that are all in early development. I haven't had a chance to talk about those in an earnings call setting, but will hope to as more data become available.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Let me just close by saying this was a strong quarter. We continue to execute on our innovation-based strategy and we continue to look for the best opportunities for long-term growth with respect to things like KEYTRUDA and ZEPATIER, but we're also eager to find the best opportunities that will create long-term value for our shareholders both inorganically and organically. Thank you very much.","Teri Loxam - Investor Relations Contact","Thanks, Darla. That concludes the call.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes Merck's Q2 2016 sales and earnings conference call.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Joseph Romanelli, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Joseph Romanelli","Thank you, Christy, and good morning, everyone. We\u2019d also like to say good afternoon and good evening to everyone listening outside the United States. Welcome to Merck\u2019s fourth quarter 2014 conference call. Before I turn the call over to Ken, I just want to play out a couple of items.","First, you will see that we have items in our GAAP results, such as the acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded those items from our non-GAAP results. There are reconciliation tables available in our press release, so you can get a better understanding of the underlying performance.","We have also provided tables to help you understand the sales results in the quarter for the business units, as well as for the products. This could be found in Table 3 of our press release and the reconciliation table, I mentioned earlier, is in Table 2 of the release. During the call, we will be referring to Table 2 for the P&L and Table 3 as it relates to revenue.","Second, I would like to remind you that some of the statements we make during today\u2019s call might be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck\u2019s management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risk or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.","Our SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2013 10-K identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck underscores no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements and you can see our SEC filings, as well as today\u2019s earnings release on merck.com.","So, with that, this morning, I am joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Adam Schechter, President of Global Human Health; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Labs.","So, with that, I'll turn the call over to Ken.","Ken Frazier","Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining the call today. Our performance this quarter is the result of the proactive steps we are taking to further sharpen our commercial and R&D focus, redesign our operating model and reduce our cost base.","We are evolving Merck\u2019s operating model and recognition of the evolution underway in healthcare markets across the world and we will continue to focus our resources on those internal and external opportunities that can generate the most value for patients, customers and shareholders.","While we made real progress in 2014, you should all know that we are by no means content. Over the past year our greater focus has led to better execution, a point underscored by the effort that led the KEYTRUDA being the first PD-1 inhibitor approved in the United States.","Another example of focus execution is restoring JANUVIA\u2019s growth. It is our intention to continue this focus discipline execution especially in areas where we have the greatest opportunities to grow internally.","While we are transforming the way Merck operates and executes, our fundamental strategy has remained consistent. Our success and our future will continue to be predicated upon what is long defined Merck, innovating at the intersection of scientific opportunity and global unmet medical need.","In short, there is no substitution for innovation, which we believe remains the best path to intrinsic long-term value creation, we intent to stay at the forefront of biopharmaceutical science and innovation.","Now turning to our results, I'm pleased that both on an annual and a quarterly basis, excluding exchange, we reported sales growth in diabetes, hospital, acute care and vaccine, as well as in our animal health business.","We also delivered on both our quarterly and full year non-GAAP EPS commitments. Our core underlying portfolio continues to perform well and our commercial organization remains focused on those areas where Merck medicines and vaccines commit their greatest contributions.","We have also said that an important part of our strategy is actively pursuing the best external opportunities to augment our portfolio, while divesting products and businesses that we believe can be better maximize outside Merck.","The divestiture of our Consumer Care business, as well as the acquisition of Cubist are examples of how we are executing this strategy. As we move into 2015, we will continue to look for the best opportunities to collaborate with academia and pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms to bring forward the next-generation of medical breakthroughs that can deliver value to patients, physicians and payers, and fuel our future.","Our increased commercial focus, acquisition of key assets and an unprecedented number of regulatory approvals in 2014 will enable us to launch several new innovative products in 2015, each with the potential to serve a critical unmet medical need. We are poised to capitalize on each of these opportunities.","I am pleased that last year, we not only achieved six new product approvals in the U.S. but also made steady progress in advancing our late-stage pipeline. We now have over 10 Phase 3 programs targeting many of the world's largest public health needs.","Roger will talk more about the exciting programs in our pipeline shortly, but let me reiterate, our industry is built on a foundation of innovation, effectively pursuing the most promising scientific discoveries both internally and externally, ultimately will be the key differentiator in determining company's ability to create long-term value for their shareholders and society.","Reducing our operating costs has allowed us to respond more rapidly to changes in the healthcare environment, drive greater profitability and invest in our late-stage portfolio. A little over a year ago, we pledge to reduce R&D and SG&A costs by $2.5 billion by the end of 2015 and I'm pleased to say that we are on track to meet this goal.","Finally, we have not lost focus on the importance of returning cash to our shareholders. The past year allowed us to return approximately $13 billion to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchases.","In 2015, our framework for deploying capital will remain consistent. We will balance investing in our business with funding compelling business development opportunities. And we remain firmly committed to returning cash to our shareholders.","Today, Merck has the opportunity to reduce the burden of disease in five of the most significant global health battles, cancer, hepatitis C, cardiometabolic disease, resistant microbial infection and Alzheimer's disease.","This is only possible because of our unwavering commitment to the discovery and development of transformational medicines and our willingness to challenge how we operate. These are both important forms of innovation and both will enhance our ability to thrive the changing healthcare environment and produce long-term value for patients, customers, society and shareholders.","In closing, we are continuing the strong momentum we achieved in 2014. We've made significant strides in our strategic initiative and accomplished groundbreaking milestones in our R&D labs. Moving forward, we expect to continue making major progress in advancing our late-stage pipeline, gaining first-in-class approvals in launching new innovative product.","And now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Adam Schechter.","Adam Schechter","Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone. This morning, I will provide you with an overview of the Global Human Health fourth quarter results. We\u2019ll also provide you with some context in the 2015 outlook. My comments will be on a constant currency basis. We finished 2014 with solid performance.","Sales reached $9.4 billion in the fourth quarter and they reflected growth in our four core areas of diabetes, hospital acute care, vaccines and oncology. And those are partially offset by hepatitis C market dynamics and product divestitures. If you exclude the divestitures, sales grew 3%.","First, I\u2019ll review performance of several key products and then I'll provide an update by region. And I\u2019ll begin with JANUVIA. The JANUVIA franchise reached approximately $1.7 billion in sales and grew 6% in the quarter and 4% for the full year. And our fourth quarter sales in United States grew 5%. Our increased focus on investment enabled us to defend our 75% market share and to grow the DPP-4 class.","In our international market, sales grew 6%. Europe and emerging markets continue to grow on strong demand. In Japan, sales declined as a result of DPP-4 class replacing in the competitive environment. We committed to grow JANUVIA in 2014 and our team worked hard to deliver on that commitment. We're entering 2015 with momentum to deliver another year of growth.","Next, in hospital and specialty care, sales of ISENTRESS were approximately $420 million in the fourth quarter, a decline of 1%. Internationally, we drove growth in Europe on continued volume increases. Emerging markets sales grew as a result of demand and of tenders. In United States, sales declined due to a tough year-over-year comparison and competitive dynamics.","On a full-year basis, ISENTRESS grew 3%. We expect continued competitive pressure in 2015. And we believe that based on its efficacy and tolerability, ISENTRESS will remain a compelling treatment option for our physicians. Sales of our immunology products reached approximately $750 million in fourth quarter, growing 5%.","Simponi remains the fastest growing anti-TNF in the markets we promote the brand. REMICADE sales declined 3% reflecting biosimilar competition in smaller EU markets, partially offset by growth in core markets. For the full year, our immunology business grew 10%.","However, we will lose patent protection for REMICADE this month across the remainder of our European markets. We expect competition for biosimilars to begin upon patent expiry. While we believe, we will retain many current patients being treated with REMICADE, we will face increased competition in new patients and there will be mandatory price reductions in certain markets.","In hospital acute care, sales were approximately $650 million and grew by 12% this quarter. We saw continued uptake of BRIDION in Europe and emerging markets as well solid performances from our antibiotic and antifungal treatments. Our hospital acute care business grew 11% for the full year.","In 2015, we expect continued growth driven by the strength of our legacy brands in the acquisition of Cubist. As a global leader in hospital acute care, we look forward to this business being a significant contributor to growth for Merck.","Now turning to our vaccine business. In the fourth quarter, vaccine sales grew 18% to $1.6 billion. Growth was driven by pediatric vaccines, Pneumovax and ZOSTAVAX and they were partially offset by GARDASIL. Sales of ZOSTAVAX were $285 million in the quarter, the highest quarter of sales of the brand.","In the United States, sales grew 7% in part as a result of our new DTC campaign, Internationally, sales grew 15%. We\u2019re now launching in more than 25 markets globally. GARDASIL sales declined 6% due to timing of customer purchases as well as fewer captive cohort vaccinations in certain emerging markets, we look forward to launch of GARDASIL 9 in the U.S. in the coming months.","The ACIP is expected to discuss GARDASIL 9 at its meeting in late February. We see GARDASIL 9 as the best-in-class HPV vaccine that will offer greater protection against cervical cancer and build upon our legacy in this important market. On a full-year basis, our vaccine business grew 4% to sales of $5.7 billion. Vaccines remain an important core focus area in 2015.","Now turning to some geographic commentary for the fourth quarter. Sales increased 1% in the U.S. but decreased 4% in Europe. In both regions, we drove growth in JANUVIA in our hospital acute care but sales were impacted by continued declines in hepatitis C portfolio and from product divestitures. Sales in Japan grew 1% despite the increases in Pneumovax sales, the biennial price decreases and ophthalmology product divestitures impacted growth this quarter.","Additionally in Japan, we launched Boursorama in November and we are encouraged by the early results of our launch efforts and from feedback by physicians. Sales in emerging markets grew 7%, driven by strong performance in China which grew 14%. Mexico and Turkey also contributed meaningfully to emerging market growth this quarter.","Now I\u2019ll spend a few moments speaking about the KEYTRUDA launch. We have made significant progress in bringing KEYTRUDA in the United States and through our expanded access program in several markets around the world. Sales of KEYTRUDA were $50 million in the fourth quarter.","Important to the early success of our launch is the strong market access we secured for KEYTRUDA, virtually all claims for the labeled indication are reimbursed without restriction within two months. In December, through broad acceptance of academic centers and community of treaters, we estimate roughly 2000 patients were receiving treatment with the KEYTRUDA. These figures indicate rapid uptake in patients fighting refractory metastatic melanoma.","Furthermore, we continue to fortify our oncology business unit as we prepare for potential launches in other tumors, such as non-small lung cancer. We are investing to be a global leader in oncology.","Now I\u2019ll briefly discuss 2015. 2015 will be an exciting year for Merck with current and new product launches. We will be launching GARDASIL 9 and as we speak the launch meetings for ZERBAXA and Boursorama are occurring in the United States. We also look forward to the potential launch of BRIDION in the United States later this year. And of course, we will continue to maximize the potential for KEYTRUDA.","In summary, global human health executed on our strategy in 2014. We focused investments on priority commercial areas in priority markets. We drove growth in Januvia, in hospital acute care and in vaccines. We acquired key assets from Cubist with near-term revenue and good long-term growth prospects to solidify our leadership position in hospital acute care.","We divested several non-core products and franchises to increase our focus while reducing our costs. And at the same time, we executed on a robust launch of KEYTRUDA. I believe that the strength of our underlying business, our commercial strategy and our new launch opportunities position us well for future growth.","Now, I will turn the call over to my colleague, Rob Davis.","Rob Davis","Thanks, Adam. Good morning everyone. As Ken and Adam shared with you, 2014 was a year of strong execution and solid performance for Merck. From a financial perspective, we are leading a transformation in the business and are on track to achieve our strategic goals while sharpening our focus.","From a deal perspective, we executed a significant number of business development deals in 2014. From our divestiture of the Consumer Care business to the acquisitions of Idenix, Cubist and OncoEthix, our deal strategy shows we are focusing our business on our core areas, which we believe will help drive future growth. We are also making steady progress to change the business model and achieve our cost production goals.","Consistent with our guidance for 2014, we were successful in lowering our M&A and R&D expenses below 2013 levels. This drove a leverage P&L and is an example of how we\u2019ve changed the way we operate. For shareholders, 2014 was a significant year from a capital allocation perspective. We returned approximately $13 billion to shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases.","This was a record year for Merck in terms of returning cash to shareholders and showed our commitment to being operationally focused and shareholder minded. Lastly, we met our guidance targets in 2014. We achieved the top end of our EPS guidance range by delivering $3.49 of earnings. Our performance throughout the year shows that we will manage our business to achieve our financial goals.","Now turning to the fourth quarter and as a reminder, my remarks will focus on our non-GAAP financials. Total company revenues were $10.5 billion in the quarter, a decrease of 7% year-over-year, which includes a negative 3 percentage point impact from foreign exchange. This decrease reflects $600 million in lost sales due to the divestitures, including the sale of the Consumer Care business to Bayer and approximately $200 million from the now ended joint venture with AstraZeneca.","Excluding these items, as well as the impact from patent expiration, foreign exchange, the underlying business grew 3% in the quarter. As Adam stated, sales in the Pharmaceutical business were driven by growth in our core areas, offset by divestitures and competition for our Hep C vaccine franchise.","Animal Health delivered a strong quarter with revenue of $885 million, an increase of 8% year-over-year excluding exchange. We had strong growth throughout our portfolio across both species and regions. We continue to see the benefit from the launch of BRAVECTO, which is now in 30 markets. The Animal Health business grew 5% ex-exchange and for the full year 2014, and we continue to expect mid-single-digit growth in 2015.","Now moving to expenses, gross margin was 74.6% in the quarter, which represents a 160 basis point increase year-over-year. Full year gross margin of 73.9% was approximately 40 basis points below prior year in line with for guidance. For operating expenses, we continue to manage our cost base and met our fourth quarter guidance.","For the full year, we reduced our operating expenses by $1.3 billion year-over-year by disproportionately focusing our resources on key clinical programs, core brands and new product launches. We remain on track to deliver $2.5 billion of cost savings versus our 2012 base by the end of 2015.","Our non-GAAP effective tax rate this quarter was 20% and 24.3% for the full year. The quarterly employee rates reflected benefit from the renewal of the R&D tax credit for 2014. Taking together, we earned $0.87 per share in fourth quarter as compared to $0.88 per share in the prior year and delivered full year EPS at the high-end of our guidance range.","Now as we turn to guidance and our outlook for 2015. On the topline, we expect revenue to be $38.3 billion to $39.8 billion in 2015, using mid-January exchange rates. This range takes into account several key assumptions, including the negative impact of generic and biosimilar competition, approximately $1 billion of net lost sales from acquisitions and divestitures and $500 million from the end of AstraZeneca joint venture.","Additionally, this range reflects $2.6 billion of negative impact of revenue due to the recent strengthening of U.S. dollar against virtually all other currencies. This foreign-exchange headwind will also impact our EPS in 2015. At mid-January rates, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $3.32 to $3.47, which reflects a $0.27 impact from foreign currency.","If you exclude the impact of exchange, we expect mid-single-digit EPS growth in 2015. We also expect EPS in the first half of the year to be lower than EPS in the second half of the year. On a GAAP basis, we expect to earn between $1.62 and $1.91 in 2015.","Now, I would look to provide some additional color on the other elements we have build into our EPS guidance. We expect product gross margin to be 75 to 100 basis points higher year-over-year, as we see margin expansion from the divestiture of lower margin businesses and products, improving product mix and manufacturing cost improvements.","In 2015, we expect operating expenses overall to be lower year-over-year. For our marketing and administrative expense, we expect a decline versus 2014, as we continue to focus on our operating model.","For research and development, we plan to invest in our innovative late-stage pipeline and therefore, expect a modest increase in our R&D line year-over-year. Altogether, we remain on track to achieve our target of a $2.5 billion reduction in expenses off of the 2,000 base by the end of 2015. I\u2019m sorry that was a 2012 base.","Regarding tax, we expect the full year tax rate to be 22% to 23%. As in prior years, our guidance does not assume a renewal of the R&D tax credit in 2015. Finally, we project average diluted shares outstanding will be approximately $2.86 billion for 2015, reflecting a decrease versus the prior year.","In summary, 2014 was a year of focused execution for Merck. Our commitment to the strategic reshaping of our company has been evident in the actions we've taken over the past year. We've been able to execute against our goals, while thoughtfully removing expenses from our operating base and continuing to drive productivity in our commercial business and in our labs.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Roger.","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","Thanks, Rob. The fourth quarter saw increased investment in discovery research, clinical development and in regulatory affairs activities at Merck research laboratories.","Turning first to product registrations, in December, we obtained FDA approval for Gardasil 9, a 9-valent Human Papillomavirus vaccine. As previously discussed, this vaccine will permit immunization against more than 90% of HPV strains associated with the development of cervical cancer.","Summing over the calendar year, in 2014 we received U.S. approval for more new molecular entities, that is, new drugs and vaccines than in any previous year in the history of Merck & Co. Also during the fourth quarter we submitted our file supporting the registration of Bridion, for which we had previously received the complete response letter. It is our expectation that the FDA will convene an advisory committee of the Bridion file with an action expected in the second quarter of this year.","On the development side, we continue to make progress on the evaluation of grazoprevir\/elbasvir, together known as our doublet therapy for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection. Phase III studies for this once daily therapy were fully enrolled during the fourth quarter, which, assuming that these data recapitulate what we have described previously in our Phase II program, should permit FDA filing in the first half of 2015. Results from some of these Phase III studies demonstrating the favorable attributes of our doublet therapy will be presented at the European Liver meetings to be held in Vienna in April.","As noted in our press release, last week the U.S. FDA informed us of their intention to resend our breakthrough designation for grazoprevir\/elbasvir for the treatment of Genotype 1 HCV infection, based on the availability of newly registered drugs that address this medical need. We intend to discuss this matter with the agency in the coming weeks. I will remind you that data presented during the AASLD meetings in November demonstrated the potential of our HCV doublet therapy to provide impressive sustained virologic responses in the vast majority of infected patients irrespective of co-morbidities.","We also provided data on our polymerase inhibitor, now called MK-3682, which we hope to use as future triplet therapy for HCV infection. A robust Phase II program testing MK-3682, in combination with doublet therapies, is already underway and we expect to initiate Phase III studies with MK-3682 by the end of the year.","Also in the fourth quarter, we provided data at the Society for Melanoma Research on the treatment of patients with advanced metastatic melanoma with KEYTRUDA. In a randomized trial compared with chemotherapy, the objective response rate was 21% versus 4% for chemotherapy at the labelled KEYTRUDA dose and the hazard ratio for progression-free survival was 0.57, favoring KEYTRUDA. We continue to study KEYTRUDA in earlier lines of therapy for malignant melanoma, data from our KEYNOTE-006 study comparing KEYTRUDA with ipilimumab and first or second line therapy as advanced disease will become available by midyear and we have registration enabling studies ongoing or planned in six other tumor types.","As previously disclosed, we intend to file for approval of KEYTRUDA in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer in mid 2015. In December, we also announced the acquisition of OncoEthix, which provides us with access to their leading BET-domain antagonist for hematologic and other malignancies. I will have more to say about this molecule during future earnings calls.","The fourth quarter saw important progress in other therapeutic areas. In November, we presented the results of the IMPROVE-IT trial demonstrating that Vytorin provides significant benefit versus simvastatin in reducing the risk of major cardiovascular events in patients hospitalized following an acute coronary syndrome. The fact that two different mechanisms of LDL cholesterol lowering, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, that is statins, and cholesterol absorption inhibitors, that is Zetia, both reduce cardiovascular risk suggests that LDL cholesterol is itself the target of action of these drugs and augurs well for a favorable outcome in the REVEAL study of anacetrapib.","Although an interim analysis of REVEAL will take place in 2015, we expect the trial to continue to an event driven completion. Also in the metabolic disease area, we have been informed by the executive committee of the TECOS study that they expect to have results available for presentation at the American Diabetes Association meetings in June. The trial has been administered by the Duke Clinical Research Institute and is currently still accruing data.","As Ken mentioned, we are delighted to have the opportunity to form common cause with colleagues in the cubbies research and development organization. We have just embarked upon a holistic review of cubbies programs. But suffice it to say that this group complements our already strong programs in anti-viral agents and vaccines.","Finally, I should note that our 2015 schedule promises to be exceptionally busy with substantial new data becoming available across all of our major programs. I look forward to sharing this information with you on future calls. Joe?","Joseph Romanelli","Great. Thank you, Roger. And Christy, I think we are ready to turnover to the Q&A portion of the call and why don\u2019t we go ahead and take our first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Vamil Diwan with Credit Suisse.","Vamil Diwan","Hi. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Just couple on the hep C breakthrough therapy designation discussed that you have implications on the companies that receive breakthrough therapies, designations for their products. So is there any other color you can provide on the back and forth around this decision? Did you have a sense that it\u2019s coming or just a real surprise to you when it came last week?","And then just on the pricing side a lot of investors focus there as well in hep C. Are the dynamics in that market playing out in terms of pricing somewhat of the way you expected? Is it changing in a way how you view the longevity of this market? And then maybe back just throw in along pricing, if there is comments you could give on the PD1 in terms of access and the level of discounting necessary there, even that still has a somewhat similar access as well? Thanks.","Ken Frazier","Roger.","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","So Vamil, let me just -- this is Roger, let me just comment with respect to breakthrough designation, we continue to have the source of discussions that we have been having with the agency with regard to our doublet therapy which we are very excited about. Breakthrough designation of course doesn\u2019t affect our filing strategy and the data or the data. We have our Phase III moving along with our program. The agency has invited us to comment on their intent to withdraw breakthrough designation, and we intend to have those discussions with the agency. And we will see where that goes, but meanwhile we are moving forward with our program. And Adam, I think you have some to add.","Adam Schechter","Hi, Vamil. So with regard to hepatitis C first, the first thing I want to say is that it is still a large market. There is over 3 million patients in U.S. alone and 100 million patients worldwide. So we believe that this is a market that will be sustainable for a long period of time. Whenever there is competitors, there is going to be increased competition in U.S. on pricing and rebates. And although the magnitude maybe discussed, I think the fact that there is competition is not a surprise at all.","The good news is as we look at our success in managed care over the years, we\u2019ve had a lot of success across every therapeutic area that we compete within, whether it would be diabetes or cholesterol or HIV, even HCV when we had details in the marketplace. So we still feel good that we will be able to compete in the competitive environment with our very strong managed care capabilities. And if I remind, we have the doublet coming which we are excited about, but we are also excited about the potential of the triplet in the future as well.","As you look at KEYTRUDA, so we are very pleased with the market access that we have today and the fact that reimbursement is happening very quickly for the approved indication. We continue to believe that the market is going to reward innovation. Particularly, innovation is going to improve clinical outcomes over the current therapies.","And if you look at KEYTRUDA, the key is building a wall of data around that product and we\u2019ve got a very broad clinical program with over 60 studies. And we are looking at KEYTRUDA monotherapy as well as in combination therapies. And we believe as that data comes out, it will continue to reinforce the value proposition that we have for KEYTRUDA. So we are pleased with the initial access and we are going to continue to compete very effectively in that marketplace as well.","Ken Frazier","Great. Thanks, Vamil. And Christy next caller?","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Anderson with Bernstein.","Tim Anderson","Thank you. A couple of questions on KEYTRUDA and then on Remicade. On KEYTRUDA, can you give us an updated timing on KEYNOTE-010, which is Phase 3 and lung cancer survival data, Clintrial seems to suggest that could report out later this year. And on that, will there be an interim look at any point at those results? And second KEYTRUDA question, can you comment on how you view the impact of KEYTRUDA from the new Compendia listing that supports the use of both your product and Optivo?","In first-line melanoma, it seems like an unexpected win for you guys given the fact that at least to my knowledge you don\u2019t have any first-line melanoma data yet. Yet, NCCN just recently gave you this recommendation?","And then on Remicade pricing in Europe in Norway, the product that the biosimilar product looks like it\u2019s coming in at something like a 60% discount. I know that\u2019s a small market, but I\u2019m wondering if you can talk about where you think biosimilar pricing might land in major markets in Europe in 2015?","Ken Frazier","So Roger, do you want to\u2026","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","Yeah. So Tim, with respect to KEYNOTE-010, this trial as with the most all of the others is an event driven trial. And so the overall survival results will be looked at as a function of the number of events that occur in order to be adequately powered to see a difference, which we would hope would anticipate would exist.","So we can\u2019t really predict what the timing will be, the timing that is in clinicaltrials.gov is our best estimate of what we\u2019re expecting. And we, of course, have a data safety monitoring board, that\u2019s reviewing these data. There always could be changes in terms of what seen and they might call us and want us to look at it, but that\u2019s really the status of the trial as it currently stands.","I would just like to say that with respect to melanoma data and the question that Adam will take on, but we do have a considerable amount of data in all lines of therapy in melanoma, which we presented in various different settings. So we have a lot of efficacy data, that\u2019s already available in the first-line setting in na\u00efve patients.","Adam Schechter","So Tim, I\u2019ll give you some context on KEYTRUDA, then I\u2019ll get directly to your question on NCCN. So we believe there\u2019s about 2,000 patients that are being treated in December. And we believe that virtually all of those patients were treated on the current label.","And to give you some perspective on Compendia, if you look at the approval on 2014, NCCN compendium guidelines added KEYTRUDA for melanoma treatment consistent with our label very quickly.","But as you mentioned in mid January, NCCN updated the guidelines for melanoma and they broaden the recommendations on melanoma and I\u2019ll give you a sense of what they did. First, there was consensus among NCCN panel that KEYTRUDA and Optivo has a higher response rate and less toxicity, compared to ipilimumab. Second, both drugs are included as options for first-line treatment and included on the list of preferred regimens.","So although we promote on label only, it\u2019s clearly a positive for anti-PD-1 class and it\u2019s a positive for the future of cancer treatment. So we'll see how this plays out over the coming months, but we believe obviously, it\u2019s a positive for the class.","As you look at Remicade, I think there\u2019s a couple things to think about. First of all, we had continued growth of Simponi, but we had declined in Remicade of 3%. And we are certainly trying to see some impact from the 20% of markets that had availability of biosimilars last year and Norway is one of those. And what we saw in Norway is first of all, it\u2019s been available for over a year. It was launched in October 2013 the biosimilar and I want to comment on the commercial strategy of the competitors, but we have seen this tender at a very sharp discount as you mentioned.","But our expectation remains that customers will continue to take a measured approach and how they use biosimilars and especially, for the patients who are well controlled, at least at this early stage as we go into the broader European markets. So therefore, we believe in the broader European markets, we will see significant price decreases from the competition, but that it will impact primarily the new patients coming in.","Therefore, we\u2019ll try to hang on to the existing patients for as long as we can. At the same time, there will certain markets like France and Spain that even if you hold a 100% of market share because of reference pricing, we\u2019re going to have a lower price there, no matter what happens in terms of market share. So we\u2019ll be monitoring and discussing that as we get through this year.","And the key for us is continuing to have strong growth of Simponi. And as you saw Simponi grew about 40% in the fourth quarter versus prior year fourth quarter, so we are seeing good growth there. I\u2019ll say though that we don't expect the growth of Simponi to offset the decline in Remicade as we\u2019re in 2015.","Tim Anderson","Thank you.","Ken Frazier","Okay. Thank you, Tim. And Christy, next caller.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Goodman","Yes. Can you give us a little bit more color on the animal health it seems to have gotten much stronger? Second, can you talk about the FX impacts on the expense side for this year? You mentioned obviously, a lot of color on the topline. And then just update us on where we\u2019re going to see the Phase 3 data for the C. diff product? Thanks.","Ken Frazier","So Rob, do you want to talk about FX and expense for 2015?","Rob Davis","Sure. So as you look at foreign currency in the prepared comments as we mentioned, given what we\u2019ve seen really since September of last year the significant strengthening of U.S. dollar versus pretty much all currencies, we are seeing an impact. And as we said in our prepared comments, we see $0.27 of potential FX impact built into our assumptions.","As we look at how this flows through the P&L, we do get some natural hedge ability through our numbers and we are hedging actively in the marketplace, but we can only offset a small percentage of the impact. And in fact, I would call more blunting of impact than ability to mitigate it.","As we look at the flow through from sales to EPS, you will see a flow through at a slightly greater rate due to the fact that we do have more expenses in U.S. dollar driven primarily due to our R&D expenses in United States and our headquarter expenses relative to the percentage of our revenue.","So that\u2019s all kind of the dynamic of what\u2019s playing through in the numbers you\u2019re seeing. But as I mentioned in the prepared comments, if you exclude FX from an earnings perspective, we actually grew, we\u2019ll be growing from 2014 to 2015.","Adam Schechter","So on Animal Health, you can see the fourth quarter showed very strong performance on our Animal Health unit and overall 2014 is a very strong year. And the good news is that it is driven by strength across all regions and all species. And in particular, on depending on companion animals, it was really supported as we said by the launch of BRAVECTO which is underway all over the world.","And this year, we\u2019re looking forward to mid-single digit growth in 2015. We\u2019ve also said that we will continue to look for opportunities to augment our Animal Health business in ways they create overall value for our shareholders. So we\u2019re very excited by that business. It is performing very well.","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","It might we worth adding that recall that we\u2019ve now lapped the ZILMAX impacts. So part of what you\u2019re seeing in the strengthening quarter-on-quarter, our fourth quarter this year versus fourth quarter last year is in fact, the fact that ZILMAX is now added at compare.","Ken Frazier","Great. Okay. Thank you, Mark for the questions and Christy, next caller.","Operator","Your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez","Thanks for the question. Can you hear me okay?","Joseph Romanelli","Yeah. We hear you Seamus.","Seamus Fernandez","Okay. Great. So just first off, I wanted to get a little bit of color on the tax rate and the significant drop in the tax rate. Rob, can you discuss a little color on what the changes are there particularly, in the context of that no R&D credit actually be incorporated into that number?","And then the second question is for Roger. Roger, can you help me understand a little bit more the differentiation about -- between the test and the Biomarker -- the potential availability of Biomarker competitor just received break through designation on the basis of PD-L1 status. So I\u2019m just wondering will Merck or would you expect Merck to have their diagnostics available as a Dako diagnostics available within the context of the lung cancer filing? And then also would it be available at launch. I think there is a lot of confusion amongst the investors as to the realities of the PD-L1 Biomarker test? Thanks.","Joseph Romanelli","Okay. So Rob.","Rob Davis","Yeah. So good morning. I\u2019ll answer the first question around tax. There are really several things contributing to the decrease on our tax rate year-over-year. First, the divestiture of the consumer care business is expected to benefit our 2015 tax rate given the fact that the majority of the U.S. consumer care business was a U.S. based business and that more than offsets the fact that there is a slight impact and then from a negative perspective to the acquisition of Cubist. So net of acquisitions and divestitures, we actually see a benefit flowing through our tax rate.","And then outside of these factors, we do have favorable product in geographic mix year-on-year. We have some time items. I don\u2019t want to get into them, but flowing through. And then probably most importantly, we have and continue to look for specific strategies to actively manage the tax rate going forward. And well I don\u2019t want to give longer term guidance clearly that is something we are very focused on. And we\u2019ll continue to see as an important contributor.","Joseph Romanelli","Roger.","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","And Seamus, just on the PD-L1 biomarker. So first with respect to what is actually good for, in non-small cell lung cancer. There is no doubt that there is a correlation between PD-L1 expression and the pretreatment specimens and response rate progression free survival that we measure after treatment. So we will in fact have the Dako associated PD-L1 antibody test for immunohistochemistry available for filing and available for you slip the drug because that is an important aspect of treating patients.","On the other hand, it is important to recognize that PD-L1 is not an absolute predictor of responsiveness that is to say that there are PD-L1 negative patients who never less respond to therapy. So the issue will be, how to capture in labeling language the way in which to use this test. It\u2019s not an absolutely predictive biomarker, but it is an important indicator of prognosis with respect to response.","Ken Frazier","Okay. Great. Thank you, Seamus. And Christy next caller?","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI.","Mark Schoenebaum","Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate all the clarity. Several, but very short, one on JANUVIA item, what -- in the U.S. in 2014, would you mind giving us the volume versus price component particularly curious about price what happened to your net price in 2014?","And then on the CETP, Roger, you mentioned that your expectation is that\u2019s going to go to final analysis, I just want to be clear. So you are basically telling us that you just don\u2019t expect that to be stopped early. And any expansion on that corner would we be appreciated? And then on TECOS, if I may you mentioned ADA that you\u2019ll have the data, but should investors expect that topline release before that yes or no? Thanks a lot.","Adam Schechter","So hi Mark, this is Adam. With the regards to JANUVIA in the U.S., there was some positive impact from price, but it\u2019s mostly from volume. And if you look at TRX volume and you look at whether it\u2019s a current week, or rolling 12 weeks, you are seeing saying anywhere from a 6% to 7% increase for same week or same rolling 12-week time period in the prior year. So a little bit from price, but mostly volume.","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","Yeah. And Mark, it\u2019s Roger. And on CETP, yes, I think it\u2019s very unlikely that the study would be stopped early. It is important in general to the executive committee of the study I think speaking for those groups that are involved, Oxford and TIMI. They are extremely anxious to have a definitive answer with respect to the question of whether HDL elevation of the kind that you achieve anacetrapib through CETP inhibition, actually has a meaningful active or better affect on cardiovascular outcomes when used in combination with -- when used as a treatment for cardiovascular risk. And keep in mind, again, as you know well, Mark, that anacetrapib lower LDL cholesterol dramatically.","So my comments were meant to say that since we know that LDL cholesterol-lowering is itself associated with a favorable outcome, one expects a favorable outcome. The question that\u2019s being asked is, can we do still more through CETP inhibition? I think we'll go to the end trying to find that out. Of course, we are all looking very carefully at the safety, all along the way and that could be a reason to stop the study. But on efficacy, I think it\u2019s very unlikely to stop at an interim. I think it will go to completion.","And then with respect to TECOS, we\u2019d just have to see what the data look like. The study is being, of course run by Independent Executive Committee, Duke Center is coordinating it. They are going to pull together the data. They believe that they're going to be able to pull that together in time for presentation at the ATA Meetings. And depending on what we see, I mean that will decide how that's announced to you and to the public at large.","Mark Schoenebaum","Thanks.","Ken Frazier","Thank Mark. Appreciate it. And, Christy, next caller?","Operator","Your next question comes from John Boris with SunTrust.","John Boris","Yes. Thanks for taking the question. So the first question has to do with some of the commentary, Adam, you gave on Remicade. I think you've indicated it. France has been, there has been some reference pricing. What is your -- across the major European countries, what\u2019s your assumption about the price compression across the major European countries in your plan for that franchise?","And then the second question on your HIV strategy, Roger, ISENTRESS and maybe in combinations, secured approval on it. Can you talk about doravirine product profile, timing for completion of phase 3 trials and how that fits into a more broader combination strategy with the other assets that you have within the HIV portfolio?","Joseph Romanelli","Okay. Adam?","Adam Schechter","Yes. So -- hi, John. So, first one with regard to Remicade and it\u2019s hard to say because we\u2019ve never had a product of this magnitude. We\u2019ve got biosimilar competition in major European markets and it's hard to predict based on what happened in the smaller markets as to exactly what will happen in large markets. What we are assuming is that we can maintain a large number of the currently treated patients and we\u2019ll see the most pressure in new patients coming into the markets.","The immediate mandatory price reductions, there's really four or five markers where that occurs is simply France, Spain, Austria and Belgium. And those are markets that it\u2019s going to depend on what the biosimilar do in other parts of Europe in terms of competition and what they do discount versus how they try to compete for the business in certain other markets. So what we've assumed is that we keep the majority of patients. There will be some pricing pressure.","If you look at the overall franchise, we think that it will decline versus the prior year because the growth in Simponi, which will remain strong, will not offset the pressure that we\u2019ll see on the Remicade and the price erosion. But it\u2019s just too early to know exactly what could happen. We\u2019ve seen discounts so far of approximately 30%, but then you see what happened in Norway, which was more steep than that. So, we\u2019ll have to see where they go and we\u2019ll report over time what we see in the marketplace.","Joseph Romanelli","Okay. Roger?","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","And, John, with respect to HIV strategy, without going into an enormous amount of detail and totality of it, as you know, ISENTRESS is an extremely important platform for therapy and as the data that we described last year, from the advanced studies that demonstrate that moving ISENTRESS to once-daily platform obviously is something that is important to do.","MK-1439, Doravirine, is intended ultimately if it reaches its objectives to replace efavirenz which is another platform. And the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor category, what we know is that this is an extremely important aspect of combination therapy. And yet, there are some real concerns about the ability of patients to adhere to efavirenz because of adverse experiences. 1439 has very favorable properties. Doravirine has very favorable properties.","And we\u2019re expecting to see, we are within phase 3 now for that study. We are expecting to see our data in the 2016, late 2016 timeframe. And based on what those data show us then we will be in a he position to put that molecule in combination with the other programs that we have including ISENTRESS. So that\u2019s an aspect. But there are many, many aspects of the combination therapy that gives you a sense where we think we are, where we think we are right now.","John Boris","Thanks.","Ken Frazier","Okay. Great. Thanks. And Christie, next caller?","Operator","Your next question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jay Olson","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. This is Jay Olson on behalf of Jami. A couple questions for Roger. The first question is about Hep C from regulatory perspective. With the recent approvals of oral Hep C regimens, does it change the way you plan to run your phase 3 program? And specifically, will you include the new standard of care as an active comparator in your phase 3 studies?","And then second, can you update us on the development plans for MK-4166? When should we expect to see clinical data and when should we look for new studies to be posted on clinicaltrials.gov? Thank you.","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","Okay. First of all, for the Hep C program, our phase 3 studies, the first wave of phase 3 studies that support registration are essentially complete. So those data are being prepared and our expectation is that we are going to be able to file the Hep C program in the first half of this year that\u2019s what we\u2019ve said.","And so there is really no change to those programs that we can engineer at this point. The studies are done and off course, those studies were studies that we designed, I\u2019m following lots of discussions with the FDA. So that\u2019s kind of where we are with respect to those. And we are looking for having the opportunity to describe those data, two year and the data will be presented in significant part at EASL.","With respect to 4166, which others know is our GIRT agonist program, which is one of the combination programs in our immuno-oncology program. It\u2019s in Phase 1 has been since the middle of last year. Data are accruing and we hope to have the opportunity to share those data with you in -- not just in future.","Ken Frazier","Great. Thank you, Jay. And Christy next calls.","Operator","Your next question comes from Colin Bristow of Bank of America.","Colin Bristow","Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Just a few quick ones, on odanacatib, can you give us an update on the progress towards tool regulatory submission, on the business development front? Can you just give an update on your strategy with respect to therapies of areas of interest and optimal deal size and whether any of this has been impacted at all by the recent high profile pricing headline?","And then finally on the animal health business, are there any specific internal reviews scheduled with regard the potential divestiture of this unit or this more of an ongoing fluid price? Thanks.","Adam Schechter","So with respect to refining the overall portfolio not with respect to animal health specifically, we continue to evaluate our strategy and our opportunity to create greater value for shareholders and for customers. I have said very clearly that, we see animal health as a great business. We are very interested in that business. We\u2019re looking to augment that business.","From a business development standpoint, first of all, we do remain committed to business development as a way of augmenting our pipeline with programs that, as Roger said, provide unambiguous promotable advantage and while we have a significant number of deals last year, including Cubist, Idenix and OncoEthix.","In 2015, we will also pursue the right kind of deals, which for us are bolt-on opportunities that will either drive our pipeline, which of course, is the most important thing to our future growth or we might pursue additional commercial assets, if we believe that we have the ability in our portfolio to maximize with our reach, our expertise and our fit, what those molecules can do. So I would say we\u2019ll continue to look for value-added bolt-on opportunities and I\u2019ll remind that we believe we have the right balance sheet to continue to do this.","Ken Frazier","Great. Roger?","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","And with respect to, Colin, with respect to odanacatib, as we\u2019ve said, as we showed at the last year's meetings, odanacatib has a very impressive affects in terms of reducing the risk vertebral, nonvertebral and hip fractures, and there is a particularly strong effect in reducing the risk of clinical vertebral fractures in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis.","The problem in our data set was that there were some inconsistencies with respect to MACE events. And we decided after looking at that and after discussions with FDA that we would re-adjudicate all of those events.","So we're in the process of doing that, re-adjudication is going forward. FDA is participated in the design of that process and we\u2019re working through it as soon as those data are complete .We\u2019ll pull it all together and we\u2019ll have the opportunity to file, which we expect to do by the end of the year.","Joseph Romanelli","Great. Thank you, Colin, and Colin, congratulations on the arrival of your first baby, your daughter few weeks ago.","Colin Bristow","Thank you.","Ken Frazier","Christy, next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Scala with Cowen.","Steve Scala","Thank you. First a follow-up on pembrolizumab in lung and the filing around midyear, it would seem that the data available in the PD-1 negative population is too limited to support a filing in that population, I'm wondering if you disagree?","Secondly, to clarify on your comments on the REVEAL trial, are you saying that it won't stop because the DSMB wants a definitive answer and not because there won\u2019t be a reduction in the event rate at the interim, so there could be a reduction in the event rate at the interim, but it won't stop because a definitive answers sort? That\u2019s the second question.","And then lastly, Glaxo recently released some very strong topline results from their Zoster vaccine? Two questions, if the results hold up and the full data is released what will be your commercial response? And it would seem logical to meet that Merck will do a study of ZOSTAVAX given in a two dose regimen? Are you contemplating that study? Thank you.","Ken Frazier","So, Roger?","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","Yeah. So, Steve, with respect to PD-L1 in lung, we actually we have a very large data set, we\u2019ve described through our presentations also on clinicaltrials.gov, more than nearly 600 patients with non-small cell lung cancer, included in that a lot of individuals who have low PD-L1 expression.","But let me point out, it is a continued of the PD-1 expression. So the issue really is when you looking at it with our immuno-histochemistry test, what is the cut point that you use. And there are patients who are absolutely completely negative. We can find a single cell seemingly that\u2019s PD-L1 expressing, of course, that's based on a very small biopsy sample, you don't know what would happen if you look to another sample or there could be population of cells that are expressing there.","And then there are others which seemingly every cell is expressing and then the vast bulk of individuals who are somewhere in the middle. And so the question is, what is a PD-L1 positive patient, we obviously, haven\u2019t approach to that, so we have develop through series of statistical analysis, but that something that clearly we have to be reviewed with the agency as we go forward.","With respect to REVEAL, I am very confident for the reasons that I mentioned that there will be a favorable effect of anacetrapib in terms cardiovascular risk. It has very impressive effects on LDL cholesterol and that should be associated with the lowering risk, but that isn\u2019t the question really that\u2019s addressed in the trial.","The trial is trying to address the question of whether HDL elevation known for decades as associated with improve cardiovascular outcomes has meaningful effects. And for this reason the trial is structured in such a way that as its typical for such trials, but its unlikely that DSMB is going to call the study, unless there is just an extraordinary favorable result. So that\u2019s my expectation and\u2026","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","Yeah. Steve, with regard to ZOSTAVAX, so first, when you think about the GSK product, there is still a lot more we need to learn beyond the limited Phase 3 efficacy data that was available in the press release. So we are looking forward to the data being published and available, so we can learn a lot more about that vaccine.","But if you look at ZOSTAVAX specifically, there are lots of attributes that customers really value. First of all, the single dose vaccine has established track record of safety and efficacy in both clinical trials, but also in real world evidence studyings.","And we have already distributed over 20 million doses across 25 markets. There is still a lot of unvaccinated patients in the U.S. alone that can benefit from it. And as you can see in the marketplace we have increased our direct-to-consumer advertising. We are doing a lot to try to treat as many patients as possible in the short-term.","Adam Schechter","To be blunt, we are trying to get patients to originate to get a single dose vaccine. And we think that that is something that we continue to do, getting people to originate twice to get a double shot is probably a little bit more challenging.","Ken Frazier","Great. Thanks, Steve, and Christy, next caller.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tony Butler with Guggenheim Partners.","Tony Butler","Yes. Good morning. Thanks very much. I will be brief and it\u2019s around OpEx. Adam, you have made some comments around the reduction in SG&A and some modest increase in R&D? But was SIVEXTRO launching in Europe, ZERBAXA in U.S. and some others. The question is, are you really providing sufficient support to those new launches?","Second, likewise, from an R&D perspective, with TECOS indiscernible 2.46] rolling off, the question is, I might have thought much like 2014, R&D expense would be flat to down, yet there up is at more related to increased dollar spend for KEYTRUDA or what?","Then third, again, on CTP, anacetrapib, Roger, forgive me if you actually stated this but is your intention to put out a press release will it be at the end of the quarter or part of a quarter call would you state the trial has continued the DSMB met, et cetera, et cetera? Thank you.","Ken Frazier","Adam?","Adam Schechter","Hi, Tony. I will start with regard to operational excellence. It first starts off with focus and what you have seen is we have really put our resources behind the four focused areas that I\u2019ve talked about before. And although, total SG&A had come down last, what you saw is we increase our spend in diabetes and we built a oncology business unit to launch KEYTRUDA and we fully allocate resources to there.","We look at every launch as a very important opportunity and we intent to fund those launches to be successful and we will cut another areas, but we are not going to cut an areas that are key priority growth areas for us, in particular we think about diabetes, hospital, acute care, vaccines and oncology.","But also other launches that are even outside of those areas, we are going to fund those and we are going to resource those for a success. So it really does come down to, where else we reduce expenses and it\u2019s going to be outside of those key growth areas.","Ken Frazier","So, Roger, do you want to cover on R&D or Rob.","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","Broadly speaking for R&D recognized magnitude of the clinical trial costs associated with moving forward with the totality of the KEYTRUDA program and all of the other programs that we are pursuing.","That said, I believe, firmly, we have delivered what it means and we will do everything we can to prioritized those investments. This is something that Adam and I do together and thinking about how to develop our portfolios and we are quite disciplined about that.","We do expect that because of the profound opportunities of KEYTRUDA, there will be an increase in expenses. But we will -- we are going to manage that very carefully. And with respect to anacetrapib, the trial will continue, there will not be a reason to announce that the trial was continuing. If something happens, of course, we will let you know about it. But in general, I think, we should expect that you'll hear about the trial when we obtain the results.","Rob Davis","And Tony, this is Rob. I just might add that I do think and agree with Adam, we are adequately investing where we need to invest for new products. I think the fact that we\u2019re growing the R&D spend is more a statement of the success of our programs and our excitement on our pipeline because to Roger\u2019s point, we\u2019re very disciplined. And I think that shows in the fact that overall, we are still expecting to lower OpEx in 2015 versus 2014 versus focus. So it is, I think, a good story of focus and discipline.","Tony Butler","Thank you.","Ken Frazier","Great. Thank you, Tony. And Christy, I think we have time for two more callers.","Operator","Sure. Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert","Thanks. First, Roger on anacetrapib, can you talk how specifically the study leaders in your cells would attribute benefit to LDL lowering versus HDL raising at the end of the study? Secondly for Adam, do you have any recent market share data on how KEYTRUDA is faring versus Optivo in the label indication?","And perhaps, how you\u2019re trying to differentiate your molecule? And how you might try to differentiate in lung? And lastly post IMPROVE-IT, are there any updated plans for the LIPTRUZET product? And are you thinking OTC on ZETIA at all? Thanks.","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","Okay. On anacetrapib, Gregg, there is no way to assign benefit to any particular mechanism, except to say that there is an awfully good nomogram that correlates LDL cholesterol lowering with the degree of reduction in major cardiovascular events. And that nomogram is supported by all set of studies with different agents now, particularly in line of IMPROVE-IT.","So you have a general feel for the magnitude that you're expecting. The question is do you see something that\u2019s above and beyond that. I think that what\u2019s critical in the study of anacetrapib is to get a very, very hard number and to be really comfortable with the magnitude of the treatment effect and we\u2019ll see that when the study completes.","Gregg Gilbert","Okay.","Ken Frazier","And Gregg, with regard to KEYTRUDA, there is really no market share data at this point in time. It still very early but a couple of things to think about. First of all, we noted that in December, we have about 2,000 patients and most of those are -- perhaps majority of those are on the approved indications.","So the math, how many patients are out there, we think, we\u2019ve done a very good job in terms of the label indication getting a lot of patients already on KEYTRUDA. But I think the key thing is that this marketplace has room for multiple competitors and this is going to play out over years. It\u2019s not going to play out over days or weeks or months.","And as I think about it, I think about this market place almost like the anti-TNFs where you have multiple players, some are strong in one indication and then another could be stronger in the different indication. We\u2019re going to have to see how combination plays out over years. But what we\u2019re doing is we're building our oncology business unit to really maximize the potential of KEYTRUDA over the long term.","And Roger, in the past, has talked about the numerous studies that we have underway as monotherapy, the number of cancer types that we\u2019re studying. And we believe that the totality of the data will allow us to really be able to be successful for KEYTRUDA over time.","With regard to LIPTRUZET, I\u2019ll broaden it to how do we think about VYTORIN, ZETIA and the overall ZETIA franchise. We have to wait for the information to be in the label in the U.S. before our representatives can begin to promote the product and that hasn\u2019t occurred yet but once it does occur, we\u2019ll actively promote the data into label. We\u2019re having very good comments from cardiologist and physicians about the trial but we are going to wait before we can promote it into label on the U.S.","The good news is outside the U.S., the patent in Europe goes past 2016. And in Japan, it goes into 2019. So in other markets around the world, we have a longer time in order for us to actually be successful in introducing the improvement data to physicians in those countries.","Ken Frazier","Great. Thanks, Greg. And, Christy, our last call?","Operator","Sure. Your final question comes from Chris Schott of J.P. Morgan.","Chris Schott","Great. Thanks very much. Just a couple quick ones here. First, coming back to HCV, I guess just elaborating a little bit more. Do you see access as a challenge in 2016, given some of the exclusive contracts that are currently being signed by some of your competitors and should we think about another step-down in price for the category as you enter the market?","Second one was on KEYTRUDA beyond the lung filing. What\u2019s the next tumor type we should be watching in terms of a potential filing? And then finally, as you adjust to go with the broader bio portfolio at Merck, when could we see additional Merck developed bio agents enter the clinic and what mechanisms are you most excited about when you think about your pre-clinical portfolio? Thanks so much.","Ken Frazier","Adam?","Adam Schechter","So, first, with regard to HCV and so we don\u2019t know the exact language in the contracts that competitors have signed. So, I will put that aside not knowing the exact wording the contracts. But in general, we\u2019ve had very-very good success with managed care access across multiple different therapeutic area, multiple different specialty classes where there is intense competitors and we believe that we will be able to get good access once we launch the product. I don\u2019t want to discuss our contracting or pricing strategy but we are going to make sure that we are competitive in the marketplace in order to get access.","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","And, Chris, with regard to KEYTRUDA filings, as we\u2019ve discussed before beyond melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Last year, we had the opportunity to present data from five additional tumor types in which, response rates really suggest that registration enabling studies to proceed and we are pursuing all of those. So that includes, of course head and neck cancer, includes gastric cancer, includes bladder cancer, triple negative breast cancer and Hodgkin's Lymphoma data.","And we have quite strong, quite provocative data in all those areas that we\u2019ve had chance to share with you. We\u2019ve initiated studies in many of those cases and depending on upon what those results look like, that would provide the basis potentially for filings going forward. We\u2019ll have a lot more to say about that but those are the areas which are most advanced right now and I\u2019ll look at clinicaltrials.gov. We will reveal that in particular, colorectal, head neck cancer and other cancers.","And then with respect to other immuno-oncology assets, of course we have the GITR asset, we\u2019ve already talked about and we\u2019ve discussed LAG-3, which will be coming forward. We are very interested in the set of cell surface molecules that are both stimulatory and antagonistic with respect to immune regulation and we have developed internally derived antibodies against a whole cluster of those. You are going to have a chance of seeing a number of them coming forward in this calendar year.","Joseph Romanelli","Okay. Thanks, Roger. Ken?","Ken Frazier","Okay. Let me just summarize, I think we had a solid 2014, with growth in all of our core areas, EPS at the high end of the range. Importantly, six new product approvals in the United States and that innovation, momentum continues in 2015. We will be filing for lung in mid-2015, our HCV filings in the second half of 2015. We are making steady progress in a number of areas within MRL, and we are going to continue to do business development to develop best external collaborations we can.","As it relates to 2015 underlying business, our core business again will be growing and again, I stress that, x for x, we are growing EPS mid single digit in 2015. So the underlying portfolio is performing well and the Merck Research Lab\u2019s performing well. So thank you very much for hanging in there with us, for little bit more than extended call. And look forward to talking to you soon.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"13800":["Merck & Co Inc.

My name is Darla, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Merck's Fourth Quarter 2017 Sales and Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Teri Loxam. Please go ahead.","Teri Loxam","Thank you, Darla, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Merck's fourth quarter and full year 2017 conference call. Today I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; Adam Schechter, President of Global Human Health; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Laboratories.","Before I turn the call over to Ken, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation of these in our press release. We have also provided a table in our press release to help you understand the sales in the quarter for the business units and products. In addition you will note that we have included a table in the supplemental financials on the Investor section of the Merck website which provides information on the new accounting standard related to the allocation of pension costs on the income statement.","This standard, which is effective January 1, 2018, requires pension components other than service costs to be reflected in other income and expense. As a result of this standard, Merck's 2017 cost of goods sold, operating expenses and other income and expense will be restated for 2018 reporting purposes. This change has no impact on net income or EPS but will result in an increase to expense and an offsetting increased other income. The supplemental table shows that the new 2017 amounts will be what they will be when we report in 2018. Our 2018 guidance for gross margin and operating expense is relative to these restated 2017 amounts.","I would like to remind you that some of the statements that we make during today's call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made on the current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.","Our SEC filings, including item 1A in the 2016 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement. You can see our SEC filings as well as today's earnings release on merck.com.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken.","Ken Frazier","Thank you, Teri. Hello to everyone and thank you all for joining the call today. Last year, 2017, was another successful year for Merck as we continued pursuing our mission of advancing the most promising science across our Animal and Human Health business. Our full year results demonstrate underlying strength as we were able to grow despite a challenging year with the loss of exclusivity of several key products and other pressures.","The year's highlights include: ongoing and significant progress for KEYTRUDA, Lynparza and our expanding oncology portfolio; advancement in vaccine, especially with continued uptake of GARDASIL; and progress within our specialty medicines business, including the submission to the FDA of doravirine for HIV and advancement of our next-generation HIV pipeline. Animal Health also continued its strong performance and remains a core growth driver for Merck.","We are entering 2018 with good momentum behind these pillars and anticipate that they will drive solid top and bottom line growth for the company. We continue to invest significantly in R&D, and at the same time, we're actively engaged in finding the best external science to further augment our portfolio and pipeline and business development. We believe that bringing forward innovation that meaningfully addresses unmet medical needs is the key to Merck's long-term success, and we are actively building such a pipeline.","In addition to efforts behind our pipeline, including focused work to reshape our discovery capabilities, we continue to evolve our operating model in line with our changing portfolio and the evolving health care environment. I'm excited for what lies ahead this year and in future years. We expect our pipeline to continue to deliver medically important breakthroughs, and we remain dedicated to finding innovative ways to demonstrate the value of our products and to increase patient access. Finally, we are pleased that Congress and the administration enacted tax reform, which helps to level the playing field for U.S.-based companies and increases our financial flexibility by providing us access to overseas cash.","I will now turn the call over to Rob to go through more details on tax reform, our fourth quarter and full year results as well as our 2018 guidance. Rob?","Rob Davis","Thanks, Ken, and good morning everyone. As Ken noted, we're pleased with the newly enacted tax reform. The impact of the new legislation to Merck in the fourth quarter was a $2.6 billion provisional charge. This reflects a onetime transition tax of approximately $5 billion on foreign earnings deemed to be repatriated, partially offset by changes in deferred tax liabilities. While tax reform does not fundamentally change our capital allocation priorities, it does improve our flexibility and enhances our ability to deploy capital in support of our strategy to invent new medicines that address key unmet medical needs, benefiting patients and driving sustainable long-term shareholder value.","To that point, in addition to funding our growing investment in R&D as well as seeking value-creating business development opportunities, we are also planning roughly $12 billion of capital investments over the next five years, with approximately $8 billion in the United States, to add capacity for our key growth drivers of oncology, vaccines and Animal Health as well as additional investment to enable ongoing discovery efforts.","We also remain committed to our dividend, which we increased for the seventh year in a row last November. Finally, to the extent we don't deploy capital towards business development deals over time, we look to return it to the shareholders.","Now let's turn to the fourth quarter results. My remarks will mainly focus on our non-GAAP financials. In the fourth quarter, we grew the top line on both a nominal and ex-exchange basis, driven by strength in KEYTRUDA, BRIDION and Animal Health. This more than offset the headwinds from LOEs for the products like ZETIA, VYTORIN and REMICADE; competitive pressure for ZOSTAVAX; and the negative sales impact of approximately $125 million due to the June cyber incident.","Total company revenue of $10.4 billion grew 3% in the quarter, including a 1 percentage point benefit from foreign exchange. Our Human Health business grew 3% excluding exchange, and Adam will provide additional detail on that in just a moment. Our Animal Health business delivered 8% growth excluding exchange, driven by continued strength in our companion animal, ruminants and poultry businesses.","Looking to the other parts of the P&L. Non-GAAP gross margin was 74.6% in the quarter, roughly flat year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $4.6 billion were higher year-over-year, reflecting increased R&D spending. The increase in R&D was driven by the timing of business development transactions as well as higher clinical development spending. The cost of goods sold and the operating expense lines also reflect approximately $145 million in costs related to the June cyber incident.","Our non-GAAP effective rate was 15.3% in the quarter, roughly 8 percentage points lower year-over-year, resulting in a full year tax rate of 19.1%. Increased income and lower tax jurisdictions and certain onetime items resulted in the lower full year tax rate versus last year. Taken together, we earned $0.90 per share on a non-GAAP basis, an increase of 10% versus the prior year or 6% excluding the positive impact of foreign exchange.","While there was some benefit from the lower tax rate in the quarter, our true operating strength was somewhat masked by several items that hit the fourth quarter, including the impacts of cyber, natural disasters and the timing of BD deals. On a GAAP basis, EPS was a loss of $0.32, reflecting the provisional charge related to the enactment of U.S. tax reform legislation I described earlier.","Now let's turn to guidance and our outlook for 2018. We expect full year 2018 revenues to be in the range of $41.2 billion to $42.7 billion, mainly driven by strength in our growing pillars of oncology, vaccines and Animal Health. This range assumes an approximately 1 percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange using mid-January rates.","Before going into the remaining guidance, I'll remind you that the gross margin guidance and operating expense growth rates are relative to the restated 2017 amounts, which Teri mentioned at the beginning of the call. We expect our non-GAAP 2018 gross margin to be slightly lower year-over-year, driven primarily by product mix across the portfolio. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to increase year-over-year at a low to mid-single-digit rate. This is primarily driven by an increase in R&D spending as we continue to make the investments necessary to drive our many pipeline opportunities, such as our oncology pipeline, including KEYTRUDA and Lynparza; as well as our vaccines and other specialty care programs.","Regarding tax, we anticipate the full year non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 20%, which reflects the favorable impact from tax reform of a few percentage points relative to what our rate would have been absent reform. Despite the tax reform benefit, the 2018 rate will generally be flat compared with 2017 due to onetime benefit in 2017, which I referenced earlier, that will not repeat in 2018. Beyond 2018, we anticipate some additional favorability.","We project average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 2 point billion \u2013 2.7 billion for 2018, reflecting a decrease versus the prior year, as we continue our share repurchase program. Taken together, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $4.08 to $4.23, which reflects an approximately 1 percentage point negative impact from foreign currency at mid-January rates.","In summary, 2017 reflected a year of strong execution resulting in top and bottom line full year growth and a leveraged P&L. We expect our momentum to continue into 2018 and anticipate delivering meaningful revenue performance driven by our growth pillars of oncology, vaccines and Animal Health. We will remain disciplined in our capital allocation of resources, continuing to invest in our pipeline to drive long-term growth while balancing the need to fully fund near-term opportunities, enabling us to both invest for the future while delivering solid EPS growth in the year. We believe this approach best positions us to maximize the long-term trajectory of our business and deliver shareholder value.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Adam.","Adam Schechter","Thank you Rob. And good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll provide highlights on the performance of Global Human Health for the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2017. My comments will be on a constant-currency basis. 2017 was another year of solid execution for Global Human Health. Sales of $35.4 billion grew 1% despite headwinds of more than $3 billion from LOEs.","I'll now highlight a few of our key franchises and launches, and I'll start with oncology. 2017 was an exceptional year for our oncology franchise. Global sales of KEYTRUDA nearly tripled versus 2016, surpassing $3.8 billion. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA continues to lead new patient starts across nearly all indications. In metastatic lung cancer, KEYTRUDA remains the leading treatment option across I-O and non-I-O therapies. We continue to build on that leadership position with an increased adoption of the combination with ALIMTA and carboplatin in non-squamous patients, and our recent announcement of the success of KEYNOTE-189 trial should catalyze even broader use of this combination.","KEYTRUDA is the only I-O agent to show an overall survival benefit in the first-line setting as a monotherapy in high expressers and as combination therapy with ALIMTA and platinum chemotherapy in non-squamous patients in an all-comers population. Anecdotal feedback from physicians has been very positive, and they are looking forward to seeing the full results from the KEYNOTE-189 study. KEYTRUDA is also leading across many tumor types outside of the U.S. In addition to our leadership in melanoma, recent approval for additional tumor types in key markets, including lung and bladder cancers, are expected to drive incremental growth. Altogether, we see an extraordinary opportunity for KEYTRUDA in 2018 and beyond as we continue to establish KEYTRUDA as a foundation in the treatment of cancer.","We also see great opportunity for Lynparza, which we are codeveloping and co-commercializing with our colleagues at AstraZeneca. Lynparza regained class leadership following approval of the broader ovarian cancer label in the U.S., and we are currently launching the new metastatic breast cancer indication. The Merck field force is now being deployed in the U.S., and additional reps will be brought onboard in other top markets in 2018. We see significant long-term opportunity for Lynparza.","Now moving to diabetes. Global sales for the JANUVIA franchise were nearly $6 billion for the full year, with volume trends remaining strong in most markets around the world. As I've discussed over the last several years, we face continued pricing pressure, particularly in the maintain market-leading access. We expect the growth opportunity in international markets will be of increasing importance for the JANUVIA franchise moving forward.","Beyond JANUVIA, we're looking to build on our leadership in diabetes with the launch of STEGLATRO and STEGLUJAN. We believe JANUVIA will remain the first add-on to metformin in a majority of patients. But we are also pleased to provide additional options to help patients lower their A1c as disease progresses.","As we look at our hospital specialty portfolio, products like ZEPATIER and BRIDION helped to offset the headwind from several LOE products in 2017. ZEPATIER sales were nearly $1.7 billion for the year. As anticipated, sales in the U.S. in the fourth quarter reflected a significant reduction in share and volume due to the competitive landscape. We expect this dynamic to continue in 2018 with most markets outside of the U.S. also coming under pressure.","Conversely, we continue to see an important growth opportunity for BRIDION in many markets around the world. Global sales grew nearly 50% in 2017 to just over $700 million. We expect BRIDION to remain a key growth driver for the hospital and specialty portfolio given the growing trend toward minimally invasive and robotic procedures and customers' continued positive experience with the product.","Now moving to vaccines. Our broad vaccines portfolio of pediatric and adult vaccines continue to perform well and reached $6.5 billion in 2017. Sales of ZOSTAVAX reached nearly $670 million for the full year. In the fourth quarter, we saw significant decrease in our ZOSTAVAX business in the U.S. as U.S. market reacted to new ACIP recommendations. Sales of GARDASIL reached $2.3 billion in 2017, with increased global demand for gender-neutral vaccination driving growth for the product year-over-year. Underlying growth and increased coverage rates remained strong in the U.S.","Outside of the U.S., we saw growth in Europe with the JV termination as well as increased demand in Asia Pacific and our GARDASIL launch in China. We are excited about the growth opportunities for this important brand in both the U.S. and outside of the U.S. in 2018.","In closing, we are well positioned for growth in 2018. We expect our diabetes franchise to be relatively stable and growth from key products including KEYTRUDA, Lynparza, GARDASIL and BRIDION to more than offset the headwinds that we face.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger.","Roger Perlmutter","And thank you, Adam. My colleagues in Merck Research Laboratories made progress on numerous fronts during the past three months. Beginning with product approvals. In the fourth quarter, PREVYMIS, our cytomegalovirus terminase inhibitor, was approved by the FDA for the prophylaxis of CMV infection and disease in adult recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. And this is the first new drug registered for prophylaxis and treatment of cytomegalovirus infection over 15 years.","And as described in our recent publication in the New England Journal of Medicine, the use of PREVYMIS as opposed to placebo was associated with the reduction in all-cause mortality in allogeneic hematopoietic transplant recipients. Marketing authorization for PREVYMIS was also obtained in the European Union in January, and the product is under review in other jurisdictions, including Japan. In December, we received FDA approval for a family of products containing the SGLT2 inhibitor ertugliflozin, which is presented as monotherapy with the brand name STEGLATRO or in combination with metformin or with JANUVIA for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.","As a result of a worldwide collaboration with colleagues at Pfizer, these three products also received the positive opinion from the CHMP last week and are under review elsewhere. Progress in the approval segment was nowhere more evident than in oncology. First, together with our colleagues at AstraZeneca, we have gained FDA approval for Lynparza, our poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor, for the second-line treatment of HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer in patients with a germline BRCA mutation.","This is the first approval for a PARP inhibitor in the breast cancer setting, and it's a component of our strategy to broaden the utility of this important new drug. Lynparza was also approved in Japan for the maintenance treatment of ovarian cancer, irrespective of BRCA status, in patients who have previously responded to platinum-based chemotherapy. Lynparza is the first PARP inhibitor approved for any indication in Japan.","Beyond Lynparza, we also made meaningful strides in further characterizing the activity of KEYTRUDA in a variety of malignancies. Based on data from our KEYNOTE-045 study, KEYTRUDA was approved for the second-line treatment of urothelial malignancies in Japan. This approval mirrors what we had previously achieved in the United States and in the European Union. Moreover, the FDA accepted for review our filing of KEYTRUDA for the treatment of primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma, a rare but typically aggressive tumor. These accomplishments were overshadowed, however, by the results of two studies that together contribute importantly to our understanding of the ability of KEYTRUDA to influence the treatment of malignant disease.","In early January, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer or EORTC announced the results from our KEYNOTE-045 cooperative study, showing that KEYTRUDA treatment as compared with placebo significantly improved recurrent-free survival in patients with previously resected, high-risk melanoma. Based on an interim analysis, KEYTRUDA-treated patients were 43% less likely to experience recurrence of their disease.","KEYNOTE-045 will continue under the direction of the EORTC, thus permitting analysis of other key endpoints, and the results will be presented at an upcoming scientific meeting. More recently, interim analysis of the KEYNOTE-189 study revealed that first-line treatment of non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer patients with the combination of KEYTRUDA plus standard therapy, including either carboplatin or cisplatinum, together with pemetrexed, resulted in statistically significant improvement in both progression-free survival and overall survival.","This study extended the results obtained in our KEYNOTE-021G study, which as you will remember, resulted in accelerated approval for combination treatment of non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer in the United States in May of last year. The KEYNOTE-189 study enrolled more than 5x as many patients as the KEYNOTE-021G and was structured such that overall survival and progression-free survival were co-primary endpoints.","We are certainly encouraged by the strength of the KEYNOTE-189 data, details of which will also be presented as soonest as possible in an appropriate scientific venue. Our clinical development and regulatory affairs teams are interacting with regulatory agencies regarding a number of new filings. Earlier this month, we announced that the FDA has accepted two New Drug Applications for doravirine, a second-generation non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor for use in combination with other antiviral agents and as a complete regimen in combination with tenofovir and lamivudine for the treatment of HIV infection.","The agency has established a PDUFA date of October 23 for these reviews. We believe that doravirine will prove to have broad utility, especially when used in combination with other new agents that we have advanced for the treatment of HIV infection. For example, we are studying combinations of doravirine with MK-8591, a novel and highly potent anti-retroviral agent. Unsurprisingly, our broadest efforts in the development and regulatory space were directed towards KEYTRUDA.","A few weeks ago, we announced that KEYTRUDA was recognized with yet another Breakthrough Therapy Designation, the 12th, for the treatment of advanced and\/or metastatic renal cell carcinoma in combination with Lenvima, a multi-kinase inhibitor discovered and marketed by Eisai. We are collaborating with Eisai in pursuing the development of this novel combination.","Clearly, given the large amount of clinical development activity underway with KEYTRUDA, including more than 700 registered clinical studies, of which more than 400 involved combinations, our regulatory affairs groups are exceptionally busy. We look forward to sharing more information about the clinical data supporting these regulatory activities at the many scientific meetings that will occur in the late spring and early summer, and I will provide details regarding the cadence of these presentations during our April earnings call.","I'll now turn the call back over to Teri.","Teri Loxam","Thanks, Roger. Darla, we'll move on to the Q&A portion of the call. And before we do that, I\u2019d like to remind everyone to please their questions to a maximum of one or two so we can try to get as many people on the call as possible.","Darla, could we get started, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein.","Alex Man","Hi, this is Alex Man on for Tim Anderson. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. First, on KEYNOTE-189 while I understand you're limited in what you can say now, how should we think about the benefit of a combination occurring to more than just the high-expresser subgroup? And second, on Echo 301 in melanoma with KEYTRUDA plus epacadostat, some investors have felt sounded a bit cautious in the past. What's your latest thinking around the degree of risk for this trial as we head into the readout? Thanks.","Roger Perlmutter","Right, Alex. Well, first of all, with respect to KEYNOTE-189, just as you say, with we are quite limited in terms of what we will describe about this study. Our highest priority has to be to ensure that the KEYNOTE-189 data are presented as soon as possible in the appropriate scientific forum. And of course, we also would like to see the data published in an appropriate scientific venue as soon as possible.","I would just reiterate that we are certainly encouraged by the strength of the KEYNOTE-189 data, and we're optimistic about the way in which those data will be received by practitioners. And so the most important thing is that practitioners need to have that information in front of them in a such a way that it can guide their thinking about how best to treat cancer patients.","And with respect to Echo 301, I would say that, again, the important question is, do we see meaningful benefit that ensures to patients when the combination of epacadostat is used with KEYTRUDA? We are \u2013 have been very pleased, as I've said before, that epacadostat has an adverse effect profile such that it combines very well with KEYTRUDA. But the question is, how much benefit does one get from an efficacy standpoint? And until we actually see the data, we just don't know.","Teri Loxam","Thanks, Roger. Darla, we'll move on to the next question.","Operator","It's from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger","Thanks so much. So I have two questions. First, could you please provide some color on KEYTRUDA sales mix in the U.S. by cancer type and also ex-U.S.? And then second, with respect to ZOSTAVAX, I'm hoping you can provide a little bit more color on the competitive pressures and the outlooks \u2013 outlook for ZOSTAVAX sales. Thank you.","Adam Schechter","Hi, David, good morning. So if you look at KEYTRUDA, first of all, we had very strong growth year-over-year in the U.S. and outside the U.S. In the U.S., it grew more than 50% \u2013 150%, and outside the U.S., it grew more than 175%. If you try to break down the data by indication, it's not perfect, as I've said before. But we believe more than 55% of the sales in the U.S. are in lung, about 15% melanoma, about 5% in head and neck, another 5% in bladder and then the rest in other.","International market, it's not easy to get the data to break it out. Right now, the majority of our sales still remain in melanoma. However, we are seeing increases as we launched new indications around the world. So I don't have the precision that I have in the U.S. because the data is not easily available. But melanoma is still a driver outside the U.S., and lung is becoming more and more important and more and more of a growth driver.","With regard to ZOSTAVAX, as I've said before, with the ACIP recommendations in the United States, it makes it very difficult. I think that we'll continue to see pressure in the U.S. based upon those guidelines. And then I think as the product launches outside of the U.S., we'll see similar pressure over time, and it's really because the recommendations are really recommending a preferential vaccination of a competitor versus ZOSTAVAX. So we expect very strong pressure competitively as we move forward.","Teri Loxam","Thanks, Adam. Darla, we'll move on to the next question, please.","Operator","It\u2019s from the line of Andrew Baum with Citi.","Yan Li","Hi, it\u2019s Yan Li on for Andrew Baum. Two questions, please. First question, going back to KEYNOTE-024, can you inform us, out of the total patients originally enrolled on to KEYNOTE-024, what was the percentage of them that did not manage to receive treatment because their disease had progressed or performance status worsened whilst obtaining their, obviously, results?","A second and broader question on your oncology strategy. Given the recent FDA PMS gene assay approvals as well as tissue-agnostic MSI approval for KEYTRUDA, what is Merck\u2019s strategy and appetite for materially expanding your small molecule position that is an exposure in oncology to take advantage of the new NGS paradigm? Thank you.","Roger Perlmutter","Right. Okay. So first of all, for KEYNOTE-024, the question, I guess, is how many individuals were enrolled in the study, randomized in the study who didn\u2019t receive treatment presumably because they \u2013 their disease progressed very rapidly. I\u2019m not sure what exactly you\u2019re getting at. I don\u2019t have the numbers in front of me. Obviously, the \u2013 well, first of all, of course, the study has been published, and you can look at the table that describes the patient allocation. But we can provide additional data, and I guess we\u2019ll do that offline. But I don\u2019t think there is any aspect of that, that affects the interpretation of the KEYNOTE-024 study, which, again, was \u2013 demonstrated dramatic treatment effect in those patients whose tumors expressed a high level of PD-L1.","And with regard to the strategy for small molecule exposure and more generally, I guess, the strategy for advancing therapies in oncology, I guess, I would say again that it\u2019s important to recognize that KEYTRUDA is really the first broad spectrum \u2013 truly broad-spectrum antineoplastic agent introduced into clinical practice. It is active across an enormously broad range of different tumor types. We\u2019ve studied KEYTRUDA as monotherapy in more than 30 different tumor types and have responses in the vast majority of those tumor types.","And in many, many important tumor types, my view is that KEYTRUDA will become foundational. What we demonstrated is that one can add other therapies to KEYTRUDA and achieve even more beneficial responses. Preclinically, the addition of radiotherapy, traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy, targeted chemotherapies as well as other immune-based therapies, including therapies related to infection with oncolytic viruses as well as immunization, all of those things preclinically work in combination with KEYTRUDA to improve the effect of PD-1 antagonism itself.","Clinically, we also have evidence for combination \u2013 the activity of combinations. And I think what will happen in the future is that those combinations will become more and more diverse. So the choice of combination will be very much focused on the individual patient, precision medicine, if you will, based on a range of different issues, the patient\u2019s performance status and age, a variety of indices related to the tumor and increasing knowledge about responsiveness. That\u2019s a long, long winded way of saying, of course, we\u2019re interested in having other agents that are active other targets to the extent that they can add real benefit in the meaningful segment of the KEYTRUDA-responsive cancer population.","Teri Loxam","Thanks, Roger. We'll move on to the next question, please.","Operator","It's from the line of Jason Gerberry with Bank of America.","Jason Gerberry","Thanks for taking my questions. Just two for me. Just first, Roger, KEYNOTE-042, can you talk just a little bit about what drives your confidence for this \u2013 into the study readout, particularly given, I guess, some mixed data with monotherapy and sub 50% expressers? And if that study is positive, how are you guys viewing the commercial opportunity relative to the recent positive KEYNOTE-189 outcome? And then my second question, the outlook for JANUVIA, I think, has long been for stable performance into the out years. Just kind of curious if that includes incremental contribution from SGLT2 fixed-dose combinations. Or do you think that the JANUVIA\/JANUMET franchise without that contribution can be stable next year? Thanks.","Roger Perlmutter","Right. I\u2019ll start, and then Adam can take the commercial aspect. I mean, for KEYNOTE-042, which is an expanded version of KEYNOTE-024 that looks at individuals whose tumors express lower levels of PD-L1, we do believe that PD-L1 expression is one measure of likely responsiveness to KEYTRUDA, and we\u2019ve demonstrated that in a whole variety of settings. But it\u2019s not the case that the only individuals who respond to KEYTRUDA are those whose tumors express PD-L1 in greater than 50% of cells.","Indeed, we have had good results in lower-expressing populations and in a whole variety of different settings. So I\u2019m optimistic about KEYNOTE-042 in a broader population, but, of course, we have to wait for the data. We do expect the data will be available in the first half of this year. The study is under the supervision of a Data Monitoring Committee and is event-driven. So once those events are complete, then we\u2019ll have the answer. And again, before I pass on to Adam, I would just say that when \u2013 my expectation is that when oncologists think about how they\u2019re treating lung cancer patients, one of the issues will be: Is this individual somebody who will likely respond to monotherapy which has a more favorable profile with respect to toxicity than does combination therapy? Where an individual is younger, more robust, a combination therapy would \u2013 might be more attractive.","And in older population with many comorbidities, combination therapy might be less attractive, irrespective of what, for example, PD-L1 expression said. But \u2013 so that\u2019s just an example of the way in which I think therapy will be personalized going forward. But Adam can give more details.","Adam Schechter","Yes. So with regard to commercial opportunity, in metastatic lung cancer, KEYTRUDA is the leading option today across I-O and non-I-O therapies. So we are in a very strong position, and we believe that we will continue to be able to build upon that strong position moving forward. With regard to the diabetes franchise, I would continue to look at it as a franchise, and we believe it will be a relatively stable franchise. We believe that the growth outside the U.S. will be increasingly important as we move forward.","So for example in China, we have NRDL approval for JANUVIA now, and we\u2019re launching that in China as we speak. I believe that the SGLT2 and the SGLT2 combo with JANUVIA will continue to be important, but altogether, we look at the diabetes franchise as a relatively stable portfolio moving forward.","Teri Loxam","Thanks. Next question please, Darla.","Operator","It\u2019s from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen.","Steve Scala","Thank you. First, for Roger, on KEYNOTE-189, Merck, of course, announced that PFS and OS were achieved, but small trials suggest KEYNOTE-021G may have created an unrealistic expectation for the outcome of larger chemo combo trials. So do you think if the degree of PFS and OS benefit in KEYNOTE-189 was substantially less than KEYNOTE-21G that it would still be well received? Second question is for either Ken or Roger, how would you characterize Merck\u2019s pipeline today versus that in the past? Today, Merck has a pipeline that has the fewest disclosed products in big cap pharma. Of course, that could just be a function of disclosure policy. But any thoughts on the pipeline today would be appreciated. Thank you very much.","Roger Perlmutter","Right, Steve. Well, with respect to KEYNOTE-189, I can\u2019t really respond to a hypothetical about what the market would do if \u2013 and what physicians might believe if the results were X, Y or Z. I have to retreat back to what I said before, which is we\u2019re encouraged by the strength of the KEYNOTE-189 data. And we\u2019re going to present those data just as soon as possible in an appropriate scientific venue, and then everyone will have a chance to look at them and decide how they feel about those data, but we\u2019re certainly encouraged by the strength of them. And the second question is, how do we feel about the pipeline?","Well, of course, in general terms, you always want more things in your pipeline. That\u2019s always the way. On the other hand, I guess I would point to the pillars of growth that Rob mentioned. First of all, we have a lot of exciting opportunities in the oncology space, not just KEYTRUDA and Lynparza, which are important; and selemetinib, which also became part of our collaboration with AstraZeneca. But beyond that, we have a series of molecules in the immuno-oncology and related space that look really pretty exciting. We haven\u2019t had a chance to say much about those, but they include molecules like our STING agonist for intratumoral injection, like our LAG-3 antibody, like anti-GOT antibody, a number of others that have gone forward and a bunch of other interesting programs.","And of course, we acquired a small company with a Phase I asset in Rigontec just late last year. So we have a lot of things going on there. And some of that data that we\u2019re seeing there are really quite intriguing and quite promising. So as we look in the oncology space, we see more opportunities for growth. We also have an opportunity for growth in the vaccine space. As Adam detailed, we have an enormously strong vaccine profile, particularly as we continue to expand the activity in GARDASIL space with GARDASIL-4 and GARDASIL 9.","So we are \u2013 that program is \u2013 well, it is a remarkable vaccine that offers the promise of dramatically reducing the incidence of papilloma virus-related disease and particularly cervical cancer. But beyond that, we are going into Phase III with an extended pneumococcal conjugate vaccine with 15 serotypes. We have still other vaccines coming forward. We have extremely interesting cytomegalovirus vaccine, which looks quite exciting. We have a dengue vaccine, which looks quite interesting. And so there\u2019s a lot of work going on in the vaccine program that is really very exciting.","Broadly speaking, we have activity in many other areas, including neuroscience and cardiovascular disease, and many of those look quite interesting as well. So I would say that it\u2019s very difficult to compare pipelines across companies and across time. But I\u2019m enthusiastic about the opportunities that we have and believe that we can dramatically grow our business based on the programs that we\u2019re currently pursuing.","Teri Loxam","Thanks, Roger. We\u2019ll move on to the next question.","Operator","It\u2019s from the line of Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez","Great. Thanks for the questions. So just a quick one. Roger, can you just give us a general sense of the other evidence that suggests that a combination of KEYTRUDA with chemotherapy, particularly the ALIMTA chemotherapy, has benefits not just on PFS but perhaps on overall survival? Is there any evidence to suggest that? Or is the definitive evidence going to be provided in the presentation of the KEYNOTE-189 results? As we\u2019ve talked to physicians, they\u2019ve really emphasized that, that would be something that they view as incrementally exciting about the KEYNOTE-189 data set because they\u2019ve already started to evolve their practice in that direction.","And then the second question is really around the opportunity to see leverage in the Merck story and in the portfolio. I was hoping Rob and Adam could really talk about the opportunities and the points of leverage that you see in 2019-plus, as we\u2019ve now clearly defined the story for 2018. Thanks.","Roger Perlmutter","Okay. Seamus, with the \u2013 with respect to the KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy story, I would say, first of all, we agree that overall survival is the gold standard in terms of treatment of malignant disease, and our goal is certainly, where possible, to demonstrate that improvements in overall survival actually take place. As \u2013 the 021G data, which is again quite a small dataset, just 50 patients per arm in a two-arm study, was surprising in that as the data emerged and despite crossover, as we looked over time, overall survival became more and more meaningful.","The study was not powered for an overall survival result, but as we saw those data become stronger and stronger, it led me to decide that we really wanted to change the statistical analysis plan for the KEYNOTE-189 study to emphasize overall survival as an endpoint. We did it just for that reason. And because of that, KEYNOTE-189 study, which had over 600 patients enrolled in a two-to-one randomization, was powered for overall survival, and as we announced, the overall survival result was positive. So on its first interim analysis it met both the PFS and overall survival endpoint, and we will be presenting those data. And I think that will be very important to oncologists engaged in treating cancer patients.","Adam Schechter","And then with regard to \u2013 as we look out, we\u2019re obviously not giving guidance beyond 2018 today. But as I broadly look into the future, I think we have some real pillars of strength. Oncology is going to continue to be a real pillar of growth for us, new indications, additional data with KEYTRUDA. We believe Lynparza will continue to be a real growth opportunity for us. And vaccines, in particular GARDASIL, we believe has a lot of growth potential moving forward. And then we have several products in the Hospital and Specialty areas that should provide us continued growth such as BRIDION. So as we look to the out years, we still think we have some pretty good pillars of growth.","Ken Frazier","I would also add that our Animal Health business, which is a global business with a great, strong portfolio, both in production and companion, also, I think, will provide us with strong growth outpacing the industry comparisons they have.","Rob Davis","And then finally, I guess, to tier you down from sales to how we think about earnings, clearly, as we\u2019ve consistently said, we continue to have a goal of delivering a leveraged P&L over time. As you see in 2018 and as I think we had guided previously, we are in a period of investment behind the many opportunities we see in the pipeline that Roger has outlined. We will continue to drive that investment going forward. But tiering down the growth in revenues, the real tailwinds that Adam and Ken laid out, those pillars of growth, down through the P&L, we do actually expect long term we will return to a leveraged P&L over time as we go forward.","Teri Loxam","Thanks. We\u2019ll move onto the next question please.","Operator","It\u2019s from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Chris Schott","Great. Thanks very much for the question. The first one here is just can you give a little bit more color on your tax rate dynamics for 2018 and beyond? You\u2019re obviously, clearly seeing a benefit, but your rate is coming in what seems to be a couple of hundred basis points above many of your peers. So help me understand a little bit the dynamics there. And how much room is there for an improvement relative to this 19% to 20% rate that you\u2019re talking about?","The second question I had was just latest on the EU filing for that broader first-line lung indication based on KEYNOTE-189. Just latest thoughts on timing there. And is there anything you can do to accelerate that process at all? Thanks very much.","Rob Davis","Chris thanks for the question. So with regards to the tax rate in 2018, it is slightly higher than what we had in 2017. But I think it\u2019s important to point out that 2017 actually benefited from some onetime tax items primarily related to benefits related to foreign tax credits. That\u2019s important \u2013 that\u2019s credit plan that we were able to do that drove the rate down in 2017 by a few points. So in reality, probably a better run rate to look at is 2016, which was at around 22%. So if you look at that going forward, we actually see tax reform benefiting us by a few points. We'll still though be in that range, a little bit over 19%. The guidance we gave, 18% to 19% for \u2013 or 19% to 25%, sorry, for 2018.","And as we look at that, part of what\u2019s going on is we have a higher mix of income in the United States relative to some of the other companies. That does cause us to have a little bit higher of a structural rate. That\u2019s actually been the case over time. That continues. But as we look beyond 2018, we actually do think we will see the rate come down. If I was putting something out there, I\u2019d say probably another percentage down from where we were going to be in 2018 as we move forward in 2019 and beyond.","Roger Perlmutter","And Chris, with respect to the regulatory strategy, we have had discussions with regulatory agencies in light of the 189 data, and we\u2019ll certainly be following their advice with respect to filing strategies and how one can review this data. Obviously, we\u2019re eager to see this data incorporated into practice as regulators see fit.","Teri Loxam","Thanks, Roger. We\u2019ll move on to the next question please.","Operator","It\u2019s from the line of Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Market.","Alex Arfaei","Great. Thank you very much for taking the question. First of all, Roger, congratulations on Keynote-189. Your team\u2019s foresight to include overall survival certainly appears to have paid off. Will 189 be able to provide insights by subgroup, either PD-L1 tumor mutation burden or other factors to help physicians determine what type of patients are most likely to benefit from the combo as opposed to monotherapy? And then, Adam, how should we think about the growth opportunity of GARDASIL longer term? You mentioned China. I think you folks keep emphasizing the global opportunity. Just help us understand whether that\u2019s a near-term thing or if it\u2019s sustainable. And similarly, your HIV assets don\u2019t get a lot of attention. Just wondering if you could help us understand the commercial opportunity there. Thank you very much.","Roger Perlmutter","Right. Well, with respect to the KEYNOTE-189 data, we are going to \u2013 we\u2019re expecting to present these data in the appropriate scientific forums as soon as possible. And as I\u2019ve said, I\u2019m \u2013 we\u2019re certainly encouraged by the strength of the data. This data, when they are presented, will include a lot of different evaluations across a broad range of different stratification, subgroups and \u2013 as one would expect in those analysis. So there\u2019ll be an opportunity for people to look at a broad range of different determinants that may or may not have some effect. Obviously, I can\u2019t comment on what those data might look like. We should have the opportunity to present them relatively soon.","Adam Schechter","And with regard to, first, HPV, I think that\u2019s going to be an important contributor to our business and growth aspects not only in 2018 but beyond that. And we believe we can continue to drive underlying demand for both GARDASIL and GARDA 9. We\u2019re seeing greater coverage of the younger cohorts over time and in a more gender-neutral manner. We believe that about 50% to 70% of males and females in the U.S. have received at least the first dose, so there\u2019s room even there for continued growth. And outside the U.S, we still believe there is significant opportunity. I mentioned China. We\u2019re in the early stages of launch, but I think it could be a very significant growth opportunity for us there over time. So I think we have very strong growth prospects for GARDASIL and GARDASIL 9 in the foreseeable future.","With regards to our HIV franchise, we\u2019ve been in the HIV field for many, many years. And if you look at where we are right now, we are launching doravirine. And I think that, that is really a bridge, to a large degree. And when I say launching, we\u2019re preparing for the launch of doravirine. It\u2019s under review. But I look at that as a bridge to the future products that Roger has in the pipeline, which will enable us someday in the future to be a leader again in the HIV field. So it\u2019s a place that we know well. It\u2019s a therapeutic category where I think there\u2019s still significant medical unmet need, and I think there are ways in the future with longer-acting agents or agents with potentially less side effects that could make a significant impact.","Teri Loxam","Thanks, Adam. We\u2019ll move on to the next question.","Operator","It\u2019s from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI.","Umer Raffat","Thanks so much for taking my question. Perhaps first one for Ken. Ken, there\u2019s a meaningful part of your business that\u2019s been hitting on all major clinical and commercial milestones, KEYTRUDA-driven obviously. Do you think that business trades at a material discount to its intrinsic value? And if so, how do you envision unlocking that value? And maybe one for Roger. Roger, one of your competitors on the European side is really emphasizing that their emerging Phase 3 data in I-O, chemo will basically span each possible chemo combination there is out there in a separate dedicated Phase III. Do you think that impacts your positioning in first-line lung, which is primarily centered around an ALIMTA-based I-O, chemo?","Ken Frazier","So let me just comment on the first question as it relates to the commercial execution and clinical execution we\u2019ve seen with respect to KEYTRUDA. So first of all, I do think it is unprecedented to see how quickly this company has moved forward in that whole area of oncology. We\u2019ve seen very strong growth that Adam talked about, 150% in the U.S., 175% or so outside the U.S. I believe as more data emerges, people will be able to see this opportunity the way we see it internally. And I think that they will see why we are so excited about that one particular opportunity. And then, as we\u2019ve said several times, KEYTRUDA, which we think, again, is a pipeline within a product, is also accompanied by very strong additional assets, including Lynparza and a number of other internal opportunities that we have.","So from our perspective, I think it\u2019s really important for us to continue to execute on that. And as the world begins to see that more clearly, I think our oncology franchise will be more well received. It\u2019s also been said here also that things where we have a legacy or leadership. We have great opportunities in front of us with GARDASIL. Roger talked about our pneumococcal vaccine opportunity. We have CMV and the RSV and dengue behind that. We\u2019ve talked about our Hospital and Specialty business, HIV, BRIDION, neuroscience, et cetera. And again, I really want to \u2013 I want to underscore that our Animal Health business really is a global business leader in its segment. So I think \u2013 to try to get to your questions, I think as execution continues, I think the evidence will emerge, and I think people will see why we are so comfortable and excited about what we have in our portfolio and our pipeline.","Roger Perlmutter","And with regard to I-O, chemo combinations and sort of the breadth of such combinations, if I could just elevate for a minute. I would say we should pause and reflect what a remarkable time this is, that the combination of KEYTRUDA with chemotherapy based on the 021G data and then, of course, our recent announcement with respect to KEYNOTE-189 is providing meaningful results in patients with metastatic lung cancer who previously had really very limited opportunities.","And I guess I would make three points. The first point is that, as we discussed with 021G, and KEYNOTE-189 only makes that stronger, the combination with chemotherapy that we demonstrated with ALIMTA and platinum therapy kind of sets a floor on what one should expect in terms of treatment of lung cancer. You need to do at least that well, and that\u2019s very important going forward in the future. So that\u2019s the first thing.","The second thing I would say is that there will be a lot of studies of different chemotherapeutic agents in a variety of different settings. I would point out, for example, that this is all with reference to the non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer population. But squamous carcinoma of the lung is an important contributor to morbidity and mortality and, in certain regions, a quite large contributor. And we do have the KEYNOTE-407 study, which will be coming out some time in the first half of this year and also promises to provide important information about how to treat such individuals with different chemotherapy regimens obviously, but with KEYTRUDA as a background.","So I think that\u2019s an important thing to recognize. And the third thing to recognize is that, again, with time, I think we will see that a broadening of the set of options that exist for cancer patients such that one will select appropriate therapy based on the individual characteristics of patients, for example, with lung cancer, in that selection, I believe that KEYTRUDA will still prove to be foundational across a very broad range of treatment options.","Operator","It\u2019s from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin","Thank you. Ken, I have a question for you. I would say that you\u2019ve kind of gone out of your way the last couple of years in downplaying your interest in a transformational deal. And I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019re rethinking that now that we are starting to see talk again of industry consolidation, Pfizer said so on their earnings call. And it\u2019s just interesting, when you take a step back, Merck\u2019s shares have been flat the last two years despite phenomenal good news for KEYTRUDA, and it seems that the bolt- on strategy hasn\u2019t really changed the story. I\u2019m just wondering what your reluctance is to be more aggressive with the strategic direction of the company. Thanks very much.","Ken Frazier","Well, Jami, thanks for the question. I would say, first of all, as I\u2019ve suggested before, we are actively engaged in looking for the best opportunities to enhance our pipeline. And I said before that we look at deals with all types of structures, including acquisitions and partnerships, collaborations and licensing. We also don\u2019t restrict ourselves as we do our scan across things based on size and structure and stage of development. We are looking for the best opportunity to create the strongest longer- term portfolio for Merck.","So I would just say that we continue to look for the best opportunities that we can find. I have expressed in the past my reluctance to do what you call large transformational deal. I think if you look at the history of this so-called large transformational deals, they haven\u2019t necessarily provided the ability to those companies when they finish their synergies to drive their pipelines going forward. So I\u2019m very much focused on what will allow this company to be a strong innovator five, 10 years from now. And if that kind of deal would help us do that, then I would look at it differently.","Teri Loxam","We\u2019re going to trying to get one more question in here and now we\u2019re running out of time.","Operator","And your final question comes from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.","Vamil Divan","Hi, great. Thanks for sticking me in. So two questions, if I could. So one on the KEYTRUDA, Lynparza. Just wondering if you can highlight what the next data points are that we\u2019ll see for that combination. And then given the importance that we feel just around you\u2019re a single company owning the different components of the combination, can you discuss how pricing negotiations may play out over time? Given the products of separate companies, is there a way for you guys to work together? Or the products just could be priced the way they are? Would you have had more flexibility, for example, if you had acquired a PARP outright?","And my second question, following up on an earlier one on Echo 301. I feel like many investors are expecting that data to be definitive one way or the other, either very good or very bad data. I\u2019m just curious, Roger, if that\u2019s how you\u2019re looking at this trial. It is the first Phase III. We\u2019re still in obviously the very early days of immuno-oncology. So I\u2019m thinking it might provide good information, but be more informative and definitive. And wondering if you agree with that or if you think the results really will be definitive and give us a clearer sense of what the combination provides over PD-1 monotherapy?","Teri Loxam","So Roger, maybe you can start with the KEYTRUDA and Lynparza, the next data point set we\u2019re looking at coming up?","Roger Perlmutter","Right. I mean so with respect to with respect to KEYTRUDA, Vamil, we\u2019ve talked about some of those data points, namely the KEYNOTE-042 data, which looks at responses in the first-line setting to KEYTRUDA monotherapy in lung cancer \u2013 non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer in a broader range of patients defined by PD-L1 expressed in the tumor and the KEYNOTE-47 data, which are in squamous non-small cell lung cancer.","There\u2019s also the KEYNOTE-048 studies in the first-line head and neck cancer settings, which should be quite interesting. And so there\u2019s a lot of data that will be coming through. Again, as I make the point, we have over 700 studies, over 400 combinations. There\u2019s just an enormous amount of data coming forward. And with Lynparza, there\u2019s a quite a detailed plan for expanding the Lynparza indication, not only in the sort of traditional, hormonally responsive tumors, that is to say in ovarian and breast cancer settings, but also in broader settings, including in pancreatic cancer. All of those things are really quite interesting, and it\u2019s quite a robust program. So a lot going on in Lynparza as well.","Adam Schechter","And if you look at combination pricing, I mean, in general, it\u2019s just too premature to discuss the pricing of combos until we see the data, the incremental improvements of combinations, how they compare with monotherapies. And I believe the market will reward innovation, particularly innovation at least to improve outcomes over the current monotherapies. But we have to see the data to really get a sense of what that would look like. And I don\u2019t believe you necessarily will have to own everything. I think that the partnerships will be successful, but we need to see data.","Teri Loxam","Great. Thanks Adam. We\u2019re out of time, so I\u2019m just going to turn it back over to Ken for closing.","Ken Frazier","So again, thank you all for participating in today\u2019s call. I just want to reiterate that we\u2019re closing out 2017 with very strong operating momentum, which is a great foundation for 2018 and beyond. Thank you. Have a good day, and we look forward to speaking to you in the future.","Operator","This concludes the Merck\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2017 Sales and Earnings Call.

[Operator instructions.] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Joseph Romanelli, vice president of investor relations. Please go ahead.","Joe Romanelli","Thank you, operator, and good morning everyone. We\u2019d also like to say good afternoon and good evening to everyone listening outside the United States. Welcome to Merck\u2019s fourth quarter 2013 conference call. Before I turn the call over to Ken, I just want to point out just a couple of items.","First, you\u2019ll see that we items in our GAAP results, such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded those items from our non-GAAP results. The reconciliation tables are available in our press release, so you can bet a better understanding of the underlying performance. ","We\u2019ve also provided tables to help you understand the sales results in the quarter for the business units as well as for the products. This can be found in table three of our press release, and the reconciliation table I mentioned earlier is in table two of the release. During the call, we\u2019ll be referring to table two for the P&L and table three as it relates to revenue.","Second, I would like to remind you that some of the statements we make during today\u2019s call might be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs of Merck\u2019s management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. ","If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2012 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, and you can see our SEC filings as well as today\u2019s earnings release on merck.com. ","This morning, I\u2019m joined by Ken Frazier, our chairman and chief executive officer; Adam Schechter, president of global human health, who will update you on our product and geographic performance; Peter Kellogg, our chief financial officer, who will review our P&L and provide our outlook for 2014; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, president of Merck Research Labs, who will provide you with an update on some of our key programs.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ken. Ken?","Ken Frazier","Thank you, Joe. Good morning everyone, and thank you all for joining the call today. This morning we reported earnings consistent with the guidance that we provided last year. We did so by managing through faster than anticipated generic erosion, a significant impact of foreign exchange, and other headwinds in our business environment.","At the same time, we took proactive steps to further sharpen R&D and commercial focus, bolster our innovative pipeline, and accelerate our efforts to redesign our operating model and reduce our cost base. ","The events of last year underscore the imperative for Merck to remain both a highly innovative company and one that can respond to the fast-evolving healthcare environment. Now I\u2019d like to take just a few minutes to reaffirm our strategy and the approach we will continue to take moving forward. ","As we\u2019ve consistently said, Merck remains committed to innovation, applying cutting edge science in order to develop clinically meaningful medicines and vaccines that save and improve lives throughout the world. It\u2019s only by bringing to market new products that make a meaningful difference to patients, healthcare providers, and payers that we\u2019ll continue to drive value over the long term for patients, customers, and of course our shareholders.","Our goal is to position Merck at the forefront of introducing these kinds of important new products. In this regard, we took an important step last year when Dr. Roger Perlmutter rejoined Merck as head of R&D. Roger\u2019s mission is to help us improve our productivity and our pipeline execution with the firm intention of reestablishing Merck as a leading research intensive biopharmaceutical company.","I\u2019m delighted that we\u2019re already seeing progress with the kind of innovation that can make a life or death difference to patients, like MK3475, our anti-PD1 immunotherapy for oncology. Last month we announced that we initiated the rolling submission of a BLA in the United States for this important investigational antibody, which we expect to complete in the first half of 2014. And then this morning, we announced that we signed three additional collaboration agreements to evaluation MK3475 in combination regimens to treat a broad range of cancers.","Last month, we also received a favorable recommendation from the FDA\u2019s advisory committee for vorapaxar, and in 2013 we initiated Phase III trials for our base inhibitor and received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA for our combination regimen for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C.","Looking ahead, we also anticipate completing regulatory applications for odanacatib, suvorexant, and sugammadex, and may receive regulatory approvals for multiple others. Each of these candidates is based on a novel mechanism that addresses the treatment of a disease or condition in an entirely new way.","Roger will talk more about our pipeline and the progress he and his team are making towards moving ahead promising pipeline candidates and increasing R&D productivity overall. ","2013 was an important year for Merck. We continued implementing our strategy of driving underlying growth while aggressively managing our cost to deliver bottom line performance. We focused on making the right investment decisions across our businesses while continuing to advance our near term and late stage pipeline.","The strength of our underlying portfolio, combined with our aggressive cost management and productivity initiatives, enabled us to deliver non-GAAP EPS of $3.49 for the year. To ensure that we have a strong growth profile in the years to come, we placed our efforts and resources behind the franchises that we believe will help us grow, such as our diabetes and vaccines businesses, and in many cases were able to drive double-digit growth.","We also continue to invest in the key geographies that will remain drivers of growth now and into the future, including in our key emerging markets, where we saw another year of solid growth. To maintain this momentum, we announced a strategic initiative in October designed to sharpen our focus on our best growth opportunities and to redesign our operating model while reducing our cost basis.","We have made solid progress on all of these fronts. You\u2019ll recall that following our merger with Schering Plough as of 2012, we achieved merger synergies resulting in $3.5 billion in net savings. In addition to those synergies, we expect a further $2.5 billion in cost savings by the end of 2015 off our 2012 base.","This initiative will also increase our operating efficiency, provide us with the flexibility to take action on our best opportunities, and to be responsive to the challenges of a dynamic healthcare environment. This includes investing in new licensing and business development activities to acquire external innovation that will further strengthen our pipeline.","I remain confident that these actions will help make Merck a more competitive company, better positioned to drive innovation and growth. We also will continue to return a high level of cash to our shareholders. In 2013, we returned $11 billion through both the dividend and share repurchases.","Finally, I would like to remind you that we continue to evaluate all aspects of our business. Our goal is for each of our priority businesses to be industry leaders. We must determine whether particular assets are core to our strategy, whether they will provide strategic advantage going forward, and whether they will generate greater long term value as part of the company or not.","Through this process, we are exploring strategic options for both our animal health and consumer care businesses. We could reach different conclusions about the two businesses, and anticipate that we\u2019ll complete the process and take action, if any, in 2014.","In closing, in 2013 we took decisive action to revitalize our research and development, strengthen our pipeline, and sharpen our focus. As we look forward to 2014, I\u2019m confident that we\u2019re positioning the company for long term growth, and I\u2019m excited about the potential of our near and long term pipeline.","I\u2019m also confident that we\u2019re moving quickly to make Merck a leaner, more agile company, focused on our best commercial and innovative product development opportunities. And now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to my colleague, Adam Schechter.","Adam Schechter ","Thank you, Ken. Good morning everyone. This morning I\u2019ll provide you with an overview of global human health results for 2013, and also touch on the 2014 outlook. In 2013, global human health took action, action to focus our resources on core markets in core therapeutic areas that provide the greatest potential for long term growth.","Top line results continue to reflect the loss of exclusivity of a number of brands and weakness in the yen. However, we did have a number of areas of growth in 2013, including vaccines, immunology, diabetes, and HIV. Our underlying portfolio grew 4% on a constant currency basis for both the full year and in the fourth quarter, excluding the recent patent expiries.","Let me provide more details on the performance of our core products and our core markets. My comments will be on a constant currency basis. I\u2019ll start with the Januvia franchise. ","The franchise had sales of $1.6 billion and 6% growth in the fourth quarter. In the United States, sales declined 3%, driven by a slight decline in PRx volume. A small benefit from price was offset by reduction in customer inventory levels this quarter. ","Our international markets, which now represent 50% of total sales, grew 15%. We drove good very good in each region, in Europe, the emerging markets, and Japan, and we maintained market leadership. Globally, the diabetes market is significant, and the macro trends support a growing market. We will continue to focus significant resources around the world on this core franchise, with about $6 billion in annual sales.","Moving to Isentress, we had another good quarter, with 16% growth. In the United States, we are maintaining our patient share, despite new competition, although it\u2019s still early. Outside of the U.S., Isentress continues to have solid volume growth.","Moving next to immunology, the combined immunology business, consisting of REMICADE and SIMPONI, grew 15% in the quarter. Sales of SIMPONI grew over 40% to $146 million, and reached $500 million on a full year basis. We are seeing good growth across our markets, including the recent launch in France.","Lastly, moving to our vaccine business, in the fourth quarter vaccine sales grew 1%. The timing of public sector purchases for Gardasil and RotaTeq had a negative impact on vaccine growth in the quarter. In addition, last year\u2019s fourth quarter sales included the launch of Gardasil in Japan and ProQuad in the U.S.","Demand for our vaccines portfolio remains strong, with full year sales growing 11% to over $5.5 billion. Now let me touch on two core vaccines, and I\u2019ll start with Gardasil. Gardasil sales declined by 9% in the quarter. International sales growth of 12% was offset by 19% decline in the U.S. ","In the U.S., Gardasil sales were affected by the timing of public sector purchases, which do not occur at the same level each quarter. Public sector purchase were about $50 million lower this quarter than in the fourth quarter of 2012. Internationally, Gardasil sales grew 12%. Strong growth in emerging markets benefited from the start of the national immunization program in Brazil.","Sales growth in the emerging markets more than offset the loss of all sales in Japan. Sales in Japan reflected the government\u2019s decision in June to suspend proactive recommendation of HPV vaccines. For reference, Japan\u2019s sales were $40 million in the prior year quarter.","Moving on to Zostavax, Zostavax sales were $264 million this quarter, the highest since launch. As expected, sales in the U.S. grew sequentially due to seasonality. Internationally, we now have launched Zostavax in select Asian markets and in the U.K. We\u2019re seeing good uptake in those markets. But as an important reminder, our European vaccine results are reported through equity income. We continue to see Zostavax as a growth driver in the future. ","Now I\u2019d like to touch on our overall performance at a regional level. In the United States, Europe, and Canada, sales continued to be affected by the loss of exclusivity of a number of brands, including Singulair, Maxalt, and Temodar. ","Excluding these products, U.S. sales increased by 2%, and Europe and Canada sales increased by 5%, compared to the prior year. We expect continued pricing and rebate pressure in 2014, similar to prior years. Japan sales declined 4% ex-exchange, primarily due to lower sales of Gardasil. As we move into 2014, sales in Japan will be adversely impacted by the biannual price decreases and repricing of the DPP4 class in the first quarter. ","Sales in emerging markets grew 8% ex-exchange. Double-digit growth in key emerging markets like Brazil, Korea, and Russia were partially offset by declines in China and Mexico this quarter. In our key emerging markets, our base business is strong, and it\u2019s diverse, and Merck\u2019s growth continues to outpace the overall market. Looking ahead, we expect the emerging markets, including China, to be growth drivers for us.","In summary, in 2013 global human health drove performance of our underlying portfolio of key brands. These brands grew 4% in the fourth quarter, as well as for the full year. We also continue to prioritize investments and sharpen focus on the best opportunities for long term growth. ","We have already made good progress, including the following: building Merck\u2019s oncology business unit to execute the future launch of MK3475. We are recruiting external talent, with deep scientific and deep commercial experience in oncology. We also divested noncore assets like Saphris, certain ophthalmology products in the U.S., and some off-patent brands internationally.","In 2014, we will continue to prioritize and focus on our most promising investment opportunities. In addition, we\u2019re preparing for multiple near term launches. We\u2019re anticipating regulatory actions for V503, our 9-valent HPV vaccine candidate; for vorapaxar; for vintafolide in the E.U.; for vaniprevir in Japan for HCV; for suvorexant in Japan; and for the allergy immunotherapies Grastek and Ragwitek.","I believe that our strong portfolio, the actions we are taking to prioritize investment, and our near and long term opportunities position us well for future success. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to my colleague, Peter Kellogg.","Peter Kellogg ","Thank you, Adam, and good morning. As you heard from Ken and Adam, we took action in 2013 to ensure that we are resourcing our key underlying growth drivers and sharpening our focus to invest in our best pipeline opportunities. We are starting to see the benefit of those actions. Moreover, we\u2019re ensuring that the savings and efficiencies we are creating in our businesses are translated into continued focus on cash returns to shareholders.","This morning, I will highlight the financial elements of our fourth quarter as well as discuss our outlook for 2014. And my remarks will focus on our non-GAAP financials. ","With solid growth in our underlying business and strong cost management, we were able to deliver EPS growth of 6% this quarter. Additionally, we delivered full year EPS within our guidance range. Adam has already discussed highlights from the top line, so let me discuss some of the other elements of the quarter. ","First, product gross margin. This declined on a year over year basis to 73% this quarter. As was outlined in prior quarters, generic erosion of high gross margin products created a headwind. This is compounded by solid growth in some of our lower margin products such as vaccines and immunology.","We expect this mix shift to continue in 2014, with the first half gross margin being at a similar level as the fourth quarter of 2013. Later in the year, however, we anticipate improvement in PGM, particularly with the anticipated inclusion of the AstraZeneca joint venture. Taken together, we expect the 2014 full year gross margin ratio to be slightly lower than the 2013 full year rate of 74.3%. ","Moving to other areas of spending, during the fourth quarter, we continued to find opportunities to lower our cost base. You can see the results of our efforts to reduce R&D spending of about $440 million. Please note that this is in part due to a $150 million upfront licensing payment in the base period. Also in the fourth quarter, SG&A expenses were reduced by approximately $400 million compared to last year, including a roughly $60 million benefit from foreign exchange. ","The fourth quarter also marked an important milestone for our capital allocation efforts. We successfully completed the $5 billion accelerated repurchase program announced earlier in the year. Coupled with our ongoing share buyback activity, we repurchased approximately 5% of our shares this year. Additionally, we increased our dividend for the third year in a row, and as Ken said, our share repurchases and dividend payments amounted to over $11 billion being returned to shareholders in the year.","Now, turning to guidance and our outlook for 2014, our guidance reflects a reshaping of our portfolio, reductions in expenses and infrastructure, and targeted investments to drive future growth and long term shareholder value. That said, at current exchange rates, we expect revenue of $42.4 billion to $43.2 billion.","Let me outline a few key factors and assumptions included in this guidance. First, we anticipate AstraZeneca will exercise their option to end our longstanding partnership. If they exercise the option, the JV would come to a close at the end of June. At that time, we would no longer report supply sales nor equity income from the joint venture.","Furthermore, in the first half of the year, we continue to expect sharp year over year declines in both of these line items. Second, while not as significant as in 2013, we still expect negative top line impacts from patent expiries in 2014, and we expect that impact to be about $500 million. ","Third, in regard to divestitures, as we announced over the past several months, we began divesting noncore assets such as [unintelligible] in the ophthalmics products in the U.S. as well as other products. Sales from these divested products contributed approximately $600 million in 2013. ","Finally, our EPS guidance spans a wider range than in prior years. This guidance range plans for a potential devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar. The higher end of the range assumes no devaluation, whereas the bottom end of the range accounts for a possible devaluation under certain scenarios.","As you may recall, the devaluation of this currency in 2013 led to a $0.07 negative impact. We cannot predict the timing or the magnitude of this potential devaluation in 2014. However, if it does occur, we do expect that the impact would be greater than the impact in 2013. As a result, we expect non-GAAP EPS between $3.35 and $3.53. Accordingly, as the year progresses, we would expect to narrow the EPS range. The corresponding GAAP range is $2.15 to $2.47. ","Taking into account the divestitures and the anticipated conclusion of the AstraZeneca joint venture, 2014 will be a trough year for earnings. Now, I would like to provide some additional color on the other elements we have built into our EPS guidance. ","On R&D, we expect our 2014 non-GAAP R&D expenses to be below 2013 levels, despite heavy and focused investments in our anti-PD1, hepatitis C, diabetes, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease programs. Similarly, for SG&A, we expect to be below 2013 levels, as we continue to prioritize and focus spend in core product lines and the upcoming launches Adam mentioned earlier.","Regarding tax, we expect the full year tax rate to be 24% to 26%. As in prior years, our 2014 guidance does not include a renewal of the R&D tax credit. Now, let me outline how you should think about the spread of earnings across the quarters.","On an operating basis, we expect EPS in the first half of 2014 to be lower than in the second half, with the first quarter being the lowest. As I mentioned earlier, this is driven by the gross margin being lower in the first half of 2014. ","Regarding capital allocation, we remain poised to bolster the pipeline with external innovation, and we maintain a strong balance sheet and an efficient capital structure for the right opportunities. In 2014, you can expect continued shareholder friendly returns of cash through our $15 billion share repurchase program announced last May, as well as through the quarterly dividend. ","So, in conclusion, 2013 was a pivotal year for our company. We have emerged with a promising pipeline to deliver future growth. Additionally, we committed to a strategic reshaping of the company to maximize our core in line assets and key pipeline programs. Finally, we accelerated returns of cash to shareholders. In 2014, we will continue to execute upon our strategic initiative of prioritization and focus, and we will capitalize on opportunities to drive long term shareholder value.","Thank you. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Roger. ","Roger Perlmutter ","Thank you, Peter. As Ken highlighted at the beginning of the call, we\u2019re making steady progress in MRL, crafting a more cost-effective organization focused on innovative products with meaningful differentiated attributes.","Our R&D expenditures in the fourth quarter, as Peter noted, declined by more than $440 million versus the prior year. While reducing our cost base, we have simultaneously advanced important regulatory filings, made tangible progress in our late development programs, and introduced significant new molecules into early clinical development.","I should also note that we have recruited key personnel into our development, regulatory, and discovery groups, and established a new licensing and business development function. Each of these changes is having a significant favorable impact on our activities.","I will summarize some of our accomplishments in the fourth quarter and discuss our plans for 2014. Beginning with regulatory activities, we completed our filings for vorapaxar and for our grass and ragweed oral desensitizing therapies for allergic rhinitis. All three of these received favorable reviews at their respective FDA advisory committees. We have submitted potential labeling language for each to the FDA, and look forward to discussions with the agency on further steps in the review process. ","At the end of the fourth quarter, we filed a U.S. biologics licensing application for V503, our nonvalent human papilloma virus vaccine, which we believe will extend protection substantially against this important cause of cervical cancer in women.","Also, I\u2019m pleased to report that the Japanese regulatory agency granted priority review to vaniprevir for the treatment of chronic HCV infection.","As most of you know, we received a complete response letter following our NDA submission for suvorexant, based on the need for lower dosage forms that would permit reduced exposure to this novel orexant antagonist for the treatment of insomnia. We have now completed the studies suggested by the FDA and we expect to be able to submit our responses to their request by the end of the first quarter. ","Similarly, we have initiated a definitive hypersensitivity study for sugammadex, our novel agent designed to reverse neuromuscular blockade employed during anesthesia. Completion of this study will permit us to submit an updated application for this important product.","Turning from regulatory affairs to clinical development, we were active on many fronts. Data presented at the Society for Melanoma research meeting last fall demonstrated favorable overall survival trends in patients with advanced melanoma who received MK3475, our PD1-specific antibody that has received breakthrough designation from the FDA.","Currently, we have more than 4,000 patients enrolled in clinical trials for MK3475 in multiple tumor types, including non-small cell lung cancer, triple negative breast cancer, uroepithelial tumors, head and neck cancer, and some hematologic malignancies, among others. ","Response rates in our large [salvage] studies encouraged us to initiate a rolling submission to the FDA, with the goal of making this new therapy available to patients with advanced melanoma who have exhausted all other treatment options. As we announced last month, we expect to complete the follow up for MK3475 during the first half of 2014. ","This morning, we announced further progress in the evaluation of PD1 and other regulatory targets. First, we\u2019ve opened a signal detection study seeking to identify other malignancies for which MK3475 may provide therapeutic benefit. ","The trial will enroll approximately 320 patients suffering from one of 20 different tumor types, which were selected based on a variety of attributes, including the pattern of expression of PD-L1. In our experience to date, high levels of this PD1 ligand appear to correlate with tumor responses. ","Second, we announced significant new partnerships testing the ability of MK3475 to add benefit to patients undergoing treatment with other investigational agents, including a 41BB specific antibody from Pfizer, a small molecule [IDA1] antagonist from Insight, and an oncolytic virus from Amgen, which has been shown to cause significant tumor shrinkage in many patients with malignant melanoma.","We believe that the scientific justification for each of these partnerships is very strong. Moreover, the breadth of these partnerships, added to our previously announced collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline, demonstrates our substantive commitment to MK3475.","Third, we also announced a new partnership with Ablynx to develop nanobodies that combine into other regulatory molecules, and in particular can be used to form multivalent complexes such that PD1 antagonism is combined with specific binding to other important proteins on the lymphocyte surface. ","The driving force for this collaboration derives from studies in our own Palo Alto laboratories examining the molecular basis of checkpoint activity in T-cells. This effort with our colleagues at Ablynx will add considerably to our repertoire of immunoregulatory modulators, the cornerstone of our new approach to oncology therapeutics. ","Beyond PD1 and immunoregulation, we made significant additional progress in several important areas of development, including expansion of our hepatitis C virus portfolio. We also advanced potential new therapies for human immunodeficiency virus infection and the development of compounds that act by novel mechanisms to augment glucose lowering in patients with diabetes.","Finally, in the fourth quarter we announced progression of our base program into Phase III, based on satisfactory evaluation by our independent data monitoring committee of the results obtained with the lead cohort.","Looking forward, as I indicated, we expect to complete our filing of the suvorexant response in the first quarter, and the MK3475 rolling submission before the middle of the year. Our sugammadex filing will occur before the end of the year, and depending upon the review of the final data, we hope to be able to proceed with our odanacatib filing as well.","These regulatory accomplishments will be augmented by additional progress in Phase III clinical studies, which I will describe in detail at our R&D day on May 6. And it is fair to predict that additional business development activity, principally in the form of collaborations and alliances, will emerge throughout the year.","I now turn the call back to Joe.","Joe Romanelli","Thank you, Roger. And operator, we\u2019ll get ready to start the Q&A segment. And for all the callers, if you can just limit your questions to one or two, so that we can get through as many callers as possible. So with that, operator, I\u2019ll turn it over to the first caller. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Your first question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Chris Schott - JPMorgan Chase ","First one for Ken, maybe. As you\u2019ve had a chance to review your animal health division, can you share any updated views on how core of a franchise you see this business to Merck? And then the second one is on immuno-oncology. Two part question. First, what\u2019s your view at this point on how much of this market will ultimately be monotherapy versus a combination of immuno-oncology assets? And then as you think about the combinations, how important is it for Merck to own both assets versus working with partners as you look to maximize the value of this platform for the company?","Ken Frazier ","I\u2019ll start with your first question. As we mentioned before, we are looking at our entire portfolio, but to respond specifically to your question about animal health, we have always viewed this as a very good business for Merck. We think of it as being one of the industry leaders. It\u2019s the second largest. It has good margins. The science that we employ in our human health efforts often has application across species. The underlying macroeconomic drivers both on the companion side and on the production animal side are very favorable.","So I can say that this is a very good business that we like very much. And the question becomes, what are the alternatives? And is there\u2019s something that actually makes that more valuable to our shareholders over the long term?","Roger Perlmutter ","With respect to monotherapy versus combination therapy, I think, again, as I\u2019ve said previously, we\u2019re really at a very early point in the study of immunoregulatory molecules. We\u2019re quite impressed with the data that we\u2019ve been seeing using MK3475 as monotherapy, but certainly the history of cancer therapy is that over time oncologists seek to employ combinations in order to get better benefit-risk ratios, and to get better responses in a larger fraction of patients.","With respect to owning both versus collaborations, obviously under the best of circumstances you\u2019d like to own both, but you can\u2019t expect to discover everything yourself, and we want to do absolutely the best thing for patients and advance the best therapies.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seamus Fernandez from Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Swann ","Ken, can you first maybe talk a little bit about the interest in expanding the animal health franchise, whether it be via swaps or other type of collaborations with other players in the space on the animal health side? And then can you also provide some additional feedback on your interest in the consumer health business and how that fits overall? We\u2019ve seen a lot of speculation in the press in that regard. Interestingly, we just met with Novartis\u2019 CEO, and he expressed that this is the time for the industry to be working together in terms of swaps and things like that.","Separately, Roger, just a quick question. Congratulations on the collaborations in particular. Can you just give us a little bit of color into whether or not you think that PD-L1 biomarkers are basically when you have high PD-L1 expression, that you fully maximize the efficacy of those products? Or if you will be pursuing combinations in high PD-L1 expressing patients as well?","And then just in terms of the [IVO] collaboration, and the 41BB in particular, what tumors do you think, obviously non-small cell lung cancer is one with strong interest, but what other tumor types should we be thinking about these mechanisms having interesting activity?","Ken Frazier ","To respond to your first question, as I mentioned previously, we are exploring strategic options for both our animal health and consumer care businesses. Getting a business versus getting cash is something that we obviously need to think about, so I\u2019m not going to comment on any one hypothetical swap or anything of that nature. We are looking at all options, I can assure you, with the sole objective of maximizing the long term value to our shareholders. ","I will also comment that, again, we think these are terrific businesses. In animal health, we have the number two business in terms of sales and healthy margins, as I mentioned before. In consumer, we have very attractive brands like Coppertone, Dr. Scholl\u2019s, Claritin. I have said that this is a business that is geographically concentrated in the United States. ","And so as I think about these things going forward, I\u2019ve got to look at what the practical actions are that present themselves, and whether or not these assets are going to create more long term value inside the portfolio or outside the portfolio. ","Roger Perlmutter ","For those two questions, the first, with respect to PD-L1 expression and maximal efficacy, again, I think it\u2019s important to stand back from this and recognize that we are testing a hypothesis with respect to PD1 activity. What we believe is that there are resident cytotoxic T lymphocytes directed against tumors, and that those T lymphocytes are inactivated or prevented from becoming activated by PD1 engagement.","And it stands to reason that PD-L1, as one of the two principal ligands for PD1, PD-L1 expression would be an indicator of the degree of inactivation of those cells, and if we could block that, we should activate T-cells and destroy tumor. That\u2019s a lovely hypothesis. It sounds great, but there are many parts of that that have yet to be tested experimentally, particularly in the human setting. ","So there\u2019s a lot of work to be done to understand whether that\u2019s really what\u2019s going on. Even if that is precisely what\u2019s going on, there\u2019s no reason to believe that PD-L1 engagement with PD1 by itself is the only thing that controls T-cell activation and hence tumor responses. So I have every reason to believe that we can build on this, and certainly we have preclinical data that indicate that we can do exactly that, and we tend to pursue that very aggressively in patients.","The second question is, what tumor types will we explore with our Insight and Pfizer collaborations? Obviously, there are a lot of tumors that we can look at. And again, we are driven by both the pattern of 41BB expression in the Pfizer case and also early data that are becoming available through Insight\u2019s studies on their small molecule antagonist of IDA1. So we\u2019ll move forward together with them in those collaborations, but I\u2019m not going to specify tumor types for you at the moment.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley ","I have questions on the P1 as well. So I\u2019ll just try to run through them pretty quickly. Some of them are very simple. But they\u2019re under the umbrella of a single question, so don\u2019t cut me off please. ","First, in terms of the collaborations announced today, is there any way that you can frame the economics to each party if one of the combinations announced today were to be commercialized? Is it something like 60-40 to Merck because your PD1 is the core therapy? Second, what is needed to complete the rolling submission for your PD1 for [unintelligible] failures? And then third, with respect to ASCO, should we be expecting any interim data on your PD-L1 positive lung cancer trial, which is scheduled to complete in September, or your Phase I triple negative breast, head and neck, and gastric trial, which completes in October?","Roger Perlmutter ","With respect to the collaboration\u2019s economics, we\u2019re not going to go into the details of that. Suffice it to say that these are deals that are structured in a way that\u2019s very attractive for both parties. What is needed to complete the file, well, each of the modules associated with a biologics application, and obviously there\u2019s a lot of detail there, not only with respect to the clinical data and the greatest safety summaries, but also CMC data, etc. As I said, we\u2019re confident we can get this done and we will complete the rolling submission by the middle of the year.","And finally, for ASCO, we\u2019re going to have a lot of data that we will be able to present at ASCO, and we\u2019ll move forward with those. I\u2019m not going to prestage that in any way. But I should also point out that there will be data presented at other scientific meetings, some of which come earlier, including the AACR meeting.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs ","Ken, just a first question for you. Clearly the company talked about being poised to pursue external innovation, which signals M&A activity. And I\u2019m wondering if you can just sort of size for us what size transaction you are looking to do. Merck historically hasn\u2019t been that active in M&A in the last couple of years, and just can you give us a sense for are you looking to do a big deal that is transformational, a pipeline deal in the $1 billion to $2 billion range? And if you could just sort of help us size that.","And then Roger, for you, if you could give us a sense for the timing for readouts and potential filings in the new studies that were announced today, specifically Pfizer and Insight. And then just Insight has not disclosed the data for IDO Yervoy in melanoma, and just wondered if you could share with us what you have seen, and what data led you to select lung cancer for your collaboration?","And then just finally, and I\u2019m sorry about this, but with the Amgen assets, Roger, do you expect that that asset can work in other tumor types besides melanoma?","Ken Frazier ","Let me just try to respond to your first question. As I said before, a major consolidation of the industry type transaction is not Merck\u2019s preferred strategy. We would like to be much more focused on value added, both on opportunities that provide meaningful, clinically meaningful products and obviously we have to acquire those in a way that we believe will create value for our shareholders over the long term. ","So you should know that business development is a major priority for us. That\u2019s why Roger talked about creating a new subunit of MRL. And I believe as you move forward, you will see us demonstrate just how important a priority it is for the Merck research labs.","Roger Perlmutter ","I can\u2019t give you too much color on the timing for readouts and the collaborations. These things we\u2019ve just announced are just getting started, and obviously it will take some time before that happens. Nor, of course, can I comment on any data that Insight might have accumulated in terms of their own studies. They\u2019re obviously going to be speaking about that in the future.","With respect to the activity of TVEC in other settings, that oncolytic virus has been studied in other settings early on in its development, and there was evidence of activity, for example, in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. And so there\u2019s always been interest in that. Over time, we\u2019ll see whether or not that\u2019s an important area to pursue. ","But I think the important thing to point out is that this modified herpes simplex virus acts in part through direct destruction of tumor cells, but in large part because it stimulates an immune response. The hypothesis which we are pursuing, together with our colleagues at Amgen is that if we can permit that immune response to be even more robust that we\u2019ve now provided two sources of stimulation of the cells that are going to eradicate the tumor. And it should be even more powerful. If that proves to be true in one setting, it could be prove to be true in many, and that obviously is a very exciting possibility. ","So the first thing, of course, is we have to demonstrate that the two can be used together safely. That\u2019s the most important part of any of these collaborations. But thereafter, we\u2019re going to be very aggressive about looking at opportunities to improve care for cancer patients.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Boris with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. ","John Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ","First question just has to do with cost savings and your cost savings initiatives that you have ongoing. Peter, you\u2019ve given guidance for below 2013 guidance. Can you maybe add some color to that? ","On the R&D front, Roger, can you maybe shape how deep the cuts have been and how much additional cuts you still need to make within the R&D side of the equation? ","And then for Adam, on the SG&A side, understand you have a new leader running the U.S. business. Are you still a believer in feet on the street, or have you reduced your primary care infrastructure within the U.S. based on the evolution of where the U.S. market is going? ","On odanacatib, for Roger, what do you need to see in the risk-benefit profile out of the five-year data that you\u2019ll have in house to make it a filable compound? And is that potentially influencing how you\u2019re shaping your primary care infrastructure? ","And then just on animal health, when will we see Zilmax back in the marketplace?","Peter Kellogg ","Let me take the first one, I think just to talk a little bit about the overall cost savings program and where we are, and how to think about it going forward. What we indicated was that we would see both R&D and SG&A in 2014 to be below the levels reported in 2013. That\u2019s our guidance. ","Just to go back and recap the direction we\u2019ve been going, and what we announced earlier in the year, we highlighted that we were launching a new program, which would expect $2.5 billion of annual net pretax cost savings by the end of 2015 compared to 2012. And of course that\u2019s not taking into account foreign exchange, so this is on a constant currency basis. ","As we go on to 2013, the tail end of 2013, we actually made a lot of progress, whether it be in SG&A or R&D, throughout the organization, as well as in manufacturing. And we did report very nice numbers. I think very good improvement in 2013. There was some forex benefit coming through that, I would just highlight. Some of those actions, quite frankly, were immediate cost savings and so forth. Ex-foreign exchange, we actually, I would say, came through with about $1.3 billion of savings for that year. So that\u2019s a great start. That\u2019s a real jump right into it.","As we move forward, I think you\u2019ve heard Ken talk a lot about the focus of this program not just being on cutting costs, but really thinking about structurally setting ourselves up to run the business very effectively, in a very focused manner, but in a reengineered manner that really takes out permanent cost savings, allows us to operate, pursue strategic opportunities, whether they be geographic, therapeutic area, or business line, and yet still become more and more productive as we roll forward.","I would say that the savings are split between SG&A and R&D overall. I think I would highlight that in no way are those efficiencies in any way impeding our ability to invest in PD1 or hepatitis C, or any of the other high potential pipeline candidates. It is being aided a bit by the fact that we have been divesting some assets, both from the pipeline as well as from our commercial franchise. And so in general we think we\u2019re on track to achieve the $2.5 billion program by the end of 2015. ","It\u2019s a little hard to say how [BD&L] will come into play against that. Obviously, if there\u2019s enormous opportunity that we go after it, then that would be a little bit different. But against normal levels of BD&L I think the program, that\u2019s kind of what we anticipated in our planning.","So on the next question, there\u2019s a question about Zilmax, I believe, right, in the animal health business? And I think that what I\u2019ve highlighted is, just to back up for a second on that, we did voluntarily implement a temporary sales suspension of Zilmax in the U.S. and Canada to give us a little time to really work with our industry partners so that we provide real strong, accurate data that will reaffirm confidence in Zilmax, and it remains an FDA approved product.","We\u2019ve worked with the advisory board in itself, the formal certification process for anyone that uses Zilmax. Certification has started in preparation for field evaluations for Zilmax [fed in controlled] cattle. And we\u2019re on track to begin all of that in the first quarter of 2014. So progress, I think we\u2019re following a very thorough approach to this, very important and very responsible.","Overall, the animal health continues to be a very nice business. I would highlight that around the world many parts of the world grew very nicely last year. Latin America, Canada, North America, Asia Pacific, all on an ex-exchange business, did very well. Really the softness in the business was primarily in the U.S., based on this. ","I would say overall animal health sales ex-Zilmax in the fourth quarter, just as an analogy\u2026 So if you take the total business sales ex-Zilmax, it was up 4% in the fourth quarter. So it still continues to do quite well. ","Adam Schechter ","If you look at 2013, we really did prioritize our investments and we made sure that we focused on the best opportunities for long term growth. So in areas like diabetes, we actually increased our spend in 2013. In other areas, we significantly decreased our spend. ","As we go into 2014, we\u2019re going to continue to prioritize and focus on the best investment opportunities that we have. So I mentioned, for example, that we\u2019re building Merck\u2019s oncology business unit. So we\u2019ll be increasing in the United States significantly and other parts of the world as well, the number of people that we have to prepare for the launch of that product.","At the same time, in other parts of our business, where we\u2019re deprioritizing, we\u2019ll be reducing our SG&A pretty significantly. Overall, in the United States we\u2019ve had significant reductions over the past several years in our field sales force. We think we\u2019re about rightsized now. But we\u2019ll continue to look for opportunities for growth to make sure we prioritize them appropriately.","Roger Perlmutter ","Just to comment on the R&D spend issue, which Peter handled, but I want to emphasize that from the beginning, we\u2019ve focused on three aspects, on processes, on portfolio, and on staffing. And we\u2019re working hard on all of those, and it\u2019s a journey. We\u2019ll continue to work on it. Adam and I have worked very closely rationalizing the portfolio. We\u2019ve improved the processes whereby we make decisions and reduce frictional coefficients, and it was necessary for us to reduce staffing. The kinds of run rates that you\u2019re seeing now are the result of those efforts, and we\u2019re going to keep at it.","And then with respect to odanacatib, again to keep in mind that our data safety and monitoring committee did come back really actually early in the analysis, and say that the study should be stopped because of an overwhelming efficacy and a favorable benefit-risk profile. So we know that based on their analysis, we know unambiguously that there is a treatment effect. ","The study was designed with an additional blinded extension, and until we have the full intention to treat data set, we don\u2019t know what those data look like and hence exactly what a file would look like. But I would say, based on just what the data safety monitoring committee had told us previously, that one has reason to be optimistic.","Ken Frazier ","Can I frame the whole issue around cost reduction? The way that we\u2019re looking at this whole thing is if we can drive much greater efficiency in our infrastructure, then we can continue to invest assets where it\u2019s going to matter in the long run, whether that is in the commercial space, or whether that is in the R&D space. ","When you have an asset like PD1, which I think you can already see is an asset that we could be studying as monotherapy and in combination with various agents for quite some time, it\u2019s incumbent upon us to make sure that we don\u2019t in any way constrict our ability to reach the full potential of our pipeline because we haven\u2019t been very tough on our infrastructure. ","And I would use the word tough because I would say that this is not an easy thing to do, particularly as it relates to the significant reduction in force of our employees. But I think it\u2019s an obligation we have. In an external healthcare market looking for greater innovation and greater efficiency, so too, our business model has to be about greater innovation and greater efficiency. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Baum from Citi.","Andrew Baum - Citi ","Number one, regarding the IDA, as with the other programs, are there any first mover advantages here in doing collaboration deals with these three high profile products? I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s no exclusivity precluding licensing to other owners for PD1 assets. So just in terms of bandwidth, are there any advantages here?","And then second, I know it\u2019s not immunotherapy, but just in relation to anacetrapib, could you remind us how many interim analyses that compound and that trial has had? And when will the next one be? And when is it possible that you could potentially present blinding if there was a strong efficacy signal?","Roger Perlmutter ","First of all, with respect to the question of first mover advantages, I think at the highest elevation, what we have to say is we are anxious to bring the potential benefits of PD1 antagonism to every patient possible. And that means we have to choose what we think would be the best combinations and try to pursue those aggressively. ","I think when we do that, of course, we generate data sets that, if they are attractive and promising, provide a basis for moving forward commercially. But the first thing is, number one, can these things be used together safely, and then number two, do we really get a benefit from an efficacy point of view. And we\u2019ll find out. And no, of course, these things would not be exclusive, and should not be exclusive, because you want to do the best thing for patients. ","The second thing is with respect to anacetrapib, keep in mind we do have a 30,000 patient outcome study that is going on right now. The data safety monitoring board met recently and recommended to us that the study be continued without any modification. ","And there are three interim analyses that are planned. The first interim analysis will be at this point in early 2015. Now, I just would like to mention here it\u2019s important to know that this is a study that is being conducted by an independent academic-based group. The steering committee for that study has control over the conduct of the study, and so while we are involved on that steering committee, nevertheless, strictly speaking, the study is being run by the Oxford group. And so that\u2019s just important to keep in mind.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Gregg Gilbert - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Roger, could you comment on how your all-oral HCV regimen stacks up versus Gilead and AbbVie\u2019s now that we\u2019ve seen some more complete data sets? Sort of a crystal ball question there, I understand. And then for Ken, in the 1990s many large pharma companies divested non-pharma businesses, and many of those companies regretted those actions. So at a high level, what do you think is different in this day and age? ","Roger Perlmutter ","With respect to HCV, I think what everybody wants, of course, is to have a fully oral regimen that is ribavirin free and that is pangenotypic and achieves sustained virulogic load reductions as close to 100% as possible. And thus far, we\u2019re not there. Nobody\u2019s there yet. We don\u2019t have the data sets there. ","But I think that we\u2019re in a pretty attractive place with our 5172 molecule, which is a very novel protease inhibitor that has very desirable characteristics and conserves the foundation for future combination regimens including with our 5A antagonist, as well as with other molecules that we have in development.","So I think we definitely have a good regimen. I think there\u2019s a lot of work yet to find the ideal regimen. Obviously the other companies, including Gilead and AbbVie and Bristol and others, are working very hard to find ideal regimens also. But it\u2019s a competitive race.","Ken Frazier ","On your question about comparing the 1990s to now, first of all, I appreciate the fact that you are implying that there\u2019s a lot to be learned by looking at what\u2019s happened in the past, period, and whether those decisions actually drove long term shareholder value. And that\u2019s why we are saying we are committed to doing what we believe will drive long term shareholder value. ","So you\u2019ll see, first of all, within our pharma business, we\u2019ve already started to focus on streamlining that business. When you see the changes that have been made in neuroscience, with [unintelligible], with the ophthalmology businesses, with the divestitures to Aspen in our [unintelligible] facility, we\u2019re really looking at which assets give us the greatest opportunity to drive growth going forward.","And that is really the lynchpin for us. Is a particular asset going to create more long term value inside our portfolio or outside our portfolio? Because everything that you have to devote capital to inside your portfolio has an opportunity cost somewhere else in your portfolio. So we\u2019re really looking to have the kind of portfolio that actually drives the greatest long term growth and value for our shareholders.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen.","Steve Scala - Cowen & Company ","First, for Peter, I believe you said you had $500 million in patent pressures in 2014, which is far less than the impact from Singulair, but with roughly similar, if not even more gross profit margin erosion that you\u2019re setting now. So would you explain that dynamic? Why are we seeing such extreme erosion with even less patent expiration pressures?","And then for Dr. Perlmutter, just stepping back, based on what your immune oncology competitors have said and done, what is your sense of where Merck stands competitively both in number of available combinations, number of tumor types explored, use of companion diagnostics, and any other metric you wish to cite?","Peter Kellogg ","Let me just recap kind of the background for your question. So you\u2019re right, we did highlight that going from \u201913 to \u201914 we will see, from lost exclusivity, about a $500 million impact. And that\u2019s a tail on Singulair in Europe, Temodar, and a couple of other products going off. And I did highlight in the past that a lot of our PGM effect is being driven by mix of the different products. ","Now, in \u201913 I mentioned that we saw Singulair going away, which was a very high gross margin product, and very strong growth, though, in some other products, that have very good gross margins, just not quite as high as our average, such as vaccines and immunology, REMICADE, SIMPONI, in Europe and so forth. ","I think the other thing I would say is that we\u2019ve always commented over time that we are continually under margin pressure. We see on a regular basis pressure in Europe, and we will also see next year, we anticipate, as Adam mentioned, a biannual price decrease that is kind of a standard practice in Japan. And so all of those kinds of items are factored into our thinking and our modeling.","The last thing I would say, though, is that the AstraZeneca joint venture, we do expect to wrap up in the second half of the year. So in the first half of the year, we\u2019ll still be seeing supply sales going to AstraZeneca, albeit at a slightly lower level. Still those are lower gross margin products, as you might imagine. And that would go away in the second half. ","So I did highlight that while the first half of the year would look a lot like the fourth quarter, as we see volume picking up, which drives productivity and manufacturing as well as we see AstraZeneca going away, we\u2019ll see kind of forces that also improve our PGM as we go through the second half of the year. ","So I think net-net for the year, on average, we expect to be a little bit below, on average, the full year of \u201913, but we do see it kind of bottoming out as we look to the first half of the year, and starting to pick up as we go into \u201914 and onward. ","Roger Perlmutter ","Again, at a high elevation, as you know, there\u2019s a lot less to be learned about how best to use PD1 antagonists in the treatment of cancer. We don\u2019t yet know the full impact of PD-L1 expression and how best to assay for it. And different companies are using different assays. As I said, our evidence is supportive of the idea that this could be an important marker for responsiveness.","We don\u2019t know which tumors are most responsive in a monotherapy setting, the range of tumors and the degree of response, and the durability of response. And we don\u2019t know how to make that better either through combinations with other immunoregulatory agents or through combinations with targeted therapies or even conventional cytotoxic therapy. So there\u2019s still an enormous amount to learn.","When you look at our program, we\u2019ve got more than a dozen studies now. We\u2019ve got thousands of patients enrolled. We\u2019re looking at a broad range of tumor types. We\u2019ve been enormously thoughtful about which combinations, how to look at biomarkers, and how to proceed. And I have to tell you, I like our program. I really do.","On the other hand, I also recognize that we\u2019re treating a devastating illness that there\u2019s a lot of important information to get, and there\u2019s room for many different companies to contribute. And all of the groups are good, and that\u2019s great for patients.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson from Sanford Bernstein.","Tim Anderson - Sanford Bernstein ","You\u2019re running a Phase II-III trial in lung, looking at high expressors of PD-L1, and if I look at the Roche and Genentech data, it would suggest that it\u2019s about 25% of non-small cell patients that are high expressors. I\u2019m wondering what your data is, using your assay, using your cut points. Is it similar to that 25% figure for lung? I\u2019m just trying to gauge the size of the commercial opportunity if biomarker kind of limits it.","And then second question, unrelated to PD1, Ken, just a couple of years ago, you resisted the idea of getting rid of consumer animal health, and now obviously those are on the table. I\u2019m just wondering, what changed in that fairly short timeframe? And you\u2019re saying that all things are under consideration now, so my question is, is it a realistic possibility that you might go even further and actually split up the drug side of the business into different companies like Pfizer is considering doing? Or would it likely stop with reevaluation of animal health and consumer health?","Ken Frazier ","I\u2019ll start by going back to where we were before. I would say what\u2019s consistent is I think these are terrific businesses. I think what we have to say now, given the size of our company, given the opportunities that we have, like PD1, we have to look at where our capital should go from an allocation standpoint. So what we\u2019re really doing is looking at all aspects of our company. I remind you that we have divested Saphris. We have divested the ophthalmology business. ","So we are not just looking at animal health and consumer. We\u2019re looking at the sum total of what we have, where we should put our capital, where we can have the greatest amount of growth going forward. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re looking at things, and that\u2019s how I\u2019m going to answer those questions.","Roger Perlmutter ","First of all, the percent positive in non-small cell lung cancer with PD-L1, that moves a little bit as you accrue more data. But just to be very clear, we have had no difficulty enrolling. There are lots of patients out there who are PD-L1 positive. ","Number two, as we\u2019ve explained, it is not the case that PD-L1 expression is determinative. There are responders in our data sets, as we\u2019ve presented, that are PD-L1 negative. That\u2019s true in different tumor types. And others have presented the same thing. Whether that reflects our improper setting of the cut point, as you suggest, our inability to measure PD-L1 expression at the target where it\u2019s active, or some other ligand that\u2019s involved, we don\u2019t know. We can\u2019t say that. ","But what we should recognize is, in the first instance, one wants to look in patient populations where one can best characterize the treatment effect, and our data indicate that that is in the PD-L1 positive segment. There will be patients, potentially quite a lot of patients, who don\u2019t score in that assay, but nevertheless have responses. That a second issue, and one which we want to address, because obviously you don\u2019t want to deny the benefits of this therapy, particularly if it\u2019s well tolerated, to patients who have no other alternatives.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group ","I actually have a question for Adam, if he\u2019s awake, after all the PD1 questions. [laughter] My question is, embedded in your 2014 guidance, do you anticipate that there will or will not be Januvia and Janumet volume growth in the United States in 2014? If you\u2019d be willing to provide any color on that, that would be great.","And then I guess for Roger, I will slip in one PD1 question if I might. A question I know you\u2019ve gotten before, but since you have breakthrough status and you\u2019re probably speaking to the FDA frequently, I was just wondering if you would be willing to provide any kind of update as to the earliest timeframe that you might be able to file for approval in any of the lung cancer settings. And I know this is competitive and there may or may not be a lot you can say, but anything you can say, we\u2019d certainly appreciate.","Adam Schechter ","Thanks for the question, and talking about PD1 gets me just as excited as Roger, and I can\u2019t wait until I have more to say about that when we start to launch. With regard to your question on Januvia, if you look at the full year sales in \u201913, we had 5% growth ex-exchange. If you look at 2014, we expect growth in 2014. The macro trends support a growing market. In the U.S., it looks like the decline has stabilized. Now the question is, can we get it to turn around, and we\u2019re working hard to see if we can do that.","Internationally, the market is growing, and we expect that growth. We have high penetration in some markets, like in Japan, but we have other opportunities in the international markets we believe we can get volume growth as well. We expect some pricing pressure internationally. You\u2019ve heard about the repricing of the BPP4s in Japan. That will occur effective April, but it\u2019s going to affect the wholesalers in February and March. And that could be a maximum of 15%, although we don\u2019t and won\u2019t have the exact number until March.","We also have good data in Germany, where they looked at Januvia and said that there was incremental benefit versus the products in the market. We don\u2019t know the magnitude of the price decrease, but there will be some price decrease, we expect, in Germany. But net-net, we expect to grow in 2014.","Roger Perlmutter ","With respect to our discussions with FDA and breakthrough status, of course FDA is interested to know what kinds of things we\u2019re seeing in all patient subsets, particularly for reasons of safety and exposure. But right now we\u2019re completely focused on completing the rolling submission with respect to melanoma in patients previously exposed to ipilimumab. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. We will get that done by the middle of the year. Other discussions, of course, will occur after that.","Ken Frazier ","Mark, in your preamble, you referenced our comment about the trough year for EPS. What I want everyone to understand is that our team is very focused on and committed to driving growth, and we expect to grow earnings off this new base in 2015.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Holford with Jefferies.","Jeff Holford - Jefferies ","\u2026 structurally, at least initially in the melanoma indication. Will this be focused and built upon PD-L1 selection in any way? It just seems that there are many issues about limiting how broadly these treatments could be used during that, even though it\u2019s somewhat of a prognostic marker. ","And then secondly, on Zilmax, what\u2019s the risk here, that this is not to do with getting additional safety data? What\u2019s the risk for companies like Tyson Foods and other companies? Are they just worried about bad publicity using these products and really coming back is going to be difficult from there?","Roger Perlmutter ","With respect to PD-L1 expression, and you were cut off a bit at the beginning, but I think the important thing to emphasize again is that in terms of trying to understand the benefit-risk profile of the drug, it\u2019s important to focus on populations where the responses are easiest to demonstrate. ","We have been working hard on looking at the PD-L1 marker as a way of identifying sensitive populations, but as we said before, PD-L1 negative patients do have responses. And in a patient population that has exhausted other treatment options, it\u2019s not reasonable to withhold a therapeutic option that holds promise provided it\u2019s reasonably well tolerated. So I think that\u2019s going to be the view, always, and with time, we\u2019ll know more about how to select patients for this therapy and for other therapies.","Ken Frazier ","Quickly on Zilmax, I just want to stress, again, that we voluntarily implemented a temporary sales suspension in the United States and Canada, so that we could work with our industry partners, so that we could reaffirm confidence in Zilmax, which we really have. And so we\u2019re now working with an advisory board which includes some of the big players in the industry to provide a profit for certifying people who use it to show that the product actually is very helpful.","I think we also ought to keep in mind the underlying dynamics, which is there is an increasing need for protein consumption around the world and that requires greater productivity going forward. So this is an important product. It is a useful product. And what we did was to ensure that everybody was on board to understand the benefit of this product going forward. And we\u2019re confident that this process will actually lead to a good outcome for Zilmax.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets ","Roger, obviously you\u2019re taking a broad combination strategy for MK3475, and I certainly appreciate your comments about how much we still don\u2019t know. What I\u2019m wondering is if you could elaborate a little bit more on the strong scientific justification you mentioned in your prepared remarks. And could we see data supporting this approach at AACR in April?","And a follow up for Ken. Last October you mentioned an increased focus on your top 10 geographic markets. What are your plans for the other markets as you prioritize resources? ","Roger Perlmutter ","The scientific justifications are of several forms. Clearly we like to have preclinical data at a minimum that is supportive of the idea that PD1 antagonism will work effectively with another therapy. In many cases, we have exactly that. ","In some cases, as we reported in our press release with Pfizer, we\u2019re seeking that kind of preclinical information, and in other cases there\u2019s data that\u2019s been developed, for example with TVEC, with respect to the underlying mechanism of action and the expansion of T-cell subpopulations that\u2019s extremely supportive for the idea that those two will work in combination.","We will have the opportunity to talk about some of those data coming up at AACR, for example, and ASCO, and of course at our May 6 business review, RD review, which is not too far away.","Adam Schechter ","Regarding the top 10 markets, the top 10 markets represent a very significant amount of our total sales. So what we were signaling is, we have to be successful in those markets in order to grow in the future. That does not mean that there aren\u2019t other markets that remain important for growth opportunities. ","So we\u2019ll make sure that we invest in the top 10 markets and we first and foremost have the right promotional resources and resources in those markets. And then we\u2019ll look at the other markets on an individual basis to ensure that we maximize those, albeit we might use different models and different approaches in those markets.  ","Ken Frazier ","Let me just summarize. First of all, I thank you all for staying on the phone so long as you did. Really quickly, as a management team, we\u2019re very excited about where Merck is today. Our goals are two. One is growth, the second is innovation. Everything that we\u2019ve talked about with respect to our portfolio is to put together the right combination of assets that will allow us to drive the greatest amount of growth going forward.","We\u2019re pleased that we have some very strong assets in our business now. Eight of our top 10 brands grew double digit last year. We want to continue to grow our company, and I restate that we expect to grow earnings off the new 2014 base going forward.","But the most important thing in our business for the long term is innovation, and we are excited by the evidence of progress that we\u2019re seeing in the Merck research labs. MK3475 obviously is one of the first and most important of those things. But HCV, vorapaxar, additional catalysts like suvorexant, odanacatib, and other things coming forward this year, we\u2019re extraordinarily excited by what can happen for Merck in the near future, and we would just say stay tuned. We believe that we\u2019re going to have very exciting things to report. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today\u2019s Merck fourth quarter 2013 earnings call.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Alex Kelly, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Alex Kelly","Thanks, Jackie, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to Merck's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. Before I turn the call over to Ken, I want to mention just a few housekeeping items. First, there are a number of items in the GAAP results this quarter such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items, and you should note that we have excluded those items in our non-GAAP results. You can see our reconciliation tables in the press release and also in Table 2 of the charts. That will give you a better sense of the underlying performance. We've also provided tables to help you understand the revenue trends, and we have some additional tables as well.","So during the call, we're going to refer primarily to the non-GAAP results, which you'll find in Table 2. And finally, I'd like to remind you that some of the statements we make today might be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The statements are based upon management's current beliefs and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. You can see our SEC filings in our -- which identify certain risk factors and other cautionary statements that you should know about when considering those forward-looking statements. You can find our SEC filings on our website at merck.com.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to our speakers. First, we have Ken Frazier, our Chairman and CEO. We also have Adam Schechter, the President of our Global Human Health business; and then Peter Kellogg, our Chief Financial Officer. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Ken.","Kenneth C. Frazier","Thank you, Alex. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call today. Last year, we laid out our plans for success in 2012 and beyond. We told you that we continue having high expectations for ourselves and that we intend to deliver strong operational performance and advance our pipeline. We are delivering both.","Our results this quarter demonstrate the momentum we continue building in our underlying business. As I've said for some time, we are focusing on delivering growth through innovation and execution. We are pleased with the growth we saw this quarter, and our longer-term focus on innovation remains intact.","This quarter, we delivered our sixth straight quarter of top line growth and even faster non-GAAP bottom line growth. We did so in the face of significant pressures from the difficult global economic environment, including an increase in government austerity measures and currency headwinds. Although we anticipate many of these external challenges to continue, the greatest longer-term threat to the global health care system remains the rapidly increasing and unsustainable growth in costs. This is why we are committed to our strategy of bringing forward innovative medicines and vaccines that have demonstrated outcomes, provide value to public and private payers and make a real difference in the end to patients.","Despite the external challenges to our industry and the imminent SINGULAIR U.S. patent expiration, we remain focused on building long-term shareholder value by executing the 4-part strategy we shared with you at our business briefing last November: first, executing on our core business, which includes our largest markets, our core brands, our new launch brands and innovative R&D; second, expanding geographically to leverage high-growth markets such as Japan and key emerging markets; third, extending into the complementary businesses of Consumer Care and Animal Health; and fourth, excelling at managing our cost structure while continuing to invest for future growth, which is critical in this industry.","Our second quarter results, plus a broader view of our robust pipeline, demonstrate that we are executing our strategy well. So let me start with how we executed on the core. Overall, we grew worldwide sales by 1%, which includes a 4% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. On a constant currency basis, therefore, sales increased 5%. Once again, we saw double-digit growth from a number of key products. We remain confident in our ability to weather the loss of exclusivity for SINGULAIR, and in 2012, we intend to maintain our revenues at or near 2011 levels on a constant currency basis.","The second part of our strategy is to expand geographically in high-growth markets like Japan and key emerging markets. Since the merger, we've been making investments accordingly, and as you will hear from Adam, those investments are paying off. In addition to our organic growth initiatives and capabilities, we have also started new joint ventures in places like China, Brazil and India to expand our capabilities while making further inroads into these important markets.","Moving to the third part of our strategy, extending into complementary businesses, Merck Animal Health grew 14% this quarter, excluding exchange. The double-digit growth in the quarter was primarily driven by sales in the United States and Asia Pacific across the cattle, swine and companion animal segments. We seek connectivity in R&D and manufacturing between our Animal Health and our Human Health businesses, and we remain optimistic about the global trends and growth prospects for our Animal Health business.","Merck Consumer Care continues to show top line growth in 2012 and is experiencing growing end market demand in many key countries. Sales this quarter grew 3%, excluding exchange. We remain confident about the future prospects of this business, which meets the needs of consumers and complements our pharmaceutical core in terms of its life cycle management.","The last element of our growth strategy is to excel at managing our costs while also investing for future growth. This quarter, we drove top line growth across our business while also tightly managing costs and reducing operating expenses overall by about $200 million, resulting in an 11% increase in non-GAAP EPS. We're committed to driving continuous productivity improvements across the enterprise to help us invest for growth on an ongoing basis.","Finally, I'd like to focus the remainder of my remarks on our foundation, that's innovation, and the progress that Merck is making on that important front. Last year, we reiterated our commitment to R&D. Translating cutting-edge science in the medically important products is at the heart of what we believe Merck does best. We're pleased to see significant progress in the pipeline. We remain on track with 6 major filings over the next 18 months. Among them is Odanacatib, our investigational cat-K inhibitor for osteoporosis. Odanacatib represents a potential whole new way to treat osteoporosis. Any unmet medical need in this field remains very high.","Currently, as you may know, there are about 200 million women worldwide who have osteoporosis, but only approximately 20% of these women are treated. As we reported earlier this month, the Data Monitoring Committee for the fracture risk reduction study completed its first planned interim analysis and recommended that the study be closed early due to robust efficacy and a favorable benefit risk profile. We still need to close out the trial and follow up on the safety issues that remain in certain selected areas, as noted by the DMC. We anticipate submitting regulatory applications for approval of Odanacatib in the U.S. and the EU during the first half of next year and in Japan in the third quarter of 2013.","In addition to Odanacatib, we are also on track to file Suvorexant, a new first-in-class treatment for patients with insomnia. Suvorexant approaches insomnia differently than other medicines because it helps patients to sleep by targeting and blocking orexins, which play a role in keeping people awake. As you know, many patients have the need for chronic treatment. Suvorexant has demonstrated efficacy through 12 months, which is one of the longest continuously dosed placebo-controlled trials of a sleep medication ever conducted.","Beyond Odanacatib and Suvorexant, we are on track to file BRIDION, a first-in-class neuromuscular reversal agent; V503, a vaccine that expands protection against certain HPV-associated cancers; TREDAPTIVE, our novel cholesterol medicine that improves multiple lipid parameters; and vintafolide, a first-in-class innovation that could have utility in a variety of tumor types, including ovarian and lung cancers.","As a reminder, each of these compounds we intend to file is consistent with our focus on R&D innovation, meaning clinically differentiated drugs that are either first in class or best in class. We believe all 6 of our planned major submissions include data that will create significant market opportunities at the time of launch and afterwards.","We also anticipate several meaningful R&D events in the second half of this year, including responding to the FDA with additional data for ATOZET, our combination tablet containing ezetimibe and atorvastatin; beginning Phase III trials for MK-3102, our once-weekly DPP-4 inhibitor; and starting Phase II trials for our novel base inhibitor, which recently had early data presented at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference.","In conjunction with the growing momentum of our internal R&D efforts, we remain committed to identifying and accessing external innovation. Our goal is to seek out those assets at all phases of development that help position us for success in key therapeutic areas and which can be attained on terms that create shareholder value. Our recent partnership with Endocyte for a late-stage oncology drug is an example of our strategy, as are the HIV partnerships with Chimerix and Yamasa for early-stage compounds announced earlier this week.","In closing, let me emphasize again that we remain confident in our core strategy and the progress we are making in transforming Merck's business. As we are facing a major patent expiration, we are confident that we are building a foundation for growth for our underlying portfolio of products. As importantly, we're pleased to be advancing and delivering on the pipeline. Overall, our focus on strong operational performance and investing for the future will allow us to deliver shareholder value over the longer term.","I'd like to now turn the call over to Adam Schechter.","Adam H. Schechter","Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to speak with you today and to provide you with an overview of Global Human Health results. Global Human Health continued to deliver top line year-over-year growth in the second quarter. Pharmaceutical and vaccine sales grew 2%. Sales grew 8%, excluding the transfer of REMICADE and SIMPONI in certain territories in 2011 and the impact of foreign exchange.","The benefits of our diverse and our innovative portfolio of products and our focus on growth and execution are evident in the results again this quarter. I will highlight several aspects of our performance according to our strategy. I'm going to begin with the execution on our core business, which includes our largest markets, our core brands and our launch brands.","In the United States, sales grew significantly this quarter. They grew significantly whether you include or exclude SINGULAIR. Driving this performance are innovative products with double-digit growth and long exclusivity like JANUVIA, JANUMET, ISENTRESS, GARDASIL, ZOSTAVAX and VICTRELIS.","Moving to Europe and Canada. Sales declined 14% in the second quarter. If you exclude the transfer of REMICADE and SIMPONI in Canada and the impact of foreign exchange, sales declined 3%. Strong contributions from JANUVIA and JANUMET and the launch sales of VICTRELIS were offset by continued austerity measures and the loss of CLARINEX exclusivity.","Many of our key brands are growing in volume in the EU. However, we continue to anticipate an unfavorable mid-single-digit impact from pricing measures in 2012. But it's trending toward the higher end of that range.","Moving on to several core brands. I'll start with the JANUVIA family of products, which became our largest-selling products for the first time this quarter. JANUVIA and JANUMET continued to have strong performance, growing 33% to $1.5 billion. This quarter's results include about $100 million of supply sales to our co-marketing partner in Japan. As you may recall, these supply sales are reported every other quarter.","Despite multiple competitors in the market, the JANUVIA family retained about a 75% share of the global DPP-4 market and continues to have opportunities to grow. There continues to be opportunity to gain share from the generic sulfonylurea class, which still represents about 37% of the patient days of therapy. We believe that JANUVIA's efficacy, tolerability and broad product offering will enable continued strong growth of this important brand.","Worldwide sales of SINGULAIR grew 6%. When SINGULAIR loses exclusivity in the United States next week, we expect multiple generic entrants on day 1. This means that erosion will be rapid, and it will be significant. In addition, SINGULAIR will use exclusivity in major European markets in February of 2013.","ISENTRESS continues to be a strong core brand for Merck with 18% growth. This week, we presented the year 5 data from the STARTMRK study. This efficacy and tolerability profile underscores why ISENTRESS has been a valuable treatment option in the fight against HIV. We are confident that ISENTRESS will continue to be a strong choice for patients going forward.","In our cholesterol franchise, ZETIA and VYTORIN global sales grew 2% to $1.1 billion. ZETIA continued to grow in the United States, and VYTORIN contributed to growth outside of the United States.","Combined REMICADE and SIMPONI sales grew 6%, excluding foreign exchange in the retained territories of Europe, Turkey and Russia this quarter. SIMPONI remains an important launch brand with $76 million of sales versus $59 million for the same quarter last year in the Merck territories. We are looking to expand SIMPONI's product offering with an additional indication in ulcerative colitis, which is a fast-growing anti-TNF category. The file was recently submitted to European Medicines Agency for their review.","Moving on to vaccines. Vaccines had another strong quarter of double-digit growth. GARDASIL maintained its strong performance with 17% growth over the prior year. This is due to continued uptake of the male indication in the United States and the launch in Japan.","Sales of ZOSTAVAX were $148 million, the highest quarter since 2008. Given the stable supply situation, we've been increasing our promotional efforts this year, first, with a disease awareness campaign in the spring; and more recently, with a branded campaign that began just last month.","Moving to launch brands. We continue to launch multiple products, including GARDASIL in Japan and VICTRELIS around the world. And our launch products contributed more than $200 million in revenue this quarter. Global sales of VICTRELIS reached $126 million. In the U.S., share continued to grow, and VICTRELIS ended the quarter with over a 40% TRx share. While we are pleased with the continued share gains, we have seen a contraction in the market for new patient starts. However, there are still a considerable number of appropriate patients that need treatment, and we are now working on market development activities. In addition, U.S. new patient starts should increase somewhat after the historically low summer months.","Internationally, VICTRELIS is launching in 23 markets around the world. VICTRELIS has a greater than 50% patient share in many of these markets, including France, Germany, Canada, Norway and Denmark. This rapid uptake and strong patient share performance signals a value of triple therapy with VICTRELIS and what it represents to patients, to physicians and to payers.","Now I'd like to highlight how we're executing against our strategy of expanding geographically into key high-growth markets. And let's begin with Japan. Growth in Japan was 9% or approximately 7%, excluding exchange. Sales this quarter continue to reflect strong growth of JANUVIA and launch brands such as GARDASIL and BRIDION, tempered somewhat by the biennial price cuts last quarter and a tough comparison to a very strong allergy season last year. Looking ahead, we believe we have continued opportunity for robust growth in Japan.","Moving to emerging markets. Sales reached $1.9 billion, up 1%. However, the emerging markets grew 16% if you exclude REMICADE sales and foreign exchange. Growth in emerging markets was driven by China, Russia, Brazil, Mexico and the Middle East. In the key emerging markets, our growth is outpacing overall market growth. Although there is pricing pressure in certain emerging markets, we are maximizing the growth of our core brands. We are launching new brands. And in the future, we'll begin to realize the benefits of joint ventures that we've been forming in several of these key markets.","China continues to be an important growth driver with 27% growth or 23%, excluding exchange. The growth was driven by our hospital and specialty business lines, as well as contributions from our diversified brands and our core brands. We expect they will continue to grow in China and other emerging markets.","In summary, Global Human Health continued its consistent, strong operational performance. We believe our business momentum positions us well to maintain the top line this year, even considering the SINGULAIR U.S. patent expiry next week and austerity measures around the world. So if there's one thing, if there's one thing I'd like you to remember, it's that our base is strong, our base is diverse, and our base continues to grow. I believe we can deliver strong results in 2012 by executing on our strategy, our strategy of optimizing our core businesses, which includes our largest markets, our core brands and our launch brands, and by continuing to expand into high-growth emerging markets in Japan.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to my colleague, Peter Kellogg.","Peter N. Kellogg","Thank you, Adam, and good morning. As you heard from Ken and Adam, we are continuing to execute against our stated plans to grow and perform, and we are on track to achieve the financial targets we laid out earlier this year.","In the second quarter, we drove revenue growth and reduced our expenses, resulting in even faster bottom line growth. We also generated new clinical data to support our late-stage R&D programs. These results demonstrate that Merck is operating well and has built a strong foundation and momentum in our key brands and across our businesses. This morning, I'll briefly talk about our performance in the second quarter, and I will discuss our outlook, including the implications of foreign exchange and austerity.","Let me start with the operating results. My remarks will focus on our non-GAAP financials, which exclude acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. On this basis, we earned $1.05 this quarter, 11% higher than the prior year. As Ken and Adam mentioned, we drove revenue growth in each of our 3 major business units. However, our total revenues grew only 1% due to a 4% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange and a 1% unfavorable impact from alliance revenue and third-party manufacturing sales. We do expect supply sales to Astra to continue to decline going forward.","Now let me turn to our expenses in the second quarter. Our financial discipline has resulted in total operating expenses being reduced by nearly $200 million in the second quarter. Product costs were about $30 million lower year-over-year. Marketing and administrative expenses were down about $260 million, and research and development expenses were up about $100 million due primarily to the $120 million upfront payment to Endocyte.","On the R&D expenses, I would note that the continuing momentum in new pipeline projects and business development deals have led our R&D expense to be about $100 million above the first half of 2011. As a result, we now expect our 2012 non-GAAP R&D expenses to be slightly higher than the 2011 level on a full year basis.","Our non-GAAP gross margin of 77.2% was better on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to product mix and productivity improvements. However, with the SINGULAIR U.S. patent expiration in August, we anticipate that our gross margin will be lower going forward, as SINGULAIR is a very high-margin product.","The improvement in marketing and administrative expense was due to actions that improved our operating efficiency across the company, which account for about 2\/3 of the marketing and admin expense improvement. The balance was due to foreign exchange.","Moving to tax. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 25.8% in the second quarter. This is higher than the first quarter tax rate. The Endocyte payment unfavorably affected the rate, and foreign exchange also unfavorably affected the tax rate due to the magnitude of change during this quarter. Based on the first half non-GAAP tax rate of 25.3%, we have revised our tax guidance for 2012 and now expect our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 25%.","Now let me provide some additional commentary on our 2012 outlook. At the outset, we are reconfirming our non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.75 to $3.85. That guidance incorporates the strong operating performance in the first half and the amendment of the AstraZeneca partnership. And it is tempered by the slightly higher R&D spending, a higher tax rate, austerity measures and foreign exchange.","As Adam mentioned, the environment of austerity remains challenging from a price perspective. While our volume in Europe is growing, we continue to expect pricing pressure in the mid-single-digit range of our European business in 2012, although it may now be in the higher end of that range. Despite these pressures and consistent with our prior guidance, we expect the underlying operational momentum of Merck's business will enable us to maintain our full year 2012 revenues at or near 2011 levels on a constant currency basis. But it is now clear that currency, and especially the euro, has deteriorated significantly since we last spoke, and that deterioration in foreign exchange rates is putting downward pressure on our results in the second half.","At current exchange rates, the ForEx pressures that I mentioned are expected to adversely affect full year sales by more than 3%. For example, at today's exchange rates, sales in the third quarter would be adversely affected by about 6%. And much of that top line pressure will flow through to the bottom line. So you should adjust your assumptions accordingly.","We continue to believe that the fourth quarter will be the lowest quarter of the year primarily due to the U.S. SINGULAIR patent expiration.","So to summarize our guidance, our operations are strong, and we are maintaining our non-GAAP EPS guidance between $3.75 and $3.85. But the euro movements during the remainder of the year will influence where we finish the year within that EPS range. We also continue to expect GAAP EPS to be between $2.04 and $2.30.","As Ken and Adam mentioned, we are consistently delivering on our strategy that is focused on growth and execution. And also, we are right on track with the roadmap that we laid out at the time of our merger. At that time, we talked about a progress timeline that had 3 phases. We completed the bulk of the launch phase in 2010 and the early part of 2011. Now in the accelerate phase, we are focused on driving top line growth and leveraging the income statement to achieve even faster bottom line growth. Six quarters of top line growth and roughly double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth are indicative of our execution during this accelerate phase. We have succeeded in creating momentum to absorb macro external pressures and the SINGULAIR patent expiration.","The next phase, which we call the breakthrough phase, happens when key products begin emerging from the R&D pipeline. Two of these programs, Odanacatib and Suvorexant, took significant steps forward this quarter. As we bring these and other drugs to market, we will invest to drive their long-term success and help them reach as many patients as appropriate so that the Merck of tomorrow is even stronger than the Merck of today. Thank you.","Now I'll turn the call back over to Alex.","Alex Kelly","Okay. Thanks, Peter. Now we'd like to open up the call to answer your questions. [Operator Instructions] So Jackie, we're now ready to take the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Catherine Arnold with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Catherine J. Arnold - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I had 2 questions. One, I wondered if you could just comment on ZOSTAVAX. I mean, very impressive performance. And I know last quarter you had said that it's going to take another 3 or 6 months to better understand the demand here, and you've been doing DTC. Does the second quarter tell us sort of more about what we should be thinking on annualized rates and how we should start seeing maybe more normalized sequential quarterly progression? Or is it going to remain choppy? And then a more big picture question, Ken, I guess I'm just wondering if the board or executive team has evolved or changed over the last few quarters in the way it's thinking about evaluating or considering what's core for Merck strategically and what might be candidates for divestment or spin? And then if the answer is yes, if you could just give us a little bit of color there.","Kenneth C. Frazier","So thanks for the questions, Catherine. I think our approach to our overall business portfolio remains essentially the same, which is we need to evaluate as we go forward what the opportunities are across Animal Health and Consumer Health in conjunction with Global Human Health. Right now, we're pleased to have them in the portfolio. We think they're performing well. We will continue to evaluate how we can ensure that those portions of the portfolio actually help us contribute to our plans to have long-term shareholder value. So that was what I would say. We'll continue to look at that, but we're pleased to have those in our portfolio right now. The other thing is that we continue, as we look at our portfolio, to look for ways to augment our businesses through the kind of business development that will create long-term shareholder value. So that wasn't directly your question, but I want to make sure that, that's also clear. On the ZOSTAVAX thing, I have to say we're very pleased that we could now say we're in a stable supply situation now in the United States, and we're continuing to work hard to make the kinds of manufacturing improvements and enhancements that are necessary to meet worldwide demand. So with that, I'll turn it over to Adam.","Adam H. Schechter","Catherine, so the $148 million for the second quarter, that was the highest quarter since 2008. But I think it's important that we believe it's reflective of current market demand. At the same time, we're increasing our promotional efforts, and we just started our branded DTC campaign last month. So we're looking to see if we can continue to accelerate. Also, in the fourth quarter, there may be some seasonality as the flu season hits and some patients are going in to get their flu vaccine. They might also get their PNEUMOVAX vaccine. The question is, will they get the third one, which will be ZOSTAVAX? So we're going to be working very hard in the fourth quarter but watching it very closely to see if demand can continue to increase.","Catherine J. Arnold - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Adam, just as a follow-up, are you basically saying that this quarter shows real demand, but there's opportunities to stimulate more demand, if possible?","Adam H. Schechter","So I believe that this quarter is real demand, and we're going to continue to see if we can accelerate growth moving forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein.","Tim Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","On Odanacatib, the press release about early stoppage of the trial suggested there was a safety issue. Can you give us any color even at a high level on what this is and also say when full results will be released? On REMICADE, which will be your third-biggest drug once SINGULAIR goes off, we recently saw the first biosimilar approval in South Korea. Can you give us your general thoughts on biosimilars against the product? And the VICTRELIS new patient start declines, is that because of warehousing at all? Or is that just natural treatment evolution?","Alex Kelly","Okay. Thanks, Tim. Ken, do you want to start?","Kenneth C. Frazier","Tim, we don't have any updates beyond what we said in our press release. We are waiting, as you are, for the trial to close out following the first planned interim efficacy analysis. We anticipate that will take several months and that the data from the trial will be presented in 2013.","Adam H. Schechter","So let me try first to answer your question regarding REMICADE. And if you look at REMICADE, it's currently patent protected in a majority of EU countries until late 2014. We filed for an extended patent life in the EU based upon the pediatric indications, so we're hoping that, that will bring exclusivity to 2015. We're still doing a lot of work, but we would expect potentially minimal impact the first few years after biosimilar entry because it'll be the first monoclonal antibody biosimilar in the EU. The product will be limited to new patients, and we don't think there will necessarily be switching for patients that are controlled. And many of the mechanisms for approval and reimbursement and physician familiarity will take time to build up. If you look at VICTRELIS, as I said, we've seen a slowing of new patient starts. We think there's a couple of reasons for that. The first one is there's a lot of clinical trials that are ongoing, and they're enrolling new patients. The second reason is some of the highest prescribing physicians are at capacity of how many patients they can bring into the office, and they're not expanding their staff. With the economic environment that they're facing, they're not increasing staff to try to bring in more patients. And in addition to that, it's the slower summer months. We don't have any sense at this time that there\u2019s significant warehousing that's taking place.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Gilbert with Merrill Lynch.","Gregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Adam, if you consider the next couple of years, is your sales force size and structure appropriate to launch drugs like Odanacatib and TREDAPTIVE and Suvorexant? And secondly, for Ken, now that the FDA's open for business, at least in theory on biosimilars and in light of your affordability comments, can you share any tangible milestones over the next year or 2 that relate to Merck's biosimilar strategy?","Alex Kelly","Okay. Let's start with Adam.","Adam H. Schechter","So when you look at the products that you mentioned, they're obviously primary care products. So if you look at Odanacatib, if you look at Suvorexant, you look at TREDAPTIVE, the majority of the prescribing occurs in the primary care offices. And we have a significant presence today in every market around the world, including now in markets like China and India and Brazil for primary care. I believe that the sales force that we have in the United States and in Europe is appropriately sized to launch important new products into the primary care setting, and we're going to make sure that we resource in order to be successful with these products. In addition to that, several of these products will take market development work, and we're going to make sure that we invest in order to ensure that we do the right work for market development. So to answer your question, I believe we have the right size of primary care sales forces. We're going to invest in order to be successful with these new product launches, and we feel that we'll be prepared in each of the markets around the world to be ready.","Kenneth C. Frazier","With respect to Merck BioVentures, we've made progress in developing the portfolio of biosimilar targets and securing partnerships to enhance the portfolio and capabilities. As we've said, we also have a number of specific biosimilar molecules in early development. So we continue to look at those. We continue to prioritize those across our portfolio with both biosimilars and novel biologics, but right now, we have nothing more to share on those issues. I would say, again, that the most prominent of the ones that we have are Rituxan and Enbrel.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I have a couple of questions. Ken, first for you, when you look at your R&D expenditures going forward and given that a number of your large outcomes trials are beginning to wind down, do you see an opportunity to bring that level of spend, that roughly $8-ish billion in spend, down on an absolute basis? Should we think about it that way going forward? And secondly, to you, Peter, on the 2012 guidance, if I heard you correctly, it sounds like you are guiding to the lower end of that range, given the worsening in foreign exchange, as well as the gross margin impact from SINGULAIR. And please confirm that, that's correct. And also, I just wanted to make sure we're thinking about the gross margin impact correctly. Can you give us a sense for the magnitude of change over the next several quarters?","Alex Kelly","Okay. Ken, you want to take the start, please?","Peter N. Kellogg","So thanks for your questions, Jami. I think, first of all, as I said in my prepared remarks, we remain committed to R&D. And since 2009, we've reduced our R&D annual spend by about $900 million while continuing to invest in key programs. I think as we move forward, we'll have greater opportunities in terms of improving efficiencies. You're right. The outcome studies will be winding down. But I'm also pleased that the pipeline overall is moving forward. So as I've tried to say from the very beginning, we want to apply very stringent ROI hurdles to the work that we do in R&D, but at the end of the day, R&D spend should be a function of the specific assets that we have at specific stages of development in the pipeline.","Peter N. Kellogg","Jami, this is Peter. I'll take your next question, which is regarding guidance. For 2012, the range that we provided, really, is the right range. I don't know that we are pointing to the bottom end of the range necessarily. Clearly, ForEx is an impact, and so that's what we spend time trying to explain. Obviously, we mentioned the third quarter ForEx is the biggest impact, which all of you know, I'm sure, primarily because the euro was so strong in the third quarter last year. So we're lapping a very strong euro as we go through the third quarter. But there's no further than that. I think on the PGM, it's a good point. Clearly, first of all, I would say that as our PGM has improved, it's been through some productivity gains but also through some very positive mix due to some strong margin products. As SINGULAIR goes off patent, that is a very high PGM product. So I think that's something I would really emphasize. That's a very high one, so it does have an impact on PGM. And I would just additionally reiterate what Adam commented on, which is that SINGULAIR, while it goes off next week practically in the U.S., it also has an expiry in Europe in February of 2013. And that's married up with Maxalt U.S. patent expiry in December of this year and the first TEMADOR generic entry in the U.S. in August of 2013. So all of those are impacts that affect our PGM going forward. So I wouldn't want to be too dire, but I just think if you think about it, these are good PGM products.","Kenneth C. Frazier","Yes. And Jami, maybe I can provide some additional context that will be helpful. As we've thought about the SINGULAIR loss of exclusivity in the United States, we looked at other products where they had multiple generics available right at launch, so things like XALATAN that occurred in 2011. We went back and looked at Ambien and Coreg. And what you see is within 4 weeks, they lose over 80% of their sales. And then within the second month, they lose 90% of their sales. And ultimately, they're to 93%, 94% thereafter. So when you have multiple generic products in the marketplace, you do see very rapid declines. And that, as you\u2019re thinking about modeling, might be helpful.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I had 2 questions, if I might. One is one that you've gotten before, but I think it would be helpful to ask it again and get an update, and that is on the IMPROVE-IT trial. Can you maybe outline your thoughts on what the impact commercially would be to a trial that shows no harm but it also shows no benefit considering that the label doesn't currently claim an outcomes benefit in any way? And also, could you give us an update on the timing for the interim and the final just to make sure we're all straight on that? And then the second is on JANUVIA. You said that the sulfonylurea class still had 37% of patient days. I was wondering if you could give us that same metric for the entire DPP-4 class right now.","Alex Kelly","Ken, do you want to start?","Kenneth C. Frazier","So I'll start. Let me first say that we remain confident in the IMPROVE-IT trial. And we remain confident on the basis of the LDL hypothesis, which I think has been proven over and over again in various studies with various agents and interventions. We announced previously in March 2012 that the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board plan to review data from the study again in approximately 9 months. That review has now been scheduled for March 2013, at which point 9 months of additional data will have been adjudicated. So there's no change to the study, and we are looking forward to getting that data. And we remain confident in these products because we're confident in the LDL hypothesis.","Adam H. Schechter","And a couple of things, first of all, with regard to patient days of therapy for JANUVIA, JANUVIA and the DPP-4s altogether, of which JANUVIA is by far the largest, represents about 8% of the current patient days of therapy. So it's under 10%. That's the equivalent number to the 37% worldwide number I gave you for the sulfonylureas. And with regard to IMPROVE-IT, of course, we looked at all potential outcomes. We believe, as Ken said, that the data supports the LDL cholesterol hypothesis, and therefore, it will be a positive trial. But we'll make sure that we're prepared under any circumstances.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Ken, I was hoping that you could speak to the 2013 revenue outlook. I know that at your analyst meeting in late 2011, I believe that you made a statement with respect to an aspiration for flattish revenues in 2013 or revenues that would be somewhat consistent with those in 2012. Could you just please update us on your outlook for next year?","Kenneth C. Frazier","David, actually, the statement that I made back then was with respect to 2012. And we have not provided any 2013 guidance. We will do that later.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","So just, Ken, can you update us on your comments about delivering a leveraged P&L as we kind of think about the pushes and pulls as we head into the second half of this year and into 2013 historically? You have commented on that, so maybe just update us there. And then second question, with regard to ZOSTAVAX and the demand base performance there, can you just help us understand where that demand is really originating from in terms of the patient pool? Is it really coming from the patients at this point, the over-65 patient population, or the new indication of the over-50 patient population?","Alex Kelly","Ken, you want to start?","Kenneth C. Frazier","Thanks, Seamus. I think what I'd like to say, first of all, is that we've articulated a longer-term goal of driving the top line. And we've invested in the top line both in our products and in our emerging markets in order to do that, but we also have this aspiration of growing the bottom line in a faster fashion. And so that remains our long-term goal. Through the pushes and pulls of patent expiries and everything, there'll be certain periods where things might look a little bit different, but be clear, that's our long-term goal. And we've been able to do that in the first half of 2012.","Adam H. Schechter","Yes. And if you look at ZOSTAVAX, the vast majority, we believe, is coming from patients over the age of 60. And if you look at 2010 data from the CDC, which is the only data that we have right now, they estimated that about 15% of the 60-plus population was vaccinated. If you try to extrapolate based upon the data that was provided then, it might be somewhere around 20% to 25%. So there's still an opportunity to grow. There's over 50 million adults, 60-plus years of age. And 41 million of the adults are between the ages of 50 to 59. So you can see there's still a large group above the age of 60, and that's where the majority, we believe, of sales are coming from right now. And also, we have to wait for the ACIP recommendation in order to be really successful with people below the age of 60.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Skala with Cowen.","Steve Scala - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I have 2 questions. On IMPROVE-IT, the interim look appears to have been delayed from Q4 this year to March of 2013, while the final outcome remains June 2013. I assume the delay is because of insufficient events. But doesn't that raise a concern about the final results? So perhaps you can comment on that. And second, on Odanacatib, what is the European regulatory strategy given that the trial was placebo-controlled?","Kenneth C. Frazier","Thanks, Steve. Again, I want to reiterate, there's been no change with respect to IMPROVE-IT. The move to March 2013 is just a question of the time that it takes to get the data adjudicated after the 9-month look.","Adam H. Schechter","And with regard to Odanacatib, we're still planning to file in the first half of '13 in Europe, and we feel good about that filing. I think we\u2019re also going to have to work very hard on the reimbursement. And I think the fact that 25% of women can't tolerate bisphosphonates is actually going to be helpful for us as we start to think about reimbursement in Europe.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First, can you just remind us on BRIDION in the U.S. what's left and when we'll see the filing? Second, just specifically talk about Latin America and what's going on there. Are there some onetime things happening this year? And will we see growth again in 2013? And then in your prepared remarks, you talked about emerging markets pricing pressure. Can you just go into specifics there?","Peter N. Kellogg","Yes. So just to start with BRIDION, Marc, as Ken mentioned, we do plan to file that in 2012. We're right now working on a study to hopefully satisfy the FDA around bleeding times, and we look forward to completing that this year and filing this year for BRIDION.","Kenneth C. Frazier","And if you look at the U.S. opportunity for BRIDION, we think that it's an important product potentially. There's 30 million surgeries in the U.S. every year. Muscle relaxants are used in about half of those surgeries. So there's also a wide use of agents that BRIDION reverses in the United States. And the majority of surgeries in the United States are reversed. So we think with the way BRIDION works in minutes, providing a quicker turnaround, it could prove to be very helpful. The second question with regard to Latin America, we continue to see strong performance in Latin America. We see good performance in countries like Brazil and Mexico. Merck is now #1 in terms of revenue. And we show good growth, and our evolution index continues to be very strong, meaning that we're growing faster than the overall market in most of the Latin American companies. And then the last question with regard to emerging market pricing pressure, there continues to be pressure in countries like China and in other countries, but what's key is the volume growth. And what we're trying to do is to ensure that there's significant opportunity for our volume to increase much faster than what the price pressure is, and that's how we've been successful, that we're able to really show significant increases in volume that offset the pricing pressures.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.","Charles Anthony Butler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Adam, as you think about reimbursement in the sleep market for Suvorexant, could you please provide us a little color on how that reimbursement actually might be different from, say, a nonsymptomatic area like statins or something like that? And that is to say, does it really matter if you're Tier 2 or even Tier 3 relative to the generics? My second question is, could you provide some color given that SINGULAIR stays on patent in Japan until 2016, what percent of -- or roughly could you say what percent of total SINGULAIR sales are actually in Japan? And then, Ken, sorry, but back to Steve Scala's question on IMPROVE-IT, have previous interim looks included adjudication?","Adam H. Schechter","So let me start with SINGULAIR outside of Europe and the United States. It represented in 2011 about $1.1 billion of sales and was growing in the single digits. So we think there's continued opportunity in Japan and the emerging markets for SINGULAIR as we move forward. If you think about the sleep market, it is going to be very a different way to think about reimbursement. And I think with generic availability, it could end up in Tier 2 or Tier 3. The key, we\u2019d try to get unrestricted access even if it is in Tier 3. People are switching in this market all the time. They're looking for the next agent, and they're willing to pay out a pocket for a good product that can help them sleep. So this is different potentially than other classes such as JANUVIA or the statin market where it was critical to be in the highest tier possible. If you look, branded drugs like LUNESTA and Ambien, they have over $1 billion in sales, and that's despite current generics, and most of their business is in Tier 3 today.","Kenneth C. Frazier","Okay. And Steve, just on the -- Tony, I'm sorry, just on the IMPROVE-IT question, it's a good question. I haven't actually considered that question before, but I would venture to say that they do try to adjudicate the data as they're doing their interim looks before reaching a conclusion. But as I said, that's not a question that I\u2019ve contemplated before.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just 3 questions here. First, Odanacatib, the bisphosphonate market, obviously, has declined significantly, continues to decline. How are you thinking about going about rebuilding the oral osteoporosis market? And do the current market dynamics imply a relatively slow ramp for Odanacatib once it's approved? Second, anacetrapib, can you just update us on when we're going to see the DEFINE extension data and any updates on the REVEAL trial enrollment? And then finally, the recent Amylin deal, Merck was reported to be looking at the asset. Just more broadly speaking, can you talk about Merck's interest at looking at commercial-stage assets such as this versus earlier-stage compounds? And maybe can you just also talk about your interest in expanding your diabetes platform as a whole, what are kind of your priorities here?","Alex Kelly","Ken, you want to start?","Kenneth C. Frazier","Yes, let me start with Odanacatib. And as I said a little bit before, and I'll give you additional context, we have great reads into majority of the prescribers for osteoporosis markets. And the good news is we know this market very well. There's no doubt that there's a decline in the bisphosphonate class. There's no doubt that there's patient dissatisfaction right now. We will have to invest in order to do market development. We're going to have to really explain the new mechanism of action of Odanacatib and have prescribers and payers understand the relevance of a new mechanism in this class. And we will make sure that we have the right resources behind it to do the right market development work and to be prepared to launch.","Alex Kelly","So on the questions about the DEFINE extension, I think that, that data could mature sometime in 2013. And there's really \u2013 the REVEAL trial is ongoing, and there's really no new updates on the REVEAL trial at this time.","Kenneth C. Frazier","And regarding Amylin, we don't comment on particular business deals. I will say that as we look out at the marketplace today, we continue to say that there are opportunities to access the kind of external research that will complement our internal efforts in the key therapeutic areas that we want to be leaders in. And we will continue to look at all of those opportunities, again, with the lens of how important is this to build on our current position in the marketplace but also coupled with financial discipline in terms of our ability to access that technology on terms that will allow us to create shareholder value.","Adam H. Schechter","And if you look at the diabetes franchise, we continue to divest -- or invest in DPP-4. We have MK-3102, which is our once-weekly molecule. We are looking longer term at mechanisms like GPR40. And then we're also very excited about SmartCells, which is the glucose-responsive insulin program, although it's in early stages. So we continue to take a look to make sure we're successful in the diabetes area for some time to come.","Alex Kelly","So also, Chris, let me just point out on the DEFINE extension trial, I need to correct myself. I said 2000 -- sometime next year. ClinicalTrials.gov actually lists this trial as finishing in early part of 2014.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Barbara Ryan with Deutsche Bank.","Barbara A. Ryan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Most of them have been asked, but maybe just based on the comments that you made in the press release with filing TREDAPTIVE by the end of 2013, I'm assuming we're still on track for the HPS2-THRIVE study to complete in the first half. And then, Peter, if you could just give us an update on share repurchase in the quarter.","Kenneth C. Frazier","Yes, we're still very much on track for HPS2-THRIVE. We'll probably get that data at the end of the year, by the end of the year. And we're looking forward to a filing in 2013.","Peter N. Kellogg","Barbara, it's Peter. Yes, we were very active in the second quarter with share repurchase. We actually had more activity than we had in the first quarter. So a good volume of share repurchase activity. When you see the share count outstanding, we do have -- because our stock price has performed well, we actually have more shares coming in through the stock option program. So it has offset some of the impact of that share repurchase activity. But we continue to see an opportunity with share repurchase. I think in the second quarter, the neighborhood was about $500 million in share repurchases.","Kenneth C. Frazier","Okay. Let me just make a couple of comments in closing since I know we're at the end of our hour. First of all, again, thank you for joining us. This was a good quarter. I think we feel it's indicative of our ability to execute going forward. We continue to focus, though, on building a foundation for long-term growth, which is based on strong operating performance but also significantly on R&D progression. And we continue to see Merck as having a great opportunity going forward to drive shareholder value. So thank you for joining us.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Teri Loxam. Please go ahead.","Teri Loxam ","Thank you, Doherty, and good morning. Welcome to Merck's Second Quarter 2018 Conference Call. Today, I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; Adam Schechter, President of Global Human Health; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Labs.","Before I turn the call over to Ken, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results, such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation of these in our press release. We have also provided a table in our press release to help you understand the sales in the quarter for the business units and products.","I would like to remind you that some of the statements that we make during today's call maybe considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.","Our SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2017 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements. You can see our SEC filings as well as today's earnings release on merck.com.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken.","Ken Frazier","Thank you, Teri. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. During the second quarter, Merck delivered strong growth. We also further advanced our leadership in oncology through focused commercial execution, the achievement of important regulatory milestones and the presentation of clinical data at ASCO for KEYTRUDA, Lynparza and LENVIMA.","Following the unprecedented results in first-line non-small cell lung cancer presented at AACR, we followed up with similarly impressive data at ASCO. This included more than 140 abstracts across 25 tumor types, which is a substantial increase from just five years ago when we\u2019ve presented the first clinical data for KEYTRUDA, a single abstract for advanced melanoma. KEYTRUDA is becoming foundational for the treatment of cancer and adding Lynparza and LENVIMA as well as our other oncology assets in the pipeline, and we believe that Merck\u2019s oncology portfolio has the breadth and depth to further expand our leadership position.","Our vaccines business is also an important growth driver. We are pleased to see the growing momentum of our HPV vaccination worldwide. The WHO Director General recently called for all countries to take action to help eliminate cervical cancer, which is predominantly caused by HPV. We've seen several countries offer expanded recommendations and we recently gained approval for GARDASIL in China, all of which contributes to our long-term confidence in this brand.","Briefly turning to Animal Health. This business continues to deliver strong results growing faster than Human Health. In addition to our global scale and the synergies we gained from sharing innovations across the two businesses, it also diversifies our portfolio and is a key pillar of our long-term growth strategy.","Delivering innovative products is at the core of who we are as a company. We will continue to augment our animal and human health pipelines through internal investments as well as externally through business development. As our results have demonstrated so far this year, we have good momentum and we are focused on continuing to execute across our business to drive growth and create long-term shareholder value.","With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Rob Davis, who go through our results in more detail. Rob?","Rob Davis ","Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Please note that my comments today will be based on a non-GAAP earnings basis. In the second quarter, we deliver strong performance in both are Human and Animal Health businesses, resulting in meaningful revenue and EPS growth. Total company revenues were $10.5 billion, an increase the 5% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of exchange, second quarter revenues grew 4%. Our Human Health business grew 3% excluding exchange, and Adam will provide more color on those results in a moment.","Animal Health sales totaled $1.1 billion in the quarter, an increase of 14%. Excluding the impact of exchange, sale grew 12%, with livestock sales growing 7% and Companion Animal sales growing 19%. Animal Health segment profits were $450 million in the second quarter, an increase of 14% compared to the prior year or 10% excluding exchange.","Turning to the expense lines. Gross margin was 74.4% in the quarter, a decrease of 290 basis points versus the second quarter of 2017. The decrease reflects increased amortization including a sizable catchup adjustment for an accrued sales milestone related to Adempas. In addition, gross margin was impacted by unfavorable manufacturing variances, partly due to last year's cyber event as well as FX. ","Operating expenses were $4.4 billion, increased 4% year-over-year, including a negative two percentage point impact from foreign exchange. The increase was driven by our continued investment in R&D, primarily for the clinical development of Lynparza and LENVIMA, as well as for early development efforts. The tax rates was 17.9% in the second quarter, reflecting the benefit of tax reform. Pasting together, we earned $1.06 per share, an increase the 6%, excluding exchange.","Turning to the outlook for the year. Based on continued operational strength, we are narrowing our revenue guidance range and narrowing and raising our EPS guidance range for 2018, despite a less favorable exchange environment versus our prior expectations in May. For the full year, we now expect revenues to be between $42 billion and $42.8 billion, including a slightly positive impact from foreign currency at mid-July rates. We anticipate our gross margin will now be lower year-over-year by approximately 1 percentage point with the slight change primarily being driven by the Adempas milestone related amortization this quarter.","We continue to expect OpEx to increase year-over-year by low to mid-single digits. We have slightly lowered our tax rate assumption and now expect it to be between 18.5% and 19.5%. We continue to anticipate approximately $2.7 billion in average shares -- or 2.7 billion shares outstanding as of the end of the year. Taken together, we now expect EPS to be between $4.22 and $4.30, including a roughly 1 percentage point negative impact from foreign currency at mid-July rates.","In summary, we continue to execute well on our strategy driving top and bottom line performance. Re-allocating resources to effectively support our commercial opportunities in the near term, we\u2019re making the necessary investments in R&D to support long-term growth.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Adam to provide more detail on our Human Health business. Adam?","Adam Schechter","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. This morning I\u2019ll provide highlights in the performance of Global Human Health for the second quarter of 2018. My comments will be on a constant currency basis.","Global Human Health sales grew 3% to $9.3 billion. Consistent with last quarter, our key growth drivers including KEYTRUDA, GARDASIL and BRIDION performed very well. Roughly 60% of our sales were from outside of the U.S. and grew 8%, highlighting of our global commercial presence and solid execution around the world. ","I\u2019ll now focus on a few of our key franchises, and I\u2019ll start with oncology. Our oncology business is benefiting from a rapid worldwide uptake of KEYTRUDA, Lynparza and LENVIMA. KEYTRUDA with global sales of nearly $1.7 billion is now approved in 12 indications across 8 tumor types in the U.S. and similarly approved a multiple indications across tumor types in countries around the world. We believe our breath of current indications, with significant opportunities yet to come, will be a competitive advantage and will help us continue to be a leader in this field for many years.","In the United States, KEYTRUDA means the leading immunotherapy in new patient starts. We\u2019re looking at all indications combined. Sales this quarter benefited from accelerated adoption in metastatic lung cancer as well as growth in bladder and MSI high cancers. In patients diagnosed with non-squamous first-line lung cancer, the significant survival benefits demonstrated in KEYNOTE-189 is resulting in sharply broader use of KEYTRUDA in combination chemotherapy. Physicians now clearly see the benefit of using this combination across all of their first-line patients, regardless of PD-L1 expression. We are currently capturing roughly two-thirds of new patient starts, excluding EGFR and ALK, approximately 20 share points higher than prior to AACR. We expect continued substantial adoption of this indication in the second half of 2018 and beyond. ","In addition, the strong survival benefits in patients with squamous non-small cell lung cancer from KEYNOTE-407 to enable us to become standard of care in this population, which represents roughly 20% of the market. With the strength shown in our clinical program, KEYTRUDA indication should be able to represent roughly 80% of all non-small cell lung cancer patients within its overall survival benefit, which is the gold standard. ","Outside the U.S., we're seeing significant growth of KEYTRUDA and now represents over 40% of total sales. We are seeing strong uptake in first-line lung, and we have secured reimbursement in most major markets worldwide for our monotherapy indications. Sales also continued to grow in melanoma, head and neck and bladder cancers. We continued to be very confident in the near- and long-term growth prospects of KEYTRUDA, driven by continued penetration of approved indications as well as the potential from many additional indications in the future. The potential benefit of KEYTRUDA in patients with breast, gastric, hepatocellular, renal, head and neck and other, including various adjuvant-stage cancers, are exciting opportunities for us. ","Now turning to Lymparza, which we\u2019re co-commercializing and co-developing with AstraZeneca. Oncology business benefitted from the strong performance of Lymparza, which leads the PARP inhibitor class in both new and total prescriptions. U.S. sales grew significantly, driven by continued growth in ovarian cancer as well as the strong launch in the new breast cancer indication. ","Ex-U.S. sales benefited from the recent launch in ovarian cancer in Japan. Going forward, we expect the recent breast cancer approval in Japan and expectations for an ovarian cancer approval in China to continue to enable strong growth.","Our partnership with Eisai for LENVIMA is also up to advanced fast start. In the United States, our sales representatives started promoting LENVIMA in renal cell carcinoma in June, and we look forward to the potential hepatocellular carcinoma approval this quarter within August 24 FDUFA date. Over the next six months, we'll begin promoting LENVIMA in many key countries in both Europe and Asia-Pacific. So as you can see we are very confident about our future growth of Lymparza and LENVIMA, both as a monotherapy and in combination with other agents. ","Now moving to vaccines, which represents another key pillar of growth. Global vaccines grew 7% and exceed $1.5 billion this quarter, led by GARDASIL, which remains in very high demand. The transition to two dose regimen in the U.S. is nearly complete, and we continue to see strong underlying demand. Outside of the U.S., growth remains very strong as the benefit of HPV vaccination continue to become more broadly understood by healthcare systems worldwide. In addition, uptick in China has been particularly robust following a launch there. We're excited about the FDA acceptance of our SPLA for the use of GARDASIL in women and men ages 27 to 45 and believe GARDASIL will remains a significant growth opportunity moving forward. ","Now moving to diabetes. Our diabetes franchise continues to be relatively stable. Global sales were nearly $1.6 billion, flat with year ago levels. Trends worldwide remained largely consistent with strong demand-driven growth ex-U.S. markets being largely offset by continued pricing pressure in the U.S.","Lastly, in our hospital specialty portfolio, PBM report another very strong quarter of growth both in the U.S. and worldwide. The neuromuscular blockade market continues to grow because of increases in robotic and minimally invasive surgical procedures. And PBM continues to gain market share as a reversal agent of choice. We recently launched PBM in China and believe our prospects for growth both in the U.S. and ex-U.S. remains strong. In total, we are pleased by performance of our global Human Health business this quarter and we're very optimistic about our future potential, driven by our key growth areas including oncology, vaccines and hospital specialty. ","With that, I'll turn it over to Roger.","Dr. Roger Perlmutter ","Thanks, Adam. During the second quarter, we had the opportunity to present important data related to our programs in oncology and infectious diseases at multiple scientific meetings and we advanced many of our key programs. Looking first at KEYTRUDA. Since our last earnings call, we gave US registration for the treatment of relapsed for refractory mediastinal and B-cell lymphoma and for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer in women whose tumors expressed PDL1, that is with CPS greater than or equal to one. In all, the FDA has now granted approval for the use of KEYTRUDA in 12 different indications, standing eight different tumor types and the broader categories for the patients whose tumors demonstrate microsatellite instability. Also during the second quarter, the FDA granted priority review to our sBLA submission for the use of KEYTRUDA in the treatment of patients with advanced metastatic carcinoma for the PDUFA date of November 9 and for the use of KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy or the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma of the lung for the PDUFA date of October 30. The latter submission was based on our recently completed KEYNOTE-407 study, results of which were presented at the American Society for Clinical Oncology or ASCO meeting in June. Now these data were described by the ASCO commentator as representing a new standard of care for patients suffering from advanced renal cell carcinoma to lung.","Similarly, the results of KEYNOTE-189 study, which tested the utility of KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy and patience receiving first-line treatment for non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer were incorporated into a supplementary sBLA that was accepted for priority review for the PDUFA date of September 23 by the FDA earlier in the quarter. Data supporting the filing showed a greater than 50% improvement in overall survival in patients receiving simultaneous KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy as compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone.","Separately our supplementary BLA for the use of KEYTRUDA in the adjutant treatment of patients undergoing definitive surgical resection of cutaneous melanoma was also accepted by the FDA with an action date of February 16, 2019. Outside of the United States, yesterday we announced that KEYTRUDA was approved in China for the second-line treatment of unresectable or advanced melanoma, with first approval of our PD-1 therapies for melanoma in China.","These numerous approvals and filings are really just the beginning of what will be a very robust period of evaluation for KEYTRUDA in both combination therapy and normal therapy settings. At the ASCO meeting in June, my colleagues presented more than 100 abstracts related KEYTRUDA alone. Many of these represented progress reports that we expect will yield data support of its registration in the not too distant future, including for the treatment of small cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma. At some greater remove, we expect that data will also merge support in the use of KEYTRUDA in the treatment of breast cancer and prostate cancer. ","Beyond KEYTRUDA, very substantial progress is made in our other oncology programs. With our colleagues at AstraZeneca, we achieved registration for the use of Lynparza tablets in the maintenance treatment of platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer in the European Union and then the treatment of BRCA-mutated HER2-negative breast cancer in Japan.","Our join efforts on LENVIMA with colleagues at Eisai also yielded in important regulatory actions. The approval of this multi-kinase inhibitor for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma in Japan, LENVIMA is under review for the same education in United States. Progress is continued in other areas as well. Earlier this week, at the 22nd International AIDS Conference in Amsterdam, we presented 96-week data from our DRIVE-FORWARD Study of Doravirine, our investigational non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor used in combination with other antiretroviral agency in treatment-naive HIV-infected patients, doing long-term suppression of HIV borrowed burden with this new age.","Doravirine, both as a single agent and as a combination single tablet regimen, is currently under review at the FDA with an action date of October 23. We\u2019re also setting Doravirine in combination with MK-8591, our first-in-class nucleoside derivative that durably blocks both reverse transcriptase translocation as well as polymerase activity. Data from this Phase II study will become available later this year.","Also in the infectious disease arena, as Adam mentioned, the FDA has accepted supplementary BLA and granted priority review for the use of GARDASIL in women and men ages 27 to 45 with an action date of October 6. Early in the quarter, we announced that GARDASIL 9 is approved in China for use in girls and women 16 to 26 years old. We see these new regulatory actions as emblematic of an increased focus on the impact of Human Papillomavirus-induced diseases, especially cervical cancer.","At the ASCO meeting in June, Doug Lowy of the National Cancer Institute, who shared last year\u2019s at Alaska award for his studies of HPV median diseases both persuasively about the importance of mounting worldwide immunization campaigns against HPV and both the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute in the United States. Their designated cancer centers have endorsed the goal of eliminating cancers caused by HPV through effective gender-neutral vaccination of adolescence. GARDASIL and especially GARDASIL 9 will play a pivotal role in these worldwide efforts.","We have many other important vaccine initiatives underway, including V114, our 15 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine currently under investigation and Phase III trials; and V160, our novel vaccine for the prevention of primary CMV infection in healthy seronegative women, which is currently being evaluated a large Phase II study.","But today, I wish to pay tribute to the many dedicated healthcare workers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and especially the Congolese Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization for the successful containment of the recent Ebola virus disease upgrades in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. My colleagues at Merck Research Laboratories works tirelessly to supply nearly 13,000 doses of our investigational V920 vaccine, which we previously demonstrated have protective activity in the 2014-2015 Ebola disease upgrade to any, these data will publish as part of the Ebola \u00c7a Suffit! trial in the Lancet in 2017. This permitted vaccination in healthcare workers and people at high risks contracting the Ebola virus disease during this most recent outbreak. We\u2019ve proud to have been able to contribute to this effort and are continuing to make rapid progress towards the registration of V920, which has been described as a game-changer in this control of Ebola virus infection. ","I will now turn the call back over to Teri. ","Teri Loxam","Thanks, Roger. Doherty, we\u2019ll move on the question-and-answer session. I'd like to remind everyone on the phone to try to limit your questions to a maximum of two or one question with two parts so that we can try to get as many people on as possible. So, Doherty, if we can move on please?","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. ","Steve Scala","Thank you very much. Roger, what is Merck's strategy in Stage III unresectable lung cancer where Astra has done well with Pacific. At the ASCO meeting, you were asked the question but not answer suggesting that Merck is pursuing approval perhaps on its single-arm trial. So I'm wondering if you can update us there. And secondly, Adam, could you provide us KEYTRUDA's market share by tumor type in the U.S. and EU? Thank you very much. ","Roger Perlmutter","Yeah, Steve. The specific registrational strategy, we were pursuing different aspects of lung cancer approval is not something that we generate comment on. Suffice it to say that we do have some data available in advanced cancer, non-resectable cancer that is non-metastatic. And we expect that there will be additional data that will come forward in the months and years ahead that will permit a specific indication, but we're not commenting on the regulatory strategy. ","Adam Schechter","Hi, Steve. I hope all is going well. Just with regard to your question, I'll give you a rough estimate as you know the data is not perfect in this area. But if you start with the U.S., the rough estimate is about 60% to 65% is in lung, about 15% melanoma, about 5% in bladder, about 5% in MSI High and then the rest is in all other indications. And then if you look at Europe, the data is even harder to get exact numbers on. What I would say is if you look at Europe and Japan, lung is the majority of revenue; and then followed by melanoma, which is the second largest contributor; and then all the other tumor types like head and neck, and bladder, are the rest of the numbers in there. But it's clearly lung followed by melanoma and then all others. ","Teri Loxam","Thanks. We'll move on to the next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Baum with Citi. ","Andrew Baum","Thank you. A question for Adam and then one for Roger. So I guess you might have seen this coming. Could you comment on the puzzles that have been made by HHF, the White House, to either remove or significantly amend the \u2013 structure by taking way the Lymparza. In particular, could you comment on your understanding of under the rages whether this has been it's just a federal plans or do you believe that there could be direct or indirect impact on commercial book of business either through the action of administration or more likely to the PBM\u2019s activity down? And then separately, potential timing whether we should expect something for this 12 months now, but do you think there is any possibility that could happen faster than that. So I know there is lot of uncertainty there, but anything you could add would be helpful?","And then to Roger. As far as I can see, the anticipation of expansion of the -- trial that was spoke about previously hasn't happened yet, unless I\u2019ve missed them. So I was wondering whether this is just the challenges of dealing with a partner company rather than your own internal assets or whether it's being compounded by the departure of some of your senior employees meeting for your resource constraints.","Adam Schechter","Well, thank you, Andrew. Let me start with your first question about the proposal to remove the Safe Harbor for rebates plans and PBMs. So I have to start by saying it's rather difficult to comment on specifics at this point. As you know there's so many different proposals being considered to address the high out-of-pocket cost or drugs to patients, what I would say as we will work with the administration and the Congress to help find appropriate solutions to these issues. We do think it's important to make sure that patients to have meaningful access and lowering out-of-pockets across the patients is something that we're strongly and support of. ","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","And Andrew, with respect to the expansion of the olaparib trial, well as you know and as I\u2019ve described we've done quite a lot with Lynparza since the partnership with AstraZeneca plus consummate. We have a lot of new studies that we've gone through and it's taken a little bit longer than we wanted to for the two organizations to come together and agree on exactly what we should study and where we should study it. But you'll be seeing a lot of those trials grow a lot very soon in response to your question. It is not because we are in any way constrained by personnel and we have our clinical team is really firing in all cylinders, no doubt. ","Teri Loxam","Thanks for your question, Andrew. Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from a line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin","Thank you. I have a couple of questions. First, just wondering, Ken and Rob, if you're comfortable with the way the Street is thinking about the cadence of KEYTRUDA uptake, given the stickiness in the second-line lung market as reported by Russell Myers, we really have yet to see an inflection point in KEYTRUDA. Yes, it's doing well, but we haven't really seen a meaningful impact from KEYNOTE-189. And even more importantly, when do you expect to see the operating margin pull-through from KEYTRUDA. Even this quarter if you adjust to the Adempas milestone, operating margins are below where they were a year ago despite KEYTRUDA sales up over $800 million. So -- I mean are we thinking about operating margins correctly? Should they go up? And when do they go up?","And then, Ken, for you a question on Animal Health. We heard you loud and clear in your opening comments, fully committed to Animal Health toward your growth, et cetera, et cetera. But I'm sure you've noticed outside of Merck this wave of corporate simplification that is going across the industry. We've seen it with Lilly, with Novartis, et cetera, et cetera. Investors are rewarding companies that are unlocking values through spinning off assets, such as animal health. And I'm sure you've also noticed the big difference in valuation between Merck\u2019s and so other. So while we understand that\u2019s an important growth driver, I think if a company is fully committed to KEYTRUDA and confident in KEYTRUDA and that business, I'm not sure I understand why this deigning on Animal House? So if you could address those two questions, I'd appreciate it. Thanks.","Teri Loxam","Thanks, Jami. So we'll start with Adam talk about the commercial uptake of KEYTRUDA, then go to Rob for the operating margins and then follow-up with Ken on Animal Health.","Adam Schechter","Yeah. Hi, Jamie. So it's our first reward, we're very pleased with the performance of KEYTRUDA. And if you look at the sales for the first half of '18, it's doubled versus the first half of 2017. And we\u2019ve seen robust growth sequentially every single quarter since launch both in the U.S. and outside the US. And I think people sometimes don\u2019t recognize is the fact that 40%, more than 40% of our sales are outside the U.S. And we\u2019ve only launched the immunotherapy there. We have not yet launched the combination therapy. But I can tell you the feedback on the chemo combo in the U.S. use has been very well received. And as I mentioned, about two-thirds of new patients are now starting on KEYTRUDA, when you exclude EGFR and ALK, and that\u2019s a 20 points share increase since AACR. I\u2019ve always said this is not going to be a big bolus of patients because these are patients coming into the market as are diagnosed each and every day and month. But as you continue to grow new patients share, those patients become part of the RF base and that represents a very large opportunity for growth for us for moving forward. And in addition to that, we\u2019ve done really well with had head and neck, bladder and MSI-high, and we\u2019re looking forward to all patients that Roger has spoken about.","Rob Davis","Good morning, Jami. And to your question about operating margin, obviously as we look at the profile of the company, I think we\u2019ve been fairly consistent with this. Clearly, as we look to long term, we intend and expect to see both the leverage P&L and operating margin expansion over time. But as we\u2019ve said previously, in the near term, as we look at 2018, we are continuing through a period of pretty meaningful investment both in the ongoing clinical studies for KEYTRUDA, but as you saw this quarter, we\u2019re now starting to see the clinical studies for Lynparza and LENVIMA also start to pick up and that is driving a lot of the growth in R&D you\u2019re seeing the quarter as well as continue to advance several programs through our vaccines portfolio. So obviously we\u2019re very cognizant of the need to get operating leverage and to margin expansion, but we also want to make sure we\u2019re making appropriate investments for the long term. And so you\u2019re probably not going to see that type of expansion you\u2019re looking for until we get through this bolus spend over the next year or so. And then on the gross margin line, you mentioned Adempas. Recall that as we came into the quarter, we did expect -- or into the year actually, we did expect to see a slight decline in our gross margins year-on-year. This is really due to the fact that we did have coming into the year of the expectation of larger negative manufacturing variances. Part of that was due to the carryover effect of cyber and part of it is due to the fact that a few years ago we actually benefited quite a bit from the start-up of commercialization of KEYTRUDA that brought with us very positive one-time manufacturing variances as we converted from our pilot plans to our commercial plans. So you are seeing that happening through the gross margin line. As we\u2019ve said in the past, well, we\u2019re not getting specific guidance on gross margin as you look forward long term. We do see both the tailwinds of margin expansion from important products like the KEYTRUDA, BRIDION other new products launching, which are margin-positive, being offset by the LOEs, ZETIA being an important one had a very high margin, and then products like ZEPATIER coming down, which also had a high margin. So those headwinds and tailwinds are largely offsetting. And as we look forward, whether or not we end up with a slightly higher margin or slightly lower margin will really depend on how product mix and currency play themselves through as we look forward. So that hopefully gives you a sense of what\u2019s happening both of the gross and operating margin line. ","Ken Frazier","And, Jami, thanks for your question about Animal Health. Let me start by letting you know and showing you that we consistently reevaluate our corporate portfolio in light of various facts, including the environment, to determine how we can generate the highest value for our shareholders over the long term. You mentioned the growth impact that we talked about earlier in the call of animal health. In addition to growth, we believe our Animal health business provides us diversification from KEYTRUDA in the rest of our human health portfolio. And we also think it's important to note the important synergies of having animal and human health together within Merck. We\u2019ll point out though our animal health business is growing more quickly than its industry peers and a great deal of that has to do with the fact that we are able to achieve synergies between our animal health R&D and our human health R&D. For example, we have innovative protein and vaccine technology that is shared across that portfolio. Animal health have access to our human health catalog, which has led to innovations on the animal health side. Right now they're investigating oncology and diabetes where our companion animals, and their other examples of human health leveraging discovery from animal health as well. So we see all of those reasons, as we sit here today, we see animal health still fitting with our strategy intent and our intrinsic capabilities as a research-based pharmaceutical company, and we believe these synergies will help our animal health business grow faster in its market and will also have an impact on overall Merck. ","Teri Loxam","Great. Thanks for your question, Jami. We'll move on to the next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. ","Christopher Schott ","Great. Thanks very much for the questions. Just had two here. Maybe first on KEYTRUDA. Where do you think penetration rates can go for PD-1s in frontline lung when we think about those non-AL to non-EGFR patients? As you mentioned, you're right now at two-thirds of new starts. Where is that go over sight? It now go to 75% at 85%, just any color there would be appreciated?","My second quarter, GARDASIL. You got $2.4 billion or $2.5 billion kind of run-rate business now. You\u2019re talking about significant growth. I guess my question here is how much larger could this product to be overtime. I mean as part of that whether you think as growth markets how quickly can you hit to those markets. And just a little bit there we\u2019re trying to get our hands on how we should think about the ramp of the product from here. Thank you so much. ","Adam Schechter","Hi, Chris. This is Adam. First of all, with regard to KEYTRUDA penetration rates in first-line lung, a couple of things to note. First of all the two-thirds and 20 share point increase have happened very quickly and we believe that there is still substantial opportunity for that to grow even further. And as I mentioned that if you exclude ALK and EGFR, we now have survival benefits in 80% of the markets. So we believe that we continue to see good growth. Outside the U.S., the opportunity remains very big because we've only launched for monotherapy, we have not yet launched the chemo combo therapy and some other data. So I think the growth opportunity there remains significant. So there is no doubt that our lung indication will continue to be a good driver of growth for us in the future, but as I said before, all the new indications that we're expecting and some of those to be rather large, we're excited about the potential future opportunity. And the two-thirds as I talked about, new patients, those are patients that are just been diagnosed coming into the market. So I do believe that there is significant opportunity there moving forward. ","With regard to GARDASIL, there is opportunity frankly globally. In the United States, there still opportunity to increase vaccination rates in 11-12 years old but also in the 19 to 26 years old. I also believe the opportunity for the 27 to 46-year olds, as we discussed with that indication, will represent another very important opportunity for us in the United States. Outside the United States, there is opportunity in new geographies, and China is an exemplar of that. And the uptake in China continues to be very strong. And then with new data that's been introduced in countries like Australia, there really is a lot of talk about elimination campaigns in markets around the world. So I believe that the opportunity for GARDASIL in the short term and long term for growth remains very significant.","Teri Loxam","Thanks for your questions, Chris. Move on to the next one please. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.","Vamil Divan","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just following up on Christopher. Just think I forgot that 80% of overall survival benefit now of the frontline market in the lung cancer. I guess what is a reasonable sort of penetration rate do you think? If we look out, say, 12 to 18 months, I think from the comments from Bristol yesterday suggests maybe the penetration will be as high as people think. So maybe you can just give your sense of out of that 80%, what would you be satisfied with it? We looked at 12 to 18 months in terms of how much KEYTRUDA alone or maybe PD-1, PD-L1 combined can penetrate?","And then my second question is more for Ken and is on the business development on a presuming that remains a priority. I think investors maybe have been a little bit surprised that I've been more active. You've done some of these collaborations, which I think might be a little bit appreciated. But just in terms of business development as you look out now, thoughts around maybe a larger deal or any change in your perspective on the focus on innovation and being the commentary about what's held you back and but all my change and getting more rest of going forward? Thanks.","Adam Schechter","So this is Adam. So we're currently capturing, as I said, roughly two-thirds of the new patient starts when you said EGFR and ALK. I also said that\u2019s about a 20 share point higher increase than what we had prior to AACR. But I would expect continued substantial adoption is indicating as we go through the rest of this year. So I do believe it will continue to grow. Also, if you look at patients with squamous non-small cell lung cancer from KEYNOTE-407, that should enable us to become the standard of care in this population as well, and that's about 20% of the market. So again, with strength that we've seen in the clinical program or indications to be able to represent about 80% of all non-small cell lung cancer patients with overall survival. And overall survival is the gold standard. So that's why I believe there's still significant opportunity there","Ken Frazier","And on business development, I'd start by again reinforces how important that priority is for the company, and we are actively looking for the best opportunities across all kinds of structures, including acquisitions and partnerships, collaboration and licensing. And with respect to acquisitions, over the past couple years, as I said previously, we can't looked at some that didn't can out either because of the target was just not a willing seller. Well, because it was for kind of competition for the asset that made the price untenable based on our assumptions. I think, as you\u2019ve seen, there has also been generally a terrific of M&A across the industry recently. There's been significant funding flowing in the small biotech, including the IPO, which are at multiyear highs. So as a result, biotechs have access to ample capital and they have perhaps less need or desire to sell right now and the deals that are getting done are being done at very high prices and premium. But I want to assure you that augmenting our pipeline to business development nevertheless remains an important priority. So we'll continue to scour the landscape carefully. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger","So I have two questions. First, when do you expect to provide more clarity on the longer-term outlook? And I guess that that includes the early- to mid-stage pipeline and the financial prospects beyond 2018. And then second. With respect to GARDASIL, could you just discuss the things that are holding it back right now supply sort of shortages. I\u2019m assuming the 3 to 2 dose conversion is over. And then finally, and I\u2019m sorry for all the questions, but just China, could you comment on net pricing there versus the U.S.? Thank you.","Adam Schechter","David, I\u2019ll take your first question, which has to do with explaining or helping people to understand a longer term prospect. So we continue to evaluate the best way to do that, including perhaps the possibility of giving longer term guidance as we appreciate the desire investors for additional insights into our own internal expectations. Obviously we want investors to understand why we\u2019re so confident in our long-term prospect. So that they continue to evaluate Merck versus other investments, they can do that. I will say that we are thinking about the best way to do that, and we will get back to you in that regard.","Ken Frazier","And with regard to GARDASIL. Again, we remain optimistic about the long-term growth opportunity there. We\u2019re still in the beginning, frankly at the launch in China and we\u2019re excited about that opportunity. Regarding the U.S., the transition to the 2-dose regimen is nearly completed. It\u2019s not entirely complete, so we are overlapping the vast majority of that change. So I think we\u2019ll start to see some growth there as we finalize the 2-dose transition. And then lastly, I would say that and showing that we\u2019ve got the right amount of products in the right parts of the world will always be something that we\u2019re going to be working on. And frankly, the update in China has been larger than what we would have initially anticipated, and we\u2019re still trying to ensure that we understand what the demand there, because this is such a large opportunity. There are so many people there that we\u2019ve got to understand how much product will need to get into that country.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert","I want to start with Roger. The pneumococcal vaccine front, obviously, the stakes are pretty huge, albeit a few years out from things changing. But it appears that you could leapfrog Pfizer in a few years and then possibly get re-leapfrogged by them with their 20-valent product. Obviously the studies have to be done. But can you shed some light on your views on how that space will evolve and any other nuances we should be aware of in terms of the potential for differentiation other than sort of whose is bigger than whose? And then, Adam, can you talk about the commercial opportunity for Duravarin? It seems to be something where there\u2019s a disconnect between them the company\u2019s enthusiasm the Streets focus? Thanks.","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","Well, thanks, Gregg. On pneumococcal vaccine. Clearly, I think this is an area where we\u2019ve been very active for a long time. With PNEUMOVAX, we have a lot of understanding of the marketplace and the needs in terms of invasive pneumococcal disease continue to evolve because of the availability of vaccines, particularly in the younger susceptible population. So as new vaccines are introduced, there are changes in the epidemiology of pneumococcal serotypes, which we follow quite closely. My expectation is that there will be need in the marketplace for multiple \u2013 vaccines to lead advanced chemo moving forward but advancing \u2013 there will be other things that will be coming forward. There will be others in the marketplace. Obviously our colleagues and competitors advisor are hard at work in these two. And we'll see how it plays out, but I think there is clear need for many vaccines in this extremely important area given the bread of the -- disease and its impact on human population. ","Adam Schechter","And with regard to doravirine, it's important to have options outside the integration inhibitor class and that is the most frequently described class at the moment. But RKI based regimens are one of the most commonly used treatment regimens in a wholly lung patient populations. And if you look at the -- profile it would improve on some of the limitations with the NNRTI class more favorable CNS side effect profile and they're put it back. But I look at it more as a bridge and so we've to continue to build on our legacy in HIV upgrades to that product that Roger talked about which is the MKE --1 novel product. So I would look at it as a near term way for us to continue to be relevant in the market but a real growth opportunity as we bridge into the future with our pipeline. ","Teri Loxam","Thanks for the question. We'll move on to the next?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Omar Saad with Evercore.","Omar Saad","Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. I wanted to focus on KEYTRUDA and maybe start off a little broader and perhaps a bit more specific. So first on KEYTRUDA experience to-date across all the indications that you have commercially, my question is how does the duration of therapy track relative to the PFS you\u2019ve put in each of those indications. Both I'm trying to understand that for our own modeling purposes. Is it two thirds of PFS which is been the proxy you mentioned by some other companies in the past or is it similar to the PFS in for KEYTRUDA or even higher than PFS. Just wanted to understand that. ","Secondly, I wanted to focus a bit more on KEYNOTE-522, the neoadjuvant, and adjuvant trial in the triple negative breast. And my question was what's the bar for a very competitive profile? And perhaps, Roger, if you could speak to the variety of PCR definitions incorporated in the secondary endpoints and whether you would sort of focused as more on one definition over the other. And perhaps, Adam, could speak to the commercial opportunity in that indication as well. Thank you. ","Adam Schechter","Yeah so with regard to KEYTRUDA, it's very hard to get data and you've really do need to have a quite a bit of data overtime to understand the exact duration of therapy. So I would, I'd be hesitant to give any specific numbers. We are collecting real world evidence data, we are working on various data sources to have better estimates of that. And over time, we may be able to provide more specific information on that. ","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","And with respect to the Neoadjuvant breasts, we are first of all, I mean, just wait and see we are very excited about the opportunities that exists for adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy with KEYTRUDA across the broad range of tumor types. And I think the neoadjuvant experience is particularly instructive because of the pro-inflammatory effect of surgery in a variety of contexts. I draw your attention and you don't need your attention because you already know it very well to the I-SPY 2 data that we've got the opportunity to present previously. And the pathology of complete response results there are extremely impressive without going into any attempting any way to compare different definitions of pathologic complete response. I think there was a good understanding in breast cancer in particular about the relationship between pathologic complete response as studied a nice by two and outcomes. And that's the kind of analysis that we are using or will use in KEYNOTE-042 and with other studies going forward I'm very enthusiastic about where that could lead. ","Adam Schechter","And with regard to the indication, I mean as I've mentioned before, having a whole host of indications just reinforces how foundational KEYTRUDA is to overall cancer care. So every indication is important. With regard to this one, we're excited to get into the breast cancer market, but we're also starting to call this but this is already with Lynparza. So we are ready to launch with KEYTRUDA as soon as the data would be available or indication available. ","Teri Loxam","Okay. Thanks for the question. Move on to the next one please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gerberry from Bank of America.","Jason Gerberry","Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, on we talked about U.S. KEYTRUDA alone, can you talk a little bit about in terms of regulatory and then pricing and reimbursement? When do you actually expect to see meaningful contribution from KEYTRUDA in lung ex-U.S. outside of the monotherapy, PD-L1 high group? And then my second question just on JANUVIA\/JANUMET, a little bit higher than we were expecting for the quarter. Can you talk a little bit about the pricing environment? It seems as though oral antibiotic drugs were we're continuing to see grows to net adjustments spike and pricing pressure. But maybe it has it stabilized a little bit or are you guys just including your SGLT combo in that line? Any clarity just around have had to think about that would be helpful? Thanks.","Ken Frazier","So, I'll start with a JANUVIA question. As I said before, outside of U.S. we continue to see strong growth in the innumerous offset by the pricing pressure that we see in the U.S. And as I said, the last couple years, each year is tougher than the last year, this year, there is more pricing pressure than it was last year. And I believe next year, they'll be more pricing pressure than there is this year. So I believe that that will continue. The good news is we are seeing growth outside of the U.S. and we're in the middle of launching in China, for example, where we think there is still a growth opportunity there. So what's happening is the growth outside of U.S. is offset by the U.S. pricing pressure, I'll be in the U.S. we still continue to see good volume there.","With regards to KEYTRUDA outside the United States, I mean lung cancer is the majority of revenue already outside of U.S. Even though it's coming from the monotherapy, we already have most of the major markets reimbursing for lung for the monotherapy. We're waiting to be able to promote the combo and I think that will represent an additional opportunity for us outside of the U.S. moving forward.","Teri Loxam","Move on to the next question. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Boris with SunTrust.","John Boris","Thanks for taking the questions, and congratulations on the results. My question for Ken on at the conclusion of the last call, Ken, you mentioned that Mark was transitioning from a primary care to a specialty care business and that the three most important franchises would be certainly oncology, vaccines and Animal Health going forward. When we look at the revenue generated from those businesses. It's basically two-thirds of your revenue around the time of loss of exclusivity of JANUVIA in the U.S. And when we benchmark the incremental revenue that you're driving from those three businesses and benchmark oncology versus Roche vaccines versus GSK and Animal Health versus Zoetis, it certainly implies that operating margins expand quite substantially, especially beyond 2022. Can you provide any color on magnitude of operating margin expansion going forward, especially when the benchmark against those key players? Second question for Rob. If you look at the 35% tail of revenue, there\u2019s some old legacy assets, respiratory assets within healthcare assets and I expected assets that carry high fixed cost, most notably women\u2019s health and animal health, because you need dedicated manufacturing facilities. Any thoughts about divestitures added that tail? Thanks.","Ken Frazier","So maybe I\u2019ll jump on the operating margin question and I can hit the second question. Or did you want to\u2026","Adam Schechter","So to your question what we think long-term operating margin. We\u2019re not going to give specific guidance that we have been consistent to say in general, we do believe we\u2019re going to see operating margins expand as we move forward. As a result of what you pointed out, which is if you look at the mix of businesses with oncology and vaccines relative to what you would think that was a traditional primary care infrastructure, clearly those are more efficient businesses. But I would point out, as you look at this, maybe just some in general thoughts to give context. As you think about a pure specialty, we are a little bit different and what you think of as a pure specialty type company for a couple reasons. Starting with oncology, you really have never seen a situation in oncology, like what we have right now, with KEYTRUDA because this is the first time you have a drug that is crossing so many different tumor types, so many different indications. And as a result of that, you\u2019re really dealing with the needs to promote and to sell to multiple different specialists. So the infrastructure burden for product like the KEYTRUDA probably is going to be more than what you would see for traditional oncology companies, just given that. Although still is very beneficial to where we are today. ","So we are going to expand that I just would say, be cautious not to look at a pure ontology play with a more limited indication profile as a competitor. And then likewise, in vaccines. If you look at our vaccines portfolio, several the products in our vaccines portfolio and as we look forward to some of the products in our pipeline, actually, several those will not only go to specialists, but also will be marketed to the primary care doctors. So that in and of itself will mean a little bit more of a footprint. So I just want to give you a sense of that to say that while we do expect to see margins expand, it\u2019s. I think it\u2019s hard to think in terms of what a pure stuff for the company would look like. ","And then with regards to the portfolio, and what we\u2019re thinking about. As Ken mentioned in his earlier comments at the beginning of the call, we are always reevaluating our portfolio. And so we are not before close to any opportunity to optimize the portfolio. If it makes sense for both the short-term and long-term, I think that\u2019s the important thing. In everything we look at. We try to measure, what is the long-term path is sustainable value creation, sustainable growth and make the decisions balancing that relative to what we see in the short-term. But to your point, as we look across diversified brands, and in particular, and products like women\u2019s health, we\u2019re always asking the question, would it be more valuable in someone else\u2019s hands, including the manufacturing assets and if we see something that makes sense from a deal perspective. We would consider it. ","Teri Loxam","And we\u2019re going to try to get one more and if we can. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. ","Alex Arfaei","Okay, thank you and good morning. Adam, follow up on your commentary on KEYTRUDA. You mentioned a number of future indications for growth opportunities. Could you please prioritize those in terms of which ones you think have greater commercial potential? And then a follow up on animal health, obviously very strong growth that used to be growing above the market rate. Just wondering how long you think that is sustainable. When should we expect this to I guess gets larger to return closer to the market growth rate? Thank you. ","Adam Schechter","Yeah so as I look at KEYTRUDA as I said. Each of these indications is important that represents value to patients the patients suffering from cancer. As I look at the size and our quarter entry and those types of things, obviously the breast cancer indication the gastric cancer indication are important to power those cellular is important to be able to compete in renal as well. And again as we look even further out the adjuvant stage cancer are very exciting opportunities for us. ","Ken Frazier","And then with your question to animal health. You are right, as you look at the quarter, we have very strong growth in the quarter and if you look back over the last couple of years we've been consistently outpacing the markets animal health market in our growth. And as Tim mentioned earlier, this is largely due to the fact that we have both a robust in line portfolio products but also we're having meaningful new product launches across vaccines across in animals. So it really is a story of innovation that is driving the above market growth. And as we look forward. We expect we're not going to give specific guidance but I would say as we look forward over the next several years I would expect to continue to see above market growth on the basis of the new products as well as the strength of them on products we have which really ties to the whole nature of the innovation story and the innovation synergies that Ken mentioned earlier. ","Ken Frazier","Okay. Thank you all for participating in today's call. I want to reiterate that we are focused on commercial execution and continuing to advance our portfolio. I'm very optimistic about the rest of the year and our long term outlook. And I want to thank you and have a good day. ","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Teri Loxam. Please go ahead.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thank you, Darla, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Merck's Third Quarter 2017 Conference Call. Today I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; Adam Schechter, President of Global Human Health; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Laboratories.","Before I turn the call over to Ken, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation of these in our press release. We have also provided a table in our press release to help you understand the sales in the quarter for the business units and products.","I would like to remind you that some of the statements that we make during today's call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meetings of the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.

Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement. You can see our SEC filings as well as today's earnings release on merck.com.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thank you, Teri. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining the call today. Our third quarter results again demonstrate the underlying strength of our business. Throughout the year, we've been executing on global launches for new products and delivering growth in our vaccines and Animal Health businesses.","Our strong performance is particularly notable in a year where we've been facing the combined loss of nearly $2.5 billion in patent protected sales, continued pricing pressures, an isolated but meaningful cyber incident, and most recently, several natural disasters.","Our consistent performance also underscores the company's resolve to be the premier research intensive biopharmaceutical company. We measure success based on our ability to sustainably deliver differentiated medicines and vaccines. And we believe that long-term value creation is a direct function of our ability to deliver on the promise of innovation.","To that end, we continue to prioritize our resources to invest in Merck's research laboratories, including our new discovery hubs in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and South San Francisco, to advance the next generation of Merck medicines and vaccines.","At the same time, we're scouring the landscape to find the best external science to augment our portfolio. An example is the newly formed oncology collaboration with AstraZeneca, which involves codeveloping and co-commercializing LYNPARZA. We're already seeing good progress with LYNPARZA and believe it will add significant strength to our growing leadership in oncology, which is anchored by KEYTRUDA.","We're also looking carefully at other potential products in our pipeline, determining which opportunities have the highest potential to address unmet needs. For instance, we recently made the decision to prioritize certain opportunities in our pipeline for vaccines and for HIV. We believe these represent areas of long-term growth and could sizably add to our other key pillars of growth, namely oncology and animal health.","Recognizing that invention requires significant resources and investment, we remain disciplined in supporting our R&D opportunities, while at the same time reshaping our operating model in line with our changing portfolio and the evolving health care environment.","Going forward, we will build on the momentum of Merck's product launches and pipeline opportunities and seek new or additional ways to maximize long-term growth and sustainable value for society and shareholders.","With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Rob Davis, to go through our results in more detail. Rob?","Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Overall, our third quarter results reflect strong operational performance, allowing us to deliver solid bottom-line growth on a non-GAAP basis, despite several challenges in the quarter.","Now, starting first with our top-line results. Total company revenues were $10.3 billion, a decrease of 2% year over year. Excluding the impact of exchange, third quarter revenues declined 3%, with the 4% decline in our Human Health business partially offset by 14% growth in Animal Health. While Adam will detail Human Health performance in a moment, it's worth highlighting that the quarterly sales of our Animal Health business reached $1 billion for the first time, driven primarily by continued strength in our Companion Animal business, including BRAVECTO, and growth in our Ruminants business, which includes contributions from the Vall\u00e9e acquisition.","Non-GAAP gross margin was 76% in the quarter, an increase of roughly 70 basis points versus the third quarter of 2016. Favorable product mix, driven by KEYTRUDA and ZEPATIER, was the largest contributor to the year-over-year improvement.","Non-GAAP operating expenses of $4.2 billion increased 4% year over year, primarily driven by higher R&D expense, reflecting increased investment in early drug development.","Taken together, we earned $1.11 per share on a non-GAAP basis, up 4% excluding exchange. Note that our GAAP EPS loss of $0.02 reflects a charge of $2.35 billion related to the formation of the strategic oncology collaboration with AstraZeneca announced earlier in the quarter.","As we had cautioned in July, the June cyber event negatively impacted third quarter results, including an unfavorable revenue impact of approximately $135 million from lost sales and approximately $175 million in costs spread across the cost of goods sold and the operating expense lines. We anticipate a similar impact to revenue and expenses in the fourth quarter, which is reflected in our updated guidance.","In addition, we borrowed $240 million of GARDASIL from the CDC stockpile to fulfill shipments in the quarter. The borrowing was driven in part by the temporary production shutdown resulting from the cyberattack, as well as overall higher demand than originally planned. The revenue will ultimately be recognized as we replenish the stockpile, which we currently anticipate will occur in the second half of 2018.","It's worth noting that while our reported sales for the third quarter were down $210 million, absent the cyber and stockpile items, we would have had a quarter of growth, even in the face of significant LOEs.","Turning to 2017 guidance. Given our operational strength year to date as well as a more favorable exchange rate environment, we are narrowing and raising our revenue range for the full year. We now expect revenues to be between $40 billion and $40.5 billion. We continue to expect a moderate year-over-year increase in our gross margin.","We also continue to expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to grow at a mid-single digit rate compared to full year 2016, driven by higher R&D cost to support our oncology business, including the AstraZeneca collaboration, as well as vaccines and other pipeline opportunities. We are also assuming approximately $175 million of business development expenses in the fourth quarter, largely driven by the closing of the Rigontec acquisition.","We now expect the full year non-GAAP tax rate to be between 20% and 21%. We continue to project average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 2.75 billion for the year.","Taken together, we are narrowing and raising our expected non-GAAP EPS range for the full year to $3.91 to $3.97. Both our revenue and non-GAAP EPS ranges include a negative impact from foreign exchange of less than 1% using mid-October rates.","In summary, we continue to execute well. We have many opportunities in our pipeline that we believe can drive long term growth, for which we have invested in this year and we will continue to invest in throughout next year as well. We have been reallocating resources wherever possible. And we will continue to remain disciplined to maximize the long term trajectory of our business.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Adam.","Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. This morning I'll provide highlights on the Performance of Global Human Health for the third quarter. And my comments will be on a constant currency basis.","Global Human Health delivered sales of $9.2 billion, a decline of 4%, primarily driven by the loss of exclusivity for several products. We continue to see strong underlying growth from launch products, including KEYTRUDA, ZEPATIER, and BRIDION.","Now I'll highlight a few of our key franchises and product launches, and I'll start with oncology. This is an exciting time for Merck as a global leader in immuno-oncology. We remain focused on executing on the extensive opportunity that we have with KEYTRUDA. And we are also excited about the growth opportunity for LYNPARZA, which we have begun co-marketing globally with AstraZeneca.","I'll start with KEYTRUDA. Worldwide sales for KEYTRUDA in the quarter exceeded $1 billion for the first time, making KEYTRUDA the second-largest product in the Merck portfolio.","And in 2017 alone, we have launched six new indications in the U.S., four in Europe, and three in Japan. In the U.S., more new patients now start on KEYTRUDA than any other I-O agent across all indications. With 10 indications in six tumor types and MSI-high cancers, U.S. KEYTRUDA sales grew to just over $600 million in the quarter.","Although there was some noise in the channel this quarter, as distributors normalized their inventory levels, if you look at the most recent script data, we have seen substantial growth in demand both year over year as well as quarter over quarter.","We continued to build on our leadership position in lung cancer with growth driven by continued adoption of KEYTRUDA monotherapy in high expressers, as well as the uptake of the KEYTRUDA\/ALIMTA combination in the first-line setting. Across all of lung cancer, nearly one in three new lung cancer patients in the U.S. are being started on KEYRUDA, making it the most prescribed treatment for new metastatic lung cancer patients.","Lung cancer was our largest tumor type, but indications outside of lung cancer contributed to approximately 45% of U.S. sales. In addition to continued leadership position in melanoma and head and neck cancer, we have seen strong momentum for the bladder cancer launch. Within just two months in the second line or greater setting, KEYTRUDA achieved I-O leadership in new Rx share, despite being the fifth market entrant.","Outside of the United States, KEYTRUDA continues to maintain a leadership position in the PD-1 class in melanoma. And we are seeing a greater contribution from lung cancer, as reimbursement is established in additional markets in the first-line and second-line settings. Following our recent 1bladder cancer approval in Europe, we're now also working through the reimbursement process for this indication in each country. Early performance in Japan is also strong, with PD-L1 testing rates in lung cancer consistent with that in the U.S.","Altogether, we see great opportunity for KEYTRUDA around the world, and we remain focused on establishing KEYTRUDA as a foundation for the treatment of cancer.","We also began working side by side with our colleagues at AstraZeneca and are ramping up our sales force to support the ongoing launch of LYNPARZA. We are excited about the opportunity we see with the broader label in ovarian cancer. And we're looking forward to the upcoming opportunity in metastatic breast cancer.","Now I'll move to JANUVIA. Global sales for the JANUVIA franchise were $1.5 billion, a decline of 2%. While we saw volume growth globally, we also experienced continued pricing pressure as we've discussed for the last several years. While we expect pricing pressure to continue, macro trends support volume growth going forward, especially outside of the U.S. As a result, we view our diabetes franchise as a relatively stable foundation from which to grow our portfolio of new products.","Moving now to our Vaccine business. Global sales were $1.9 billion with growth outside of the U.S., including the contribution from the European JV termination.","Underlying demand for GARDASIL remains strong. And increased patient starts are helping to offset the negative impact in the transition to the two-dose regimen in the U.S. GARDASIL worldwide sales would have grown in the quarter absent our borrowing from the stockpile. Based on current trends, we are confident in the continuous supply in the U.S. going forward. We continue to see opportunities for growth in our Vaccine business, particularly from the continued strength in GARDASIL as we move into the next year.","Moving now to Hospital and Specialty. The ZEPATIER launch progressed well in the quarter with growth driven by Europe, Japan, and the U.S. However, we recognize the evolving marketplace and competitive landscape. And while we remain focused on maximizing its potential, we expect significant pressure on ZEPATIER throughout the remainder of this year and into next year.","Finally, BRIDION delivered another great quarter with growth of more than 30%, driven by strong demand in most markets around the world, including the ongoing launch in the U.S. We have seen nearly 95% repurchasing from top accounts in the U.S., which demonstrates the market's continued positive experience with BRIDION.","In closing, our results show the benefit from our strong execution and the contribution from launches. We have good momentum in our global oncology and Vaccine businesses in addition to others. And we believe these franchises position us well for success heading into 2018.","Now I'll turn the call over to Roger.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Adam. Progress in the registration of KEYTRUDA continued during the third quarter with accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with recurrent or advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, who have previously received two or more lines of chemotherapy and whose tumors express PD-L1.","Also as part of our partnership with AstraZeneca, we received approval in the United States for new uses of LYNPARZA, our poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor, including a new tablet formation \u2013 formulation for the fourth line treatment of patients with ovarian cancer, who have deleterious or suspected to be deleterious BRCA alleles. LYNPARZA also received FDA approval for maintenance treatment of patients regardless of BRCA mutation status with recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who have responded to platinum based chemotherapy.","We're excited by additional data that we've seen for LYNPARZA treatment. In particular, we announced during the third quarter that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration accepted for review our supplemental new drug application for the use of LYNPARZA tablets in patients with germline, BRCA-mutated, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, who have been previously treated with chemotherapy either in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or metastatic setting. The FDA granted priority review with a PDUFA action date in the first quarter of 2018. LYNPARZA is also undergoing regulatory review in Japan.","During the third quarter at the Congress of the European Society of Cardiology, we presented the results of REVEAL, our 30,000 patient study, testing whether anacetrapib, when added to an effective LDL-cholesterol lowering regimen, could reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events as compared with the placebo control. Although the REVEAL study met its primary endpoint, after consultation with experts in cardiovascular disease, including those who had advised us through the decade-long prosecution of the anacetrapib development program, we concluded that we would not pursue regulatory filings of this drug. We are grateful to the patients, families, and physicians who participated in this study and to the Oxford University team that led all aspects of study execution and data analysis.","Separately, after reviewing the evolving hepatitis C therapeutic landscape, we decided not to pursue development of doublet and triplet regimens containing MK-3682, our highly effective nucleoside HCV polymerase inhibitor. This decision was not stimulated by any inadequacies in the antiviral compounds themselves, especially the triplet MK-3682B. But instead followed directly from prioritization decisions during our portfolio management process.","Despite these conclusions regarding our newest HCV therapies, we remain very enthusiastic about ZEPATIER. For example, earlier this month we presented real world data from the U.S. Veterans Administration (sic) [U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs], demonstrating very high antiviral activity in genotype 1 or 4 HCV infected patients with chronic renal disease, including a 95.6% sustained urologic response in patients with a very severe chronic kidney disease, CKD 4 and 5.","Beyond ZEPATIER, during the third quarter we continued to elaborate a broad program in infectious disease and vaccine research. Earlier this month, we presented data from our pivotal Phase III study of letermovir, a cytomegalovirus terminase inhibitor for the prophylaxis of CMV infection or reactivation in adult recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants. These data are currently under review by the FDA with a PDUFA date of November 8. They're also being evaluated by the Committee on Human Medicinal Products (sic) [Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use] of the European Medicines Agency.","Returning again to our oncology program, at the World Conference on Lung Cancer in Yokohama earlier this month, Julie Brahmer and colleagues presented long-term follow-up data from KEYNOTE-024, showing that in the first-line treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer, in which greater than 50% of tumor cells express PD-L1, the median survival for patients randomized to the KEYTRUDA arm was 30 months, as compared to 14.2 months for those receiving chemotherapy, despite a 62% effective crossover rate.","We also continue to see impressive improvements in overall survival following treatment with KEYTRUDA in combination with traditional chemotherapy. Data presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology meetings last month documented enhanced separation of the survival curves with longer follow-up in our KEYNOTE-021G study, comparing traditional therapy, that is carboplatin\/pemetrexed, with the results achieved when KEYTRUDA was added to this treatment regimen.","While the hazard ratio for overall survival was 0.9 in the primary analysis, after a median of 18.7 months follow-up, the observed hazard ratio for overall survival had fallen to 0.59. This was true despite a 75% crossover rate to anti-PD-1\/L1 therapy in the chemotherapy arm. In other words, early administration of KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy seemed to confer improved overall survival.","With these results in mind, we have elected to revise the statistical analysis plan for KEYNOTE-189, a nearly 600 patient study patterned after KEYNOTE-021G, to include dual endpoints of progression pre-survival and overall survival.","This revision has been reviewed and accepted by the FDA. The timeline for completion of KEYNOTE-189 has therefore been extended to capture longer term survival data, with an estimated completion date, depending upon the underlying event rate, in February of 2019. The study is fully enrolled, as we announced in the second quarter. And the opportunity exists to conduct interim analyses, again depending upon the underlying event rate that we observe.","Lastly, I note that beyond LYNPARZA and selumetinib, in the third quarter we acquired a RIG-I antagonist through the purchase of Munich-based Rigontec. And beyond these programs, our early oncology pipeline include 20 proprietary molecules, which have either entered the clinic or which have been approved to enter development.","We are now beginning to see evidence of activity in a number of these early programs. And details of these studies will be presented in scientific meetings beginning in 2018.","I'll now turn the call back to Teri.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Roger. We'll be moving on to our Q&A portion of the call. I would like to remind everyone to please keep to a maximum of two questions to allow us to get as many people on the call as possible this morning. So, Darla, if you can queue everyone up, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Your first question is from Andrew Baum with Citi.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you. Couple of questions, please. Roger, could you comment on any differential activity you've seen in KEYNOTE-021G with patients with high versus low baseline TMB [tumor mutational burden]? And whether TMB forms part of the primary endpoint of your recently initiated ipi\/pembro [ipilimumab\/pembrolizumab] trial?","And then second, the market is currently viewing your recent LYNPARZA deal as a play on ovarian and breast cancer. What opportunity do you see significantly beyond that? Both in patients with germline DNA repair mutations, given the prevalence in refractory cancers, as well as in combination with KEYTRUDA? Thank you.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Right, Andrew, okay. So first of all, the question is differential activity in KEYNOTE-021G as a function of tumor mutational burden. We don't really have those kinds of data specifically. We've done a lot of work on tumor mutational burden in all of our studies.","But those we're not \u2013 in response to your second question. We're not including tumor mutational burden as an explicit endpoint within KEYNOTE-189 in part because of course one has to define cut points for tumor mutational burden. That is, at what point within each tumor type does a tumor mutational burden rise to the point where you believe that's meaningful?","And we have a lot of data of course from this from looking at MSI-high populations. And as you know we have a broad label for patients who have MSI-high tumors. And we can see the magnitude of the tumor mutational burden in that population, where response rates are quite good. And we can look at tumor mutational burden in other populations and stratify. But there's still work to be done to define what those cut points actually are. So that's not part of the KEYNOTE-189 program.","Specifically with regard to LYNPARZA, the opportunities are really quite broad. We have, together with our colleagues at AstraZeneca, more than a dozen potential registration-enabling studies covering a broad range of tumor types.","One of the things that excited us, of course, relevant to the tumor mutational burden question, is that by virtue of the fact that PARP inhibitors have an effect on the salvage mechanism for DNA repair, the accumulation of mutations that could encode neo-androgens might be expected to increase. And those could provide acceptable targets for T lymphocytes that would be unleashed in the presence of KEYTRUDA.","So the combination of KEYTRUDA therapy and LYNPARZA is something that we're really very excited about. Of course preliminary data along those lines has been generated with niraparib in combination with KEYTRUDA as part of our collaboration with TESARO. And we continue to pursue those studies as well.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Roger. We'll move on to the next question, please?","Operator","It's from Tim Anderson from Sanford Bernstein.","Alexander Man - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. This is Alex Man on for Tim. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two here, please. First, a high level question. So you guys have threaded the I-O needle very well throughout 2017, yet your stock hasn't done too much. One of the reasons for this is that investors are nervous that I-O is the only growth driver and sometimes surprises can happen. When you think forward over the next two years to three years, what else outside of I-O can you point to as a potential source of revenue and earnings growth?","And then second, on ECHO-305, one of your two newly-posted Phase III IDO combos in first-line lung, this trial only recruits high expressers. Publicly, we've only seen early clinical data in small sample sets with this combo in lung and not much in first-line patients exclusively. So what drove the rationale to pursue the combo in high expressers only? And is the hypothesis that you really need chemotherapy to unlock IDO combo's potential in all expressers like ECHO-306? Thank you.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.","Let me start with the first question about our portfolio. So first of all, as a company we believe that a broad and balanced portfolio capitalizes on our strength and best positions the company for long term success. We are committed to making the necessary investments to optimize KEYTRUDA and LYNPARZA, as you've already heard, in addition to our many other early-stage assets in oncology.","At the same time, we have a number of clinical programs across our portfolio outside oncology that we believe will be meaningful growth fillers for the company long term. For example, we're moving into Phase III with our cough compound that we acquired from Afferent. We also have a number of programs advancing in our Vaccines business. In addition, we have a lot of work going on in other areas of our early pipeline, including the next generation of HIV assets.","So again, we recognize the need to balance delivering in the short term, while making the appropriate investments to drive long term growth. We actively review our portfolio on an ongoing basis to shift resources to those assets that have higher growth potential.","So beyond oncology, we believe we have opportunities in areas like cough, in areas like Vaccines as we move forward. And we're going to continue to augment our pipeline in addition to that.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Roger, do you want to answer the other...","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Yeah, so just with respect to the IDO1 combination studies. And there are, as you know, a number of studies that will be posted with respect to IDO1 combinations. We've put a lot of time into evaluating which studies in lung cancer might potentially yield results.","You're quite right, and you have seen the data that exists with respect to IDO1 combinations with KEYTRUDA. We are evaluating this information over time. But we don't have a lot of information to tell us exactly how these would behave.","The fundamental observation remains that by virtue of IDO1 inhibition that one can improve T lymphocyte responsiveness. And it represents a second axis for improvement in T lymphocyte responsiveness beyond checkpoint blockade. It makes sense to think that you would see that activity best in a circumstance when you know there are a lot of responsive T lymphocytes. And of course we know that occurs in the setting where inflammation is already present, as in the PD-L1 high population.","That's just a sort of a high level look at it. We're looking at a bunch of other ways of trying to evaluate IDO1 inhibition in combination with KEYTRUDA.","But clearly the existence of inflammation, as we've found over the last many years of study, existence \u2013 preexistence of inflammation is important, because these molecules, IDO1 inhibitors and checkpoint inhibitors, reveal the preexisting immunity that for one reason or another is inadequate. And so that the goal is to try and make that immunity visible through tumor reduction. That's what we're trying to get done here.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Great. We'll move on to the next question, please?","Operator","It's from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Chris Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much for the questions. First one is maybe a question for Ken. Just another one of your competitors announced that they are exploring strategic options for their Animal Health business. And I know there's been some debate over time in terms of how core Animal Health is to Merck and just how it fits in the overall portfolio. So can we just get your updated thoughts on just Animal Health, that business? How it fits within the broader Merck story? Just as we think about kind of different approaches to those franchises from some of your competitors?","My second question was on the KEYNOTE-189 endpoint co-primary. Will we hear from the company on PFS prior to the overall study wrapping up? Or do we really need to wait for both endpoints to hit before we'll get any update from Merck?","And then maybe more broadly as part of that discussion, can you just talk about just a little bit more on the confidence that you can show in OS benefit here despite the crossover? I know we had some encouraging data from KEYNOTE-021G. But just as you're adding that to the \u2013 as a primary here, just I guess a little bit more in terms of just your overall confidence on overall survival here. Thank you.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks for the question, Chris. So we are focused on driving long term growth through innovation generally. And we see Animal Health and the innovation that we can create through that portal as a pillar of growth for the company.","As we noted this quarter, it surpassed $1 billion for the first time inside our portfolio, which is meaningful. And we continue to see it going forward as a key growth driver, because it has healthy margins and as well as a strong market outlook. So from our perspective we see it fitting very nicely and augmenting our growth as an overall company.","And we intend, where we find opportunities, to further augment that business with additional business development. So it's an important part of our business, Chris.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","And, Chris, regarding KEYNOTE-189, the key issue, as you know, is that when you look at the curves for PFS as opposed to OS, the PFS curves separate essentially at the first time of analysis. So at three months, those curves are already quite different for the combination of KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy as opposed to chemotherapy alone.","For OS, the curves are separating at 12 months. But in the KEYNOTE-021G study, perhaps in part because of the small size of that study with only 16 patients per group, you're really not seeing meaningful separation of those curves until you get out closer to 18 months and beyond based on what we have right now.","Now with the improved power of the KEYNOTE-189 study, we may be able to see that earlier. But the idea would be, to the extent possible we would like to preserve the overall survival results. And that is \u2013 overall survival is of course the gold standard. It's what we're all trying to achieve. And we see KEYNOTE-189 as really very important in terms of how physicians will manage lung cancer patients for a long time to come.","To the extent that we announce the PFS data when these data become positive, then of course we're going to be driving people who believe that they are not receiving KEYTRUDA, we're going to be driving them out of the study. And we've got to be very careful about that.","So while there will be opportunities for interim analyses in the study, we're going to be careful to preserve the integrity of the study. You can be confident that as soon as we have results that we think are meaningful, you'll be the second to know. We're definitely going to announce these results. It will be very important. But we want to preserve the integrity of the study in the interest of patient care.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","We'll move on to the next question, please.","Operator","It's from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. So I wanted to follow up with questions on KEYNOTE-189 and the IDO Phase III trial. So with respect to KEYNOTE-189, Roger, the enrollment completed in February of 2017 according to clinicaltrials.gov. Just wondering why the primary completion would be two years later in February of 2019 for OS?","And related to that, maybe that the event rate is low because the KEYTRUDA combo is keeping patients alive much longer. But based upon the event numbers that you have in hand, should we assume that the first interim timing is the first half of next year? Or is there any other color you can provide on the first interim look timing?","And then separately with respect to the IDO Phase IIIs that have been posted, could you please provide a framework for them? And the expected timing of readouts? Thank you.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Right, David. On KEYNOTE-189, yeah. The study completed a little bit later. I mean it completed enrollment a little bit later, I think in March. But the event rate \u2013 based on our prior experience and what we're seeing now, the event rate is low. And so we simply calculate, well, based on the power of the study and what we expect the hazard ratio to be, we simply calculate how long \u2013 how many events we will have, at which times, and how many events we need to see. And that's how we come up with the date.","On the other hand, we're going to be following that event rate very closely. And so it can't have stabilized at this point. And so we do expect that there will be opportunities for interim analyses and that we'll have a chance to see them. I can't give you any clarity about exactly when that will take place.","And again, with IDO1, I think the issue is that across a range of different tumor types, we saw evidence that the combination of IDO1 with KEYTRUDA appeared to provide benefit in terms of response rate. That's what drove the Phase III study design.","We announced that there will be a half dozen such studies. And we were just beginning to post those studies. The information that's on clinicaltrials.gov gives you a feel for what we're trying to get done there.","But I hasten to add we do not know for sure that the combination of IDO1 plus KEYTRUDA in a larger study, where you have randomization and control, that you're actually going to see that improvement in response rate, or that improvement in response rate will translate into durable responses that have a meaningful impact on progression and overall survival.","So those are the things that we're going to be looking at, because clearly we're trying to improve treatment for cancer patients. It's that simple.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Okay. We'll move on to the next question, please.","Operator","From Steve Scala with Cowen.","Steve Scala - Cowen and Co. LLC","Well, thank you very much. Merck's KEYNOTE-189 and Roche's IMpower-150 had similar primary completions. But IMpower-150 will still read out PFS and OS this year. And then take another look at OS in the first half of next year.","Could you perhaps compare and contrast what Merck is doing relative to PFS and OS readouts versus what Roche is doing? Specifically the simultaneous versus step-wide readouts? I'm not sure I understand why Roche can do a step-wide readout, and Merck believes simultaneous is the way to go.","And secondly, consensus is looking for 7% EPS growth in 2018. Ken, any preliminary thoughts on the outlook for 2018? There are clearly opportunities for growth but also some risks. Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thank you.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Right, Steve. So I can't really comment on IMpower of course and how they've designed their studies and what treatment effect they believe they're seeing.","For us, we decided to revise our program in order to put more \u2013 to assign more of the study power to the overall survival endpoint. We have dual primary endpoints. And overall survival is clearly the important thing. KEYNOTE-021G gives us a lot of confidence we had anyway in terms of the improvement of PFS.","The issue really is the OS data. That's the thing that's proved to be most important. And really to us, very impressive that overall survival is continuing to separate as we look further on in the KEYNOTE-021G study, despite the fact that the study is really comparing early versus late KEYTRUDA therapy.","Remember, everybody gets chemotherapy and then they get KEYTRUDA. The crossover numbers are such that anybody who fails on chemotherapy then gets KEYTRUDA. And what that means is you either got KEYTRUDA at the beginning, or you got it late. And because there's such a dramatic decline in PFS, with a median PFS of less than nine months in the chemotherapy arm, everybody gets KEYTRUDA pretty quickly.","So that business of KEYTRUDA versus early versus late becomes very important. And that's the thing we really want to make sure that we understand and that we obtain very solid data on in the KEYNOTE-189 study. Because ultimately that's practice changing. That's crucially important. That's crucially important for the survival of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. So that's what we've done in that study.","Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.","Great. Yeah. Thanks, Roger. Good morning, Steve. And to your second question about EPS growth in 2018, as you know, we don't provide specific guidance for 2018 until we get to our fourth quarter 2017 earnings call, which will be in February. But maybe I can provide to your point some of the headwinds and tailwinds that give a sense of what we're seeing.","I would just start by reiterating the point that Ken made, that we do have several pillars of long term growth. Obviously it starts with KEYTRUDA and what we continue to believe is a real opportunity there for continued growth, not only with KEYTRUDA but expanding with the broader oncology portfolio.","With our vaccines business, we continue to expect to see good growth, especially GARDASIL. And then obviously Adam touched upon what we've seen this year with BRIDION, which has really done quite well. And we continue to believe has great growth opportunities as we look forward.","And then finally I'd just highlight Animal Health. Animal Health grew 14% in the quarter. It's growing double digits year to date. And we continue to see very strong growth in that business. And given the fact that it's now reaching a size, to Ken's point, that it was $1 billion in the quarter, it's meaningful to our overall portfolio.","So we think we have a lot of opportunities to drive good growth on the top line next year. But obviously we do have some pressures with ZEPATIER and ZOSTAVAX, to name a few, as well as obviously continuing LOE pressure, particularly from ZETIA\/VYTORIN as that tails off as we move into next year.","And then the only other point I'd make is that Adam highlighted JANUVIA we see as a very stable product, which is really going to be the foundation from which we'll drive growth with the other pillars I mentioned, even given some of the pricing pressure we face there.","And then finally, as you think about investments, clearly we continue to believe we have real opportunity on an R&D front for continued investment. A lot of promise, not only with KEYTRUDA and LYNPARZA but the broader oncology pipeline that we're starting to advance and add to with things like Rigontec that Roger mentioned. And then beyond that, other products that we continue to want to invest in, vaccines and others in the pipeline.","So we are going to make meaningful investment in R&D next year. That will make driving an overall leveraged P&L more challenging as we get into next year. But obviously we remain committed to that long term. And we will do everything we can to be disciplined and reallocate resources behind those growth opportunities by making the right trade-offs to drive growth.","So hopefully that gives you a sense of some of the pushes and pulls. And then we look forward to February, where we'll give you more specifics.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Great. We'll move on to the next question, please.","Operator","It's from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Good morning, folks. Thank you very much for taking the questions. Roger, first on KEYNOTE-189, I just want to make sure that I heard you correctly. Is everybody in the chemo arm, once they progress, will they all get KEYTRUDA?","And the reason I ask that question is in KEYNOTE-021G with 60% to 70% crossover, you're clearly seeing the chemo arm being lifted and doing much better than traditionally expected. So with presumably 100% crossover, again I'm just trying to struggle how you're confident about hitting that OS endpoint, given that we know PD-1s are effective in a second-line setting.","And my follow-up for Adam. Since you're basically going to have to promote KEYNOTE-021G for another 1.5 years, what's the feedback you're getting from physicians regarding the latest updates at ESMO? Are they believing your latest 19-month median PFS 70% 18-month OS rate, et cetera? Or are you still getting significant pushback? And could you give us an approximate breakdown of KEYTRUDA sales by indications, please? Thank you very much.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","So, Alex, no, there's no mandatory crossover. And you've hit the exact point, which was in response to a different question from (43:56), which is basically if we are \u2013 if we look at the study and we announce PFS. And the study is very positive in PFS at a time when overall survival is immature, the fact that that study behaves in that way will cause patients who are progressing to drop out.","They will gain access, of course, to KEYTRUDA in second line. We've already demonstrated that KEYTRUDA is extremely effective in second-line therapy based on the KEYNOTE-010 data. And so in essence you're going to be looking at crossover.","But the key thing we need to understand in this patient population is really what is the overall survival difference as a result of providing the combination of KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy early as opposed to KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy late? And so we want to try and make sure that we can understand that difference, because that's what's important ultimately for physicians and for patients, as they contemplate how best to treat non-small cell lung cancer. This is the opportunity to do that.","Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.","And to answer your question regarding the uptake in lung cancer, I mean in the United States and also in Japan, we're seeing a very strong uptake in lung cancer. And if you look at the high expressers above 50, we're seeing significant utilization of KEYTRUDA monotherapy. If you look at expressers between 1 and 50, that's where we're seeing increased use of the combination with ALIMTA.","We're hearing that now that it's in our label, physicians are being more comfortable to prescribe the combination therapy. We're hearing that a lot in the community sector where they treat most of the lung cancer patients. And they're used to using chemotherapy, so they feel very comfortable with the combination.","In addition, what we're really trying to work on now is in the non-expressers or in the patients that are not PD-L1 tested to reinforce that we have the indication for the combination to be used in those patients, which we think represents an additional significant opportunity. And we're spending a lot of time educating physicians on those patient types.","To give you a rough estimate, we think about 55% of our sales are coming from lung cancer in the U.S., about 20% melanoma, 10% head and neck, 5% bladder, and then 10% everything else.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks, Adam. We'll go on to the next question, please.","Operator","It's from Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Have a vaccine question for you. We noticed you were trying to IPR some Prevnar patents. And was curious how that relates to your pneumococcal vaccine and its status? And when you could take that one into Phase III?","And then for Roger, on your pembro\/ipi study that was recently posted, have you designed that to answer any questions that will not be answered by [CheckMate] 227 from Bristol, other than the obvious fact that the PD-1 agents are different? Thanks.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Right, Gregg. So the first question is with respect to our pneumococcal conjugate vaccine program. We have a very broad program in pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. We are looking at mechanisms whereby we can expand the set of carbohydrate specificities in order to improve vaccination, improve resistance to invasive pneumococcal disease.","We believe that we have freedom to operate in this area. We've always believed that. And we are moving forward with the first of these opportunities, V-114, which will be advancing into Phase III very shortly.","With respect to the combination of ipilimumab with KEYTRUDA, the study is designed to look to see whether those two agents when combined together really offer meaningful advantage as opposed to KEYTRUDA alone. I think that comparison, the randomized comparison of the combination of those two agents versus KEYTRUDA alone is a critical one, because of course you do add very substantial toxicity when you add ipilimumab to the therapeutic regimen.","And of course we've already demonstrated the impressive results that one gets in combination with chemotherapy. So that's the comparison that ultimately needs to be made.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks. We'll move on to the next question, please.","Operator","It's from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just shifting a little bit to the diabetes side. And you mentioned you feel that portfolio is stable. We obviously have JANUVIA LOE coming in a few years. You have (48:42) in the glargine biosimilar.","But just curious given what JANUVIA is going to face a few years from now and also the decision on anacetrapib, is that maybe an area that you've looked to sort of boost through business development to kind of have multiple portfolio down the road? Or maybe just more broadly beyond oncology, what areas are you focused on in terms of business development?","And then one question, a follow-up just on the oncology side with the MSI-high indication. Just curious how that's going from a commercial perspective in terms of obviously there's no MSI-high doctors out there. So how you're approaching that from a commercial perspective? And what sort of traction you're getting in people using that biomarker? Thanks.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.","Okay. Well, thanks, Vamil, for the question. As it relates to our business development strategy, what we're looking for is the opportunity to find the best scientific innovations that will enhance our overall pipeline and help our patients live healthier lives.","Diabetes is a very important category for us. And therefore we will continue to look for opportunities to provide a benefit to diabetic patients. But I think overall, I think the key here is we are agnostic, pretty much, to the therapeutic category.","We like the work that we're doing in oncology. But we'll look beyond oncology to find other partnerships and collaborations and acquisitions that actually provide differentiated drug, regardless of therapeutic area.","So I think we have a strong series of opportunities to grow our pillars our Vaccines and oncology and Animal Health. Diabetes remains important to us. And we'll look for those opportunities in diabetes and elsewhere.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","And with regard to MSI-high, obviously having a multitude of indications is very helpful. And it helped establish KEYTRUDA as a new standard of care in oncology.","What we're doing right now is working to increase awareness of MSI-high testing and the value of KEYTRUDA across other tumor types. As you know MSI-high is an established biomarker, but it's primarily used in colorectal cancer or endometrial cancer.","Right now if you think about MSI-high, it's available across a wide spectrum of cancers, some that are common like I just mentioned. Others that are uncommon. So it really is a lot of education in the marketplace.","So I do believe over time it will be a meaningful opportunity. But in the short term, it's going to take some time for education as the market will evolve.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Great. We'll move on to the next question, please.","Operator","It's from Geoff Meacham with Barclays.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Roger, on the recent ECHO-202 data in melanoma, can you talk a little bit about the PD-L1 negative cohort? I'm just trying to reconcile what we could see in melanoma in Phase III, versus the lung opportunity.","And then on Adam \u2013 for Adam, ahead of the potential KEYNOTE-021G approval in Europe, what's your early read on the risk\/benefit perceptions from EU docs, versus what you've seen or heard so far in the U.S.? And do you think that the reimbursement or uptake will be influenced by whether or not you have the KEYNOTE-189 data? Thank you.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","So, Geoff, on ECHO data, let me just say that we do not have sufficient information at the present time to know whether the combination of IDO1 antagonist and KEYTRUDA actually provides meaningful benefit. We continue to accrue data that is intriguing, that says that there is an improvement in response rate. And as I've said before, that that relates to both breadth and depth of response.","We are hopeful that that will translate in Phase III studies into something really very meaningful. But at the moment we don't have those data in hand. We're pursuing that through a very broad Phase III program, as you know.","Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.","And with regard to lung, we continue to see good progress. And in the EU, we've worked really hard to increase the number of patients being tested for PD-L1 status. And as you look across the various countries, we're seeing the pickup very significantly. So in Germany, it's over 60% already. In the UK, it's greater than 90%.","Our focus right now is really continuing to work through the reimbursement process for first-line and second-line lung. And each and every month, we have new countries that are coming on. And we're getting more and more reimbursement. We'll have to wait ultimately to see more about KEYNOTE-021G before we can comment.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Go on to the next question, please?","Operator","It's from Umer Raffat with Evercore.","Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. So I have a three \u2013 I have one question but with three parts. And I want to focus specifically on the new first-line lung trial of KEYTRUDA plus epacadostat, ECHO-306.","And here's what I find interesting. The comparator arm in this ECHO-306 is KEYTRUDA plus chemo. So that's the highest bar we've ever seen in first-line lung to-date. So here's my three-part question. One, can you confirm you were actively involved in the trial design? Two, I'm just curious how you're thinking about pitting pembro plus IDO versus this KEYTRUDA plus chemo comp? And then finally, the fact that you have this KEYTRUDA plus chemo comp in this trial, is this a further validation of your confidence in this combo, especially as we head into KEYNOTE-189? Thank you.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","So, Umer, first of all, the \u2013 we are actively involved with our colleagues at [BioPharm] Insight in designing all of these studies. These are not things that are being pursued independently by them.","Secondly, the study design \u2013 and we've gone through many, many iterations on study design \u2013 we chose this particular study design because we are eager to see the contribution both in terms of efficacy as well as safety. Epacadostat in combination with KEYTRUDA compared to what we now regard as a standard in the non-small cell lung cancer setting. It is a high bar as you say, because the results of that, as demonstrated by KEYNOTE-021G and some other information we previously reported, are very impressive.","And as I've said I think repeatedly on this call, I just want to make plain, we're doing these Phase III studies because we do not have randomized data that tell us that the combination of KEYTUDA plus epacadostat provides meaningful benefit. We have single-arm data that are very intriguing, because they imply that we have improved response rates, both breadth and depth. And that may translate into improvements in PFS and overall survival versus monotherapy, or in this case the combination.","But it is \u2013 we do not have that information. That's the reason we're doing these studies. And we're optimistic that we will see the benefit that we believe we've seen in single-arm studies. But we just don't know.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","All right. We'll take another question. We're running out of time. We're going to try to get through one more at least, and if we can, one other.","Operator","And your next question is from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. Ken, a question for you. Just reading the company's press release, you do mention very early on in your prepared remarks that BD is expected to be an important growth driver, or you're looking to BD as an important growth driver. We hadn't seen that in previous press releases before. I'm just wondering if you could talk to that, just the importance of business development as the company sort of moves into the next decade with the JANUVIA patent expiration. What you think is that \u2013 do you think of a large scale acquisition as something that you think will be necessary going forward?","And, Rob, you did a really helpful job talking about 2018 without giving guidance. Can you be a little bit more specific on operating expenses? Clearly R&D is going up, but what about SG&A? Should we assume operating expenses can be maintained next year? Or should we assume that they will be up?","And just lastly, Roger, for you on KEYNOTE-189, how will you allocate the statistical analysis between PFS and OS? Thanks very much.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.","Well, good morning, Jami. Let me first of all say that I'd have to go back and look at the other press releases, because we've tried to talk about the importance of business development consistently.","And what I would say is that our perspective on business development is unchanged. And that is that it is an important priority for the company. We're very actively engaged and looking for the best scientific innovations to enhance our long term growth in our pipeline.","As it relates to large transactions, what we've said is that we're primarily looking for those things that enhance the company's ability to innovate. We're not looking at things purely for synergies or consolidation purposes. And so I would think that our view continues to be that we're going to look for those things, particularly bolt-ons, that will help us as we go further with our innervation strategy.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Great. Rob, do you want to take the next?","Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Yeah. Good morning, Jami. Thanks for the question. So to be maybe a little more specific than I was a minute ago. Obviously as we have constantly stated, our goal is to drive operating leverage long term. So that continues to be where our focus is, through looking at opportunities to make trade-offs and reallocation of resources to drive productivity.","With that being said, we do anticipate operating expenses to increase as we move into next year, primarily driven by R&D with the opportunities we talked about around KEYTRUDA, LYNPARZA, and the broader portfolio. So that is something we expect.","And overall expenses will rise, even though we will do our best to manage on the SG&A line, to make the appropriate trade-offs, and drive those investments in R&D, as well as though to make sure we're continuing to invest appropriately behind some of the key launches. So hopefully that gives a little more clarity than what I said earlier.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","And, Jami, with respect to KEYNOTE-189, as you know, we don't provide details of statistical analysis plans and health allocation. So I'm not going to go through that with you. But suffice it to say that we believe the overall survival part of the study is extremely important.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.","So let me just close the call by saying thank you again for joining us. We are executing well. And we expect topline strength from this year, particularly for KEYTRUDA, GARDASIL, and Animal Health to continue into 2018 and beyond.","We're also focusing on delivering a sustainable pipeline to drive our long term growth. And as a result, we'll continue to invest in R&D.","And I'd also like to just take a moment to acknowledge all those who were impacted by the storms in Puerto Rico and Mexico over the past couple of months. I'd just say the courage and resilience that's been demonstrated is notable. And I want to thank particularly our many dedicated employees who've helped us through that period. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"14253":["Merck & Co.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Alex Kelly, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Alex Kelly","Thanks, Brooke, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to Merck's 2011 Fourth Quarter Conference Call. Before I turn the call over to Ken Frazier, I want to mention a few housekeeping items. First, there are a number of items in the GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. We have excluded those items from our non-GAAP results, and you can see our reconciliation tables in the press release and also in Table 2 that accompanies the press release. That will help you get a better understanding of the underlying performance. ","Next, we've also provided tables to help you understand the sales of our key products around the world. There are 3 tables in the press release. Table 1 is the GAAP results. Table 2 reconciles GAAP, P&L items to non-GAAP. And the third table provides the summary of our product sales. During the call we will be referring primarily to Tables 2 and Table 3.","Finally, I'd like to remind you that some of the statements we make during today's call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The statements are based upon the current beliefs of management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. And I invite you to refer to our SEC filings including our 10-K, especially Item 1A which identifies certain risk factors and other cautionary statements which could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements we make today. You can see our SEC filings as well as our press release and other tables on our website, which is merck.com. ","This morning I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our President and Chief Operating Officer and Chairman of our board; Adam Schechter, our President of Global Human Health; and Peter Kellogg, our Chief Financial Officer. ","Now I'd like to introduce Ken Frazier.","Kenneth C. Frazier","Thank you, Alex. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call today. As we close out 2011, we remain as committed as ever to our mission of translating cutting-edge science into medically important products that make a real difference in people\u2019s lives. During the course of this last year, I had the opportunity to meet with many of our customers, including leading physicians, large health plans and health ministers around the world. What I consistently heard reinforced 2 points to me. First, there is still a progress agenda. The world will reward those companies that can create and deliver innovative medicines and vaccines that address unmet needs. Second, there is a productivity agenda. In the face of rising health care costs, those companies that can drive significant productivity gains, both for their customers and within their own operating models, will be the ones who survive and thrive. That is why doing great science and delivering customer value both in a sustainable manner remain the broader context for everything we're doing at Merck. Having said that, I'd like to now turn to our fourth quarter and 2011 results.","We closed out the year with a high-quality fourth quarter growing the top line 2% and the bottom line 10%. Our overall performance in 2011 confirms our ability to deliver strong operational results in the short term while investing for growth over the longer term. In addition, it gives us confidence that we can achieve our ambitious plans for 2012 and beyond. ","One of the differentiating success factors that allows companies to succeed over the long term is their ability to respond to the challenges they continue to face. I'm pleased with the way our teams responded to and overcame the challenges we encountered in 2011. In fact, we grew full year 2011 sales by 4% and leveraged our cost base to drive a 10% increase in non-GAAP EPS. This performance is an early indicator that we are on the correct path with our strategy, which focuses on executing on our plans to optimize our core business, expanding in key markets around the world extending our presence in complementary businesses like Consumer Care and Animal Care, and accelerate -- excelling at operating our business for maximum efficiency so that we can invest for future growth. We fully intend to execute this strategy well, which will lead to strong and sustainable cash flow and increase shareholder return. I outlined the fundamentals of this strategy during our recent R&D day, and today I will talk about how we executed against it in the fourth quarter and the full year. ","Our results this quarter and for the full year were driven by broad strength across our in-line portfolio with double-digit growth from our key brands. This growth underscores the benefits of maximizing our portfolio and has allowed us to maintain or begin building a leadership position in selected therapeutic areas. For example, JANUVIA is now the #1 oral antidiabetic medicine globally. As always, Adam will discuss our product performance in more depth. ","Among our major accomplishments in 2011 was protecting the value of one of our key franchises by successfully resolving the arbitration with J&J. As you will recall, the agreement allows us to maintain the majority of the REMICADE and SIMPONI value. We believe these products will make important contributions in 2012 and beyond.","In addition to driving growth in our key products, we remain firmly committed to translating cutting-edge science into medically important medicines and vaccines. Perhaps the most notable R&D accomplishment of 2011 was the approval and launch of VICTRELIS in North America, Europe and Latin America ahead of our competition. For the quarter, we had 3 additional developments: The approval and launch of JUVISYNC in the U.S., the first drug to be approved to treat both diabetes and high cholesterol; the affirmative vote from the ACIP on the routine use of GARDASIL in boys and young men; and the FDA approval for ISENTRESS in children age 2 years and older.","As we told you in November, we continue to focus on advancing the pipeline. Looking ahead, we plan to file 5 major products in the U.S. between 2012 and 2013 including: BRIDION, a first-in-class neuromuscular reversal agent; V503, a vaccine for the prevention of certain HPV-associated cancers; odanacatib, a once-weekly oral compound with a unique mechanism of action for the treatment of osteoporosis; TREDAPTIVE, our proprietary extended release niacin plus laropiprant; and Suvorexant, our new first-in-class treatment for patients with insomnia. ","We also have several important events this year in addition to our regulatory filings including FDA action on JANUMET XR, completion of the HPS2-THRIVE study and initiation of Phase III studies for our once-weekly DPP-4 inhibitor. ","Last year, we also made progress expanding in key markets around the world through targeted investments. In December, we announced the $1.5 billion R&D initiative in China, including a new Asian headquarters for innovative drug discovery and development located in Beijing. Overall, our emerging markets represented 18% of our pharmaceutical sales in 2011 and grew 7%. Many of the products that are driving our emerging market growth are products that are off patent in mature markets. Once again, this demonstrates the benefit of Merck's broad portfolio. As we launch and receive reimbursement for newer products in our portfolio, we see additional growth opportunities in the emerging markets.","Consumer Care and Animal Health contributed to our full year performance, demonstrating that our strategy to extend these complementary businesses creates value. Animal Health grew 11% this year. Notably, nearly half of this growth was from new products. The strength of our portfolio in Animal Health and anticipated launches and companion and production animal products positions us to perform well going forward. ","Consumer Care grew 1% for the year but was down 5% for the quarter. CLARITIN, our largest consumer brand, remains the market leader despite significant OTC competition. The decline in the quarter is also due in part to a softer fall allergic rhinitis season. We have strong brands that are well positioned in their respective segments.","Turning to cost management. I'd like to reinforce the point that I've made on several previous occasions. Our intense focus on decreasing fixed cost and realizing synergies gives us the flexibility we need to make appropriate investments for growth. This past year, we made the necessary investments while also achieving synergies. In fact, we have largely realized our original synergy target and as planned are on course to achieve the full target this year.","Moving forward, we will continue to make the right investments to operate our business, and we continually actively look for growth-driving opportunities. As I've said before, we are very focused on accessing innovation, both internally and externally. This includes business development, licensing and targeted acquisitions that bolster our existing portfolio and therapeutic areas where Merck is a leader or in areas that we are targeting for leadership. ","In 2011, we signed more than 50 agreements involving a broad array of partners. Once we have funded business operations and made targeted investments for growth, a key priority for us is returning cash to our shareholders. The 11% increase in the dividend payment last month shows the confidence we have in our business and in our pipeline and is a concrete example of our focus on shareholder value. ","As we begin 2012 and look ahead, we are optimistic about our underlying business, our current momentum and the early success of our growth strategy. And we continue to set high expectations for ourselves. New and innovative products are the main driver of value in this industry, so we intend to advance and augment our pipeline. We have a strong late-stage pipeline with nearly 20 programs in Phase III, and we expect to have many pipeline opportunities between now and 2013, including the 5 major programs I mentioned earlier.","Again, we are committed to delivering strong operational performance this year despite the known challenges such as the U.S. SINGULAIR patent expiration. We intend to maintain our revenues in 2012 at or near 2011 levels. If currency rates stay where they are today, they will put some downward pressure on our revenues. But on a constant currency basis, we are still aiming for revenues at or near the 2011 levels. We are also committed to continuing to reduce our cost base in order to deliver a leveraged P&L. Peter Kellogg will discuss our 2012 guidance in more detail in a few minutes. ","In closing, we had a good quarter and an overall strong year. As we begin 2012, we are positioning Merck to perform well by advancing our innovative pipeline, meeting the evolving needs of our customers around the world and achieving a more efficient cost structure, all of which will allow us to deliver shareholder value over the long term. Thank you for your attention. ","I'd like to now turn the call over to Adam Schechter.","Adam H. Schechter","Thank you, Ken, and good morning, everyone. It is a pleasure to speak with you today and to provide you with an overview of Global Human Health results. Let me begin with 2011 full year results where sales grew 5% to $41 billion. This performance demonstrates our strong execution of our 3 strategic priorities of growing the core, expanding the core and accelerating new launches. We consistently delivered growth each quarter and we overcame many external challenges. We contributed nearly $1.5 billion in growth to the top line once you exclude the impact of ForEx and the sales of REMICADE and SIMPONI from the relinquished territories in 2010. ","We also ended the year with another solid quarter. Human health sales grew 3% in the quarter or 5% excluding the sales from relinquished territories. Our performance was driven by growth from key in-line brands, new launch brands and important markets such as the U.S., Japan and China. So let me share with you how we did on each of the 3 parts of our growth strategy. ","I'll begin with our core business, which includes our largest markets and our core brands. In the United States, sales grew 5% and were driven by growth from JANUVIA, JANUMET, ISENTRESS, GARDASIL and VICTRELIS. Overall, our solid performance in the U.S. reflects our continued strong execution and our customer focus around our portfolio of innovative brands.","Moving to Europe and Canada. Sales on these markets declined 5% in the fourth quarter. However, if you exclude the products relinquished to J&J, sales were flat year-over-year. This was due to double-digit growth from JANUVIA, JANUMET, ISENTRESS and SIMPONI, as well as the launch sales of VICTRELIS. We have a strong portfolio of brands, and we're launching products that will enable us to grow volume in the EU. But we continue to anticipate a tough business environment, and we estimate a negative mid-single-digit impact from pricing pressure in 2012. ","Now I'd like to discuss the performance of several of our large core brands. I'll start with JANUVIA and JANUMET, which continued to have very strong performance, growing 40% to $1.3 billion this quarter. Despite multiple competitors in the market, JANUVIA and JANUMET have retained 76% share of the global DPP-4 market. The JANUVIA family is #1 in worldwide sales in the oral diabetes market. We are now launching JUVISYNC in the United States, and we anticipate hearing from the FDA shortly on JANUMET XR. Adding these brands to the JANUVIA family of products is expected to enable us to maintain a strong leadership position.","Sales of SINGULAIR increased 8% in the quarter. SINGULAIR will lose exclusivity in the United States in August, and we expect a significant decline in sales. However, SINGULAIR will retain exclusivity in the EU until February of 2013 and in Japan until 2016. We also expect to see continuing growth for SINGULAIR in many of the emerging markets. Japan and the emerging markets contributed about $1.1 billion to overall SINGULAIR sales in 2011.","ISENTRESS continues to be a strong core brand for Merck and it's a valuable treatment option in the fight against HIV. ISENTRESS grew 24% in the quarter and now has a 14% patient share in the United States. Combined sales of VYTORIN and ZETIA declined 6% in the quarter. ZETIA growth in the international markets most notably Japan was more than offset by VYTORIN declines in the United States. We announced last week that the FDA has approved an updated label for VYTORIN that includes results from the SHARP study in the clinical trial section. ","REMICADE sales in the retained territories, Europe, Russia and Turkey, grew 3% in the quarter. While REMICADE's market share remains relatively stable, the market growth this quarter was less than prior quarters. This was due to austerity measures in Europe and in Turkey. We anticipate that these pressures will continue in 2012. ","SIMPONI remains a strong launch brand and had over $60 million of sales versus $35 million for the same quarter last year in Merck's territories. ","Now moving to vaccines. GARDASIL maintained its strong performance this quarter, with 24% growth over the prior year. This was due to continued uptake of the male indication. ","ZOSTAVAX, sales for the quarter were $78 million. We are pleased that customer backorders have been filled, and we have resumed normal shipping times in the United States. We are building inventory to ensure a stable supply, and we are ramping up our promotional efforts for this important vaccine. ","Now I'd like to discuss how we're expanding the core. As part of the expanding the core strategy, we continue to make targeted investments in the fastest-growing markets, the emerging markets and Japan. In the fourth quarter, emerging markets reached sales of $1.9 billion, which were in line with the previous year. If you exclude the sales from the relinquished territories, the emerging markets grew 6% this quarter or 13% if you exclude exchange. China continues to be a key growth driver in emerging markets with approximately 30% growth this quarter. Our growth in 2011 consistently exceeded market growth, and we continue to invest significant resources in China.","Japan had another strong quarter. In Japan we had 23% growth or approximately 15% excluding exchange. The performance in Japan was driven by continued strong sales of JANUVIA, which is now our #1 selling product in Japan. We plan to continue to see growth in the Japanese market with JANUVIA as well as other launch brands, including BRIDION, GARDASIL and RotaTeq. ","Now I'll move to the third part of our strategy, accelerating new launches. We are launching many products around the world, which together contributed more than $500 million in revenue this quarter and over $1.1 billion in incremental revenue for the year. The launch of VICTRELIS, SIMPONI, BRIDION, SAPHRIS, DULERA and JANUVIA in Japan all contributed significantly to our growth this quarter. ","Now I'd like to give an update on VICTRELIS. Global sales in the fourth quarter were $87 million. In the U.S., we grew share 10 out of the last 12 weeks. We ended the quarter with approximately 36% TRx share. This is an overall increase of about 10 share points in the quarter. Internationally, VICTRELIS is now launched in 19 markets, including France, Germany, U.K., Canada and Brazil, and it maintains a greater than 50% patient share in many of these markets. We continue to believe that a significant opportunity exist for VICTRELIS for the following reasons. First, many treating physicians, about 40%, have not yet prescribed either protease inhibitor. Next, we still have a significant opportunity with the VA in the United States. And we're only just beginning many of our international launches.","So in summary, Global Human Health had a strong operational performance throughout 2011. We execute on our growth strategy by growing our core launch brands and expanding into the fastest-growing markets. We believe this momentum positions us well for success in 2012. We know that 2012 will include its share of challenges, including continued EU austerity measures, annualization of the transition of REMICADE and SIMPONI in some markets, and the loss of SINGULAIR exclusivity in the United States. However, Merck has a long history of overcoming major patent expiries and we are ready to manage this SINGULAIR as well. ","Our base is strong, it's diverse and it continues to grow. I believe we can deliver results in 2012 through our key growth drivers such as JANUVIA, ISENTRESS and other core products, with our launch brands and with our continued growth in the emerging markets and Japan. ","Now I'd like to turn the call over to my colleague, Peter Kellogg.","Peter N. Kellogg","Thank you, Adam, and good morning. As you heard from Ken, we delivered another high-quality quarter by continuing to execute on our strategy to drive top and bottom line performance, and we achieved this performance while continuing to make strategic investments necessary to fuel future growth. The actions we have taken and our performance in 2011 have established a strong foundation for 2012. We leave the year with strong business momentum that will help us succeed in 2012 and beyond. ","This year I will -- this morning rather I will briefly talk about our performance in the fourth quarter and full year 2011, and I will discuss our financial targets for 2012. But first, let me start with a comment about our capital deployment. ","In addition to the operational performance we drove this quarter, we continued to generate cash and execute on our capital allocation strategy. We continued to return a high level of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of our dividend and share repurchases in 2011. Given our strong operational performance and market conditions, we continued repurchasing our stock during the fourth quarter. And our confidence in the future of our business led us to increase the dividend 11% as of January 9. In total, we returned $4.7 billion in dividends and repurchased nearly 58 million shares at a price of $1.9 billion in 2011. ","Now let me turn to the operating results. My remarks will focus on our non-GAAP results, which exclude acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. Ken and Adam discussed the revenue performance, so let me begin with our expenses. ","Total operating expenses were about $120 million lower in the fourth quarter despite making growth driving investment. These reductions, combined with our top line performance, demonstrate the financial discipline we have instilled throughout the company while maintaining our commitment to growth. ","On product costs, our cost of goods were nearly $250 million lower this quarter, resulting in a non-GAAP product gross margin of 76.5%. The gross margin was higher on a year-over-year basis due to product mix and manufacturing efficiencies in addition to a benefit from foreign exchange. ","Moving on to marketing and administrative. This quarter, M&A expenses were $3.6 billion, an increase of about $200 million over the fourth quarter of 2010. This increase was partly due to targeted investments in product launches like VICTRELIS and in fast-growing markets like Japan. The remainder of the increase was mostly due to U.S. health care reform fees and other corporate expenses such as legal defense reserves. ","Moving on to R&D, this quarter we continued to invest in our most promising opportunities and advance the late-stage pipeline as discussed in November. We also made strides to improve our efficiency and incrementally reduce our R&D spending. Research and development expense this quarter was $2.1 billion, which is about $100 million lower than the fourth quarter of last year mainly due to savings from site closures. ","Moving to tax. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 19.9% in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year non-GAAP tax rate to 23.4%. There was a slight benefit in the fourth quarter from product mix and other items, but we still ended the year in the middle of our expected tax range. Our non-GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.97 per share, up 10% over the same quarter in 2010. Throughout 2011, we consistently delivered top line growth and a leveraged P&L, resulting in a non-GAAP EPS of $3.77, an increase of 10% over 2010.","Now let me provide some commentary on our 2012 guidance. As you know, there are 2 well-characterized headwinds in 2012: The U.S. SINGULAIR patent expiration in August and the annualization of the J&J settlement. In addition, there are some external factors that affect our revenue guidance as follows. First, we assumed mid- single-digit pricing pressures across Europe as well as from the biannual price reductions in Japan. Second, we assumed that we will retain revenue and equity income from the Astra JV for at least half of 2012, although AstraZeneca remains the -- or retains the ultimate decision about this option. ","Now despite these headwinds, the underlying momentum of Merck's business and the growth of our key products enable us to maintain our 2012 revenues at or near 2011 levels on a constant currency basis. However, we should talk about ForEx. So far, in 2012 the euro exchange rate as well as most other currencies are well below the level seen throughout most of 2011. At today's exchange rates, sales would be adversely affected by about 2% to 3%. ","Now let's discuss how the revenues will be spread throughout 2012. Based on the items I just discussed, we would expect sales in the first half to be stronger than the second half of the year, with the second quarter probably being the strongest quarter and the fourth quarter being the weakest. ","On R&D expenses, we expect to maintain our non-GAAP R&D expenses at about the same level as in 2011 on a full year basis. Now, individual quarters may vary based on the timing of clinical trials and grants, and we continue working to improve the efficiency of our R&D spending.","As Ken mentioned, we intend to be active in business development to augment our pipeline and maximize our business opportunities. However, it is hard to predict which deals may be consummated, their size or their timing, but we will let you know if any deals we complete affect our financial targets. ","Regarding tax, we expect our 2012 non-GAAP tax rate to be pretty similar to the 2011 rate, and it provided a range of 23% to 25% in 2012.","Finally, at current exchange rates, we expect our non-GAAP EPS to be between $3.75 and $3.85. As with revenues, we expect the second quarter to be the strongest quarter from an EPS perspective, and the fourth quarter the weakest. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be between $2.04 and $2.30. ","So to wrap up my comments, 2011 was a very good year. We grew the top line by more than $1 billion. We delivered a leveraged P&L to grow the bottom line even faster. We increased our share repurchase activity and raised the dividend to return more cash to shareholders. And as a result of the underlying momentum that we've established in 2011, the growth of our core products and the promising R&D projects we highlighted in our pipeline, we are optimistic and confident about our outlook for 2012. Thank you.  ","Now I'd like to turn call back over to Alex.","Alex Kelly","Thanks, Peter. Now we'd like to take the time to answer your questions. [Operator Instructions] So with that, Brook, we're ready to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.","Charles Anthony Butler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Two brief questions. Number one is, Peter, you've made some comments about revenue and earnings for '12. But I'm curious if you could comment a bit about gross margins. I'm making assumptions that you have some modest leverage in order to have some additional earnings per share. But the question really remains about pacing, would it be similar to what you said about Q2 versus Q4 on weaknesses. I'm making that assumption. But moreover, how do you think you might be able to end the calendar year '12 relative to '11? And then the second question is about VICTRELIS. And I'm just curious how Roche may be helping you, if at all, as it relates to the rollout, especially in the 19 regions outside the U.S.?","Kenneth C. Frazier","Peter, you want to start?","Peter N. Kellogg","Tony, so as you know we haven't given guidance on PGM, but I think the one thing I would say is that in general, PGM follows our revenue performance with obviously adjusting for product mix and manufacturing productivity and so forth. So I think that I don't think there's any big story. However, I would say -- I would highlight that, as you know, SINGULAIR goes off patent in the -- over the summer and so as you go from there on, that will be a slight shift in mix clearly as SINGULAIR becomes a much smaller part of our mix, and that's a good PGM product. But in general, we haven't given guidance, so I can't give you the details on that.","Kenneth C. Frazier","And Tony, with regard to VICTRELIS, the good news is that we do have an agreement with Roche that is worldwide wherever we're able to do it legally in any part of the world. And in those markets, they are detailing VICTRELIS and doing education with physicians and so forth. So the partnership has gone well, and I think that they've been able to help us in all markets around the world where legally we're able to do it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink Swann.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","So Peter, I'm just wondering again when I kind of look at the numbers, we've got about -- I'm guessing maybe $500 million kind of still in there from AZLP. Can you just help us understand what kind of a profit contribution that might represent as we go from the first half of the year to the second half? And then maybe for Adam, thanks for the details on SINGULAIR, particularly o U.S. and in the emerging markets. But can you give us a sense of the growth rates that we were seeing in Japan and the emerging markets with SINGULAIR? And then also, when we expect the patent to come off in Japan?","Alex Kelly","Okay, once again, Peter, do you want to start?","Peter N. Kellogg","Sure. So on AZLP, the joint venture, I don't really give the detailed P&L for AZLP, the relationship. But obviously, there's 2 parts. There's revenue and there's equity income. And really you could think of the equity income as going straight down, that's really income going right through. And then the revenue is just product sales, so it's pretty good margin. And again, I think that you got it right. We've assumed that we'll get a little over half of the year this year, but obviously that's just an assumption and we're pretty clear about that. And so it's up to AstraZeneca who will make that decision on their own.","Alex Kelly","Okay, Adam?","Adam H. Schechter","And, Seamus, with regard to the patent expiry of SINGULAIR in Japan is 2016, but it's also important to note that in Japan even after products go off patent, there's typically room for them to continue to do well. And if you look, Japan remains a very important growth driver for us this year but as we move into the future. We don't give specific product information for the emerging markets. We do give it for outside the U.S., but I would be careful because that includes Europe. If you look at the emerging markets and Japan, I would say that we're showing good growth for SINGULAIR, and we expect to continue to have good growth moving forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Gilbert with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Gregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First on Hep C, curious whether you're seeing any warehousing behavior given some recent developments in the space from an R&D standpoint? And what's the likelihood Merck is open to making an acquisition in the HCV space soon and how would you balance strategic desire and financial discipline on that front?","Alex Kelly","Ken, you want to start?","Kenneth C. Frazier","Let me start by trying to address how we look at the overall Hep C opportunity that we have in front of us and our strategy. First, we've tried to say very clearly that we are taking steps to maximize our VICTRELIS opportunity and we're pleased with the growth that we see in the U.S. as well as outside the United States. And beyond that, we're also aggressively pursuing new and more convenient interferon-free therapies focusing on MK-5172, our pan- genotypic protease inhibitor. Beyond that, I think what I would say is looking to expand on that, we would continue to look at this marketplace to try to find opportunities to create shareholder value creating partnerships or acquisitions. But we are going to always maintain financial discipline in this area as we have in every other area. And just going back to MK-5172, we see a number of opportunities with that drug because we think it can in fact be a very strong anchor for an all oral therapy. So we intend to study that drug with other drugs in our own pipeline that are at early stages. We\u2019re also again interested in partnering to study with other drugs in the hope of developing an all oral regimen that maximizes SVR and shortens duration of therapy and minimizes side effects. And if we're not able to reach the kind of partnership or accommodation and someone else reaches the market first, we don't think the game is over. We'll study MK-5172 with whatever drugs make it to the market to see if we can improve on the regimen. So we have a number of approaches, but at the end of the day, I want to just underscore that Merck has always tried to be financially disciplined in doing any kind of deal or arrangement, and will remain so in Hep C.","Adam H. Schechter","And then with regard to your question on warehousing, the first thing I'd say is typically there's a slowdown of new patients that occurs during the holidays, Thanksgiving and the end of the year holidays. And we think we saw that this year as well. With VICTRELIS because of the 4-week lead in, you had expected that to be extended a little bit into the beginning part of January. I think the key is that if you look at a product like VICTRELIS, it can help double the cure rate today. And physicians understand that, and they're still working through the patients that they\u2019ve warehoused, waiting for a product like VICTRELIS. At this point, we're not hearing of significant warehousing. There may be some people that say it anecdotally, but it may occur later. But right now, we don't think it's a significant impact.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Peter, just a guidance question. I'm a little bit confused because you talk about revenues being negatively affected by 2% to 3% if exchange stays where it is today. But guidance of $3.75 to $3.85 is also based on the current exchange rate. Can you just clarify that for me? And if you were to assume that the euro stays where it is today, should we assume then that the low end of the range is more realistic given that a 2% to 3% negative impact on the top line would take your revenues down to about $46.5 billion?","Alex Kelly","Peter?","Peter N. Kellogg","Yes, Jami, so everything you said by the way leading into the question is correct, you\u2019ve got it all -- that's absolutely right. And the EPS, we gave a range of $0.10, so that we have -- we can adopt -- we can fit in that range with a lot of different factors, one of which is foreign exchange obviously, but many other things that could be going on in the business. So I think it's not a bad assumption to think that perhaps the current exchange rate is a little bit lower than the range or not. But quite frankly, there are quite a few factors that move our EPS one way or the other. So I wouldn't -- even though in the guidance we pointed to ForEx to help you understand some of the moving parts, there's many different moving parts in the business, launches, competitive activity and so forth. And so likewise we're very oftenly exceed our expectations in our own execution of the business. So I think that at this early point in the year, I think the 10-point range, I would think of it as the full range and it's hard to kind of pin it down to any one factor if that's okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Catherine Arnold with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Catherine J. Arnold - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I wanted to ask you guys about the DPP-4 category. I guess, Adam, is there any reason why it can't double in the next 5 years with or without a positive outcome study from JANUVIA? And then on ZOSTAVAX, now that the manufacturing issues are resolved, what are you doing differently or incrementally on promotion in the U.S. or outside the U.S., and do you think we'll see 2012 as an inflection point on sales or will it take longer?","Alex Kelly","Adam?","Adam H. Schechter","Yes, so the DPP-4 category, it continues to show impressive growth. And I think it will continue to show impressive growth. But still only about 20% of patients are treated with DPP-4 inhibitors. With that said, many patients in this market takes multiple medications. And on average, they're on somewhere between 1.8 and 2.4 medicines for a diabetic patient and as disease progresses they end up on more medications. But the bottom line is we expect the DPP-4 class to continue to show strong growth moving forward. And we also are very excited about the once-weekly DPP-4 that we have in Phase II and looking forward to go into Phase III. We think that can be a tremendous contributor both on the convenience side as well, which is important by the way when you have issues around diabetics who sometimes are not as compliant as other people could be. We think that's a really useful thing for us to do, and we think that's a great opportunity for us, too.","Kenneth C. Frazier","With regard to ZOSTAVAX, we -- before we started significant promotion in the United States, we wanted to make sure that we had supply and that we'd be able to have continuous supply. We will begin increasing our promotional support through personal promotion and also nonpersonal promotion very significantly as we move through this year. With regard to outside the U.S., we've made significant progress in the existing facilities. We expect both products to be available out of our new manufacturing plant in Durham in late 2012 or early 2013, and that will allow us to make the product more broadly available internationally.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Anderson with Bernstein.","Tim Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I know you'll probably resist talking about Merck's financials beyond 2012, but can you at least say whether 2013 earnings are likely to be higher than 2012 or will the SINGULAIR patent expiry spill over into '13 and compressed performance? And second question is on IMPROVE-IT and the upcoming interim look. How will you be informing investors once it's occurred or has it already occurred? Quite a few investors seem nervous that this trial is going to blow up VYTORIN further, and I'm wondering if you can give us some idea how you\u2019re thinking about the different potential outcomes and whether the trial might have a better chance of successfully showing what it was intended to show than what some are expecting?","Alex Kelly","Okay, Peter, would you like to start?","Peter N. Kellogg","Yes, sure. So you're right, we haven't given 2013 guidance. I mean I think the one thing I would just take away from the 2012 guidance that we've talked about today is really every company has years in which they have a patent expiry or some sort of impact like that. And really the secret or the trick to this is to make sure that your underlying momentum is strong so that when you end up having the one impact of a patent expiry, the rest of your business is really growing nicely. And obviously, we've highlighted kind of how we see 2012 and how we've come through '11 with great momentum. And so as we go into '13, it's going to be all about the growth of that underlying business, how well the key products do, how well our emerging markets do, different pieces of what we're talking about. So we really haven't given guidance. But that is clearly the answer is that as you go through '12, you can watch our underlying business performance and you can pretty much gauge, is that strong enough to overcome the impact of a patent expiry? For '12, it certainly was.","Kenneth C. Frazier","I'll just add that from the very beginning, we've been very clear about the profile of the company that we'd like to be, and that involves driving top line growth and making prudent investments to ensure that we do have top line growth but growing the bottom line faster to leverage P&L, and that's still very much our intent and our ambition as we go through '12 and into the future.","Alex Kelly","And Tim, on the IMPROVE-IT trial, you're right, we do have the 75% interim look as planned for later this quarter. Obviously, the full -- if the trial goes to completion, that's more like a 2013 completion period. And if there are any changes in the trial as a result of the interim look, we'd communicate that pretty promptly. If there are no changes, we'll probably try to find the right communication vehicle for that information as well. So with that, we'll take the next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Boris with Citi.","John T. Boris - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","First question has to do with the 5 assets, Ken, that you'd mentioned and outlined. Two of those assets you currently sell in x U.S. markets, BRIDION and TREDAPTIVE. Can you give any color on the performance or revenues for those 2 assets in x U.S. and why you think or why we might be missing or why those assets, at least you believe, are significant or material assets for you going forward? And then a question for Adam, the $500 million on accelerating new launches, VICTRELIS, DULERA account for a little over $100 million of that. Can you give some granularity on what else is contributing to the $500 million of incremental revenue on the new launches?","Kenneth C. Frazier","I'll start on the 2 launch brands, BRIDION and TREDAPTIVE. I would say, first of all, BRIDION, we think has a terrific profile and it can be very useful in helping people in their postoperative setting. We think -- we've seen in Japan, for example, pretty strong uptake. We are hoping that we can get this drug approved in the U.S., and we really think it has a unique positioning because of its value and its innovation. I think on TREDAPTIVE, going forward, a lot of that will have to do with the outcome of HPS2-THRIVE, and we think if we can launch this drug in the United states and in effect, relaunch it outside the United States, accompanied by these kinds of outcomes, we think it can be a very significant contributor. But I'll turn it over to Adam at this point.","Adam H. Schechter","Yes, and the other thing I would add is that if you look at TREDAPTIVE, the sales are not significant outside of the U.S., but niacin sales have never been significant outside of the U.S. I believe that once we have outcomes data that shows on top of a statin you can get additional cardiovascular benefit, which is the hope of the HPS2-THRIVE study, that would increase the utilization not only for the United States but also outside of the United States. With regard to new product launches, SIMPONI in the retained markets, BRIDION in Japan, which continues to do very, very well, had $60 million of sales in the quarter. VICTRELIS, which had $87 million in the quarter, as well as SAPHRIS and DULARE are primary drivers of our global launches and to the $500 million that I talked about. In addition to that, we have JANUVIA in Japan, which continues to be large and fast-growing, Remeron in Japan, and we have GARDASIL that's just launching in Japan. So those are the product launches that are driving the majority of the dollars that I talked about.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum with ISI.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Number one, if I could maybe push you a little bit on a prior question, I think we got a partial answer but perhaps not a complete answer, and that is what might, to Adam, what might the commercial impact be roughly speaking if IMPROVE-IT were to actually show an outcomes benefit that was unambiguous? And then number two, Pfizer made some comments on their call several days ago that emerging market trends were actually below their expectations in terms of price reductions and secondarily volume. And I was just wondering in general, are you seeing the same things or are you seeing something different?","Alex Kelly","Okay, Adam, would you like to start this?","Adam H. Schechter","Yes. So let me start with commercial impact of IMPROVE-IT. Obviously, we're expecting that the IMPROVE-IT trial show benefit for VYTORIN. I think that it will reinforce what many physicians believe, which is the LDL cholesterol hypothesis, which says that as you lower cholesterol, LDL cholesterol more and you get patients to their goal, the better the outcomes and the better the benefit. So I think that it will prove to be something that physicians believe inherently anyway. With that said, we would have significant promotional support and we\u2019d put even additional emphasis behind the outcomes, and I think that there would be a positive impact assuming that the product -- that the trial is positive as you stated, and that's what our assumption is. So we hope to have that data as soon as possible. And once we do, once it's positive, we'll promote it very strongly and there will be an impact positively from it. With regard to emerging markets, we're pleased with our performance in the emerging markets. We are investing significantly where it makes sense to invest and we believe there'll continue to be significant growth. I've said before that in the emerging markets, there's always ups and downs, and you can't look at any one country as representative of all the emerging markets. So for example, in Turkey, there's significant pricing pressure at the end of last year and going into this year. And in many of the markets just pricing pressure that I believe will continue. The good news is that we have a very broad portfolio of products. And if you look at what we've been able to do is to grow 13% ex ForEx and when you account for the relinquished territories of REMICADE and SIMPONI. I believe we've been able to offset the pricing pressures that we've been under, which will continue by increases in volume. And we launched a campaign, which I spoke about before, called the next 10 brands. What we're doing is we're focusing on not only the brands that you typically think about, the brands that we talk about often, but we're going down to the next 10 and the next 10 after that. And in some of these markets, we have 130 products that are available to us and we have to find ways to maximize each and every one of those products and the opportunities that exist. So I believe there still remains significant opportunity in emerging markets. It will continue to be a difficult environment, there's no doubt about that. There will be pricing pressure that will continue, but I believe that we can be successful with our products and with our volume. And the last thing I'll say is if you look at China, I mean 28% growth in the fourth quarter, if you look at our volume growth, our evolution index is well over 120 in terms of volume in China and we're growing significantly faster than the market. So that's the type of performance we expect to continue in Global Human Health for Merck.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Scala with Cowen.","Steve Scala - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I have 2 questions. First, I don't recall Merck providing revenue and EPS guidance on a constant currency basis in the past. Is this the first time? If so, why is there a change in practice and will it be continued? And secondly, will HPS2-THRIVE be presented at the AHA? I know this is hair-splitting but in November I thought Merck said that HPS2-THRIVE was expected to end in 2012, and I thought today it was said it would end. So it appears something has changed, and I'm wondering if that moves up presentation as well.","Alex Kelly","Okay, Peter, you want to start with the first comment?","Peter N. Kellogg","Sure. Thanks, Steve. So no, there's no change in policy or approach, whatever. But I think what's happened is you've all seen obviously in the fourth quarter is the exchange rates have moved around a lot and none of us can actually sit here and forecast ForEx that well. So all we want to do is to highlight to everybody that in fact, at last year ForEx rates, there\u2019s one level of performance, but with the current ForEx rates, that's what we have worked with. That's the impact we would see. But importantly, Steve, just to make sure it's clear, we only talked about that at revenue. So at EPS, we have given you the EPS range at the current rates. So really I don't think there's any change in policy at all. We're just trying to help investors understand how ForEx impacts the numbers.","Kenneth C. Frazier","And just as a revenue matter, our goal is to try to be at or near our 2011 levels on revenue, notwithstanding the clear headwinds of SINGULAIR and other patent expiries on an operating basis. And what we're really trying to say and what we said back in November, that's what we intended to do is to be essentially level with 2011 on an operating basis, and I think we're clarifying that as that gets translated into dollars, obviously, there's some impact to foreign exchange.","Adam H. Schechter","And Steve on your HPS2-THRIVE question for TREDAPTIVE, the trial itself is expected to end this year. It's unclear at this point if it will end in time to have data presented at the American Heart Association meeting later this year. But our intent is certainly to have this drug filed in 2013. So with that, we'll take the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, Peter, you gave us a sense of fourth quarter '10 to fourth quarter '11. You went through some of the changes in the big deltas. Can you talk about SG&A in 2012 versus 2011, and kind of go through the key deltas there and tell us how much FX placed into SG&A?","Alex Kelly","Okay. Peter?","Peter N. Kellogg","Sure. So I think what you'll see in the SG&A for 2011 is that we did have a number of different things going on obviously in addition to just the commercial activity. I think people often think of SG&A as just Adam's promotion and selling resources, but obviously we have all of our corporate costs, legal fees, other things to go through there. So in 2011, there was an increase overall in non-GAAP marketing and administrative for the full year, and part of that was launch investments, investments in fast-growing markets like Japan, and we talked about those 2. Of course as you all know, health care reform came in so there were some fees that were increasing. All 3 of those factors were kind of equal amounts, roughly in the neighborhood. And then of course, we had some other corporate expenses that come along, and they\u2019re hard to always to predict. So some of them may have been legal expense reserves for different situations we're dealing with or other kinds of items. So those are the main drivers for this year -- for 2011. For 2012, you've seen we've done a lot of restructuring announcements during the year, this year as well, 2011. And obviously, we've known exactly what 2012 would look like, so I think we've planned very carefully what -- how to manage the year. A lot of the announcements we've done this year will give us a full year benefit in all parts of the company for 2012. So I think that will help us on SG&A. And I think that we're well prepared for exactly how to work through a year like 2012 and 2013. Adam, I don't know if you want to add any other comments or Ken.","Kenneth C. Frazier","Well, I'll just say again, I just want to reaffirm our goal is to have a leveraged P&L and you're seeing some positive impact on this in terms of foreign exchange, but we don't expect to see a significant increase in promotion, in selling dollars next year. We're continuing to work through our synergies to create the kind of operating model that will allow us to succeed in this kind of marketplace going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A question on VYTORIN. Just maybe on the type of impact you're expecting for the product from generic Lipitor as we go through 2012. And specifically, are you kind of seeing or feeling any incremental managed care pressures on VYTORIN given the generic? And then second, a broader question on the R&D budget. Merck is currently running a significant number of large outcome studies. I guess is this type of outcome study investment, particularly the number of studies you're running kind of a normalized number for Merck? And should we expect that some of these studies wrap up over the next couple of years that are going to be replaced by other programs? Or should we think about the outcome study investment and the number of trials you're running as something that could be declining over time?","Alex Kelly","Okay. Adam?","Adam H. Schechter","Yes, let me start off with VYTORIN and impact of Lipitor. We've been focusing our promotion of VYTORIN on the severely hypercholesterolemic patients. In general, the patient that has cholesterol levels that can't get to goal on a statin alone or would have to be titrated to a very, very high level of a statin prior to treatment. So I think that the positioning that we've been focusing on for the past couple years should help us because even if a physician were to use generic Lipitor, they probably would not be able to get that patient to goal and they would need to look at something else. Therefore, they'd either be able to switch to something like VYTORIN or they could think about adding ZETIA. And we believe that ZETIA in the marketplace will continue to do well. As more patients move to the generic statins, there'll be harder to get some of those patients to goal. And therefore, they'll have options to either move to VYTORIN or to add ZETIA. We are increasing our promotional effort behind ZETIA. We think that there is an opportunity for ZETIA in the marketplace particularly with generic Lipitor. We have not seen any impact on ZETIA since the launch of Lipitor generic, but we'll be watching that closely. And it's too early to see any impact on VYTORIN as well. But we believe that this franchise can continue to do well throughout the launch of the generics.","Kenneth C. Frazier","And on the R&D spend, Chris, I think we've tried to say all along that what we spend in a particular time is really a function of the assets that are moving through the pipeline at that time. Right now, we seem right now to be experiencing a bolus of big trials right now. And we also believe that these kinds of large trials, while they do cost a lot, can help differentiate these products when they come to the market.","Operator","Our last question comes from Michael Tong with Wells Fargo Securities.","Michael K. Tong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. Number one, just follow up on the IMPROVE-IT study, and I assume you guys are all risk managers here. What if IMPROVE-IT shows no benefit or maybe under the worst-case scenario some directionally very ambiguous results, what's your strategy on the VYTORIN franchise ex-U.S. as well as within the U.S. at that point? And then secondly, can you comment on what you're seeing in terms of patient enrollment for anacetrapib?","Alex Kelly","Okay, Ken.","Kenneth C. Frazier","So on the IMPROVE-IT question, I just would reiterate that we're very confident in the value of ezetimibe and we're also confident in what we see in every study, which is that lowering LDL seems to have a positive benefit. I think the SHARP study was another indication that lowering LDL in that particular population seems to have had a benefit. And so we continue to be confident that IMPROVE-IT will be a positive outcome study for us. Without giving any detail, we obviously look at a range of scenarios all the time in trying to run the business, and that's what we're trying to do.","Alex Kelly","And in terms of anacetrapib, that trial started enrolling patients in May 2011. And remember it's a 30,000-patient trial and we're right on track with our enrollment right now. So with that, Ken, I don't know if you had any closing remarks.","Kenneth C. Frazier","Well, just briefly, I want to thank you all again for attending and listening and for all your excellent questions today. So to wrap up, 2011 was a very good year in which we grew the top line by more than $1 billion. We delivered a leveraged P&L to grow the bottom line even faster than the top line, and we increased our share repurchase activity and raised the dividend to return more cash to shareholders. Thank you very much for your listening today, and we look forward to seeing you down the road. Bye-bye.","Operator","This concludes the Merck's Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call.

Today I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; Adam Schechter, President of Global Human Health; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Labs.","Before I turn the call over to Ken, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results, such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation of these in our press release. We have also provided a table in our press release to help you understand the sales in the quarter for the business units and products.","I would like to remind you that some of the statements that we make during today's call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor Provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.","If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings including Item 1A in the 2017 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning.","Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements. You can see our SEC filings as well as today's earnings release on merck.com.","Finally, in an effort to further improve our communications and transparency, we have posted a presentation to the investor section of Merck.com. This includes some of our highlights from this quarter and we will \u2013 throughout this morning's discussion, we will reference certain slides of the presentation.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Teri, and good morning, everyone. The strong performance of our business demonstrates that our innovation strategy is working, and that Merck is on the right track to deliver sustainable value to shareholders and patients. In addition to delivering solid results in the third quarter, we also continued to advance our pipeline with exciting new data readouts and milestones.","While there are many aspects of the business to highlight this quarter, I would like to turn first to KEYTRUDA's performance. This drug continues to lead the I-O field with the breadth and depth of indications across multiple tumor types.","We've executed well both in the clinic and commercially. And we are seeing firsthand how KEYTRUDA is making a tremendous difference to cancer patients around the world.","We are very confident in KEYTRUDA's near- and long-term growth prospects, as we continue to launch existing indications and look towards future approvals. We believe that our approach of following the science throughout KEYTRUDA's development has and will continue to successfully differentiate the medicine as a foundational cancer treatment.","We are also encouraged by LYNPARZA and LENVIMA, both targets of our strategic business development, as well as our other oncology assets in the pipeline that position us to further expand our leadership in oncology.","Beyond oncology, Merck has the strongest vaccine portfolio in our company's history, led by GARDASIL, which continues to experience healthy demand and growth. The Hospital and Specialty business is performing well. And our Animal Health business is an industry leader.","We have great momentum as we close out the year and prepare for 2019, given our existing portfolio and pipeline. And we are confident about our long-term outlook.","As a reflection of our confidence in our future growth prospects, today we announced a dividend increase, along with an accelerated share repurchase program, which Rob will talk about in more detail in a moment.","These actions are driven by our commitment to a balanced capital allocation strategy and supported by our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation that provide us the flexibility to return cash to shareholders, while also investing in our pipeline, innovation, and growth. Even with these actions, we continue to have ample capacity for business development, which remains a major priority.","Looking ahead, we are confident in the strength of our business. We believe that our well-balanced portfolio will continue to drive sustainable growth and value creation.","Along with the rest of Merck's world-class team of scientists and employees, I'm excited to build on our strong performance, as we achieve our objective of delivering innovative and urgently needed medicines and vaccines to serve the critical needs of patients, while enhancing shareholder value.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to my colleague, Rob Davis, to provide more detail on the quarter.","Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Please note that my comments today will be on a non-GAAP basis. In the third quarter, we delivered both top and bottom line growth, and we are well-positioned to finish the year strong.","Total company revenues were $10.8 billion, an increase of 5% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of exchange, third quarter revenues grew 6%. Our Human Health business grew 7%, excluding exchange. And Adam will provide more color on those results in a moment.","Animal Health sales totaled $1 billion in the quarter, an increase of 2%. And excluding the impact of exchange, sales grew 6%, with Companion Animal growing 7% and Livestock growing 5%.","We continue to see strong demand for our products. However, this quarter's revenue growth rate was unfavorably impacted by timing of purchases, as well as a shorter flea and tick season. Animal Health segment profits were $409 million in the third quarter, an increase of 5% compared to prior year.","Turning to the expense lines. Gross margin was 76.7% in the quarter, an increase of 100 basis points versus the third quarter of 2017, with the increase primarily driven by favorable effects of exchange. Recall, manufacturing variances related to the cyber-attack negatively impacted gross margins in the third quarter of 2017.","Operating expenses of $4.5 billion increased 6% year-over-year, including a favorable 2 percentage point impact from exchange. The increase was driven by R&D, which was comprised of higher oncology clinical spend, investments in discovery and early development, as well as licensing costs. Our tax rate of 18.9% for the quarter was roughly flat year-over-year. Taken together, we earned $1.19 per share, an increase of 8%, excluding exchange.","Turning to the outlook for the year. We are now narrowing our revenue guidance range and narrowing and raising our EPS guidance range for 2018, reflecting our strong operational performance throughout the year. For the full year, we now expect revenues to be between $42.1 billion and $42.7 billion, including a minimal impact from foreign exchange at mid-October rates. We now expect our tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. We now expect EPS to be between $4.30 and $4.36, including a roughly 1 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange at mid-October rates. All other aspects of our guidance provided on our second quarter call remain the same. A summary of our guidance can be found on slide 7 of our earnings presentation.","Before concluding, let me spend a few moments speaking about our capital allocation strategy, through which we are able to deliver for our patients, grow the business and ultimately create meaningful shareholder value.","As Ken mentioned, we are committed to maintaining a balanced approach to capital allocation, which you can see on slide 8. Our first priority continues to be to appropriately invest in R&D and support our key brands and launches in order to drive value creation. As we stated, funding opportunities in our portfolio that grow revenue remains our primary focus. Consistent with this focus, we also see significant opportunities to drive growth from increased market demand. And we will continue to allocate resources to position ourselves for success.","We now plan to spend roughly $16 billion on capital projects through 2022. This is up from our prior estimate of $12 billion that we announced in February. Our primary focus through these projects is to increase manufacturing capacity across our key businesses, including Oncology, Vaccines and Animal Health, where demand continues to be higher than originally projected, as well as to invest in our discovery and development operations and IT infrastructure.","We also continue to prioritize value-creating business development opportunities. We believe building a best-in-class pipeline will ultimately generate long-term growth and value for shareholders.","With our strong balance sheet, we have the financial flexibility to pursue all forms of business development, including acquisitions, partnerships and collaboration. We will continue to actively look at and evaluate those opportunities to create the strongest portfolio and pipeline.","While our primary objective is to fund the business, we have a strong track record of returning meaningful cash to our shareholders. Over the past year, we've returned approximately $10 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","Given the increasingly strong confidence we have in our pipeline, long-term revenue growth, cash flow projections and overall balance sheet strength, we've decided to grow our dividend above historical levels and increase our share repurchases.","Today, we announced that we will increase our quarterly dividend by 15% or by $0.07 to $0.55 per share beginning in the first quarter of 2019. In addition, the board has approved an additional $10 billion share repurchase authorization; giving us approximately $18 billion in share repurchase capacity. As a first step, we entered into a $5 billion ASR, with the remainder providing us the opportunity to flex our regular share repurchase program over the next two-plus years.","Given the strength of our balance sheet, we're able to return this cash to shareholders today, while retaining the ability to execute on any value-creating business development opportunities that further our growth strategy. We believe we have the ability to drive significant additional value to shareholders over the long term. And these actions are a reflection of that confidence.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Adam to provide more detail on our Human Health business. Adam?","Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Yes. Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. This morning I'll provide highlights on the performance of Global Human Health for the third quarter of 2018. My comments will be on a constant currency basis.","We continued to execute very well both in the U.S. and ex-U.S. markets. Sales this quarter grew 7% to $9.7 billion, driven by the strong performance of key products in our Oncology, Vaccines, and Hospital and Specialty franchises. We have overcome loss of exclusivity and competitive pressures on certain significant products. And we are optimistic about our future revenue growth prospects.","I'll now focus on key franchises starting with Oncology. With nearly $1.9 billion in sales this quarter, KEYTRUDA's performance after four years on the market is unprecedented not only in the field of oncology, but also in the pharmaceutical industry more broadly.","KEYTRUDA is now the leading I-O therapy in the U.S. in both new patient starts and total patient volumes and has become a foundational oncology treatment. Five applications are now on file with the FDA, and numerous registration enabling readouts are expected over the next 18 months. We look forward to launching additional indications and tumor types, such as renal cell carcinoma, where last week we announced strong trial results.","Our clinical results have demonstrated KEYTRUDA's benefit across a wide range of cancers. And our vast global regulatory and commercial capabilities have enabled us to rapidly bring this therapy to patients around the world.","KEYTRUDA's growth this quarter was driven by higher use in first-line nonsquamous non-small [cell] lung cancer patients, those whose tumors do not express EGFR or ALK. In the U.S., the robust survival benefit seen in KEYNOTE-189 is convincing more and more physicians of the benefits of using KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy across all of the newly diagnosed patients, including patients whose tumors express low levels of PD-L1 or non-expressers. We see continued growth of KEYTRUDA in this setting, as we further establish the benefits of the combination in the community setting.","Additionally, beyond lung, we see strong usage in our other proved indications and have leadership positions in head and neck, bladder, and MSI-High cancers. Merck's extensive global presence is helping to drive strong growth of KEYTRUDA in ex-U.S. markets. Use in first-line lung continues to increase, driven by further uptake of our monotherapy indication following reimbursement approvals.","In Europe, lung now represents a majority of our KEYTRUDA sales in all major markets. We received European approval in early September for the chemo combo and believe that our addressable market of first-line nonsquamous metastatic lung cancer patients in Europe has now tripled. Use of the chemo combo began immediately upon approval, as some large markets, such as Germany, have already begun reimbursing. And reimbursement discussions are beginning in other major markets as well.","Beyond KEYTRUDA, the strong growth in sales of LYNPARZA and LENVIMA add to our confidence in the potential of both of these oncology therapies to be meaningful contributors to Merck's revenue growth.","LYNPARZA leads the PARP inhibitor class in both new and total prescriptions. U.S. sales grew significantly, driven by growth in ovarian cancer as well as uptake from breast cancer. We are also excited by the first-line maintenance opportunity in BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer, given the very impressive SOLO-1 data presented this past weekend. And we look forward to the potential approval of this important indication.","Separately, we're making great progress in building our partnership with Eisai for LENVIMA, which continued to grow strongly. Following hepatocellular cancer approval in Japan earlier this year, we have seen rapid adoption of LENVIMA in that indication. Additionally, the recent hepatocellular approvals in the U.S. and Europe add to the existing indications in differentiated thyroid and renal cell carcinoma.","Now moving to Vaccines. Global Vaccine sales were nearly $2.2 billion this quarter, up 13% from a year ago. GARDASIL achieved over $1 billion in sales, reflecting strong demand worldwide. The China launch has been very successful and is a meaningful contributor to ex-U.S. growth.","GARDASIL is increasingly viewed as an anti-cancer vaccine for certain HPV-related cancers. Countries like Australia have increased vaccination rates to levels that could potentially help obtain the goal of cervical cancer elimination, driving demand and awareness as well as serving as a model for others.","In the United States, demand remains strong. And the recent expansion in our proved H cohort to include men and women up to age of 45 represents an exciting opportunity. We believe that GARDASIL has a very long run rate of growth ahead.","Moving to our diabetes franchise. Our diabetes franchise continues to be relatively stable with global sales of nearly $1.5 billion, about equal to year ago levels. Increased demand in ex-U.S. markets was offset by pricing pressure in the U.S.","Finally, our overall Hospital and Specialty business performed well, led by BRIDION, which again grew strongly this quarter. ZERBAXA is also growing with exciting future potential, given the recent Phase 3 success in hospital acquired bacterial pneumonia.","In the HIV space, we launched doravirine in August and believe it represents an opportunity for patients looking for alternative NNRTI therapies and a great bridge to our exciting HIV pipeline.","In summary, our Global Human Health business is very strong. And we remain confident in our growth prospects due to the solid performance in our Oncology, Vaccines, and Hospital\/Specialty franchises. We believe we are very well positioned and look forward to the future with great optimism.","With that, I'll turn over the call to Roger.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Adam. Well, as summarized on slide 10 of our presentation, the third quarter saw very important regulatory activity for KEYTRUDA, including the approval in Europe for the first-line treatment of metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer in combination with platinum-based therapy and Alimta, reflecting the integrated results of the KEYNOTE-021C, -021G, and -189 studies.","The KEYNOTE-189 results were also incorporated in the revised label for KEYTRUDA in the United States. As previously announced, KEYTRUDA was also approved in China for the treatment of advanced melanoma, the first such approval in China for a PD-1 directed therapy.","Slide 11 provides a summary of important regulatory and clinical catalysts. KEYTRUDA is under regulatory review in the United States for the first-line treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung in combination with appropriate chemotherapy, based on the KEYNOTE-407 results.","For the second-line treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, based on the KEYNOTE-224 trial, for the first-line treatment of Merkel Cell carcinoma based on KEYNOTE-017, as monotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer in an expanded population of patients with PD-L1 expression in at least 1% of tumor cells, based on KEYNOTE-042, and for the adjuvant treatment of cutaneous melanoma, following definitive surgical excision based on KEYNOTE-054.","The European [Medicines Agency] Committee on Human Medicinal Products have adopted a positive opinion for this adjuvant melanoma indication last week. And many of the other indications are under review in Europe and in other jurisdictions.","We've also made substantial progress in identifying new tumor settings, where KEYTRUDA can be used to advantage. At the European Society for Medical Oncology meetings earlier this week, Dr. Barbara Burtness of Yale University School of Medicine reported the results with the KEYNOTE-048 study, which addressed the first-line treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with KEYTRUDA, given either as monotherapy or in combination with platinum-based therapy in 5-fluorouracil. This study included an active comparator, the EXTREME regimen, which includes cetuximab as the platinum-based chemotherapy in 5-fluorouracil. And this is the standard of care for this disease in many areas. And employed a comprehensive statistical analysis plan to control Type I error.","The improvement in overall survival seen with KEYTRUDA monotherapy in patients with PD-L1 expressing tumors, as judged by a combined proportion score, with a hazard ratio of 0.61 in the CPS 20 or greater population. And the improvement in overall survival seen when KEYTRUDA was administered with chemotherapy hazard ratio of 0.77 in all patients as compared with the EXTREME regimen suggests that KEYTRUDA has the potential to become the new standard of care in the first-line treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.","As a result, we intend to incorporate previously-filed data from our second-line head and neck cancer study, KEYNOTE-040, in the U.S. filing for KEYNOTE-048.","In Europe, the CHMP adopted a positive opinion for the use of KEYTRUDA as second-line therapy in appropriate patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, based on the KEYNOTE-040 data. And hence we will submit a separate file containing the new KEYNOTE-048 data.","Meanwhile, important new data continued to emerge as shown on slide 11. The ESMO meeting, we presented the results of our Phase 2 KEYNOTE-057 study, which showed that more than 40% of patients with persistent or recurrent non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer achieved a complete response following KEYTRUDA monotherapy.","And just last week, we announced the results of the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-426 study, in which the combination of KEYTRUDA plus axitinib, marketed by Pfizer as Inlyta, improved overall survival, progression-free survival, and the overall response rate in the first-line treatment of locally-advanced or refractory renal cell carcinoma as compared with sunitinib. These data will be presented at an upcoming scientific meeting. And we intend to seek regulatory approval for this first-line indication around the world.","Beyond KEYTRUDA, our Oncology programs are advancing in important ways that are also shown on slides 10 and 11. At the ESMO meeting, we joined our colleagues from AstraZeneca in presenting the results of SOLO-1, a study addressing the maintenance use of LYNPARZA in patients with newly diagnosed BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer, who were in complete or partial remission following treatment with platinum-based regimens.","In SOLO-1, LYNPARZA reduced the risk of disease progression or death compared with placebo by an astonishing 70%, such that at the three-year time point, 60.4% of women receiving LYNPARZA remained progression-free, compared to just 26.9% of women receiving standard-of-care placebo.","Numerous future studies will address expanding opportunities for LYNPARZA in breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancer. And we eagerly await data from combination studies of LYNPARZA with KEYTRUDA, which will emerge in the near future.","During the third quarter, our partnership with Eisai led to the approval of LENVIMA for the first-line treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in the United States, the European Union, and in China.","We also received breakthrough designation from the FDA for the combination of LENVIMA with KEYTRUDA in the treatment of advanced or metastatic microsatellite stable endometrial carcinoma. LENVIMA is a very attractive partner for KEYTRUDA across a broad range of malignancies. As an example, our KEYNOTE-581 trial, exploring the combination of KEYTRUDA with LENVIMA in the first-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma, is well under way.","At the ESMO meeting, we also had the opportunity to highlight some newer programs in our oncology portfolio, including MK-1454, our STING agonist for intratumoral injection; and MK-1308, the CTLA-4 directed checkpoint inhibitor. Both drugs would be developed in combination with KEYTRUDA. And indeed, in light of the positive impact of KEYTRUDA across a broad range of tumor types, we anticipate that most of our new programs will seek in the first instance to expand the impact of KEYTRUDA still further.","Our teams are also active in other therapeutic areas. During the third quarter, we gained FDA approval for PIFELTRO, our second generation non-nucleosidal protease inhibitor for the control of HIV infection, which was also approved in combination with lamivudine and tenofovir under the brand name DELSTRIGO. The European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use also adopted a positive opinion for PIFELTRO and DELSTRIGO in September, meaning that marketing authorization can be expected in late-November.","We're also studying PIFELTRO in combination with MK-8591, our first-in-class nucleoside derivative that durably blocks reverse transcriptase translocation, as well as polymerase activity. Data from this Phase 2 study will become available towards the end of this year.","Our anti-microbial efforts include ZERBAXA, for which we reported positive results from our large Phase 3 study in patients with hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia using an investigational dose. These data will be submitted to regulatory agencies in the near future, as will data supporting our new beta-lactamase inhibitor, relebactam, which we have shown to improve clinical responses to imipenem in patients infected with carbapenemase expressing bacteria.","Also in the infectious disease arena, the FDA granted approval for GARDASIL 9 in women and men ages 27 to 45 as a means to reduce the incidence of certain HPV-related malignancies and dysplastic syndrome. We continue to see high interest around the world in developing strategies with the goal of broader control or even elimination of HPV infection.","We have many other important vaccine initiatives under way including V114, our 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine currently under investigation in Phase 3 trials; and V160, our novel vaccine for the prevention of primary CMV infection in healthy seronegative women, which is currently being evaluated in a large Phase 2 study.","More broadly, as shown on slide 12, we have a large set of late-stage clinical assets in cardiometabolic disease and neuroscience, for which data will become available in the relatively near future.","I'll now turn the call back over to Teri.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Roger. Darla, we'll be getting started with questions. Before we do, I just wanted to remind everyone to please keep your questions to one or two maximum, so that we can get to as many people as possible.","So, Darla, let's start off the Q&A portion, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question is from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Great. Thanks for taking the question. So and my first one is just a broader question for Ken. There was obviously the announcement recently that you won't be retiring at the end of next year. And I'm just curious how we should think about how that might impact your views on the longer term outlook for Merck or the company's strategy as we think about business development? Or a lot of questions around Animal Health and how you guys see that business in your company. Does the fact that you're staying on longer as a CEO impact how you guys are thinking about maybe doing something more transformational from a strategic perspective?","And then, the second one is a more specific question for Roger. And it's just around your STING asset you presented data (28:27) for last weekend. Just curious how you think about \u2013 I think in the data we saw the monotherapy impact was more limited than I was expecting. So how do you think about the need for monotherapy impact before moving forward with a combination approach, whether it's for STING or some of the other approaches you have in your pipeline? Thanks so much.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Vamil, for the questions. Let me start by talking about whether or not my extended tenure will affect how I think about transformational deals one way or the other. So our responsibility, as a management, team is to continue to focus on the best opportunities to put together the best portfolio to drive sustainable value. That remains our focus. While we remain disciplined in our approach, we're also committed to identifying and acquiring assets that will create sustainable value.","And as we've said in our comments earlier today, we have the capacity to do deals of all sizes and all types. The question is, are they the right deals for Merck? And that's what our management team debates. That's what we discuss. That's what our board debates and discusses. So to answer your question, no, I don't believe the fact that I'm expected to stay a little bit longer is going to change the fundamental analysis of all of these people about what makes sense from a sustainable value creation standpoint.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Yeah. And, Vamil, it's Roger. On MK-1454, the STING agonist that we presented at ESMO, I think it's important to remember that this was our first opportunity to describe this molecule. It's in the manner of a birth announcement. Birth announcements are important because they speak the potential. But the important thing to recognize is that 1454 can be given intratumorally effectively. It stimulates inflammation. That was clear.","And if you looked at the pattern of tumor response, the injected tumors had more response than the abscopal effect in combination with KEYTRUDA, which suggests that there's something going on there besides just KEYTRUDA itself. But, boy, it's early days, so we have very few patients. And as I indicated, we see these kinds of therapies as being adjunctive. What we're seeking to do is to improve still further the response to KEYTRUDA.","So, so far so good. Let's see how we do. And we're enthusiastic about these kinds of approaches, not just 1454, but other inflammatory mediators, including oncolytic viruses, including TLR agonists and other things that we are studying in this setting.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Next question, please, Darla.","Operator","It's from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Chris Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much for the questions, and also appreciate the additional color you guys are providing in the slide deck. So I just had a couple of questions here. Maybe first, first-line renal. Just would be interested in your perspective with some data at ESMO, and obviously your data pending, how you see the PD-1\/PKI combos fitting into the treatment landscape, particularly relative to OPDIVO\/YERVOY?","Second question I had was on KEYTRUDA in first-line lung in Europe. I know you've got a recommendation there. But can you just elaborate a bit more in terms of where we stand today in terms of penetration? And how quickly you are expecting a ramp, given the positive recommendation on KEYNOTE-189, as we think about the rest of this year and into 2019?","And if I can slip a third really quick one in there. Could we just get an update on KEYTRUDA usage by tumor type in U.S. and ex-U.S. as you've done in the past? Thanks so much.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","So, Chris, this is Roger. Let me try the renal first. And then Adam can take on the other issues.","With respect to first-line renal, of course we haven't presented the KEYNOTE-426 data. We announced top line results. And it's important to recognize that those top line results came from the first interim analysis, where KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib met its endpoints in terms of progression-free survival and overall survival both, as well as the key secondary endpoint of response rate. Those are important results at this first interim. And they speak to the power of the combination.","Obviously what people are going to be interested in is, how much treatment effect is there and at what level are there adverse effects? In this setting, in renal cell carcinoma, as is typical, efficacy is extremely important. And I think people are going to be very, very interested therefore in looking at the efficacy results, the overall survival results that we've obtained with this combination. Suffice it to say that we're enthusiastic about it.","Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Hi, Chris. This is Adam. Let me start by giving you the percent breakout by tumor type. And I've always provided this for the U.S. and outside the U.S. The caveat is, it's very hard to get data. And it does differ by country.","But in the U.S., if you look at non-small-cell lung cancer, it's about 65%; about 10% melanoma; 5% head and neck; 5% bladder; 5% MSI-High; and then about 10% all other indications.","When you look at Europe, and lung, as you know, we've been launching the monotherapy for patients who have PD-L1 greater than 50, and we're making significant in-roads. And as I said, now in the major European markets, lung is the largest tumor type versus all the other tumor types. So we are seeing significant growth there.","With the combo, that will triple the size of the eligible market. So obviously that's going to be a much bigger market for us. But as I've always said, when it comes to first-line lung, ramp-up is slower, because you're not getting a lot of patients that have been treated before, failed, and come in in a bolus. It's as each person comes in, is diagnosed, that the chemo combo will be considered.","Also in countries like Germany where you have reimbursement right away, you'll start to see sales come in quickly. But in other markets, we're working on reimbursement to get that as soon as possible.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks, Adam. Darla, we'll move on to the next question, please.","Operator","It's from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Just a couple for you, Ken. I noticed that at a recent competitive conference, you characterized margin expansion potential as being meaningful. And I think that's the first time you've actually used the word meaningful. Can you just elaborate a bit on what you mean by that? And if at any point in time you would expect the company to provide a line in the sand in terms of where you see that going?","And second question, you won't be at all surprised I'm asking. But while we recognize and you've been very clear that Animal Health is a strong pillar for Merck's growth and diversification, based on the math that we done \u2013 we have done, we see an approximate $12 per share upside if the market were to value your Animal Health business in line with Zoetis and Elanco, both of which have obviously been hugely successful.","If you don't consider spinning this business, which it sounds like you're not, what steps can you take to highlight its value? And what conditions are you looking for in order to consider changing your mind? Or should we expect that Animal Health will be part of Merck indefinitely? Thanks.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.","So the thing I would say about this, Jami, is that, first of all, we actively evaluate our portfolio on an ongoing basis. So you shouldn't expect that any decision that we are making today will necessarily be the decision that we make forever. But we are actively evaluating our portfolio to decide what we think makes sense in terms of our overall strategy of driving sustainable value and growth for our shareholders.","I also want you to know that we do pay attention to what happens on the outside world. In fact, we share the market's excitement around Animal Health's value as a sector and our business in particular. In fact, we believe that we've run this business very well inside the company, compared to its competitors.","So if you look at our business, it's a global leader. We continue to view it as one that we can be a good owner of. When you look at it, it has industry-leading growth in margins.","And so as we think about it, again, coming back to what I said at the beginning, we have to actively review our portfolio, looking at multiple factors, including market development, to decide whether or not a particular asset, not just Animal Health, should remain in our portfolio. And we'll continue to do that on an ongoing basis.","With respect to the issue around margin expansion, we did say that we expect meaningful operating margin expansion over time. We see the growth of certain parts of our business like Oncology as being very helpful to driving that kind of margin expansion.","But as it relates to being more specific and putting numbers around that and time periods, at this time, we don't know that that's the right thing for us to do. We will continue to give guidance in the way that we normally do it on an annual basis. But I don't really think it makes sense for us today, as we're seeing this business grow and expand, for us to try to say a specific number in terms of what the margin expansion will be.","What I can tell you is that we will continue to work very hard to drive that margin expansion. At the same time, making the right kinds of investments that we need to make to drive our growth over the next few years.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks. Darla, let's move on to the next question, please.","Operator","It's from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thank you very much. Ken, given your demonstrated confidence in your long-term growth prospects now, why do you still see business development as a priority? I appreciate that you have the capacity. But just because you can doesn't mean you should. So is business development a key? Are you looking at it as a priority because of risk management reasons, given your KEYTRUDA exposure? Or is something else driving this?","And if I could, a follow up for Roger. Just wondering about your updated CTLA-4 data. Some interesting activity. Seems to have better safety than what we're seeing with the YERVOY combination. But just as this field evolves and as you get more information from CheckMate-227 and other competitive agents, I'm just wondering where your CTLA-4 ranks as a priority for you. Thank you.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.","So on business development, let me start by saying that we're pleased with the way in which our business is growing now, particularly in the Oncology field. But that doesn't make us comfortable.","At the end of the day, we know that we have to continue to build our portfolio and build on our pipeline. And that's why it's an important priority for us going forward.","Going back to the question that was asked a few questions ago, that's the situation that we face as a company. Our pipeline is never going to be strong enough. We can always add to our pipeline. And that's not just a question of de-risking, it's a question of driving our future growth.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Yeah, and, Alex, on MK-1308, you're right. I mean, our molecule looks pretty good. I mean, we've worked quite hard to select a CTLA-4 directed molecule and to try and establish what the appropriate dose and schedule would be for such a molecule.","And we are interested in the question. Not sure why, but the combination looks a little promising. And so we think that there may be a possibility for it. We're sort of still stepping through it. Haven't made explicit decisions. But it looks like there may be an opportunity there. We wanted to make sure that people were aware of what we were seeing. And we did present the data at ESMO for that reason.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Great. Let's move on to the next question, please.","Operator","It's from Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim.","Seamus Fernandez - Guggenheim Securities","Thanks very much for the questions. So maybe the first question is really around business development. A number of times on the BD, in your prepared comments, I think about six times, you mentioned business development as a priority.","So maybe, Ken, if you can just give us a little bit of an incremental sense, or perhaps Roger could opine as well, on the areas where you think adding to the pipeline and really targeting the timeframe, the sort of post-JANUVIA timeframe, as a key opportunity. Yeah.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.","So I \u2013 let me just \u2013 oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Go ahead and finish. I'm sorry.","Seamus Fernandez - Guggenheim Securities","No. That's okay. I'll follow up with my second question after you go.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.","No, I think you should go ahead and ask it, so that way we can have them all.","Seamus Fernandez - Guggenheim Securities","Okay. Then you can proceed. So and then maybe, Roger, just two quick questions for you. Maybe you can just give us a sense of, in the wake of the first-line kidney cancer result as you've seen it, do you see a meaningful opportunity to improve upon the data with other TKIs like LENVIMA in the same setting?","And then just my last question. The KEYNOTE-522 study, we're on the cusp of it. Maybe you could just help us understand the opportunity in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant TNBC setting. Thanks so much.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Seamus, and I apologize for interrupting. So with respect to business development, it remains an important priority for us, because it's our job to find the best scientific innovations that will enhance our pipeline. We think building a best-in-class pipeline is ultimately what generates long-term growth and value for shareholders. And that's what we intend to do.","And let me turn it over to Roger now.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Right. Well, I mean, if I could, on the business development side, I think everybody recognizes that for any pharmaceutical company at our scale, it will always be the case that business development contributes materially to our pipeline. It must be the case. And typically something over a majority of the molecules that we develop are licensed in from the outside or acquired in some way.","If we can acquire those in a way which also adds meaningful revenue right from the beginning, terrific. But we're fundamentally interested in the best science, the best opportunities that could have the biggest impact on patient care. I think that should be clear.","With respect to first-line renal, I don't want to pre-judge any data that we would see from other combinations. We've had data that we presented previously and discussed after ASCO of the combination of KEYTRUDA with axitinib and with lenvatinib. And those data are both \u2013 both datasets were extremely interesting.","We're charging ahead in the lenvatinib story. Every single one of the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors will have slightly different characteristics. And I don't think there's any way to predict exactly what those are going to look like. But certainly the success of LENVIMA in the hepatocellular arena is very promising. And of course the work that we've done in endometrial as well. So we're enthusiastic about those combinations.","And lastly, you're right. KEYNOTE-522 is getting close to the point where there would be a DMC review. We are expecting that that will happen this quarter, fourth quarter.","And in principle, I mean, it's very hard to predict what those data will look like. But in principle, anything that can add \u2013 improve responses in the triple negative breast cancer population obviously would be extremely welcome. A very aggressive disease, a concerning disease, and so we're looking forward to seeing those data.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks, Roger. Let's move on to the next question.","Operator","It's from Andrew Baum with Citi.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you. So a couple of questions for \u2013 well, one for Roger and then a couple for Adam. So you recently \u2013 Merck published a paper in the JCO [Journal of Clinical Oncology] commenting on inflammatory signatures in TMB as biomarkers for responsiveness. In light of the recent disclosure from CheckMate-227 around TMB as a predictive factor for overall survival, how does that influence how you're thinking about the future role of TMB in various combinations within your own studies?","Second, for Adam. Ken has referenced business development as being critical part of Merck's focus. Obviously, the reimbursement outlook in the U.S. is very dynamic. The President's going to address, what looks like, Part B this afternoon. I'm interested how you think about that dynamism and valuation in light of business development? And where you're leaning in terms of where you see the most risk from proposed and potentially enacted reform?","And then, finally, just a couple of quick comments on the future expansion of GARDASIL that you alluded to, both from China, but also from vaccination of males throughout Europe and the timelines for that? Thank you.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","All right. Let's start with Roger.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","So, yeah, Andrew, thanks for the question. With respect to TMB, I have to say I'm not much influenced by reports from a single study like CheckMate-227, where there was relatively modest ascertainment. We didn't have a lot of information from patients and patient subsets.","We've done quite large studies on TMB, comparing TMB to inflammatory signature. The JCO paper you referenced is one of those. There's quite a large series coming out in the Frontline journal very soon that describes a more comprehensive analysis.","You and I could talk about the underlying science here. It's quite interesting. I think that the question of how it is that mutation influences response rate, which it clearly does, is important to understand. People jump to the conclusion that that's neoepitopes and improved immune response; not so clear for a whole variety of reasons.","And, nevertheless, it's something that's very important to study and to understand in depth. And we continue to do that. We do not see tumor mutational burden as a test that could be implemented in any near term as a way of selecting patients who would be appropriate to treat with KEYTRUDA monotherapy, for example. And as we know, in the combination therapy setting, the utility of KEYTRUDA with chemotherapy is quite broad.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Go to Adam.","Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.","And, Andrew, with regard to business development in the U.S. specifically, obviously the U.S. remains extremely important as we think about the future. And I believe that when we find products that make a significant difference in the world, and those that there's nothing that competes in new areas, that the U.S. will continue to have good reimbursement for those types of products.","I would not want to be a late-entry, non-differentiator product. And I wouldn't want to necessarily be a new mechanism that doesn't give significant additional benefit. So when we're looking at business development, we're looking for real breakthroughs that can increase the health of large numbers of patients.","With regard to GARDASIL, we're seeing growth, very strong on a global basis. And if you look, we sold just over $1 billion. A lot of that was due to demand, but it's also from the CDC stockpile borrowing. The thing with Vaccines is it's very lumpy and you have to be careful looking at any one quarter. But if you look over time, we believe GARDASIL represents a very significant growth opportunity.","If you look at the new indication in the United States, that's a big additional cohort. But also if you look at China and even in Europe, where we've taken back GARDASIL from the joint venture last year, we're seeing real big growth opportunities there. And then, lastly, I'd say other countries are looking at what Australia has done and they're already beginning to think about whether or not to implement those types of programs. So we see a real long runway of growth for GARDASIL over time.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Adam. We'll move on to the next question, please, Darla.","Operator","It's from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.","Timothy Minton Anderson - Wolfe Research, LLC","Thank you. A few questions. You talked about spending more on capital projects, with part of that going towards manufacturing. One of those products is KEYTRUDA, though there is GARDASIL. And my question is, whether as you look forward over the next couple of years is there the chance that demand will outstrip supply? I know with Vaccines, for example, manufacturing can be very tricky. So is there any sort of risk we should anticipate in terms of sales kind of being capped until manufacturing is fully up and running?","And then, going back to GARDASIL, you guys seem to be flagging that that could be an under-appreciated opportunity. So you just touched on this I think in your last comment. But can you just talk about where you are with health authorities and payers in the various markets in terms of a broad embrace on vaccinating both boys and girls as a way of preventing different cancers?","And if that product this year is going to sell $3 billion, is it unrealistic to think that over time it could do something like double in size? I'm trying to quantify what you think is the opportunity that you guys keep highlighting.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Great. Let's start with Rob on the CapEx.","Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Morning, Tim. Thanks for the question. So if you look at where our capacity is expanding, you are correct; it is around Vaccines, GARDASIL in particular, but frankly our broader Vaccines portfolio, KEYTRUDA and Animal Health. So it is really spread across all of the key growth areas of the company.","And it's important to point out, and I'll let Adam speak specifically to what we see as the long-term demand in the marketplace. But as we look at the supply we've been able to bring to the market, we have meaningfully increased our GARDASIL supply over the last several years, including coming into this year.","As we look forward, we also have the ability to continue to increase supply on a meaningful basis going forward. So we are making the necessary investments to ensure we can drive growth in this product and are very confident in that fact. And I'll turn it over to Adam to maybe give some specifics beyond that.","Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Rob; and, hi, Tim. Yeah. So we really are seeing unprecedented increase in worldwide demand for the HPV vaccines. And it's doubled in the last year alone in terms of demand necessarily. A lot of the increase in demand is driven by the policy change for Gavi countries. And many countries are moving from demonstration programs to multi-age cohorts.","So as Rob said, we are really working hard to increase the global supply of the HPV vaccines and it's a top priority for us. And we have plans in place to really significantly increase the global supply from our 2017 base, as we look over the next three years. And I do think the demand is going to really continue to grow, so we're going to need that supply.","As you look around the world, different countries are putting in place different mechanisms to ensure vaccination. So if you look at Brazil, you have a very different profile than say a country like France. So it's hard to give generalizations.","But I would say the highest level is that people are really beginning to understand the importance of vaccinating both men and women for the approved cohorts in the countries in which we're launched. And the demand will continue to grow. And after nine years in the market to see the growth that we're seeing is really unprecedented. And I believe that that growth will continue to be very, very strong.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Great. We'll move on to the next question.","Operator","It's from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. I had three if I may. First, we're seeing some proposals come out of Trump administration, not formally proposed. But KEYTRUDA and the other I-Os are being proposed as some of the top Part B priorities, where they're seeing a price disconnect between U.S. and ex-U.S. So I'm just curious how you guys see this play out? One.","And secondly, Ken, for you on margins. I guess the question really is, when investors hear you speak about margin expansion, there's this assumption that perhaps what it's implying is a margin expansion that may be beyond what's in consensus already. Because consensus has it going up 500 bps, 600 bps from current levels. I'm not sure how much granular you want to get there. But just wanted to get your temperature on that in general.","And then finally, Roger, we noticed for your upcoming neoadjuvant triple negative breast trial, the powering was increased by 35% a few months ago. Just wanted to get some color around the thought process behind that decision? Thank you.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.","So let me start with the pricing question. So let me start by saying, I think right now there's a lot that's being talked about in Washington. But we really need to see further details to better understand how all this is expected to be implemented.","What we do agree with is that we need to find ways of getting patients more meaningful access to these Part B drugs.","But at the end of the day, while we're open to that, we would be opposed to anything that would actually create a problem from the standpoint of patient access or innovation.","But again, it's really early to try to comment on some of the things. I know the President will be speaking this afternoon. And we'll just have to continue to interact with the administration and Congress on those issues.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Great. Rob, maybe you can take the margin expansion?","Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.","Yeah. No. Umer, thanks for the question. I don't want to comment specifically on how we look relative to consensus. I think the key message here that we want to make sure people understand is that we do expect to see meaningful margin expansion due to the mix of the business and our ability to continue to drive leverage through a productive use of our investments to drive faster top-line growth over time. So really, that's the message. How that compares to consensus, we're not going to comment.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","And, Roger, you want to finish up?","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Yeah, Umer, on KEYNOTE-522, you know I'm a huge believer in adequately powering studies. I really am.","And Roy [Baynes] and I spend a lot of time thinking through the issue of how to ensure that the results that we'll get from a study will be as definitive as possible.","The important point to recognize and sort of \u2013 I know you know this. But we don't see data that results in our change in the study. The study is going on. And we don't know what the results are.","But what we do is we simply look at everything that we've learned from everything that everyone is doing and ask questions about how we should improve the way in which the study proceeds. And so we'll see where we get to. We're not always going to do it exactly right, but we do the best we can.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Great. We're going to try to get a couple more in here. Darla, next question.","Operator","It's from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. I will follow the instructions from Teri very closely, unlike some of my competitors.","So my two questions are, number one, could you please provide the percentages of U.S. sales that Merck generates from Medicare, including Medicare Part B?","And second, could you talk a little bit more about Animal Health growth? It was 6%, which is solid organically. But I just don't have a sense for what we should expect going forward in that business. I think there was some moderation in the organic growth. And if you could give us a sense for how we should think about future organic growth prospects, that would be great. Thank you.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","We'll start with Adam.","Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Yeah. So, David, thanks for the question. We don't really break out segment growth. And the reason why is because if you look at our portfolio, it's changing every quarter and growth is coming from different areas, some of which are much bigger in Medicaid than Medicare. And we don't \u2013 it's very hard, because a lot of the data you also get is retroactive versus where you are today.","But in general, you know that KEYTRUDA is reimbursed through Part B. You can tell that Vaccines are reimbursed differently. And I think as we go forward, obviously Oncology is going to play a much bigger role for us.","Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.","Yeah. And to your question about Animal Health, as I commented in the prepared remarks, I wouldn't look at what you see as the \u2013 what could appear to be the slower growth in the quarter as any indication of what's going on in the business, as I said.","There really are some timing impacts. We actually had some customer purchases in the Companion Animal space that positively impacted the second quarter. It was a buy ahead of a price increase. That is affecting the comps. If you adjusted for that in the third quarter, you'd actually see Animal Health growth very much in line, where it's been consistently.","And as we look longer term, as we said in the past, we see this business driven by our innovative pipeline, which comes from the synergies we get with our Human Health business, to continue to drive strong, above-market growth for this business over the long term. So that hasn't changed. And our confidence in this growth profile continues to be very strong.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Rob. And unfortunately, I think we're going to have to close the questions there. Dave, I really appreciate you listening to the instructions. And hopefully next time we'll be able to get more questions in.","I'll toss it over to Ken to close.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.","So I want to thank you all for your continuing support and interest in Merck. We are energized by the momentum in our business right now. And we believe our portfolio of opportunity is better than it has been at any time since I've been here at Merck.","We look to the future with great confidence about what we can deliver for our patients and shareholders.

[Operator instructions.] At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Alex Kelly, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. ","Alex Kelly","Thanks, operator, and good morning everyone, and welcome to Merck's Fourth Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Before I turn the call over to Ken, I just want to point out a couple of items. ","First, you\u2019ll see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items, and you should note that we've excluded those in our non-GAAP results. There are reconciliation tables available in our press release so you can get a better understanding of the underlying performance.","We've also provided tables to help you understand the sales results in the quarter, for the business units and also for the products. That\u2019s in Table 3 of the press release. And the reconciliation table I mentioned is in Table 2 of our earnings release. During the call, we'll be referring to primarily Table 2 for the P&L and Table 3 as it relates to revenue.","Second, I'd like to remind you that some of the statements we make during today's call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. ","Such statements are based upon the current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements.","Our SEC filings, including item 1A in the 2011 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement. And you can find our SEC filings, as well as today's press release, on merck.com.","This morning, I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our President, Chief Executive Officer; Peter Kim, President of Merck Research Labs, Adam Schechter, our President of Global Human Health; and Peter Kellogg, our Chief Financial Officer.","With that, I\u2019d like to introduce Ken Frazier.","Ken Frazier","Thank you, Alex. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining the call today. I\u2019m pleased to be with you today. As we close out 2012, we see continued evidence that our focus on a core growth strategy to create shareholder value has us on the right track. We expected that 2012 would be a challenging year, particularly with the Singulair patent expiry as well as pricing and austerity challenges.","Despite these challenges, we were able to maintain our top line at 2011 levels without resetting our revenue base, as we committed to you at this time last year. We also committed to continuing to reduce our cost structure in order to deliver a leveraged P&L, and it is is clear that we delivered on both fronts.","By driving growth in our broad product portfolio, and reducing costs, we were able not only to absorb the impacts of a challenging year, but also reinvest for future growth. In addition, we returned more than $7.5 billion to shareholders last year by increasing our dividend 11% and increasing our share repurchase level to $2.6 billion. ","In 2012, we also said that we would advance the pipeline, and we did just that. Although we were disappointed by the outcome of the HPS2-THRIVE trial, we successfully completed four new drug apps last year, with more on the way this year. Before I continue, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Peter Kim, who will provide a brief update regarding odanacatib. Peter?","Peter Kim","Thank you, Ken, and good morning everyone. As you will recall, last July the data monitoring committee for the fracture trial recommended the pivotal study be closed and the extension study, which includes more than 8,000 women, continue. We have just recently received data from the pivotal study, but do not have data from the ongoing extension trial.","We have decided to include data from the extension study in our filings for regulatory approvals. The extension study is double-blinded. Patients and investigators are blinded. Our plans to present the data are dependent on our need to maintain the blind in order to file. ","Therefore, we do not intend to present the results of the pivotal study, and we do not intend to provide additional information on safety or efficacy until after we have locked the database for the filings. We will then present the data at an appropriate scientific meeting.","Let me underscore that we continue to believe in the potential of odanacatib to address unmet medical needs for patients with osteoporosis and look forward to filing in 2014. Ken?","Ken Frazier","Thank you, Peter. As we begin 2013, we face higher hurdles from patent expirations and many of the same external challenges we saw last year. Nevertheless, we are well-positioned to meet those challenges with the growth of our underlying portfolio and our four-part growth strategy.","Our strategy provides solid footing for navigating marketplace volatility, weathering the inherent unpredictability of innovative R&D, and driving shareholder value. Once again, our team\u2019s ability to execute our strategy well gives us confidence that we can maintain sales near prior year levels on a constant currency basis.","The breadth and strength of our product portfolio was a significant contributor to our overall growth last year. On the human health side, pharmaceutical sales grew 1% for the year, excluding exchange, and 5% excluding exchange and Singulair. As always, Adam will share more details about our key growth drivers and their performance. ","While our key growth drivers continue to perform well in established markets. There also remains additional growth opportunities for many of these products as we continue to expand geographically, the second component of our core strategy. ","Emerging markets grew 13% for the year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the 2011 Remicade settlement. We are driving growth organically from our existing portfolio. In 2012, our sales in China alone grew 22% ex-exchange to cross the $1 billion mark.","In 2013, we see continued benefit across the emerging markets from the growth of our product portfolio as well as the contributions we are beginning to realize from our joint ventures such as Simcere in China and Supera Farma in Brazil. ","The third component of our strategy is to extend into complementary businesses. For us that means animal health and consumer care. Our animal health business grew 9% ex-exchange last year and our consumer care business grew 7% ex-exchange, which outpaced overall consumer market growth in several markets. ","Our animal health and consumer care businesses are complementary with our core human health business. We are a leader in many categories in both animal health and consumer care, and we intend to leverage that leadership to grow these businesses to enhance the overall performance of the company. The recently announced first cycle FDA approval of Oxytrol, a prescription to OTC switch, is just one example of how we can create value in the consumer business. ","Lastly, the fourth element of our strategy is to excel at reducing cost and maintaining a competitive cost structure. In 2012, we achieved our merger synergy target of $3.5 billion net saved. Importantly, we got the benefit of those synergies while also making investments that, over the long term, will grow Merck\u2019s top line and increase our profitability.","For example, when a market opportunity developed, we quickly put additional resources behind Januvia and Janumet, which generated greater market share, higher sales, and a very high return on investment.","Over the last three years, we have reduced spending in our base, reinvested for the long term, and steadily improved our operating profit margins. This enables us to prepare for our next we are very excited of product launches. Peter Kellogg will speak more about our 2013 guidance in a few moments.","I\u2019d like to turn now to R&D. As I mentioned, in 2012 we had four major filings: suvorexant, our novel sleep compound; vintafolide in the EU for ovarian cancer; our combination of Zetia and atorvastatin; and sugammadex, which is marketed as Bridion outside the U.S.","For 2013, we plan multiple additional filings, including V503, a vaccine that expands protection against certain HPV-associated cancers, and two, allergy immunotherapy products, one for grass allergies, which was recently submitted, and another for ragweed allergies.","Beyond our anticipated regulatory filings, we also expect to advance our pipeline this year. This follows two Phase III starts last year, our once-weekly DPPIV inhibitor, and our monoclonal antibody for the treatment of psoriasis.","We also moved our base inhibitor for Alzheimer\u2019s disease into a Phase II\/III program in November and advanced our PD1 candidate for cancer to Phase II.","Our priority is turning cutting-edge science, both within our labs and externally, into innovative medicines and vaccines. During the course of 2012, we completed more than 60 business development transactions. While we have traditionally been very good at creating value with early-stage transactions, two good examples of transactions involving late-stage candidates with significant commercial potential are AiCuris and Endocyte. ","For 2013, our goal remains to seek out those assets at all phases of development that help position us for success in key therapeutic areas where we choose to compete and which can be obtained on terms that create shareholder value.","In closing, Merck had a good fourth quarter and a strong year overall. As we begin 2013, our top line performance targets remain as challenging as ever, as we seek to overcome the patent expirations and macro challenges facing our company. We will accomplish this by continuing to execute with key growth products and in key geographies, advancing and augmenting our pipeline, and continuing to meet the evolving needs of customers around the world.","We will deliver this while driving a culture of continuous productivity improvements so that we can continue to invest in the future and deliver shareholder value over the long term. Thank you for your attention, and I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to Adam. ","Adam Schechter","Thank you, Ken. Good morning everyone. It\u2019s a pleasure to speak with you today. This morning I\u2019ll provide you with an overview of Global Human Health results for 2012, and I\u2019ll also touch on the 2013 outlook.","In 2012 Global Human Health delivered on the objective that we established at the beginning of the year. With strong growth of our key brands, we were able to maintain our $41 billion top line versus the prior year on a constant currency basis. That\u2019s despite more than a $1.6 billion decline in Singulair sales driven by the U.S. patent expiration.","Excluding Singulair, and the impact of foreign exchange, GHH sales grew 5% in 2012. GHH contributed $1.9 billion to the top line. In the fourth quarter, human health sales declined 6%, largely due to Singulair. If you exclude Singulair and the impact of foreign exchange, underlying sales grew by 5%. Underlying growth was driven by key brands and by key markets.","2012 was a year of strong execution. We\u2019ve executed on our strategic priorities of growing the core, expanding the core, and accelerating new launches. I\u2019ll now provide more details about the key aspects of our performance this quarter, beginning with execution on our core business, which includes the largest markets, our core brands, and our launch brands.","Let me start with the United States, where sales were adversely affected by the Singulair patent expiry. Excluding the sales of Singulair, the portfolio had strong growth of 10% for the year, and 7% in the fourth quarter. The U.S. performance was driven by double digit growth of Januvia, Janumet, ISENTRESS, Gardasil, and Zostavax. ","Moving to our business in Europe and Canada, on a full year basis, sales in Europe and Canada declined by 4% excluding exchange. Fourth quarter sales in Europe and Canada declined by 2% ex-exchange. We continue to have good volume growth and we are growing faster than the market in most E.U. countries, but the business continues to be affected by macroeconomic issues.","Volume growth from brands such as Januvia and Janumet, Remicade and Simponi, and Victrelis only partially offset price decreases, other austerity measures, and increased generic erosion. Moving on now to several core brands, I\u2019ll start with the Januvia and Janumet franchise, which continued to performance very well this quarter, with sales of $1.6 billion and 20% growth excluding exchange.","The growth of Januvia is broad-based, and we continue to see volume growth in every region of the world. The Januvia and Janumet franchise combined grew 15% United States and 25% excluding exchange outside the U.S. Despite multiple competitors in the market, the Januvia family retained over a 70% share of the global DPPIV market.","On a full year basis, Januvia and Janumet sales reached $5.7 billion. Our diabetes franchise now has achieved the distinction of being the highest-selling product family on an annual basis in Merck history. But more importantly, there continues to be opportunities to grow.","Moving to ISENTRESS, ISENTRESS continues to be an important core brand for Merck. U.S. sales grew 11% in the fourth quarter. Despite new competition in the U.S. market, we have maintained our patient share. That means that competition is sourcing primarily from other classes.","Outside of the U.S., ISENTRESS sales declined 10% ex-exchange, but I\u2019d like to note that a major factor behind this decline was the timing of emerging market tenders. We anticipate a return to growth in these markets.","In our cholesterol franchise, Zetia and VYTORIN global sales grew 1% excluding exchange. Zetia grew 7% globally, which was offset by a decline in VYTORIN sales. We recently announced a resubmission of the NDA for Atozet, the Zetia and VYTORIN combination. We look forward to hearing from the FDA this year.","Moving to immunology, the combined immunology business with Remicade and Simponi grew 18% in the quarter, excluding exchange. Simponi remains an important launch brand, with $95 million of sales in the quarter. We recently launched Simponi in France and Russia, and we continue to be optimistic about Simponi\u2019s future growth potential competing with other subcutaneous anti-TNFs. ","Moving on to vaccines, vaccines had another strong quarter of double-digit growth. Gardasil maintained its strong performance with over 50% growth year over year, driven in part by about $50 million of higher public sector purchases. ","There are a number of other factors contributing to the growth this quarter. First, continued uptake of the male indication in the U.S. Second, strong uptake of the Japan launch. And third, the timing of government purchases in the emerging markets. Since first launched in 2006, 100 million doses of Gardasil have now been distributed around the world.  ","Moving on to Zostavax, sales of Zostavax were $225 million in the quarter. We continue to see a very positive response to our promotional efforts and good uptake by patients presenting during the flu season. We anticipate there will be a cyclical nature to this business, with the flu season being the largest opportunity.","This year, the flu season has extended into January. We saw strong demand in January. However, we would expect that demand in February and March will decline on a sequential basis. ","We continue to see Zostavax as a good growth driver. We estimate that only about 20% of the U.S. population ages 60 and older have received the vaccine. In addition, we continue to anticipate ex-U.S. launches beginning later this year.","Now I\u2019d like to highlight how we\u2019re executing against our strategy of expanding geographically into key high growth markets. So let\u2019s begin with the emerging markets. On a full year basis, emerging market sales grew 8% ex-exchange. If you also exclude Remicade sales in the relinquished territories, emerging market sales grew 13% on a full year basis.","In the fourth quarter, emerging market sales reached $2 billion, up 9%, and represented 20% of GHH sales. Growth in the emerging markets was broad-based and it was across much of our portfolio. In key emerging markets, our growth is outpacing overall market growth.","China continues to be an important growth driver, reaching over $1 billion in sales in 2012. China sales, ex-exchange, grew 22% for the full year, and about 30% in the quarter. The growth was driven by many products, across different therapeutic areas, including diversified brands and core brands.","Moving to Japan, growth in Japan ex-exchange was 6% for the year, and 9% in the fourth quarter. Strong growth of Januvia, Gardasil, Zetia, and hospital products more than offset the biennial price cuts earlier this year. It also offset the generic competition for COZAAR\/HYZAAR and Fosamax. Looking ahead, we believe we have opportunity for strong growth in Japan. ","Now moving on to launch brands, our launch products in total contributed more than $750 million in revenue for the full year 2012. They also represented greater than $200 million this quarter. ","Victrelis global sales were $115 million this quarter, over 30% higher than the prior year. A decline in U.S. sales was more than offset by growth in international markets. We continued to have strong share, over a 40% TRF share in the United States and well over a 50% share of patient days of therapy across international markets. ","While we are pleased with our global market shares, we are seeing a contraction in some of the early launch markets such as the United States and France. In these markets, there\u2019s still a considerable number of patients that need treatment and we\u2019re working on market development activities.","Now moving on to 2013, this year we have a lot of work to do to drive the top line in the face of a number of challenges. Those challenges include the full year effect of the loss of Singulair exclusivity in the United States, the loss of Singulair E.U. exclusivity beginning later this month, other U.S. patent expiries, including MAXALT and Propecia, and continued austerity measures around the world.","In addition, we will also be preparing for a number of launches. In 2013 we\u2019ll do the following: First, continue to launch Victrelis in international markets, launch Gardasil in Japan, and Zostavax. Second, if approved, we\u2019ll launch sugammadex and Atozet in the United States in the second half of the year. And third, begin to invest in important market development activities for future launches. So 2013 is shaping up to be a very busy year. ","In closing, Global Human Health continued to drive strong performance from its diverse portfolio. We met our goal of maintaining the top line on a constant currency basis, overcoming the effects of the U.S. Singulair patent expiry.","We believe the business momentum of our key brands and growth in markets around the world positions us well in 2013. Our base is strong, our base is diverse, and our base continues to grow. We also have many existing opportunities in the near term that should position us well for future growth.","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to my colleague, Peter Kellogg.","Peter Kellogg","Thank you, Adam, and good morning. In the fourth quarter, we continued to execute against our strategy, and we achieved the financial targets we laid out at the beginning of 2012. We accomplished a great deal, and are ready to take on 2013 as we prepare for the launch of our next wave of new products.","Ken and Adam have talked about our sales performance in the fourth quarter and full year 2012. As Adam described, the Merck team overcame significant revenue headwinds in 2012 to grow the top line 1%, excluding foreign exchange on a full year basis.","We\u2019re proud of our accomplishment on the top line. In addition to our top line accomplishments, we achieved full year EPS growth, including about a $750 million reduction of our operating expenses in 2012.","Now before I discuss our 2013 outlook, I\u2019d like to review the operating results in the fourth quarter. My remarks will focus on our non-GAAP financials, which exclude acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items.","On this basis, we earned $0.83 per share this quarter. While we replaced much of the Singulair sales decline in this quarter, as Adam described we replaced those sales with a basket of products that have a somewhat lower gross margin. ","As a result, our non-GAAP gross margin declined on a year over year basis to 75%. And, with more expiries coming, in addition to what we saw in the fourth quarter, this mix shift is expected to continue in 2013 as we work through the E.U. Singulair expiry and the expiry of MAXALT and Propecia. ","In fact, in the early part of the year, we expect that there will be some downward pressure from this level. On a full year basis, however, the fourth quarter gross margin is a good barometer for you to consider for 2013.","Turning to marketing and administrative expenses, our fourth quarter SG&A expenses were $300 million lower than the prior year. More than one-third of the benefit was due to a decrease in corporate charges such as legal defense reserves. There was also a $50 million benefit from foreign exchange. ","In addition, we reduced direct selling expenses and promotional spending in developed markets. These developed market reductions were partially offset by increased investment in emerging markets. ","On a full year basis, SG&A spending decreased by $900 million in 2012. While this included about a $300 million benefit from foreign exchange, management actions ahead of the Singulair patent expiration reduced our SG&A spending by more than $600 million. ","Over the past three years, we have significantly reduced the level of SG&A spending. In fact, considering that half of the net merger synergies came from SG&A, we have reduced our base SG&A by about $1.75 billion. ","While we are continuing to be very disciplined about spending, we don\u2019t expect to see further reductions in 2013. In fact, SG&A may increase slightly in 2013 as we first, invest in emerging markets to grow our core while we build out our joint ventures; second, invest to maintain our leadership position in competitive markets like diabetes; third, invest in near term launches like sugammadex; and finally, invest in future launches like suvorexant and odanacatib. We also expect a reversal in some of the exchange favorability that we saw in 2012. ","Moving to R&D, research and development expenses in the fourth quarter were about $70 million higher year over year due to the $140 million up-front payment to AiCuris for the CNV program. So what we\u2019re seeing in the fourth quarter and also on a full year basis is that we\u2019re getting more and more discipline and efficient in our R&D base and bringing in new programs from the outside.","For example, absent the AiCuris up-front payment, R&D expenses were slightly lower in the fourth quarter. And on a full year basis, our R&D expense would have been about $100 million lower than 2011 if we exclude the up-front payments for AiCuris and Endocyte.","Moving to tax, our non-GAAP tax rate was 23.6% in the fourth quarter, and the full year 2012 rate was 23.8%. This is lower than our prior guidance, primarily due to a favorable ruling on a state tax matter in the fourth quarter.","Now let\u2019s turn to 2013. Against the backdrop of an even bigger patent expiry impact, we are targeting to hold 2013 sales near the 2012 level on a constant currency basis. We will be investing to drive the top line and prepare for new product launches. The changes expected in non-GAAP EPS are primarily due to the gross margin mix shift that I discussed earlier, and investments to drive the top line. ","Now let\u2019s turn to the guidance as outlined in our earnings release. As noted, our 2013 non-GAAP EPS guidance range is $3.60 to $3.70. Similar to our guidance in 2012, we expect that the underlying operating momentum of Merck\u2019s business will allow us to maintain our full year 2013 revenues near 2012 levels on a constant currency basis.","Now, at current exchange rates, sales would be affected unfavorably by about 1-2%, as weakness in the yen more than offsets improving euro exchange rates. We expect to offset the patent expiries we face in 2013 with growth from Januvia, Janumet, and other products, as well as animal health and consumer health and the fast growth markets such as certain emerging markets in Japan. ","On R&D expenses, we expect our 2013 non-GAAP R&D expenses to be about the same as the 2012 level on a full year basis. The final element I will discuss is the tax rate. Our 2013 non-GAAP guidance of 21-23% includes the benefit of both the 2012 and the 2013 R&D tax credits. For planning purposes, you should assume that the 2012 credit will be realized in the fourth quarter and the credit for 2013 will be realized proportionately over all four quarters.","Speaking of the quarters, with additional patent expiries for MAXALT in the U.S. and Singulair in Europe during the first quarter of 2013, we think that the first quarter of 2013 will look a lot like the fourth quarter of 2012 from a bottom line perspective. The subsequent quarters should improve from that level.","So to summarize our 2013 outlook, our operations are strong, and our non-GAAP EPS guidance is between $3.60 and $3.70. On a GAAP basis, we expect to earn between $2.03 and $2.26.","In conclusion, in 2012 our goal was to drive through the Singulair patent expiration. We were able to maintain our sales line despite the expiry impact by driving growth of key products and increasing sales in the fast-growth markets.","This required commercial investment in certain growth products, which was offset by reduced operating expenses elsewhere. This was a very ambitious and outstanding performance on the part of our Merck team.","In addition, we brought in new R&D programs and advanced our internal R&D pipeline. We are well-prepared and confident that we are on the right track to execute our strategy in 2013 as we prepare the market for our next wave of growth-driving product launches.","Thank you. And now I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Alex. ","Alex Kelly","Thanks, Peter. Now we\u2019d like to open up the call to take your questions about our quarter. But in order to help us get through as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one or two questions and note that we will not be taking follow up questions. You are, however, welcome to rejoin the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, we\u2019re ready for the Q&A. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Your first question comes from the line of Tim Anderson from Sanford Bernstein. ","Tim Anderson - Sanford Bernstein","A couple of questions on odanacatib. You\u2019ve talked about safety in the past, and said the filing will slip. Without telling us what that safety is exactly, can you at least tell us whether that safety concern is a theoretical one, or whether there\u2019s actually been a signal of some sort that you\u2019ve seen in the data that you have in hand? ","Then on Zetia\/atorvastatin, I look at that as normally a lower risk application, but given the controversies with Zetia in the past, I would have to imagine FDA doesn\u2019t take any final action until they have results from IMPROVE-IT. So the fact that you\u2019re saying FDA should complete its review by mid-year might suggest that IMPROVE-IT could wrap up at this next interim look in March. ","So I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m thinking about this correctly in terms of IMPROVE-IT potentially stopping at the interim look. And can you just reiterate your level of confidence in the outcome of IMPROVE-IT, whenever it stops? ","Ken Frazier","I\u2019d like to turn it over to Peter, but just to reiterate, we continue to believe in the future benefit that\u2019s possibly associated with coming forward with both of those drugs. So let me turn it over to Peter. ","Peter Kellogg","Tim, as you know, in July we announced that the data monitoring committee, the DMC, for the study completed its first planned interim analysis. And they recommended that the study be closed early due to robust efficacy and a favorable benefit-risk profile. And as a result of that, we made the decision to begin to take steps to close out the pivotal trial. ","And as you note, we also said that the DMC noted that safety issues remain in certain select areas, and that they made recommendations with respect to following up on them. At that point, we reiterated the fact that our previously announced plan to conduct a blinded extension trial would allow us to further monitor these issues, as well as to continue to measure efficacy.","And really, at this point in time, that\u2019s all we can say. We are going to be conducting, as I said, that extension trial in a double-blinded manner, and we anticipate filing in 2014. ","With regard to Atozet, the combination of Zetia with atorvastatin, what I would say there is that that file has now gone in. It is a refilling as we have now conducted the clinical efficacy study to show that with regard to clinical efficacy, we have bioequivalence to the individual components alone. ","And of course the individual combination of Zetia with atorvastatin is something that is on the label. It is currently being used, and so what we\u2019re talking about is a combination of convenience. ","And with regard to IMPROVE-IT, you\u2019re correct, the data monitoring committee for IMPROVE-IT, as you know, requested that there be another interim analysis. That interim analysis is currently scheduled for March, and we\u2019ll see what happens there.","With regard to confidence, I\u2019ll just reiterate, as I have before, that we are very confident that lowering LDL cholesterol is a good thing to do for cardiovascular health. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.  ","Tony Butler - Barclays Capital ","Staying with odanacatib and a couple of other pipeline questions, Peter while we have you, you reemphasized or reread the July press release by saying that the DMC, when they reached 70% of the key events - so it\u2019s roughly at least 166 events that would have occurred out of the 16,000 patients. ","But the question is, in the release also it states that you would file in \u201913. The notion of the extension study was documented, so I guess the question is was the anticipation at the time to file on the existing data set without the extension study? ","And then what changed to then therefore include the extension study? If was to have been included all along, is it just simply taking longer than you would have assumed?","And then two brief comments, if I may. Will we get any read out on the PD1 and melanoma this calendar year? And also, on the base inhibitor in the Phase II in Alzheimer\u2019s? ","Peter Kellogg","You\u2019re correct that in July we said that we anticipated filing odanacatib in 2013. As I said, we\u2019ve just recently received the data from the pivotal study. We do not have any data from the ongoing extension study. But we have made the decision to include data from the extension study in our filings for regulatory approvals. And so that\u2019s really what I can say about that. ","With regard to PD1, I\u2019ll begin by saying that this is a very exciting mechanism, and that actually unleashing the immune system so that it can now attack tumors is a very exciting area of research, and we are certainly excited about our PD1 inhibitor NK475, which is still early in development, but which has shown significant improvement in patient outcomes.","We reported recently on, I think, 85 melanoma patients that were on our monotherapy. And we saw a 51% objective anti-tumor response. And so that\u2019s really what we know right now. We have not made a final decision as to what it is that we\u2019re going to be presenting this year, although I certainly anticipate that we will present additional data at the ASCO meeting as we move forward.","And so I\u2019ll just say stay tuned. We certainly are very excited by this program. We\u2019re pleased with the data that we\u2019ve seen to date, and we do anticipate presenting additional data later this year.","With regard to the base inhibitor, which as you also know we\u2019re very excited about, the key developments from 2012 were first of all that we were able to show that one can lower CSF A beta levels in people by over 90%, without having untoward effects. And that was a new result. Really we had not known previously if you could lower CSF A beta by those sorts of levels, and not have something show up which was untoward.","And so that then gave us the confidence to kick off a Phase II\/III outcomes trial in Alzheimer\u2019s patients. And that has now started. The design of that trial is to begin by enrolling an initial cohort of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and then after a set period of time to look for any safety issues that would preclude us from moving forward to Phase III. And absent any of those safety issues that would preclude us from moving into Phase III, to then move in a seamless manner into Phase III in the mild to moderate patient population.","At the same time, such a move would kick off our plans to conduct the study in what\u2019s called the prodromal patient population. And the prodromal population are basically patients with mild cognitive impairment for MCI that, as judged by biomarkers, have a higher propensity to progress to Alzheimer\u2019s disease, to frank Alzheimer\u2019s disease, in a shorter period of time.","And as you may have seen, we announced a deal with GE to use their PET ligand to identify patients with MCI that fall into this prodromal category, and we will use their PET ligand and take advantage of the infrastructure that they\u2019re helping to establish to allow us to enroll a prodromal Phase III study with our base inhibitor. ","And so that\u2019s really the upshot of where things exist. We will conduct an interim analysis of the safety cohort as I said, and we expect this interim analysis of the safety cohort to occur by the end of 2013.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JP Morgan. ","Chris Schott - JP Morgan","I realize you can\u2019t comment too much on odanacatib, but coming from it a different way, is the signal that you\u2019re seeing here something that reduces your excitement in the commercial prospects of this drug, if it is in fact approved? ","And then the second question on PD1, just following up on those comments, how far would you estimate you\u2019re behind Bristol\u2019s development program at this point? Is there any way you can further accelerate your development of PD1 in melanoma? And should we think about other indications moving into Phase II in 2013 beyond melanoma? ","Ken Frazier","As we said earlier, the decision that\u2019s been made with regard to odanacatib is to include data from the extension study when we file for regulatory approvals. And we continue to believe in the potential of this drug to meet the unmet needs that exist for patients with osteoporosis. And we look forward to filing it in 2014. So I think that\u2019s the most that we can say about that. ","Adam Schechter","And the thing I also want to remind you is that there\u2019s 200 million worldwide with osteoporosis, and only 20% of them are treated today. It\u2019s a $10 billion market prior to generic Fosamax. And if you\u2019ll remember, about 25% of patients can\u2019t even tolerate the bisphosphonates and bisphosphonate use is declining. So it remains a very big, important market. ","Peter Kim","I hope you understand that really I\u2019m not trying to be difficult. It\u2019s just that our plans to present the data really are dependent on our need to maintain the blind so that we can file this file. And so therefore, we\u2019re really not in a position to speak to additional information on safety or efficacy as we move forward here. ","With regard to PD1, as I said, this is something that we are excited about. We are excited about the profile of our molecule, MK3475, and what we\u2019ve seen so far. In terms of how far behind we are, I think we\u2019re very committed to this program. I\u2019m not really going to speak to the competitors\u2019 programs, except to say that obviously we are very interested in being very competitive in this arena.","In terms of our commitment to PD1, I can tell you that we are very committed to this mechanism and to this molecule. You know that we have already shown results on melanoma. We have started a very large Phase II study, which, as you can see on clinicaltrials.gov, involves over 500 patients. We have a study in non-small-cell lung cancer, which is currently in Phase I. ","And without going into any details, for competitive reasons, we are very interested in being smart about what additional indications we move into, and that\u2019s something that is certainly of great interest. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS. ","Marc Goodman - UBS","I guess one more thing on odanacatib. Peter, you mentioned what\u2019s changed since the last time we\u2019ve heard you all talk is that you\u2019ve actually seen the data now. It\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve kind of heard you say that. So I was curious if you made this decision alone, or you talked to the FDA and you\u2019ve made the decision to wait for this additional data? ","And then secondly, can you remind us on the psoriasis drug that you\u2019re working on what the hook is there and why you believe that\u2019s going to be a very important product when it hits the market?","Peter Kim","With regard to odanacatib, as I said, we received the data and the decision to wait and include data from the extension study in our filings was a decision that was made internally by Merck, in consultation with a small number of external experts, and not something that was done in consultation with the FDA. So that\u2019s an internal decision that we made.","With regard to psoriasis, this is an anti-IL-23 antibody, and it is one that we have, as obviously we\u2019ve gotten good results in psoriasis, which is why it is that we\u2019re moving forward into Phase III. The proof of principle for this mechanism, the IL-23, actually comes from another drug that\u2019s currently marketed, and that\u2019s STELARA, or ustekinumab, which works by blocking both IL-23 and IL-12.","In contrast to that drug, which blocks both IL-23 and IL-12, our drug is specific for blocking just IL-23. And there are theoretical issues having to do with preclinical studies and genetic studies and preclinical animals which point to two specific infections that are at increased risk in preclinical studies, including mycobacterium tuberculosis and salmonella infections. ","And I want to emphasize these are preclinical studies, but what we\u2019re trying to do here is develop an antibody which is more specific and targets the cytokine that\u2019s important in psoriasis, namely IL-23, and do so in a specific manner.  ","Adam Schechter","And Mark, just to add some context from a marketing perspective, if you look at the worldwide psoriasis market, it\u2019s expected to grow from about $4.5 billion in 2011 to almost $8 billion in 2018. It affects about 2-3% of the global population. And if you look at the patients that are impacted, about 25% of them suffer moderate to severe disease that could require potentially more aggressive treatment with phototherapy or systemic therapy. ","And if you look at, even with the advances of anti-TNFs, and the fact that it\u2019s the non-life-threatening nature of psoriasis, we think that additional systemic agents that can have an improved risk-benefit profile potentially, compared to the current biologics, would represent a very significant opportunity. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark J. Schoenebaum with ISI Group. ","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group","I have yet another question on odanacatib. I apologize in advance. Can you just clarify, does the company know what the safety issues are specifically that the DMC is watching? ","And then my second question is totally unrelated. Ken, can you just talk a little bit about your plans for the animal health business? Obviously Zoetis IPOing today looks like PE\u2019s going to be somewhere in the mid to high teens. Substantial PE premium to where Merck shares are trading right now. If indeed that PE holds over time, what would be your rationale for not mimicking what Pfizer has done? ","Peter Kim","Mark, really what I can say is that we\u2019ve seen the data of the pivotal trial. And we\u2019ve studied the data from the pivotal trial, and we\u2019ve made the decision to include data from the extension study in our filings for regulatory approval. And I\u2019ll just reiterate again that we continue to believe in the potential of odanacatib in patients with osteoporosis and look forward to filing that in 2014.","Ken Frazier","As it relates to our animal health business, I think you could see from this quarter\u2019s performance, it\u2019s a very strong contributor to Merck\u2019s overall performance. And from our perspective, we are committed to this business. We think it\u2019s a good fit with our overall business. The research that we do and vaccines and other parts of our business we think actually dovetail nicely with this business, and I think as we stand here today, we think it\u2019s a very good profitable business, and one that actually contributes very strongly to Merck while remaining in its own right one of the leaders in the animal health space.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. ","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets","You mentioned that you\u2019re just beginning to realize the contributions from emerging markets through your joint ventures. How would you help us quantify the upside potential there? And then quickly on hep-C and 5172, how would you describe your strategy in hep-C given how fast the market is evolving? And do you believe you have all the necessary pieces in your early-stage pipeline? Or are you looking for external assets to complement 5172.","Adam Schechter","A few thoughts on emerging markets. We continue to believe that there\u2019s significant potential for growth in the emerging markets. And our strategy has been one to make sure that we maximize our current core brands, which includes our diversified brands, our large in-line brands, and also our launch brands. ","But in addition to that, we believe there\u2019s potential growth opportunities from joint ventures in some of these markets. And we\u2019ve formed multiple joint ventures of which two are up and running as we speak. If you look in China, we have a joint venture with Simcere, and I attended the launch meeting where we had several hundred sales representatives for that joint venture. Very motivated, very energized, and working across both companies in order to maximize some of the diversified brands.","If you look in Brazil, we have our joint venture with Supera up and running, and there again we have a very sizable sales force that\u2019s really working together on diversified brands. When I think about them, I think of them as part of our ability to continue our momentum in the emerging markets. I don\u2019t think of it as a step change, where you should start to see a big increase at any point in time. ","Instead, it\u2019s the way in which we\u2019re running our business. It allows us to continue to grow, and our goal has been, and will continue to be, to grow faster than the overall market in each of the markets that we compete in the emerging markets. And I believe that the joint ventures will allow us to continue to be successful and continue the momentum we have in those markets. ","Peter Kim","As you point out, this is a fast-moving field. We certainly are aggressively pursuing new and more convenient and interferon-free therapies. Our focus is on MK5172, our protease inhibitor, which we think is going to be the cornerstone of treatment regimens moving forward. And we\u2019re interested in using that drug in combination with either internal candidates like MK8742, our NS5A inhibitor, or in partnership with others. And I\u2019ll just emphasize that our goal is to develop an all-oral regimen that maximizes SVR and shortens the duration of therapy and minimizes side effects.","We recently announced, and you can see it on clinicaltrials.gov, two new clinical trials. The first is a 12-week regimen that contains MK5172, a potent protease inhibitor, as well as MK8742, which is our oral NS5A inhibitor, plus or minus ribavirin. And that\u2019s in HCV genotype 1 patients.","And the second trial that we announced, and that\u2019s posted right now, that we\u2019re going to conduct, is a study of MK5172 alone in combination with ribavirin, in either 12- or 24-week regimens. And for this trial, we\u2019re conducting this in HCV genotype 1 patients with an IL-28CC genotype, the point being that if we\u2019re not able to achieve [SCR] with these patients, because they have an IL-28CC genotype, they\u2019re at a much-higher propensity of being cured using the normal Peg\/Riba regimen. And so, together with the FDA, we worked out a strategy by which we can actually test a much more aggressive regimen, which is MK5172 alone with ribavirin in patients. ","And of course we also have our other protease inhibitor, MK7009, that\u2019s ongoing in Japan and showing very good progression.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Baum with Citi. ","Andrew Baum - Citi","Firstly, given the margin pressures on your business, I know you\u2019ve rationalized a number of your manufacturing sites already. There seems to be considerable potential to do more. Perhaps you could remind us the target opportunity and the timing of that. And then second, with reference to the external opportunities highlighted at the beginning of your press release, to augment your growth, perhaps you can remind us, within pharma, from an M&A perspective, the type of frameworks you used in assessing assets in that particular side.","Ken Frazier","Let me start with the second part first. When we look out across the spectrum of opportunities, we try to find the best science that we can find. Historically, I think we\u2019ve done our best work in the early stages in identifying targets and projects that are more on the early side of the spectrum. But as we\u2019ve shown this year, we are willing to do late-stage deals. We will do them when we are interested in competing in that area and maintaining leadership in that area, and where we think there\u2019s significant shareholder value to be obtained. And I\u2019ll just turn it over to Peter there.  ","Peter Kellogg","I believe the question is related to the manufacturing network, and where we stand. I\u2019ll just go back quickly to the time of the merger, where we had 93 plants globally across all of our businesses. That\u2019s pharma, animal health, and consumer. And at this point, we currently operate in 75 sites around the world, so you can see that we\u2019ve obviously made a fair bit of progress on the network rationalization. ","And we\u2019re working on plans to further reduce the size of our footprint. But those plans will take some time to implement. As we\u2019ve always said, we\u2019re three years, roughly, into the merger. Some of the items that we synergize and get benefit from come in the first couple of years, but that we think the manufacturing network - we always have said kind of manufacturing and IT type of items - take more like four or five or six years. ","So at this point, we think our network consolidation effort will continue into 2016 program at this point. So much work still to be done, but I think really good progress by the manufacturing network team and we\u2019ll be getting benefits from those hard efforts. ","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Damien Conover with Morningstar. ","Damien Conover - Morningstar","Just had a question regarding suvorexant. I think in January this year the FDA was talking about an increased concern with driving studies for insomnia products. And I was just wondering, with the current package that you submitted, do you believe that you addressed this sort of heightened concern? ","And then secondly, just shifting gears to potentially a smaller product for you guys, MK7243, I think in Europe your partner sells about $30 million. I was just wondering if the opportunity in North America might be larger, just given this is a pretty large indication. But just wasn\u2019t sure if there was enough differentiation around the product to really see a sizable impact. ","Adam Schechter","Let me start with suvorexant. We\u2019re not going to comment on the file specifically, but when I think about suvorexant, the first thing to realize is this is a significant need. About 30% of the population has sleep issues. And 30% are chronically treated. It represents about 60% of prescriptions. ","And we\u2019ve seen, and we\u2019ve heard through market research, multiple times, that patients are unsatisfied with the existing therapies, that they believe there are residual effects and reduced efficacy over time. And it\u2019s a big market. If you look at the branded drugs, prior to patent expiries, it was a multi-billion dollar market.","So we believe that a new product like suvorexant coming into the marketplace could really have a significant impact and be an important product for these many patients that are suffering from the inability to sleep.","Regarding the AIT, the allergy immunotherapy, there\u2019s about 30 million moderate to severe allergy sufferers in the U.S. alone, and that\u2019s per year. And about 3 million of those receive immunotherapy shots. Of the ones that are receiving the immunotherapy shots, only 50% of them are still on the medicine 12 months after initiation of therapy. ","So there\u2019s a lot of dissatisfaction. The people do not like getting the shots. They don\u2019t typically go back over a long period of time. So we view a daily sublingual AIT immunotherapy as an alternative to shots as a potential opportunity to increase not only the number of patients that come into the market willing to take a product for their allergy but also those that will take it over a more sustained period of time.  ","Ken Frazier","Okay, let me close out by thanking you all for your attention this morning. I\u2019ll make a few points in closing. Merck did have a very strong fourth quarter, and a good year overall. Looking forward to this year, we expect that our underlying operating momentum will allow us to continue to maintain our full year 2013 revenues near 2012 levels on a constant currency basis. ","We\u2019re also committed to remaining focused on our core strategy and executing it, including advancing and augmenting our pipeline, and today\u2019s news that we\u2019ve decided to include data from the extension study in our filing for regulatory approvals should be one that doesn\u2019t cause you to be confused about our commitment. ","And I\u2019d like to underscore that we continue to believe in the potential of odanacatib to address unmet medical needs for patients in osteoporosis, and we also look forward to advancing additional filings and to approvals this year for suvorexant, vintafolide, Atozet, as well as the sugammadex compound which is marketed as Bridion. ","So thank you very much, and we look forward to speaking to you soon.  "],"13796":["Merck & Co., Inc.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Teri Loxam. Please go ahead.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thank you, Darla, and good morning. Welcome to Merck's third quarter 2016 conference call. Today I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; Adam Schechter, President of Global Human Health; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Labs.","Before I turn the call over to Ken, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation of these in our press release. We've also provided a table in our press release to help you understand the sales in the quarter for the business units and products.","I'd like to remind you that some of the statements that we make during today's call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements and you can see our SEC filings as well as today's earnings release on Merck.com.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thank you, Teri. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Before we discuss our results for the quarter, I would like to take a moment to reflect on the recent ESMO Congress where the latest data were presented from our KEYTRUDA, clinical development program for lung cancer, and simultaneously published in two major scientific journals. Many have noted the significant implications these results may have for the treatment of lung cancer, the deadliest type of cancer in the United States. And just yesterday, the FDA approved KEYTRUDA the only PD-1 therapy for the first line treatment of metastatic lung cancer making it an option for tens of thousands of lung cancer patients in the United States.","For the first time in decades, the standard of care may change for lung cancer patients offering them renewed hope. This advancement is what Merck is all about and we are honored to be making a real difference in the fight against cancer. The recent KEYTRUDA achievements are proof of concept, if you will, that our innovation strategy is working. Our sustained investment in medically important R&D has yielded a number of recent approvals in regulatory milestones across the various therapeutic areas in our human health and animal health businesses.","Turning now to the results. In the third quarter, we reported a strong performance that reflects growth across several priority programs, including our vaccines portfolio and also KEYTRUDA and ZEPATIER which are continuing to launch around the world. We remain confident in the strength of our portfolio from our JANUVIA franchise which is core to our business and continues to maintain its leadership position in the DPP-4 class to BRIDION, which is quickly contributing to our growth, while still in the launch phase here in the United States.","Looking ahead, we will continue to follow the science, pursuing the best internal and external scientific opportunities that will enable us to take on some of the world's greatest health challenges. That is why business development remains an important priority in achieving our goals. Our appetite for business development has not changed. We continue to seek the best opportunities and collaborations with the right financial valuation to augment our portfolio and pipeline.","In closing, our performance in the quarter positions us well to continue to invest in our business and to deliver a balanced, differentiated portfolio of medicines and vaccines that will generate long-term growth and sustainable value for shareholders and society.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.","Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. As Ken noted, in the third quarter we delivered solid sales and earnings growth on both a nominal and ex-FX basis. Total company revenues were $10.5 billion, an increase of 5% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of exchange, revenue increased 6%. Our Human Health and Animal Health businesses contributed 6% and 7% growth respectively, excluding exchange in the quarter and despite an approximately $170 million headwind from sales in Venezuela in the third quarter of 2015.","As a reminder, we went to the SIMADI rate in the fourth quarter of 2015, so this is the last quarter in which we will face this headwind. I should note that the year-over-year increase in Human Health sales in the third quarter includes an approximately $200 million benefit from the pull-forward of customer purchases from the fourth quarter. These were mainly due to the timing of shipments in Japan in anticipation of an ERP go-live and the timing of CDC vaccine purchases.","Taking into account our performance in the first three quarters of 2016 and our expectations through year-end, we are narrowing and raising our full-year revenue guidance to $39.7 billion to $40.2 billion. We continue to anticipate foreign exchange will have an approximately 2 percentage point negative impact on revenue in 2016.","Looking to the other parts of the P&L, non-GAAP gross margin was 75.3%, an increase of 20 basis points. Product mix was the primary driver of the increase versus the prior year. For the full year, we continue to expect non-GAAP gross margin to be roughly flat versus last year with margins in the fourth quarter expected to be lower on a year-over-year basis as we see the mix impact of generic competition for CUBICIN and ZETIA in the U.S. market and declines in FX hedge gains year-on-year which flow 100% to gross margin.","Non-GAAP operating expenses of $4 billion were roughly flat versus the third quarter of 2015 as declines in marketing and administrative expenses largely offset an increase in research and development expenses in the quarter. While we are committed to delivering a leveraged P&L over the long-term, it may be more challenging in the near-term, given the impending loss of market exclusivity for ZETIA and VYTORIN in the U.S. and investments that we need to make to support the growing opportunity for KEYTRUDA. That being said, we remain disciplined and continue to look for opportunities to reallocate resources across the portfolio.","Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.8% this quarter. We expect the full-year rate to trend to the higher end of our previously communicated range of 21.5% and 22.5% which includes the impact of the R&D tax credit. Taken together, we earned $1.07 per share on a non-GAAP basis, delivering 11% growth versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, non-GAAP EPS increased 8%. Of the $0.11 increase in non-GAAP EPS this quarter compared to Q3 2015, approximately $0.04 were related to the customer purchases in Japan that I mentioned earlier.","On a GAAP basis, we earned $0.78 this quarter. Given our results in the first nine months of the year, we are also narrowing and raising our full-year non-GAAP EPS range. We now expect to earn $3.71 to $3.78 per share with foreign exchange still expected to have an approximately one percentage point negative impact. On a GAAP basis, we now expect to earn $2.02 to $2.09 per share for the full year. Altogether, our top and bottom-line growth in the quarter, driven by solid operational performance, sets us up for a strong 2016 overall.","With that, I will turn the call over to Adam.","Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. This morning I'll provide highlights in the performance of Global Human Health for the third quarter, and my comments will be on a constant currency basis. Global Human Health delivered another strong quarter with sales of $9.4 billion or an increase of 6%. We drove growth across many of our core areas including oncology, vaccines and hospital and specialty care. I'll highlight now a few of our key franchises and product launches and I'll start with oncology.","We continued to execute on a launch of KEYTRUDA and we are excited by the long-term potential for this important brand. KEYTRUDA generated $356 million in sales in the third quarter with about half of the sales generated outside of the United States. In the U.S., sales were driven primarily from melanoma where KEYTRUDA continues to be the leading immuno-oncology therapy, as well as from the ongoing launch in second-line lung cancer.","In August, we also gained approval for recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer and we began to launch that indication immediately. This represents the first new treatment option for these patients in almost a decade. In addition, and very importantly, we are ready to launch in first-line lung cancer where we just received FDA approval for the high PD-L1 expressing patients, those who express PD-L1 greater than or equal to 50%.","We know from several data sources including our own clinical trials that this patient population represents about 25% to 30% of non-small cell lung cancer patients. In addition, we received expanded labeling for second-line lung cancer based upon our KEYNOTE-010 data. So now, patients that express any level of PD-L1 are eligible for KEYTRUDA in a second-line setting.","Based upon these two new patient populations for KEYTRUDA in lung cancer, we have already begun to see an acceleration of testing for PD-L1 at diagnosis. Outside of the United States, we've launched our melanoma indication in more than 50 markets and we continue to see broad adoption of KEYTRUDA as a leading metastatic melanoma treatment. We've also recently gained EMA approval in second-line lung cancer for all PD-L1 positive patients. We're working through the reimbursements process in each country which, as you know, can take some time. But we expect that we'll start to ramp up nicely in Europe once reimbursement comes through. In addition, we're preparing for the upcoming launch of KEYTRUDA in Japan where we recently received an indication for melanoma.","While we've already achieved a number of milestones for KEYTRUDA, this is just the beginning. We remain dedicated to establishing KEYTRUDA as the leader in lung cancer. In addition, we are very optimistic about the long-term potential for KEYTRUDA across many different tumor types.","Moving now to primary care. The JANUVIA franchise generated sales of almost $1.6 billion this quarter, a 2% decline compared to the same quarter last year. Outside of the United States, we saw strong growth of 9%. This included favorable impact of about $30 million from the timing of customer purchases in Japan, which was offset by an unfavorable impact of roughly the same magnitude from sales in Venezuela. In the U.S., we saw a decline of 10%, which was anticipated given the tough comparison to third quarter of 2015, where we saw a large buy-in. TRx trends remain strong in the United States with growth of 4%, and JANUVIA continues to be the leading DPP-4 treatment of choice in the market.","We expect revenue growth in the United States in the fourth quarter of this year versus fourth quarter of 2015. Formulary discussions for 2017 are nearly complete and we expect similar access in the United States for JANUVIA to what we've had this year. We've seen and expect to continue to see increased pricing pressure in the United States for JANUVIA but we are pleased by the continued strong volume growth, and thus far, we've been able to offset most of the pricing pressures. We remain confident in our diabetes franchise and we're pleased with our continued strength in this brand globally.","Now moving to our vaccine business. We had another strong quarter with sales of $2 billion or 27% growth. The increase was primarily driven by GARDASIL, pediatric vaccines and PNEUMOVAX. GARDASIL sales were $860 million globally, a 38% increase versus last year. In the United States, GARDASIL sales grew 33% driven by the timing of public sector purchases but also higher demand. On October 7, the FDA approved a two-dose regimen for 9 to 14-year-olds, and just last week, ACIP voted to recommend two doses for certain of these patients. This is aligned with the dosing already adopted in some markets outside of the U.S. And it will have a negative impact on sales for GARDASIL moving forward.","PNEUMOVAX delivered another strong quarter with 24% growth versus prior year. The United States growth was primarily driven by demand with better follow-through from ACIP recommendations for patients 65 and above to receive PNEUMOVAX one year after Prevnar. Outside of the U.S., growth was largely driven by Japan.","Finally, in hospital and specialty care, sales grew 5% to $2.2 billion. Growth in acute care and contributions from launch products were partially offset by declines in REMICADE. REMICADE sales were down 28% this quarter as tenders and new patient starts increasingly go to biosimilars. We expect the declines in REMICADE to continue given the competitive pressures, but also increased switching.","Now moving to ZEPATIER. We are encouraged by the progress we are making in the first year of launch. ZEPATIER's product profile and positioning are resonating well with both healthcare professionals and payers. As we continued to communicate last quarter, we have seen some early wins in both the public and private sectors for 2016 and 2017. This includes priority access in the VA, favorable access within the Medicaid segment and key wins in the Medicare Part D and commercial segments.","It is important to note though, that some of our major formulary wins had effective dates of either July 1 of this year or January 1 of next year. So we don't expect to see the full effect of these wins immediately. Given the time it takes from formulary success to getting patients on drug, we're only just beginning to see the impact from those plans that became effective this summer. We are also looking forward to launching ZEPATIER in Japan this quarter where it was recently approved.","On the hospital side, we had a stronger-than-expected quarter with CUBICIN as generics only entered the market at the end of the quarter. Now that there are two generics in the market, we experienced a decline for CUBICIN which appears to be similar to fast erosion rates that we've seen for other hospital products once generics launched in the U.S. Finally, BRIDION had another good quarter with almost 50% growth driven by strong demand across ex-U.S. markets as well as a good ramp-up in the U.S. following our launch earlier this year. While Japan is currently our largest market in the world, over time we believe that the U.S. market will become the biggest for BRIDION.","In closing, we continue to deliver solid performance across many products. We have good momentum and good execution across our core focus areas. And although we'll have to contend with the ZETIA and VYTORIN patent expiry in fourth quarter of this year into next year, we believe we are well positioned for the long term.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thank you, Adam. In the third quarter Merck Research Laboratories made substantial progress on multiple fronts, first in the area of infectious disease. Based on our landmark Phase III studies and following the favorable vote of the FDA Antimicrobial Advisory Committee, the FDA approved ZINPLAVA for the reduction of the risk of recurrence of Clostridium difficile infection in patients at high risk for such recurrences. I'll remind you that ZINPLAVA is not an antimicrobial agent per se, but contains a monoclonal antibody, bezlotoxumab, which is directed against the toxin made by C. difficile and important in the pathogenesis of C. difficile-mediated disease. Review of the ZINPLAVA file is also proceeding in the EU. Also in the infectious disease area, last week we announced top-line results for our Phase III study testing the ability of letermovir to reduce the risk of cytomegalovirus disease in patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplants.","These programs are only the most recent of our very broad efforts to improve therapies for infectious diseases including three important Phase III programs: ZERBAXA, for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia; relebactam to broaden the spectrum of our antibiotic, PRIMAXIN; and doravirine, a non-nucleosidal HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor, with what we believe to be improved characteristics versus currently available therapies.","As Adam mentioned, we continue to demonstrate impressive activity for ZEPATIER, our hepatitis C virus therapy, including in patients known to have used intravenous drugs. We're also making progress in advancing our triplet therapy for HCV infection, with presentations describing the efficacy of this combination across genotypes to be presented at the upcoming AASLD meeting. But much of the excitement during the past quarter focused on KEYTRUDA, our PD-1 specific antibody for the treatment of malignant disease.","As Ken and Adam mentioned, the FDA has just announced an updated label for KEYTRUDA which includes our KEYNOTE-010 study demonstrating that KEYTRUDA is superior to traditional chemotherapy in the second-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, including those patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 in as few as 1% of cells. The revised label also includes our KEYNOTE-024 study which was presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology meetings earlier this month and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine.","In brief, KEYNOTE-024 was a randomized active comparator controlled Phase III study demonstrating that KEYTRUDA, when used for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic, non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors express high levels of PD-L1 and who lack mutations in the EGF receptor or ALK genes, is superior to traditional platinum-based chemotherapy of the type that has been the standard of care in this disease for more than two decades. These data are important because KEYTRUDA treatment, at a fixed dose of 200 milligrams every three weeks, reduced the risk of tumor progression or death by 50% and reduced the overall risk of death by 40%.","Moreover, KEYTRUDA treatment was associated with a lower rate of serious adverse effects than was observed in the chemotherapy treatment arm. We believe, as Bruce Johnson suggested in an accompanying editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, that KEYTRUDA will come to represent a new standard of care for appropriate lung cancer patients whose tumors express high levels of PD-L1, a population that represents between 25% to 30% of those presenting with advanced non-small cell lung cancers.","Also in the third quarter, we received approval for the use of KEYTRUDA in lung cancer in the European Union, again based on our KEYNOTE-010 data. Review of the KEYNOTE-024 study is ongoing by the Committee for Human Medical Products (sic) [Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use] for the European Medicines Agency. Beyond these very important results, during the third quarter we also obtained data from our KEYNOTE-021 and cohort G study demonstrating that KEYTRUDA can be used in combination with traditional platinum doublet-based chemotherapy to yield objective response rates far superior to what we've seen with chemotherapy alone. In this study, patients with metastatic, non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors expressed any level of PD-L1 were enrolled provided they lacked EGF receptor or ALK gene mutations. Progression pre-survival nearly doubled in the KEYTRUDA-containing treatment arm. The results of this study were published simultaneously in Lancet Oncology.","While this was a Phase II study in a relatively small cohort, including just 123 patients, the results complement an earlier single-arm study employing the same combination regimen which we presented at the American Society for Clinical Oncology in June. Patients in that cohort achieved an objective response rate of 71% and the objective response rate was 55% in cohort G. Hence, there is reason to believe that combinations of traditional chemotherapeutic agents, perhaps acting through an immune activation mechanism, will work in concert with KEYTRUDA to provide superior responses in advanced lung cancer patients in the future. Additional confirmatory studies, including our KEYNOTE-189 and KEYNOTE-407 studies, are already underway.","Finally, last week we announced that the independent data monitoring committee supervising our KEYNOTE-045 study in second-line urothelial cancer involving patients with relapsed or refractory bladder or related uroepithelial cancer, recommended that the study be stopped on the basis of improved overall survival in the KEYTRUDA treatment arm. KEYNOTE-045 is a Phase III, active comparator-controlled, monotherapy study in a very sick patient population; however, the results obtained in this setting mimic results from the first-line KEYNOTE-052 study that we presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting earlier this month, which showed impressive response rates in the treatment of urothelial malignancy.","In sum, KEYTRUDA is changing the cancer treatment landscape. Already approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma, second-line non-small cell lung cancer, first-line non-small cell lung cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck for which we obtained FDA approval in August. We have obtained what we believe to be registration-worthy data in urothelial cancer, have more than 30 registration-appropriate studies underway, have developed data supporting the activity of KEYTRUDA in 22 different malignancies and have more than 360 clinical studies currently underway, including more than 200 combination studies evaluating responses in more than 30 different tumor types. Needless to say, we anticipate additional regulatory filings in the fourth quarter and of course in 2017.","Finally, I note that we're making good progress in our diabetes programs. Our insulin glargine filing was accepted for review by the FDA. And with our colleagues at Pfizer, we expect to file for approval of ertugliflozin as monotherapy and as a fixed-dose combination with metformin or with sitagliptin before the end of the year.","Now I'll turn the call back to Teri.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Roger. Darla, we're going to get onto our Q&A process. Analysts, if you'll please limit your questions to one or two so that we can get as many questions in as possible, that would be appreciated.","Darla, over to you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question is from Tim Anderson with Bernstein.","Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. Couple of questions. On business development, you mentioned it remains an important priority. It's a message you've had throughout the year. Two questions on this. I'm wondering how the news of August 5 had suddenly changed the outlook for KEYTRUDA, might change how you think about M&A. You could argue that doing a bigger deal now runs a risk of disrupting the focus that you'll need on immuno-oncology for example. And kind of related to that, can you give us some idea of the upper limit to deals you might be considering? Is everything on the table? Are you looking more at mid-sized deals or smaller? And then second question is on KEYTRUDA and IDO and the timing for making a possible go, no go decision for Phase III in lung cancer. Is that something that we would learn about maybe in the next six months or so?","Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.","Good morning, Tim. Ken Frazier here. Let me start on the business development question. So I said that it remains an important priority, and you should know we're actively engaged and looking for ways of augmenting our pipeline. And in so doing, it's important to remember that we are not limited by size or by phase. We're going to continue to look for the best partnerships and collaborations. But fundamentally, we're looking for bolt-on opportunities as a company. Your question about whether or not KEYTRUDA changes our approach to business development, not really. We need to augment our pipeline. We continue to be active in that area. But I would not say that the August 5 news has changed our fundamental approach to business development.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","And, Tim, it's Roger. With respect to IDO1 and decision-making in lung, we continue to pursue the melanoma study with our colleagues at Incyte, and we are very interested in the IDO1 combination. As we develop more data for that, we'll be able to make a decision. And your timeframe is probably about right. I can't say specifically because these are event-driven studies. But sometime I would imagine towards the middle of next year we'd be in a position where we'd be able to make decisions about how much activity we're seeing and whether or not we should proceed in a registration-enabling study using that molecule.","Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Roger. Darla, next question, please.","Operator","It's from Colin Bristow, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Colin N. Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions, and congrats on the quarter. So first on KEYTRUDA in lung, clearly you're going to be a lone and dominant player in first-line for the next 18 months. But how do you view the level of competitive threats from Bristol and Astra's IO-IO combos? And then just what are the combinations you are evaluating which you're most excited about in terms of the potential in the lung setting? And then second on KEYTRUDA's share in second-line lung, can you just talk about how much of a headwind to sales your requirement for PD-L1 testing has been and then what your expectations are for share sales in this setting, given the testing's now going to become standard? Thanks.","Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Yeah, so let me start. First of all, we are thrilled to be the first to launch in first line lung. And I give Roger and his team a lot of credit for the design of the trials and the ability for us to actually be the first to have approval there. We are always looking at competition. We are always mindful of competition. And we want to make sure that we do everything we can to get as much utilization, appropriate utilization obviously, for the indication that we have, as quickly as possible and to really cement our product, KEYTRUDA, as foundational in the treatment of first-line lung cancer. With regard to second-line lung, right now we have about a 10% market share of the second-line lung market in the United States.","But if you look at patients that have PD-L1 greater than or equal to 50, that's where the majority of our market share is. And our market share is much, much higher in that group. With the new data that we have in first-line lung and a new indication, there's no doubt that PD-L1 testing will become standard. We're already seeing very significant increases in PD-L1 testing since the ESMO meeting. So I believe that the barrier of needing to be tested in second line for PD-L1 will be removed to a very large degree. And the fact that we now have an indication for all PD-L1 positive patients in the second-line setting, I believe that we should be a leader in not just first line, but second-line as well over time.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","And, Colin, it's Roger. Standing back from this, I think one has to be impressed by the general efficacy of combinations of KEYTRUDA with other agents. And that's true with respect to PD-1 blockade and other agents pre-clinically, but also clinically. So if you look at combinations, for example, with immune-active agents like T-VEC, there's impressive evidence of activity. There's evidence of activity with other immunologic agents, but there's also, as we've talked about, very impressive combination activity with chemotherapy.","And in a way, the 021G results in lung cancer basically put a floor on what to expect from these combinations. At a minimum, you're going to have to see the kinds of response rates and progression-free survival results that we've seen in 021G. Keep in mind, that study, as you know, is just 123 patients and nevertheless a highly significant result with respect to progression-free survival.","Over time, we'll see if an overall survival result is obtained there. Of course the crossover is so large in those populations, it may not be possible to see it. But I think that there is reason to believe that KEYTRUDA can be used in combination with a lot of things, and oncologists have a lot of experience using traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy. So there's reason to believe that those kinds of combinations will work well.","That said, one shouldn't discount other kinds of immunologic combinations, including combinations with CTLA-4 directed agents. We've done those studies and shown that there is activity for those combinations. The question is ultimately what provides the best balance in terms of therapeutic efficacy and safety and tolerability? It's early days. It will take some time to sort that out, but we'll be pursuing all of those things. And we are.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Great. Next question, please, Darla.","Operator","It's from Geoff Meacham with Barclays.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I have a couple related ones. Payer question on first-line lung. So what limitations would you guys expect on both duration or patients below the 50% cut point? Are there lessons to be learned from the second-line experience? And then, Roger, you mention crossover. So, some have talked about the lower rate of crossover for 024 as being a major contributor to the OS benefit. Just want to get your perspective on this with an eye towards the crossover rates that we could see in 189 or 407. Thanks.","Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Yeah, Geoff. So this is Adam. First of all, if you look at payers in first-line lung, we haven't seen any limitations on duration, and I don't think we'll see any limitations. With regard to people below PD-L1 greater than or equal to 50, we'll have to see what happens there. What we've seen in second-line is as long as they're PD-L1 positive that the payers are not pushing back very much on the physicians. So the physicians still have a lot of control if they're PD-L1 positive. I would assume it'll be the same in lung for first-line, but it's obviously early to tell.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","And, Geoff, it's Roger. With respect to crossover, clearly, if you have 100% crossover and it occurs early, then you're simply testing the treatment a few weeks apart, and under those circumstances, it's unlikely you'd be able to demonstrate an overall survival benefit.","That said, patients in a chemotherapy-controlled study \u2013 chemotherapy does have effect, and so crossover tends to occur later as a result. And under those circumstances, it will be possible to demonstrate an overall survival effect.","It's a fairly complicated set of differential equations one would have to apply to this to understand exactly what the puts and takes are. But my guess is that because the treatment effects seem to be really quite large in the 024 study, my guess is that we'll be able to see those kinds of treatment effects as well in the chemotherapy combinations. Time will tell.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Darla, next question, please.","Operator","It's from Andrew Baum with Citi.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Hello?","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Hi, Andrew.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.","Good morning.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Good morning. Just following on from the earlier question, could you just update us in relation to your collaboration with NanoString in terms of when this could be an approvable diagnostic that could drive broader usage in patients who may not have the higher expression levels of PD-L1?","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Right, Andrew. So the collaboration with NanoString is designed to obtain better, really better diagnostic mechanisms because we know that PD-L1 expression is an imperfect biomarker. That said, the NanoString test does not exclude PD-L1 expression. PD-L1 expression is an indicator of an inflammatory response because the PD-L1 transcriptional unit is under the control of cytokines like gamma interferon, and wherever there's an immune response, you'll see PD-L1 up-regulation.","Much of the NanoString signature involves other genes that are similarly regulated. So it isn't the case that the NanoString test will look totally different from a PD-L1 test. It will just have a better receiver-operator characteristics so that you will have better sensitivity and specificity. So I guess we continue to refine that signature. It's working quite well actually, but it'll take a while before we can actually reduce it in practice.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Next question, please, Darla?","Operator","It's from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I appreciate the comments you made in the prepared remarks about the leverage and it may take time given the investment. Can you just maybe give a little more color? We get a lot of questions on how to think about 2017 versus 2016, and I know you're not ready to give guidance, but just would you expect any degree of margin expansion as we look at this point on how 2017 would look relative to this year?","Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.","Yeah, no.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","If I could just throw one second question in, this is actually, maybe just moving away from KEYTRUDA now. There's a lot of great news there. Just beyond KEYTRUDA and everything you're working on there in oncology, maybe, Roger, if you could just highlight what are the other key pipeline assets that you think people may be overlooking? I know obviously you have the base and the CTP coming out next year, but I think people view those as higher risk. So are there other ones that you could point to that people should keep an eye out to think about diversification beyond KEYTRUDA? Thanks.","Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.","Yeah, Vamil. This is Rob. Thanks for the question. Obviously we're not in a position to give guidance for 2017 this morning, but just directionally, as I said in the prepared comments, we're moving into a period where we will have the pressure from ZETIA VYTORIN coming.","And that being said, we have the growing opportunity clinically we see with KEYTRUDA, and that's why we made the specific comments we did, which is while we remain committed to leverage long term, we recognize that in specific periods we may not be able to achieve that given the level of investment we need to make in R&D and the cost we've already taken out elsewhere in the organization.","So more to come as we get through the next quarter and we give specific guidance. But that was the purpose of the comment I made in the prepared remarks, to highlight what we see as a great opportunity with KEYTRUDA, and we're going to invest behind it appropriately.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","And, Vamil, with respect to key pipeline assets, obviously all the Phase III programs and those that are proceeding through registration investors are aware of. We're very excited about the work that we're doing overall in infectious diseases which includes the antibacterial programs, as I mentioned, relebactam of course pretty interesting, and doravirine in the HIV area. We actually have quite a large HIV program which is pretty exciting, and obviously the HCV program and triplet data are very important.","And beyond that, of course, the ertu [ertugliflozin] filing with our colleagues at Pfizer. Given our traditional strength now in diabetes and the opportunity to combine a really very well-behaved SGLT-2 inhibitor with JANUVIA, that can be an important opportunity as well. Nothing there that investors necessarily have missed, but I think important things to pay attention to. Early in the pipeline, there's an awful lot going on, but time doesn't permit me to really review that stuff.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Next question, please, Darla.","Operator","It's from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC","Oh, thanks for the questions. So couple of quick ones. First off, can you talk to us a little bit how the PD-L1 testing dynamic is actually shaking out percentage of basically lung cancer patients that are being tested with PD-L1 today? And where do you see that sort of maxing out in the next 12 months or so? And maybe can you give us a little bit of a sense of where you're seeing the majority of that uptake? Is it really starting at the academic hospitals or are the academic hospitals relatively fully penetrated and then the community's going to take a bit longer? Just trying to get a better sense of how the PD-L1 testing dynamic works.","And then secondly, how do the tests actually come back, and in what timeframe? Maybe you can just help us understand what information is provided to the physician when they request a PD-L1 test and how that information come backs? And then a last question is biosimilars. Can you just give us a sense of how you are thinking about the opportunity for biosimilars for Merck specifically? And how you would encourage investors to think about that? Thanks so much.","Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Okay. So let me address the questions on PD-L1 testing. I'll focus first on the U.S. because the dynamics are a little bit different in some other markets in the world. In the United States, about 60% of physicians are testing PD-L1. This was prior to ESMO. We don't have any new data on that percentage after ESMO. At the same time, we estimated that about 40% of non-small cell lung cancer new patients were being tested prior to ESMO.","I get weekly data, and it's not perfect but you can certainly see a trend break where there's a significant increase in the number of patients that are being tested for PD-L1 right after ESMO data was released. So I expect the numbers I just provided you will increase significantly, but I think it's important to remember that even if you look at EGFR testing, it took a while for that to become standard. And even today, after years, about 80% to 85% of patients are routinely tested. So I think there's probably a ceiling of somewhere between 80% to 85% of PD-L1 testing that'll occur over time. But with that said, it does take a little while to ramp up, albeit it's ramping up faster.","If you look at the length of time it takes to be tested, it's about the same as all other testing for lung cancer. So if a physician asks for PD-L1 testing, they can get it back within a week, typically as fast as they can get ALK testing or EGFR testing. So it's very fast.","In terms of the way it comes back to physicians, it's not always consistent. Different labs and then academic institutions, they may give it differently, but right now most of them come back with a number that says PD-L1, 55 or 48, as opposed to just a positive or a negative sign, and we think that that's the way it'll probably continue over time. We're seeing it in academic hospitals, but we're also seeing it, much more utilization even outside of those academic centers as well.","With regard to biosimilar opportunity, the bottom line is that we think it is a real commercial opportunity. It's not our strategy. Our strategy remains on innovation, but with $40 billion on a global basis of drugs that are biologics going off patent or at least biosimilars being able to enter the market over the next five years, we think there's a real opportunity for us commercially.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Great. Next question, please, Darla.","Operator","It's from Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Assuming KEYTRUDA and ALIMTA as a combo won't be reimbursed soon, Roger and Adam, based on your interaction with physicians and payers considering the label and compendium listing, how are you expecting patients that are strong expressers, somewhat below 50%, to be treated in the near term \u2013 35%, 40%, 45%, et cetera? And then on diabetes, Adam, can you talk more about the JANUVIA pricing pressure that you're seeing? What's driving it? And how sustained do you think it will be? Thanks.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Well, I would just say, Gregg, that in my discussions, I think people are wondering about those patients who are younger, otherwise healthy patients without significant comorbidities who present with a diagnosis of advanced lung cancer, and far too often when people present with lung cancer, it is already at a quite advanced stage, and the question of how to give those people the greatest possible benefit.","Whether they will choose to use chemotherapy combinations, obviously these are approved drugs, I don't know, but certainly I've heard physicians discuss that. They've wanted to discuss that with me and with others. So I think there is some consideration of that kind of issue. I think in the population of individuals who have significant comorbidities, of course the generally more favorable tolerability of KEYTRUDA as monotherapy will drive decision making.","Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.","And, Gregg, with regard to JANUVIA, as I mentioned in my remarks, we expect to still have very good managed care coverage in 2017 that's consistent with what we had in 2016. So we will have good access. The pricing pressure in the United States, it's certainly increased over the last few years, and there's new in-class competitors that have had significant discounts. And every year, the rebates and discounts have increased, and the same time will be true in 2017.","But at the same time with our strong position in terms of market share and our ability to grow our demand, in particular TRx volume, we've been able to offset most of the pricing pressures with the increase in demand. So I think that 2017 of course there'll be more pressure than 2016, but we're optimistic as we move into the year.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks. We'll go to the next question.","Operator","It's from John Scotti with Evercore ISI.","John Scotti - Evercore ISI","Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. Just a couple on KEYTRUDA and one on hep C. So I was wondering if you could characterize a bit more your base case for what you see the ramp is into the first-line. Given the level of PD-L1 testing you're seeing already, should we expect a fast ramp into the 4Q? Is there a warehouse of patients ready to get on therapy? And then given the exclusion criteria in 024, so brain mets [metastases], autoimmune, EGFR, ALK, et cetera, should we think about the real world addressable population of KEYNOTE-024 as perhaps lower than the 25%, 30% of first-line lung that has PD-L1 expression? Or does that number bake into excluded patients?","And then quickly, are there any interims built into the Phase III KEYNOTE-189 and KEYNOTE-407 chemo combo studies that have the potential to stop early? So do we have a sense for when those may be? And then briefly on ZEPATIER, can you characterize what you're seeing out there in terms of discounting? And is discounting increasing? And then you mentioned that new formulary position will take into effect in January of next year and I was just wondering if those are parity contracts or are there any exclusive contracts there? Thanks so much.","Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Yeah. So let me start with first-line lung. There are no bolus of patients that we would expect in first line lung. We expect that as patients are newly diagnosed, that's when they would be considered for utilization for KEYTRUDA. So I would not expect a big bolus that would come into the marketplace in fourth quarter. It's going to be new patient by new patient.","Over a year in the United States, Japan and the EU there's about 250,000 patients that are new patients with non-small cell lung cancer, and based on everything that we've seen we believe that 25% to 30% is the right number for you to think about as we look at those patients in the marketplace.","And then the last thing I'd say is if you look at ZEPATIER, as I mentioned on previous calls, the marketplace had very significant discounting that was occurring. In fact, the pressure on the rebates and discounts before we even launched into the market was very significant. Despite that, we feel like we've gotten good formulary access. We're doing very well in the VA, Medicare Part D, also in some commercial plans, particularly in the regional plans.","As we look at 2017, beginning of January, we do have some new contracts, many of them are at parity, but I think there will be one or two that we'll be able to discuss in the not-too-distant future where we will have a preferred position.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","And, John, it's Roger. With respect to the exclusion criteria in KEYNOTE-024, I don't think you should worry about that too much. Patients with active brain metastases are treated typically with radiation directed towards those metastases as a medical emergency. Those are the same kinds of patients that we enrolled in the study. There weren't really significant exclusion criteria that are different from what appears in routine practice though. The number that we're quoting is pretty much what you should expect. Our studies are aligned with what's been seen epidemiologically.","And for KEYNOTE-189, the ClinicalTrials.gov dates are the dates you should probably use. That study, final data entry's listed in September, and that's probably a good time to think about the 189 study.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Great. We'll move onto our next question, please.","Operator","It's from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks very much. Regarding GARDASIL, could you just tell us what the recent price increase was? And how we should think about the potential decline in sales next year, as there's the shift from three doses to two doses for treatment? So specifically how we should think about netting out the positive benefit of the price increase as we think about the reduction of dosing? And then with respect to KEYTRUDA, could you just tell us what the U.S. sales were by indication in the third quarter so we have a sense of the business mix in the third quarter? Thank you.","Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Yeah, sure. Dave, let me start with GARDASIL. If you look at GARDASIL, there's a couple things to think about. First of all, we've had price increases similar to the price increases that we've had in the past so that you haven't seen any difference or acceleration per se. But you also have to realize that the 9-valent costs a bit more than the 4-valent. And most of the patients are moving to the 9-valent vaccine. So I'd net the price increase plus the difference in price between those two, the 4-valent and the 9-valent.","The thing that is hard for us to understand right now is if you have two doses, will the doses be given in the same year? Or, for example, if a person presents themselves in August before back-to-school, do they get one dose next year in August? But they don't get the second dose until the following year in August. So there's still some things that we're going to have to wait to see in terms of how physicians treat those patients.","Some might get the first dose in January, the second dose in July or August. Some might just get August dose, the one, and then the following year be the second dose. So there's certainly going to be an impact. The magnitude right now we can't be certain of.","And if you look at the sales by indication, just to give you a rough amount, about 50% to 55% of our sales were melanoma. About 25% or so was in lung, 5% or so was in head and neck cancer. This is for the U.S. specifically, and then the rest was in all other.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Great. We'll move on to the next question, please.","Operator","It's from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Just a couple of follow-up questions on issues that were already addressed. Again, Adam, in the biomarker testing process, I'm still unclear about something. You said that there's about 60% testing, but is that 60% including PD-1 or is that 60% testing in general for EGFR and ALK? And where are we with \u2013 in front-line, how many docs or how much of that testing is for PD-1? And again, I know we've been trying to get a sense for timeline, but can you elaborate a little bit longer on how long that's going to take for the market to be prepared for a large penetration of KEYTRUDA in front-line just given that PD-1 testing is probably in its early stages? But if you can elaborate on that.","And also, Roger, just on the compendia listing issue for KEYNOTE-021 which we learned was rejected, there was a lot of enthusiasm expressed about that at ESMO. What is the process now? Do you have another opportunity to get that on the compendia listing? Or do we need to wait for the full Phase III trials? Thanks very much.","Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.","First \u2013 so Jami, this is Adam. First of all, I want to be clear on the 60% number that I provided. What I said was approximately 60% of U.S. physicians are testing for PD-L1, not that 60% of patients are being tested. So right now if you look at physicians across the U.S. that treat lung cancer, we believe about 60% of them test at least sometimes for PD-L1. We also believe that about 40% of non-small cell lung cancer new patients are being tested for PD-L1. So that should give you a better idea of what's happening prior to ESMO.","Since ESMO, I don't have updates to these numbers because it takes time to have these updated, but I do see a very significant increase in the total number of tests that are being ordered for PD-L1. I don't believe that there's any rate-limiting ability of the labs or the institutions to do the testing, so that's not the issue. The question is how quickly will physicians adopt testing for all patients? And the reason I capped that at about 80% to 85% is because even today, for EGFR testing, we see only about 80% to 85% of patients that are treated. So if we're at 40%, the cap is at 80%, the question is how fast do we go from 40% to the 80% or 85%, and that's what we're working on.","With regard to a ramp up for lung, there's not going to be a bolus of patients. The 250,000 patients in the top seven markets around the world come in throughout the entire year, and the question will be, as they come in, how quickly will they be put onto KEYTRUDA if they have PD-L1 greater than or equal to 50?","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","And, Jami, it's Roger. With respect to compendium listings, the process is completely independent, of course, and it is simply groups of experts who look at available data and make decisions about guidelines, in essence, so there's no real basis for readdressing that question with the KEYNOTE-021G data which they've already looked at. The compendium analysis I would think would be informed by the availability of more data. Now other things could change, but I think what we would expect is that with the availability of KEYNOTE-189 and others, there'll be the opportunity to pursue it, presuming that those data are actually confirmatory, to pursue labeling for that. And that's probably the next thing that happens in that general area.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","It's from John Boris with SunTrust.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions. Just one related to pricing for Ken. Just on Proposition 61, Ken, which will be on the November 8 ballot in California as a proposed statute, just your thoughts on that proposal since it would create possibly a price ceiling on prescription drug cost paid by state programs, predominantly Medicaid. And can you just remind us what percent of your business is in Medicaid? Second question relates to the one asked by Jami. Can we just get an update on where you are on enrollment on KEYNOTE-189 and any thoughts on interim analyses on that program? Thanks.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.","So let me start with Proposition 61. So first of all, we don't break out our sales by channel, but I will say as an overall comment, we have very serious concerns about this measure and its potential impact on patients. And that's why we're part of a growing coalition of groups that are actively opposing that ballot measure in California, because we think it will negatively impact millions of California patients. So we're very active in opposing it.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","And John, on KEYNOTE-189 as I said, the thing to think about is the ClinicalTrials.gov date of September of next year is about the time one should expect a data readout. We're not anticipating that we'll have anything before then.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Next question, please, Darla.","Operator","It's from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much. First one here just following up on John's question, more broadly on drug pricing and public scrutiny. Just seems like there's a lot more focus on drug pricing than any time in recent memory, whether it's Prop 61, the EpiPen hearings, et cetera. So maybe just a question for Ken. Just how do you see this playing out for the industry? Are you guys thinking about price differently than in the past? Should we be thinking about a more challenging pricing environment going forward? Would love to just hear your thoughts on that topic.","And then a second one just coming back to some of the business development priorities, I know the focus is on bolt-ons, but when we're thinking about larger details specifically, would Merck be willing to take on single program or product risk in a larger deal? As we're thinking about those, if a sizeable component evaluation were tied to one or two core programs, is that something that fits what Merck's looking for? Or should we be thinking about more diversified assets as we think about things that are beyond bolt-ons? Thanks very much.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.","Let me start with the business development question. I would start by saying that I think we will look at each deal based on its particular merits, and so I don't think there is a way for me to respond to that. I think what our past experience has been is we've tried to look for those deals where we believe we're going to get scientific assets going forward, and if we can get good assets that are in the marketplace now, that's something that we would be willing to do. But I don't think I can say categorically that we wouldn't take the kind of deal that has a concentration in one product versus another. Obviously concentration is one of the factors that you weigh when you think about the risk inherent in the deal.","As it relates to pricing, we also are very concerned about the whole issue of pricing and affordability for patients. It's a significant one. It's been amplified in this year's political season. We find it unfortunate that a lot of times the focus is on affordability and pricing rather than the long term benefit that these therapies provide.","So from our perspective, we think that going forward we don't think these environmental pricing pressures will ease, and that's why we continue to focus on our strategy of investing in innovative R&D for products like KEYTRUDA because we think those are the kinds of products that will help Merck weather some of the pricing risks and pricing pressures that we will be facing as an industry going forward.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks. We're going to try to squeeze in one last question, Darla.","Operator","It's from Tony Butler with Guggenheim Partners.","Tony Butler - Guggenheim Partners","Yes. Thank you very much. Roger, just a very quick question on 189, 407. As patients move over or change overall therapy, those from chemo onto pembro [pembrolizumab] plus chemo \u2013 and this question I think is really important because there may be a hypothesis around duration, and I'm curious if you think that's possible. That is, the longer we look, we actually don't see \u2013 even if patients cross over, on the other side of that crossover they may not totally separate. And I'm just wondering if you think that's a possibility. Thanks very much for your time, and also congrats on a good roll you're on.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Well thanks, Tony. I do think again as I said, at the limit if the crossover occurs early, I mean, you're just comparing a single chemotherapy regimen to chemotherapy plus KEYTRUDA given earlier lay. If they're only weeks apart, I don't see how, under those circumstances, how overall survival would separate. And of course that's a traditional problem in the development of chemotherapeutic agents and the reason why progression-free survival has been accepted as an endpoint in a variety of different tumor types.","On the other hand, chemotherapy is active, and for individuals whose disease is controlled by chemotherapy, then the crossover will inherently occur later. Because we believe that KEYTRUDA provides a more durable benefit to patients with lung cancer, and the data from that are clear across a variety of tumor types, under those circumstances, I would expect separation for overall survival. And as I indicated, it's a fairly complicated set of equations to try and estimate what that's going to look like. I think we probably have to wait for the data.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.","Let me close by saying this was a very strong quarter for Merck. As we look to the future we're very excited by the launch opportunities that we have in front of us: KEYTRUDA, ZEPATIER, BRIDION as examples. We think those building on the firm foundation we have with products like JANUVIA and our vaccines give us a great opportunity in the long term.","We know that we're facing some headwinds from loss of exclusivity in the next year, but we continue to be confident in our ability to actually invest in some of these high-potential programs going forward. And you should know that we will continue to look for ways to help offset some of the incremental spend that we'll have to make in order to support a product like KEYTRUDA to ensure that this company provides the best short and long term proposition for its shareholders.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Teri Loxam, SVP, Investor Relations and Global Communications. Please go ahead.","Teri Loxam","Thank you, Darla, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Merck's first quarter 2019 conference call. Today I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Labs, who will each have prepared remarks. In addition, I'm also joined by Mike Nally, our Chief Marketing Officer; and Frank Clyburn, our Chief Commercial Officer, who will be available for the Q&A portion of the call.","Before I turn the call over to Ken, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation of these in our press release. We have also provided a table in our press release to help you understand that sales in the quarter for the business units and products.","I would like to remind you that some of the statements that we made during today's call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor Provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

You can see our SEC filings as well as today's earnings release on merck.com.","Finally, similar to last quarter, we have posted a presentation to the investors section of merck.com, which includes some of our highlights from the quarter.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken.","Ken Frazier","Thank you, Teri. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. We had a very strong start to 2019. And we are seeing our fundamental strategy of investing thoughtfully in R&D involving the science payoff. Our current portfolio of assets continues to drive strong growth and we are working to ensure that we capture the near-term opportunities in front of us to maintain this momentum, while planning for the next generation of treatments.","Our first quarter performance with double-digit year-over-year sales and EPS growth are the results of portfolio and operational strengths driven by oncology, vaccines, and select hospitals and specialty products. We\u2019re confident that products within these areas, including KEYTRUDA, LYNPARZA, LENVIMA, GARDASIL, BRIDION and others together with our Animal Health franchise will lead to strong growth over the coming years.","Our performance in this first quarter also speaks to our success globally as we've received a number of additional approvals and launched new products in various markets around the world. Our international business, which represented nearly 60% of our sales this quarter, has strong momentum. And we believe that we've only scratched the surface in terms of the opportunity in key markets such as China, where we are seeing significant growth.","We foresee a stream of additional approvals from our current portfolio of products across markets globally, and we will look to maximize these opportunities powered by our commercial team's proven ability to execute. In parallel, we are also focused on advancing our promising pipeline and continuing to augment our internal research and development efforts with external innovation. We are excited by the prospect of our pipeline, which includes potential new treatments and vaccines, oncology, HIV, and many other areas of significant and ongoing unmet needs.","There is also impressive work underway in our discovery hubs in Cambridge, London, and South San Francisco, where we are incorporating some of the most scientifically advanced modalities and technologies in the world. Importantly, these hubs are located where many of the best biotech and scientific mines are gathered. And we're benefiting from the vibrant academics and biotech communities in each of our respective hub.","Finally, we're continuing to evolve in a rapidly changing industry environment to best position Merck for sustainable, profitable growth over the long term, while helping to drive positive outcomes for patients. The overall healthcare landscape remains dynamic as the industry grapples with complex issues such as the rising cost of healthcare, generally, pharmaceutical prices in an excess, and the shift to more outcomes based reimbursement systems. At the same time, we believe that demand for even better outcomes for more innovative medicines will continue around the world giving us back and growing unmet need in cancer, Alzheimer's disease and in so many other areas as the global population continues to grow, while countries, certain countries age. As a result, we will remain step-back and going where the science leads us in order to bring forward transformative medicines and vaccines. We are confident in our strategy, our growth prospects and our ability to continue to deliver significant benefits for patients and value to shareholders in 2019 and beyond.","We look forward to discussing these matters in more detail with you in our Investor Day in June, where we plan to give you a deeper understanding of our pipeline and company and provide you with the opportunity to meet a broader set of our scientists and business leaders.","With that, I'll pass the call over to Rob to go through the details of our quarterly results. Rob?","Rob Davis","Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. As Ken mentioned, Merck had one of its strongest quarters in the recent history. Our first quarter results reflect broad based strength across our portfolio and continued discipline in our resource allocation. We executed very well across our key growth stores, and our updated guidance reflects confidence that we remain well positioned to deliver strong growth this year and in for the future.","Turning to the top line, total company revenues were $10.8 billion, an increase of 8% year-over-year, or 11%, excluding the negative impact from foreign currency. This quarter was led by our human health business with growth of 12%, excluding exchange. Animal Health revenues grew 3%, excluding exchange. The remainder of my comments pertaining to sales will be on an exchange basis.","The increase in human health revenues was led by key products in our oncology, vaccines and hospital and specialty businesses. Growth was strong in both the U.S. and international markets, and especially in China, where sales increased 67% year-over-year, driven largely by newly launched products,","In oncology, KEYTRUDA sales were nearly $2.3 billion this quarter, an increase of 60% versus the first quarter of 2018. Growth was primarily driven by higher use in first line non-small cell lung cancer both as monotherapy and with the rollout of the chemo combo.","In addition, utilization remains strong across the breadth of indications including melanoma, head and neck, bladder and MSI-high cancers. With our recent approvals and adjuvant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma in the United States, we are now approved in 18 indications across 11 different tumor types, plus a pan tumor approval in MSI-high patients. We are also very excited by recent approvals in Japan and China, and look forward to making additional indications available to patients and markets around the world.","In the U.S., first-line lung cancer remains a key driver of growth given further penetration of the chemo combo in both nonsquamous and squamous non-small cell lung cancer. We also are encouraged by early feedback in adjuvant melanoma, which was our first approval in the adjuvant setting.","First-line lung has also become a larger contributor in ex-U.S. markets with growth driven by further uptake of our monotherapy indication and PD-L1 high expressers that also by demand for the chemo combo, following regulatory and reimbursement approvals in select EU markets and Japan.","In Europe, the uptake of the chemo combo and non-squamous patients has strong end-markets, where we have gain reimbursement. And we look forward to potential additional reimbursement approvals later this year as well as an introduction of the chemo combo in the squamous setting.","In Japan, KEYTRUDA growth accelerated this quarter given the recent approvals across find indications, including lung, adjuvant melanoma and MSI-high cancers with utilization of the chemo combo and first-line lung cancer as a particularly strong driver of growth.","Finally, in China, we are seeing strong sales of KEYTRUDA, following our launch late last year and metastatic melanoma. And we were very excited by our recent approval in China in first-line lung cancer.","Overall, we remain very confident in KEYTRUDA's benefit to patients and long-term growth potential given its established immune-oncology leadership and increased utilization across many indications, and in markets around the world, as well as our expectation for many additional approvals going forward.","We also remain encouraged by the progress and potential of both LYNPARZA and LENVIMA, which we are developing and marketing in collaboration with AstraZeneca and Eisai respectably. LYNPARZA sales doubled this quarter, driven by further uptake in ovarian cancer following the U.S. approval of solo one in December as well as uptake in new markets such as China and Japan. In the U.S. across all tumors, LYNPARZA continues to lead the PARP inhibitor class with over 50% total patient share.","We remain excited by the long-term potential of LYNPARZA, especially with a recent start of the initial Phase 3 KEYTRUDA combination studies. LENVIMA is another important product for our oncology portfolio. Sales this quarter reflected continued strong performance in hepatocellular carcinoma following recent launches around the world. The launch in China is still early, but we believe that opportunity there is large given the high prevalence of HTC in that market.","Now turning to vaccines. Our vaccines business reflected strong demand for GARDASIL, which achieved sales of over $800 million this quarter, representing growth at 31% compared to Q1 of 2018. Ex-U.S. demand remains particularly robust while continued strong uptake in China, following the GARDASIL 9 launch last May, and increased general neutral vaccination in Europe. The decline in the U.S. reflects timing of public sector purchases which will more than offset underlying demand.","The strong growth demonstrating across our overall vaccines portfolio was also helped by the performance of certain pediatric products. Our hospital and specialty business was led by 30%","growth in sales of BRIDION. U.S. growth reflects BRIDION's increased utilization and procedures were neuromuscular reversal agent issues, including in robotics and minimally invasive surgeries.","Animal Health revenue increased 3% this quarter to just over $1 billion. Companion animal sales grew 6%, primarily driven by strong demand globally for the BRAVECTO line of products. Livestock sales grew 1%, driven by volume growth, particularly from new poultry and swine vaccines. This was largely offset by lower aluminum product sales, driven by distributor purchasing patterns and weather-related softness resulting in delayed movement of cattle into the feed loss in the United States.","While Animal Health growth this quarter was light versus recent trends, we still expect our full year performance to again outpace the overall market. Additionally, we are very excited by the recent closing of our acquisition of Antelliq, which establishes Merck as a leader in animal identification and monitoring, one of the fastest growing parts of the Animal Health industry.","Turning to the rest of our P&L, my comments will be on the non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 75.9% in the quarter, an increase of 30 basis points versus the first quarter of 2018, favorable benefits of product mix and foreign currency were mostly offset by lower price, higher royalties and amortization of milestone payments.","Operating expenses of $4.4 billion increased 2% year-over-year, including a favorable two-percentage-point impact from foreign exchange. Our investments in research and development grew 9%, driven by clinical development spending in oncology and vaccines as well as our discovery and early development efforts.","SG&A spending declined 3% year-over-year as we continue to drive productivity and reallocate resources to our highest value growth opportunities. Other income and expense reflected $21 million of expense this quarter versus $259 million of income last year. The negative variance was primarily due to a litigation settlement gain in last year's first quarter as well as lower income from certain investments in equity securities and higher net interest expense this year.","Our tax rate of 16.5% for the quarter was 350 basis points lower year-over-year, largely due to favorable discrete items, primarily related to foreign tax credits and prior year mix of income adjustments booked this quarter. Taken together, our earnings per share increased 18%, excluding exchange to $1.22.","Turning to our outlook for the year, we are narrowing and raising both our revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance ranges for 2019, reflecting our strong and continued operational performance. We remain confident in both our near and long-term prospects to revenue growth, driven by expected demand for innovative products across key growth pillars, which more than overcome expected headwinds from price, foreign currency and pressures on mature and LOE products.","For 2019, we now expect revenues of $43.9 billion to $45.1 billion, which represents 4% to 7% growth versus 2018, driven by strength across our oncology, vaccines, hospital and specialty and Animal Health businesses. This range assumes a negative impact from foreign exchange of just over one-percentage-point using mid-April rates, which is slightly above our former assumption.","We are also increasing our expected EPS range to be between $4.67 and $4.79, including a slightly positive impact from foreign exchange at mid-April rates, down from the one-percentage-point positive impact we had previously assumed. The new range represents growth of approximately 8% to 10% versus 2018.","Other elements of our guidance remain unchanged, including our expectation for roughly flat gross margins, a low to mid-single digit increase in operating expense, driven mostly by the meaningful investments we continue to make in R&D, which we expect to increase in the back half of the year an expectation for roughly $0 in other income and expense, and finally, a full year tax rate of a range of 18.5% to 19.5%.","In summary, we are very pleased by our first quarter performance. We expect our operational momentum to continue throughout the remainder of 2019 with continued strength across our few pillars of growth. Strong revenue growth along with disciplined resource allocation will allow us to make important investments in our pipeline, while at the same time delivering a leverage P&L and meaningful increases in earnings per share.","We believe our ongoing efforts to develop and deliver innovative products that help meet unmet medical needs for patients worldwide and coupled with strong commercial execution and discipline financial management positioned us very well to generate strong short and long-term value to society and to our shareholders.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Roger.","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","Thanks, Rob. The first quarter saw a continued progress across all aspects of the R&D portfolio. As has already been mentioned, early in the quarter we obtained U.S. approval for KEYTRUDA when used as Adjuvant therapy in the treatment of patients for the malignant melanoma with lymph node following definitive reception.","More recently we obtained approval for combined use of KEYTRUDA and Pfizer's axitinib in the first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma based on the results of our KEYNOTE-426 trial. The strength of this study in which improved overall response rates, progression free survival and overall survival compared with traditional treatment with single agent sunitinib were observed led to a very rapid review with approval secured nearly two months prior to the PDUFA date. I should also note that the combination of KEYTRUDA plus axitinib yielded consistently favorable results versus sunitinib in all traditionally defined patient subgroups and irrespective the PD-L1 expression in the tumor.","KEYTRUDA acts on a very broad range of malignancies. The current FDA label includes indications from SALVAGE to Adjuvant therapy while in different settings expanding 11 different tumor types with more indications currently under review. During the quarter, we also gained approval for KEYTRUDA in China when combined with platinum plus pemetrexed chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. With this approval, we hope to bring the benefits of this combination regiment previously approved in the United States, the EU, Japan and other major jurisdictions for the very large population of patients in China suffering from pulmonary malignancy.","We also obtained FDA approval for the use of KEYTRUDA monotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors expressed PD-L1 at 1% or more of tumor cells based on the results of our KEYNOTE-042 study. This indication broadly use of KEYTRUDA monotheraphy to a much larger set of patients. Previously only those patients in whom 50% or more of tumor cells were shown or expressed PD-L1 were included in the monotheraphy indication. This recent broader approval also includes stage pre-patients who are not candidates for surgical resection of their disease or for treatment by definitive chemoradiation.","At this point, I should note at the end of first quarter, we posted our 1,000 KEYTRUDA study on clinicaltrials.gov. And surprisingly, the bulk of new studies examined combinations of KEYTRUDA with other regiments and at earlier stages of disease. Not all of these studies yielded the results that we and our patients around the hope for. As we have previously announced both our KEYNOTE-240 study in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and our KEYNOTE-062 study in the first-line treatment of patients with gastric cancer did not meet our expectations. However, both of these studies, the results of which we expect to be discussed with The American Society for Clinical Oncology Meeting in June, provided important information that we'll assist specialists and refining their treatment regiments.","In addition, the aggregated results of our clinical programs inform the selection of novel agents. As an example, we have more than 20 molecular entities currently under study in early stage clinical trials. Beyond this, together with our colleagues of AstraZeneca, we made significant progress in advancing the use of our PARP inhibitor LYNPARZA for the maintenance treatment of patients with malignancies that they are evidence of defective DNA repair. Just yesterday, we announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use or CHMP of European Medicines Agency has adapted a positive opinion recommending LYNPARZA as first-line maintenance treatment for women with advanced BRCA-mutated epithelial ovarian fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who have responded to traditional first-line platinum based chemo therapy. This recommendation or an indication has already been achieved in the United States was based on the SOLO-1 study showing that LYNPARZA treatment reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 70% versus that observe the placebo treatment. The CHMP recommendation follows approval by The European Commission authorizing LYNPARZA for the treatment of germline BRCA-mutated HER2-negative advanced breast cancer based on the OlympiAD trial.","Also in the first quarter, we announced that LYNPARZA treatment improved progression-free survival versus placebo in patients with germline BRCA-mutated metastatic pancreatic cancer. This disease had not progressed on platinum based chemotherapy. Pancreatic cancer is an exceedingly difficult disease to treat. And we were gratified to see both statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in patients with germline BRCA-mutations.","On the infectious disease front, earlier this month, we have the opportunity to describe the use of ZERBAXA to treat hospital acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia at the European Congress on Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Disease Meeting in Amsterdam. In this ASPECT-NP study, we evaluated an increased dose of ZERBAXA 3 grams per day, which provided improved intrapulmonary drug levels and infected lungs.","The study met its primary and key secondary endpoints in this critically ill population. 92% of them were accessed in intensive care units, including favorable efficacy in patients with key key gram-negative pathogens. The results of ASPECT-NP are currently under priority review at the FDA as a qualified infectious disease product with a PDUFA date of June 3rd. The same medication is also under review by the CHMP in Europe.","Looking ahead and beyond ZERBAXA, we have multiple PDUFAs during the second quarter. In the infectious disease area, the first quarter saw acceptance with priority review for a new drug application detailing the activity of our novel beta-lactamase inhibitor Relebactam to be used in combination with Imipenem and Cilastatin for the treatment is susceptible Gram-negative infections with the PDUFA date of July 16th.","In the oncology space, FDA has granted priority review for KEYTRUDA in the first-line treatment of patients with current or metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancer either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy based on the results of the KEYNOTE-048 trial with the PDUFA date of June 10th, and for KEYTRUDA in the third-line treatment of patients with advanced small-cell lung cancer based on results from the KEYNOTE-158 and KEYNOTE-028 trials for the PDUFA date of June 17th. We're also looking forward to a large set of Phase 3 results, including the first data from our registration enabling program for the 15 Valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine V114, which is intended to provide broad protection against invasive pneumococcal disease in susceptible population.","We will provide more information about this program and about our other areas of research at the Investor Day meeting on June 20th. Now my colleagues and I will take your questions.","Teri Loxam","Thanks Roger. Darla, we'll move to the Q&A portion. We're sensitive to the rest of our peers reporting this morning. So we'll end our call just before 9 A.M. So I'd ask that you keep your questions to a maximum of one or two so that we can get as many people on the call as possible. So Darla?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question from Jason Gerberry, Bank of America.","Jason Gerberry","Just two for me. First, just can you talk, Ken, maybe a little bit about the future of Merck's role as a primary care company? I know a lot of investors perceive the company is largely pivoting post genuity LOE away from primary care and becoming more of a specialty company. But you also have programs like MK-7264. So just -- if you can provide a little bit of color in terms of the company's commitment and thought process regarding being a primary care player longer term? And then just, secondly, can you guys give a little bit of color that the KEYTRUDA loan opportunity in China? A little bit more specific there would be helpful. Thanks.","Ken Frazier","Well, let me start by saying that as a company, we are focused on following the science and coming up with innovative products that make a big difference. We are not saying we're going to be totally a specialty company or vaccines company or primary care company. What we actually want to do is to make sure that we take advantage of the best opportunities. Right now, in oncology, the current growth is largely driven by that. But if you look at our pipeline, things like for example, the pneumococcal vaccines are things that are essentially primary care type products. So I would say we haven't committed ourselves to one area of medicine. It has always been helpful to us to follow the science. And we're going to continue to do that going forward.","Frank Clyburn","And with regards to China -- good morning, this is Frank. We're one very excited about the overall opportunity in China as we demonstrated, as Rob mentioned, 67% growth versus prior year. Specifically with KEYTRUDA, last year we received our second-line melanoma indication in China, and as Roger mentioned, we just received our first-line lung indication with the combination with chemotherapy. We're really excited about the opportunity in China. We will be working through the NRDL listing process with the Chinese regulators. And given the timing of our lung approval, we'll have to see if NRDL listing is a possibility this year. A listing would open up an exciting opportunity to expand volumes. But even without that, we feel that we're very well positioned for with KEYTRUDA in China with the only PD-1 that has a first-line lung cancer indication. And we feel as though the breath of our program as you've seen in other markets, we plan to bring additional indications to China, which we think positions us very well for future growth.","Teri Loxam","Right. Thanks. Let's move to the next question, please.","Operator","Let's move to Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI.","Umer Raffat","I actually wanted to focus not on cancer today for a change and perhaps on HIV for a minute. I just wanted to gauge your expectations into the drive to simplify Phase 2 trials coming up this summer. I understand you have a triple of like regimen. And I guess my question really is what is it that we can learn about MK-8591 in the context of the combination pill? And what are you, specifically looking for on deciding whether to take this program forward into larger Phase 3? Thank you.","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","8591 has extraordinary properties as you appreciate both in terms of its potency and in terms of the duration of its effects. We have had the opportunity to present some of those data in the past, but we're now getting -- we'll have a chance to look at significant Phase 2 studies of long duration. I'm quite optimistic actually, that we're going to see very good responses in that setting in that that will lead to Phase 3 programs. Over time, I think the real advantage of 8591 -- this has ability to be put into a long-term format as potentially an implantable that could provide enormous benefits from pre-exposure prophylaxis point of view, but as well, dramatically simplify the treatment regimen for patients who are already infected with HIV in order to achieve long-term viral suppression. So we're going to be looking at those results of Phase 2 results very soon and have the opportunity to present them. And I think that will lead to much larger studies. And we're quite enthusiastic about 8591.","Teri Loxam","Okay. Thank you. We'll move on to the next question please, Darla?","Operator","It's from Chris Schott with JP Morgan.","Chris Schott","I guess, just two here. Maybe first, can you just elaborate a little bit more on KEYTRUDA in front-line lung, as you think about Europe? Just, where are we at this point in terms of reimbursement and market share? And how should we be thinking about kind of the ramp in that first-line lung business as we go through the rest of this year? My second question was just trying to get a better handle on longer-term margin dynamics. Can you just elaborate a little bit more expense trends over time? I know specifically, you've talked about R&D investments this year and next. But we think longer-term -- can we think about expenses actually rolling over beyond 2020 starting decline or is the longer-term margin opportunity more about expenses this growing at a slower rate than top line? Thanks very much.","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","With regards to KEYTRUDA outside the U.S. and Europe, in particular, first, we're very pleased. We sold close to $985 million this quarter and had growth of almost 69% versus prior year outside the U.S. So we're very pleased with our progress. In lung, specifically, lung represents about 70% of our sales outside the U.S. We have access right now in Germany and many of the mid-European markets. We're still working on access in several of the other large European markets for reimbursements, which we expect will come on line hopefully in the second half of this year. So our overall momentum where we have first-line lung approval for monotherapy is very strong with a leader clearly in lung, in that setting. The chemo combination has helped us to ramp, as I mentioned. And we have market leading shares in the markets -- in Europe there and then look forward to the second half of the year where we'll see additional reimbursement additional markets come onboard for access. So we're very pleased with where we are in Europe and outside the U.S. with regards to lung.","Teri Loxam","And Rob, can you comment on margins.","Rob Davis","So with your question on margin, maybe just an overall comment then the specifics on what's happening in the operating expense line. We have said and we continue to believe we do expect meaningful operating margin expansion over time driven by revenue growth, the changing mix of our business, our continued focus on efficiencies and ultimately a moderation of R&D growth over time. So I just put that up there as to set context with, specifically when you look at what will be driving the margin expansion into your question. We will continue to see R&D grow over the next couple of years and we would expect that to be at a rate faster than sales. But after that, we do expect to see R&D moderate. It will still grow. And our overall OpEx we believe will continue to grow. It just will be growing at rates slower than sales that should allow for the margin expansion we've been talking about. So it's not that we expect absolute reduction in spend, but just a moderation of growth as we move through the bolus of investments in the really expansive and frankly impressive clinical program that our MRL colleagues have put together in the near-term here.","Teri Loxam","Let's move on to the next question please.","Operator","It's from Navin Jacob with UBS.","Navin Jacob","If I may, on KEYTRUDA, the administration will be or the OMB putting out the regulations on or draft guidance on IP. I just wondering to the extent that you can share with us what the average net prices in the Europe relative to the net price here in the U.S.? Is the administration's characterization of EU to U.S. pricing differential of -- or U.S. to EU pricing differential of 1.3 to 1. Is that fair? And then number two, just on the China market, how large is KEYTRUDA right now, roughly analyzing in China that'd be very helpful to us? Thank you.","Frank Clyburn","Yes. So on the first question, this is Frank, with regards to KEYTRUDA, we're really focused on our overall strong underlying demand in the U.S. and outside the U.S. in our strong data. We haven't shared with regards to net pricing outside the U.S. With regards to China, we see the opportunity as very significant. If you look at the lung market in particular, the 600,000 to 700,000 lung cancer patients in China, half of them have a driver mutation, and we think a couple hundred thousand of those patients are available for treatment with our overall KEYNOTE-189 regimen. So we see China is a very significant opportunity of growth going forward. And we're very pleased that we're rolling out our new lung cancer indication.","Teri Loxam","Thanks, Frank. We'll move on to the next question please, Darla.","Operator","It\u2019s from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.","Vamil Divan","So one, maybe just on the lung side, you mentioned the KEYNOTE-042 approval. Can you may be just quantify sort of your expectations on the use of monotherapy in patients with PD-L1 between 1 to 50? And then also the stage three opportunity, I think, maybe because people may surprise with that label expansion. So if you can talk about the commercial opportunities there? And then maybe, Ken, just building on the earlier question around primary care and sort of business development priorities. Can you maybe just comment broader on sort of the size of deals that you want to focus on the science? I think a lot of investors also curious on just as you think about bolt-on versus largest transactions? Or any changes in your priorities there?","Teri Loxam","All right. Let's start with Frank.","Frank Clyburn","So KEYNOTE-042, we see as a very positive advancement for our position in non-small cell lung cancer. As Roger mentioned, our new indication is based on -- for patients who are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemo radiation. So it gives us an entry in the Stage 3 patients. It's a smaller subset of Stage 3 patients based on our indication, but an important indication for us to expand into non-small cell lung cancer. The other aspect of 42 does allow us. It allows to bringing all PD-L1 positive patients in the metastatic setting that would look for a monotherapy option. And there are patients that look for monotherapy options may be based off of their performance status or other co-morbidities. We see this as an important opportunity as well. So we're very pleased that KEYNOTE-042 helps to round out our overall lung story and positions us very strong for future growth in lung.","Ken Frazier","Okay. And on the business development side, I would just say that, first of all, last year, we were very active. We did about 60 transactions spanning licensing, technology deals and clinical collaborations. As we said before, our goal is to find the best scientific opportunities that we can. Our balance sheet gives us the opportunity to look across the entire spectrum of opportunities. But we've also been very clear that while we look at everything, what most appetizing to us are the bolt-on deals because we believe that the least disruptive thing from an R&D standpoint. I would also comment that while the end of last year, we felt valuations were going in the right direction with the first quarter 2019 market recovery, assets being more fully valued. And as we look forward, we continue to say we have to be disciplined and look for those opportunities where we can create value going forward. Thank you.","Teri Loxam","Thanks, Ken. We'll move on to the next question.","Operator","It's from Andrew Baum with Citigroup.","Andrew Baum","I have two questions, please. The first one for Roger on V114. I'm simplistically wanted to say, well, your competitor is in market experience that has a great number of stereotype areas, precious for replacement strains. And so I underline the word simplistically. But what is that you believe Merck brings to the table apart from speed to market, which you think is going to make sure that Merck is a major participant both pediatric and adult segments? And then second, in relation to the IPI proposals, and this is addressed to Ken or Frank. What do you think is the ultimate impact of IPI given the ability to negotiate in Europe provides nontransparent discounts but increased lift? Because what is the complexity of -- attacks this pricing the 340B hospitals? How does that all shake out? And do you think it's actually feasible to find a solution that works?","Teri Loxam","Let's start with -- thanks Andrew. Let's start with Roger on V114.","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","So first of all, we're not inexperienced in the pneumococcal disease market. And we have had pneumovax on the market for decades. This is an area that we know extremely well. The pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have been in development for more than 20 years in our laboratories. In fact, I started these programs through my first tour of duty long time ago. And so we've learned a great deal about how to make these vaccines and make them very efficacious. And particular, we've learned about balancing stereotypes in order to provide the broadest possible response. Over time, our program, which includes not just V114, but others as well, will become an important contributor to human health and protection from pneumococcal disease -- invasive pneumococcal disease both in adults and in the pediatric population. So you'll see that evolve over a period of years. It's going to be an important contributor, no doubt.","Ken Frazier","On the international price index situation, so we have, first of all, we submitted our comments. We continue to see that it's not the best approach to dealing with the major problem that we have with patient out-of-pocket cost. I think we are much better approaching. I think it's still early days. I don't know exactly how these kinds of things will be implemented a number of proposals out there, as you know, involving healthcare reform in this country. I would say that we negotiate as much as we can in ex-U.S. markets for the value that we believe that we can bring. And I don't think anyone's opposition that -- by doing that, it's going to improve our ability to negotiate in Europe is really the right thing. Finally, I would say that we've looked at some of the calculations in the report about KEYTRUDA. We're not sure it's actually the right one, but I will tell you that that we continue to focus on the strong data that makes KEYTRUDA a unique product across many indications.","Teri Loxam","Right. Thanks, Ken. We'll move on to the next question.","Operator","It's from Steve Scala with Cowen.","Steve Scala","A couple questions. KEYTRUDA numbers were impressive, but a touch below expectations. Just wondering if there were any one-time factors that impacted the Q1 number? And secondly, on gefapixant, it looks like an effective drug and a safe drug, but I don't believe the Phase II data in OA or OA pain ever was presented neither were other smaller studies that completed sometime ago. So can you elaborate on the data set supporting gefapixant? Thank you.","Teri Loxam","Right. We'll first go to Frank on KEYTRUDA.","Frank Clyburn","Yes. So KEYTRUDA sales, as we've mentioned, were $2.3 billion this quarter of 60% growth year-over-year as exchange. And what I tend to look at is what's happening from an underlying demand perspective. And when you look both versus prior year and sequentially, we're seeing very good continued underlying demand. You will see quarter-to-quarter some fluctuations based on some inventory movements. But overall, I think that we feel very good about how we're seeing the demand ramp. And in particular, we're seeing strong overall demand with regard to our lung cancer indications both in non-squamous claims and squamous cell carcinoma non-small cell lung cancer. In fact, in squamous cell lung cancer, we're seeing our market shares exceed 75% for new patients. So we've become the standard of care in that subset of patients. We also are feeling very excited about the opportunities outside of lung. In the U.S., as Roger mentioned, we have our new indication now based off of KEYNOTE-426 and renal cell carcinoma. We see that as a very significant opportunity for future growth. As well as Roger also highlighted KEYNOTE-48 with a PDUFA date coming up in June, for head and neck cancer, and we have market leadership position in head and neck and later lines of therapy. And we're very excited about KEYNOTE-48. In addition to lapping, I mention is outside the U.S. as we've been saying, we see significant opportunities based on some of the continued rollouts in Japan and China and in Europe. So we're very confident about the KEYTRUDA ramp and feature growth prospects going forward.","Teri Loxam","Thanks, Frank. We will move to Roger.","Teri Loxam","On 7264, it makes sense that the underlying logic of this is the belief based on a variety of preclinical studies that the purinergic receptors, and particularly P2X3, contribute to a neuronal hypersensitivity syndrome. So in the setting of chronic stimulation, there's sort of a feed forward phenomenon. And it contributes to Angelin and other sensitivity syndromes. That's true. We believe, in the first case, in the chronic cough setting where an early stimulus, usually result of inflammation leads to a cough syndrome that does not resolve after eight weeks. And in that setting, as we've demonstrated in Phase II studies, gefapixant has dramatic effects, but as well in some other chronic stimulation syndromes. And we're looking at a number of those, including, as you know, endometriosis, there's a lot of preclinical data that supports the conjecture, but fundamentally, we need better clinical data. And that's what we're going to get.","Teri Loxam","Thanks, Roger. We\u2019ll move like to the next question.","Operator","It's from Geoff Meacham with Barclays.","Geoff Meacham","Frank, I want to ask about lung trends in the U.S. When I look at brand impact data shows first-line share that stable at around 60% in 1Q. So the question is -- are you seeing any moderation and sequential share gains in the U.S.? And where do you think the ceiling share could be in first line lung? And the recent immune design deal, Roger, can you talk me to more broadly about how you can leverage the technology optimally and now that it's in-house? And how do you guys view a new engine and approach and IO more broadly? Thank you.","Teri Loxam","All right. Let's start with Frank.","Frank Clyburn","Geoff, in the U.S. and lung, we're seeing is with regards to share, you have to take out patients that do not have EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. So we see our market shares somewhere in the low 70% share for the non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer segment. So we see very strong penetration, Geoff, within PD-L1 positive patients. The 15 above segment which we're pretty much getting all of those patients in the 145, we have penetrated very significantly. We still have opportunity for growth in the PD-L1 negative patient population. And that's a focus for the commercial team. So I do see that as being the opportunity we'll continue to educate, in particular the community physicians in the U.S. with regards to lung. As I mentioned with regards to the squamous non-small cell lung cancer patient population, we have penetrated that very rapidly over three quarters. Those patients are now being treated with a chemo combo regiment or with monotherapy. So we still see growth for squamous, but clearly we have penetrated that segment very rapidly. And as I mentioned before, we are very excited not only about lung, but all the other indications that I spoke about, and Roger spoke about that are upcoming new launches for us in the U.S.","Teri Loxam","Thanks, Frank. We move to Roger for immune design.","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","So in immune design, there were two principal assets and both of high interest to us. I mean, the first is the molecular defined Adjuvant -- Gilead Adjuvant, which we believe could be beneficial for some of our newer vaccines that require Adjuvant and as well for some of the older vaccines where there's a design to get to less of a fewer -- a smaller number of vaccinations. So we're looking at those things very carefully. The Adjuvant has been in thousands of people. And so we already understand its safety profile quite well. So that's good. And the second thing is the lentivirus vaccine, which is unique from several perspectives. The first is its selective targeting of dendritic cells. The second is its high carrying capacity. And the third is that it has already a substantial amount of clinical exposure demonstrating that it actually stimulates an immune response. That can be applied to neoantigens, but it can also be applied, as they have, to more conventional cancer testis antigens, which are often forgotten about. But I think may -- someday have their day in the sun. So we're looking forward to pursuing those kinds of approaches in the combination with other immune modulators that we've already developed.","Teri Loxam","Thanks, Roger. We'll move on.","Operator","Your next question from Alesandra Chen from Cantor.","Alesandra Chen","So my first question is on China. And do you think that individual drugs have blockbuster potential? And if so, what has to change in the market for this to happen? And then just a follow-up question on V114, if it's approved, what is your go-to-market strategy you might have competition that's in the market now and potentially coming? For example, will you target children first and then go after adults? And then what do you anticipate the ACIP recommendation maybe? Thank you.","Teri Loxam","We'll start with Frank in China.","Frank Clyburn","So with regards to China, we see China is a very significant opportunity for us. As we mentioned, we're seeing very strong growth. And I think, for us, what's important is we have pivoted to innovation in China. And this has always been a part of our overall strategy at Merck. So when you think about the launches right now in China of GARDASIL, of KEYTRUDA, LYNPARZA, LENVIMA, BRIDION, JANUVIA has just now received an NRDL listing. We see significant opportunity for China across a number of products within our innovative portfolio.","Teri Loxam","Right. Thanks. We move over to Mike Nally for V114 outlook.","Mike Nally","When we think about V114 and the opportunity going forward, we think there's a great opportunity in both the pediatric and adult segments. Obviously, we've had a presence in the adult segment as Roger noted within Pneumovax 23 for over 35 years. And as we think about the pediatric segment, clearly, we were touching all pediatric offices basically around the world with our existing vaccines. And so when we look at the opportunity for 114, a lot of it comes down to really understanding the underlying epidemiology and how that's evolving over time. With 114 at a market level, that is different, but also across pediatric and the adult segments, the epidemiology is evolving quickly. So as we think about the ultimate recommendations, it's clear that customers want choice in this market. And with 114, we think we provide a really valid alternative, especially given the fact that we have a very balanced immune response across all 15 stereotypes that we're covering in our vaccine. And what we're seeing today is that there are some stereotypes that are inadequately covered. And we're seeing breakthrough with those from the existing vaccines.","Teri Loxam","Thanks, Mike. We'll move on to the next question, please.","Operator","From David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger","I have a couple questions. And if I repeated anything from -- repeating anything, I apologize. First, with respect to Animal Health, the constant currency growth was 3%, including 1% in livestock. Was the issue in livestock just at the end of the quarter in the U.S.? I think that you know, there were the Midwest floods and other weather issues at the end of the quarter, but I don't know if there were other things that held back the livestock business. And I think that you said that for the full year you expect growth to be greater than the market for Animal Health. What is the market expected to grow in 2019? And then separately, could you just quantify the inventory swings for KEYTRUDA in the first quarter, and for Gardasil, if there were any for Gardasil? Thank you.","Teri Loxam","Thanks. We'll start with Rob on Animal Health.","Rob Davis","As you look at what happened with Animal Health in the first quarter, your numbers are quoting are correct. And really what we were seeing is an impact of the cold weather. It's not necessarily the flooding that went through the middle part of the country. It's really more due to the cold weather patterns, which cause the cattle to stay in the fields longer and not move into the feedlots as quickly. And given that a lot of our products are more focused to the feedlots that mix dynamic of just how it played out affected us in the quarter. So that was part of it. We also then just see some buyout from our distributor partners due to some consolidation going on in the distributor space. So it was really a combination of a change in channel and by down to pull down inventory in the channel and the seasonality impacts that affected the business in the first quarter. As we look to the full year, we do expect to grow above market. And if you look at where the Animal Health market has been over the last couple of years, it's in the roughly, I would say, low to mid-single-digits of growth. So we expect to outpace that, and as before, we layer in the impact of the Antelliq acquisition.","Teri Loxam","Pass over to Frank for KEYTRUDA inventory.","Frank Clyburn","And with regards to KEYTRUDA, as I mentioned, with the brand that is now of this size, you're going to see some slight movements with regards to channel quarter-to-quarter. We're focused, as I mentioned, really on the strong underlying demand that we're seeing in our major indication, as well as the future indications we're prepared to launch.","Teri Loxam","Right. Let's move on to the next question, please.","Operator","It's from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei","Frank, a follow-up if I may on the KEYTRUDA opportunity. In China given that it sounds like it's going to become increasingly important. As I'm sure you know there are Chinese companies that are also working on PD-L1, some of them moving to late stage. And these could compete with you on price. So as you look at China longer term. What's the outlook and from a competitive perspective in immuno oncology. And do you also see a future where these PD1s compete with KEYTRUDA in the U.S. and developed markets? And if I may, could you provide your estimated KEYTRUDA sales by indications in major markets? Thank you.","Frank Clyburn","So on the -- let me start with the estimated sales in the U.S. by indication. We usually provide that out. So 65% of our sales in the U.S. are lung, 10% are approximately melanoma, and neck represents about 5%. And as I mentioned, we're very excited about the opportunity we have upcoming in head and neck, bladder represents about 5%. MSI-High is become a very important indication for us represents about 5%, and all others approximately 10%. Going back to your question on China, we believe oncology is really a data-driven area, Alex, given the severity of the disease. If you look right now what's been accomplished with KEYTRUDA, and we've always said that this wall of data is going to be important. And I think it's going to be very important for us in China as well. When you think about 18 indications across 11 different tumor types, we believe that this continues to differentiate us in the marketplace. China will clearly be a competitive market. But our first mover advantage with the first-line lung cancer approval, we think sets us up very well. And the local players in China do not have an approved indication right now in first-line lung nor have they conducted or achieve the results of a trial like KEYNOTE-189. So our strategy as we've seen in the U.S. right now, there are five additional competitors there. And we believe our clinical execution and commercial execution and our significant amount of data will help us to compete in China as well as any other market around the world.","Teri Loxam","Right. We're going to try to get at least one more, and if we can squeeze it in.","Operator","It\u2019s from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.","Tim Anderson","Just a broader question on China in general, big growth in the quarter, but they've implemented certain policy changes like this four plus even tendering process yet a lot of industry participants think is going to slow down overall Chinese growth for multinationals. What is your outlook for that for Merck's overall book of business? The second question is KEYTRUDA. The triple-negative breast 522 has been trial system update. Are we likely going to see data this year? Is that still possible? And if it is, is that just going to be PCR? Or could we actually see clinical efficacy being reported out? Thank you.","Teri Loxam","All right. So we'll do Frank comment quickly on China; and then Roger on 522.","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","So as I mentioned in China, for us, we have pivoted to more of the innovative products that are driving our growth Gardasil, KEYTRUDA, BRIDION, LYNPARZA and LENVIMA. So we feel that we are very well positioned, and that's going to help us to continue to see growth. We will likely see some impact from some of the older products based on some of the pricing initiatives that are underway in China and some of the provinces. So while we may see some bumping us along the way, we have shifted the majority of our portfolio. Approximately 60% to 70% of it is now is focused on innovative products. So we feel as though that positions us very well not only in the near-term, but for the long-term growth in China.","Teri Loxam","Real quick one on Slide 22.","Frank Clyburn","On Slide 22, yes, of course, the study is supervised by an external data monitoring committee, and they will be evaluating that it's event-driven. My expectation is that it is possible for sure that we could see some review from them. There was a previous interim which led to the study continuing and our expectation is that there will be an opportunity to see additional data. But I can't speak to what those data will be. And as soon as we know, we'll have the opportunity to announce it. That's basically they're in control.","Ken Frazier","So thank you for joining the call today. We are executing well across our business and we remain confident in our performance for the year and the long-term.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Alex Kelly, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Alex Kelly","Thank you, Jackie, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to Merck's Third Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Before I turn the call over to Ken, I want to mention just a couple of housekeeping items. First, there are a number of items in the GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items, and you should note that we've excluded those in our non-GAAP numbers. You can see reconciliation tables for the non-GAAP results in the press release and also in Table 2 of our supplement. We've also provided tables to help you understand the GAAP results, and that is in Table 1; the reconciliation tables, as I mentioned, on Table 2; and Table 3 in our press release provides sales performance for the company, our business units and our products. During the call, we'll be referring primarily to Tables 2 and Table 3.","Finally, I'd like to remind you that some of the statements we make during today's call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The statements are based upon the current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. You can see our SEC filings, including the 2011 10-K. They identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements we make today. You should note that Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement. And importantly, you can find our SEC filings as well as today's press release on our website at merck.com.","This morning, I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman; Adam Schechter, our -- the President of Global Human Health; and Peter Kellogg, our Chief Financial Officer.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Ken Frazier.","Kenneth C. Frazier","Thank you, Alex. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call today. Our results this quarter reflect the continuing momentum of our underlying business. One year ago, we told you that our intention was to maintain 2012 revenues at or near 2011 levels despite the U.S. SINGULAIR patent expiration, and the Merck team is making good on that commitment. In the third quarter, we drove growth of our key products and in our key geographies, which offset the impact of the SINGULAIR patent expiration. With one more quarter to go in 2012, our year-to-date sales are up 2%, excluding the impact of exchange, so we are right on track in executing our strategy.","We strongly believe that our 4-part strategy provides a sound basis for weathering short-term market volatility and driving longer-term shareholder value. As a reminder, our strategy is focused on executing on our core business, which includes our largest markets, core brands, new launched brands and innovative R&D targeted at therapeutic areas with the greatest future patient demand and scientific opportunity; two, expanding geographically to leverage high-growth markets such as Japan and key emerging markets; three, extending into the complementary businesses of Consumer Care and Animal Health; and four, excelling at managing our costs while continuing to invest for future growth. We also believe this strategy will allow us to continue doing what Merck does best: providing innovative products that have demonstrated patient outcomes, provide value to the public and private payers alike and make a real difference for our customers.","In terms of executing our core business, our company-wide sales grew 7% this quarter, excluding SINGULAIR sales globally and foreign exchange. We are pleased with the solid growth across the portfolio, including double-digit growth for a number of our key products.","In terms of expanding geographically, we continue to invest disproportionately in higher-growth markets. In the third quarter, emerging market sales grew 15% excluding exchange. We are also starting to get our joint ventures up and running, such as our partnership with Simcere in China, which began operating this quarter. As always, Adam will provide more specific details about our human health performance by product and by geography.","The third part of our strategy is extending into complementary businesses. Our Animal Health business continues as a strong contributor with 7% growth in the third quarter, excluding exchange. Additionally, we launched ACTIVYL in the U.S., a companion animal health product line for ticks and fleas. Merck Consumer Care grew 10%, excluding exchange. This growth was led by the expansion of our Dr. Scholl's franchise with the launch of the Active Series as well as key skin care brands.","The last element of our strategy is to excel at managing our costs while also investing for growth. Consistent with our efforts to tightly manage costs, we once again reduced the marketing and administrative expenses this quarter. We are committed to driving continuous productivity improvements across the enterprise to help us invest for growth and execute our 4-part strategy on an ongoing basis.","Speaking of productivity, let me now turn to R&D and update you on our progress there. We have multiple filings planned between now and the end of 2013. We are on track for 4 filings in 2012 and even more in 2013.","I'd like to tell you about our 6 major programs, starting with suvorexant. Data presented last month from a safety and tolerability study demonstrated that patients who have been taking suvorexant for 12 months, when switched to placebo, saw their insomnia return, but without clinically meaningful withdrawal symptoms. This is significant, because what happens when patients stop taking their sleep medication is a key concern for both patients and health care professionals. As you know, many insomnia patients have the need for chronic treatment. The safety and efficacy of suvorexant were evaluated through 12 months in one of the longest continuously-dosed placebo-controlled trials of a sleep medication ever conducted.","We also recently presented data from a Phase II trial for odanacatib, a potential first-in-class treatment for osteoporosis, which, as you know, is a disease that continues to have significant global unmet medical need. In that Phase II trial, treatment with odanacatib compared to placebo significantly increased bone mineral density over a 2-year period in women with osteoporosis who previously had 3 or more years of treatment with FOSAMAX. We are on track to submit regulatory applications for odanacatib in the United States and EU in the first half of 2013 and in Japan in the second half of next year.","In addition to presenting these data for odanacatib and suvorexant, we also recently completed all studies for sugammadex requested by the FDA. Sugammadex is known as BRIDION outside the U.S. We are pleased to report that the data support our previously announced plans to resubmit sugammadex to the FDA this year.","Separately, we remain on track for filing vintafolide, a first-in-class innovation for filing in the EU that could have utility in a variety of tumor types, including ovarian and lung cancers; TREDAPTIVE, a novel cholesterol medicine that improves multiple lipid parameters; and V503, a vaccine that expands protection against certain HPV-associated cancers by including additional HPV types.","As a reminder, each of these compounds is consistent with our focus on R&D innovation, meaning a clinically differentiated drug that is either first-in-class or potentially best-in-class.","Beyond our anticipated near-term regulatory filings, our pipeline continues to progress with new programs moving into Phase III. For example, we recently started Phase III trial for MK-3102, our once-weekly DPP-4 inhibitor, and we are on track to start Phase III for MK-3222 for the treatment of psoriasis either later this year or early next year. In addition, we will soon start Phase II trials with our novel base inhibitor, which we are studying for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.","We continue to focus on increasing the productivity of our internal R&D efforts, while at the same time, we are focusing on identifying and accessing external innovation. Just last week, we announced a worldwide licensing agreement with AiCuris for a late-stage antiviral candidate for the treatment and prevention of human cytomegalovirus infection in transplant patients. In addition, in the third quarter, we announced 2 HIV partnerships with Chimerix and Yamasa for early-stage compounds.","In closing, through the first 3 quarters of 2012, we have succeeded in maintaining our sales above the 2011 level on an extra-exchange [ph] basis. We remain confident in our ability to achieve our 2012 sales and EPS goals even with the full impact of the U.S. SINGULAIR patent expiration.","Many of you are expecting 2013 to be a challenging year. Notwithstanding those challenges, we continue to believe we have the right strategy in place to manage for the long term, while at the same time, we are setting high expectations for ourselves next year. Like this year, we intend to advance our pipeline. Like this year, we intend to deliver strong performance from our key in-line brands and businesses around the world. And like this year, we intend to continue managing our costs well to enable us to invest for growth, including in our pipeline and in new product launches.","We know that we need to continue to execute in the short term, and based on our performance so far this year, you should be confident that we know how to execute on both our short-term and long-term plans. We intend to drive long-term growth and shareholder value. We will do that by continuing to focus on performance and innovation just as we have done this year.","I'd like now to turn the call over to Adam Schechter.","Adam H. Schechter","Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to speak with you today and to provide you with an overview of Global Human Health results. GHH's performance is consistent with the strong results that we've had throughout the year. With continued strong growth of our key brands this quarter, we were able to maintain the top line versus our prior year on a constant-currency basis. That's despite the rapid loss of SINGULAIR sales in United States since early August. Excluding the sales of SINGULAIR and the impact of foreign exchange, Global Human Health sales grew 8% in the quarter. Our performance was driven by double-digit growth of key brands such as JANUVIA, JANUMET, GARDASIL, VICTRELIS, ZOSTAVAX and ISENTRESS.","I will provide more details about the key aspects of our performance according to our strategy, and I'll begin with our execution on our core business, which includes our largest markets, our core brands and our launched brands.","Let me start with the United States, where sales were adversely affected by the SINGULAIR patent expiry. If you exclude the sales of SINGULAIR, our portfolio had strong growth of 12%. Driving this performance are innovative products with double-digit growth and long exclusivity, like JANUVIA, JANUMET, ISENTRESS, GARDASIL, ZOSTAVAX and VICTRELIS.","Moving to our business in Europe and Canada. Overall third quarter sales in Europe and Canada declined 14% or 3% excluding exchange. We continue to have good volume growth and a strong evolution index, but the business is affected by the macroeconomic issues facing our industry. Volume growth from brands such as JANUVIA and JANUMET, ISENTRESS, SIMPONI and VICTRELIS only partially offset price decreases, other austerity measures and the generic erosion of CLARINEX.","Moving on to several core brands. I'll start with the JANUVIA and JANUMET franchise, which continued to perform very well this quarter with sales of $1.4 billion and 19% growth excluding exchange. The growth of JANUVIA is broad-based, and we continue to see volume growth in every region of the world. JANUVIA and JANUMET combined grew 16% in United States and 23% excluding exchange outside the United States. So there was nice growth in all regions. Sequentially, sales outside the United States were slightly lower this quarter, primarily due to the timing of supply sales to a co-marketing partner in Japan. It's important to remember that we only report these supply sales to Ono in the second and fourth quarter. So there were no supply sales in the third quarter versus the $100 million that we reported in the second quarter.","Despite multiple competitors in the market, the JANUVIA family retained about a 73% share of the global DPP-4 market, and it continues to have opportunities to grow. There continues to be opportunity to gain share from the generic sulfonylurea class, which still represents about 37% of patient days of therapy.","Moving to SINGULAIR. SINGULAIR sales declined by $700 million, driven by the patent expiry in the United States. Within 1 month of the expiry, we saw a rapid 90% loss in prescription volume. We've also begun to see generic versions in other markets, and we'll lose market exclusivity in the major European markets in February of 2013.","ISENTRESS continues to be a strong core brand for Merck with 23% growth excluding exchange. Earlier this month, we celebrated a significant milestone with 5 years on the market. During that time, ISENTRESS has been a valuable treatment option to physicians and to patients in the fight against HIV. New competition is still early in its launch, and we'll provide updates in the future. ISENTRESS maintains a preferred position in U.S. treatment guidelines, which is a testament to the efficacy, to the tolerability and to the critical longevity of ISENTRESS.","In our cholesterol franchise, ZETIA\/VYTORIN global sales grew 3% excluding exchange. ZETIA grew 9% globally, which was partially offset by a decline in VYTORIN sales in the United States.","Moving to immunology. Our combined immunology business with REMICADE and SIMPONI grew 4% in the quarter excluding the impact of exchange. We continue to be a leader in immunology, with a strong market share for REMICADE. In addition, SIMPONI remains an important launch brand, with $86 million of sales in the quarter. We recently launched SIMPONI in France, and we've reintroduced its convenient auto-injector in Germany. We continue to be optimistic about SIMPONI's future growth potential competing with other subcu anti-TNFs.","Moving on to vaccines. Vaccines had another strong quarter of double-digit growth. GARDASIL maintained its strong performance with 31% growth over the prior year. The growth is due to continued uptake of the male indication in United States and the timing of government purchases in Canada and Mexico this quarter. Sales of ZOSTAVAX were $202 million, our highest quarter sale since launch. We are seeing a very positive response to our promotional efforts and good uptake by patients presenting during the flu season. We anticipate there will be a cyclical nature to this business. We believe the flu season, which straddles the third and the fourth quarters, represents the largest opportunity. We continue to anticipate broader x U.S. launches beginning next year.","Moving to launch brands. We continue to drive strong launches, including GARDASIL in Japan and VICTRELIS around the world. Our launch products contributed more than $200 million in revenue this quarter. Global sales of VICTRELIS reached $149 million in the quarter. In the United States, we continued to have strong share, ending the quarter with over a 40% TRx share. Internationally, VICTRELIS has well over a 50% share of patient days of therapy across all markets where both protease inhibitors are available. There has been rapid uptake, and we have a strong share of markets like France and Germany and Canada.","While our near-term focus is on driving the growth of VICTRELIS, we're also focusing on the future. In a couple of weeks, we'll be presenting new Phase IIb data at AASLD for MK-5172, our potent protease inhibitor.","Now I'd like to highlight how we're executing against our strategy of expanding geographically into key high-growth markets. Let's begin with the emerging markets. Emerging market sales reached $1.9 billion, up 7% or 15% excluding exchange. Growth in emerging markets was broad-based across our portfolio. In key emerging markets, our growth is outpacing overall market growth. Although there is pricing pressure in certain emerging markets, we are maximizing the growth of our core brands, we are launching new brands, and in the future, we'll begin to realize the benefits of the joint ventures that we've been forming in several of these markets.","China continues to be an important growth driver with 18% growth excluding exchange. The growth was driven by our Hospital and Specialty products as well as contributions from our diversified brands and our core brands, which we expect to continue to grow in China.","Moving to Japan. Growth in Japan was 1% this quarter. Strong growth of JANUVIA, ZETIA and our hospital products was tempered by a few factors: first, a tough comparison last year due to wholesaler stocking for the GARDASIL launch; second, generic competition for COZAAR\/HYZAAR and FOSAMAX; and third, the biennial price cuts earlier this year. Importantly, looking ahead, we believe we have opportunity for strong growth in Japan.","So in summary, Global Human Health continued to drive strong performance from its diverse portfolio. We were able to maintain the top line this quarter on a constant-currency basis, overcoming the effects of the SINGULAIR patent expiry. We believe our business momentum positions us well to maintain the top line this year despite the loss of SINGULAIR exclusivity in the United States for 5 months and austerity measures around the world.","Our base is strong, our base is diverse and our base continues to grow.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to my colleague, Peter Kellogg.","Peter N. Kellogg","Thank you, Adam, and good morning. In the third quarter, we are continuing to execute against our strategy and we are on track to achieve the financial targets we laid out earlier this year. In the third quarter, we maintained our revenue on a constant-currency basis despite facing the SINGULAIR impacts that Ken and Adam talked about. We also reduced our expenses, resulting in bottom-line growth. In addition, we generated new clinical data and advanced key R&D programs. Our results demonstrate that we have built a strong foundation and momentum in our key brands and across our businesses.","This morning, I will briefly talk about our performance in the third quarter, and I will discuss our outlook.","This quarter, we faced a pretty steep climb. Revenue headwinds of $1.2 billion came from 2 major items: first, U.S. SINGULAIR was a $700 million headwind; and second, foreign exchange was a $550 million headwind. As Ken mentioned, this quarter, the entire $700 million impact of the SINGULAIR patent expiration was replaced by strong global sales across the rest of our business. The Merck team delivered exactly what we said we would do at the beginning of the year: deliver revenue near the 2011 level on a constant-currency basis. We're proud of that accomplishment and also that we delivered EPS growth this quarter.","So let me start with the operating results. My remarks will focus on our non-GAAP financials, which exclude acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. On this basis, we earned $0.95 this quarter, 1% higher than the prior year due to the unfavorable impacts of the U.S. SINGULAIR patent expiration and foreign exchange.","Now let me turn to our expenses in the third quarter. Our non-GAAP gross margin declined sequentially by 200 basis points to 75.2%, due primarily to the impact of SINGULAIR. In fact, during the third quarter, the U.S. SINGULAIR impact was about 140 basis points unfavorable, and keep in mind that this is only a 2-month impact.","Regarding our year-over-year improvement in marketing and administrative expenses, almost 1\/2 of the benefit was due to foreign exchange. The remainder was divided equally between reductions in direct selling expenses, promotion spending and other items.","Meanwhile, research and development expenses were pretty much flat year-over-year.","Moving to tax. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 20.3% in the third quarter. This is lower than the tax rate in the first 6 months and lower than our prior guidance. Two discrete items drove this lower rate: the first was the favorable impact of a settlement with a foreign tax authority; and second related to the realization of foreign tax benefits. Absent these discrete items, the non-GAAP tax rate would have been approximately 25%. These items are not expected to have an impact on the fourth quarter. We continue to expect our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 25%.","Now let me provide some additional commentary on our 2012 outlook. We have narrowed our EPS guidance and now expect our non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $3.78 to $3.82. This guidance reflects what we have consistently communicated about how 2012 would evolve, a strong operating performance in the first 9 months and a fourth quarter that reflects the full impact of the U.S. SINGULAIR patent expiration. Accordingly, we continue to expect the fourth quarter to be the lowest quarter of the year. In addition, our performance in the fourth quarter will also be tempered by higher R&D spending, continued austerity measures and foreign exchange rates that remain below prior year rates. Despite these pressures and consistent with our prior guidance, we expect that the underlying operating momentum of Merck's businesses will enable us to maintain our full year 2012 revenues at or near 2011 levels on a constant-currency basis.","On R&D expenses, our pipeline programs, which are continuing to progress nicely, and new business development deals have resulted in our year-to-date R&D expenses being about $100 million above the first 9 months of 2011. In the fourth quarter, we also expect to incur approximately $150 million in upfront payments due to the recently signed deals, including the AiCuris deal. These upfront payments will be included in both GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expenses in the fourth quarter. As a result of the $100 million increase year-to-date and the pending upfront payments of $150 million, we expect our non-GAAP R&D expenses to be higher than the 2011 level on a full year basis.","So to summarize our 2012 guidance. Our operations are strong, and our non-GAAP EPS guidance is now between $3.78 and $3.82. We also expect GAAP EPS to be between $2.08 and $2.24.","So let's look at what our third quarter results can tell us about 2013. First off, we are seeing a significant change in our product mix away from SINGULAIR and towards newer growth drivers, such as JANUVIA, JANUMET and our vaccines, among other products, as well as Animal Health and Consumer Health and the fast-growth markets like the emerging markets in Japan. This is expected to continue in 2013. What may be harder to appreciate is the impact of this mix shift on our gross margin. We are replacing a very high gross margin product with a basket of products that have a somewhat lower gross margin. As a result of this mix shift, our 2013 gross margin is expected to be lower than in 2012.  We expect to provide our 2013 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call.","In summary, we delivered a very good quarter with strong core operating performance offsetting the impact of the U.S. SINGULAIR patent expiration. We drove growth of key products, and we increased sales in fast growth markets while maintaining a strong financial discipline. In addition, we continue to bring in new R&D programs and advance our internal R&D pipeline.","Given the performance of our underlying businesses this quarter, we are indeed facing our current challenges head-on and from a position of strength. We are confident that our strategy is working, and we are right on track to deliver short-term performance and long-term growth.","Thank you. I'll turn the call back over to Alex.","Alex Kelly","Okay, thanks, Peter. And now we'd like to open up the call to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] So Jackie, can you please start the Q&A, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  Your first question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","About this MK-3222, we haven't heard much about it, what's the key to the product and how it will compete with the others.  And then SINGULAIR o U.S. seemed to be a little weak. How much of that was currency, or is there something else going on? Obviously, we know what's going to happen next year.","Alex Kelly","Great. Thanks, Marc. Why don't we start with the SINGULAIR x U.S. number, and then we'll come back to the IL-23.","Adam H. Schechter","Yes. So Marc, if you look at SINGULAIR outside of the U.S., we've already started to see some patent expiries in countries like Mexico, Canada and Poland, so you really are starting to see some impact from the SINGULAIR patent expiries already. In addition to that, we had a slightly slower AR season in Japan. In general, in markets such as the emerging markets in Japan where we don't have the patent expiries, we believe that we continue to see good growth and we expect to see good growth over time.","Kenneth C. Frazier","Okay. And also on MK-3222, we expect to begin Phase III trials in psoriasis either late this year or early next year. This is a drug that we have great -- a great deal of excitement about. We think that this is a disease where there continues to be a great deal of unmet medical need going forward. We had a Phase II program that -- based on the study that we had there, we feel that there's value for moderate to severe chronic psoriasis patients, and so we look forward to learning more about this drug as we move forward. And the anti-IL 23 psoriasis program, which is a monoclonal antibody, is one that we look forward to.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","The first -- it seems like this earnings season, we've had kind of mixed data points on U.S. primary care pricing as we kind of think out to 2013 from some of your competitors. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about managed care access in pricing for the JANUVIA franchise as well as the ZETIA\/VYTORIN franchises as we look out to kind of 2013? Are you seeing any incremental pressure there? And second, if I just think about where Merck is right now, we're getting through SINGULAIR, we've had some positive updates in your pipeline, seems like you only have really one more major expiration with cholesterol out in 2016 or 2017. It seems like a time when Merck could start getting more aggressive with its capital deployment. I guess, how are you thinking about use of cash at this point, particularly business development relative to things like further dividend increases?","Alex Kelly","Okay. Thanks, Chris. Let's start with your questions about pricing and managed care access, and we'll come back to capital.","Adam H. Schechter","Chris, thanks for your question. This is Adam. And we continue to do well with our managed care access for JANUVIA and, for that matter, for ZETIA and VYTORIN. With JANUVIA, we have 85% to 90% unrestricted access. And it's important to note that many patients use metformin even prior to JANUVIA or JANUMET. So therefore, they're using a Tier 1 product before they move to our unrestricted access in Tier 2 or Tier 3. Of course, there continues to be pressure, but I think with a profile that we have with JANUVIA, with the utilization and where it's utilized, we expect to continue to have very good formulary acceptance as we move forward into 2013. If you look at VYTORIN and ZETIA, we have 90% of patients that have commercial and Medicare Part D access to at least one of the brands. And what we think it's important is that they have the ability to use dual inhibition through either adding ZETIA or utilizing VYTORIN. So 90% access, we believe, for either one of the 2 being in second tier or third year with no prior off [ph] is a good place to be. And if you look at 2012 and 2013, we don't anticipate any significant changes for VYTORIN or ZETIA.","Alex Kelly","Okay. Ken?","Kenneth C. Frazier","Chris, thanks for your question on capital deployment. I think, first of all, we do have a very strong balance sheet and we have the ability to do deals when we see them. Our goal is to always look for the best external R&D opportunities that are out there, but we also want to access them at a price at which we can create value for our shareholders. And from our standpoint, a deal like the one we just did with AiCuris for late-stage antiviral candidate is the kind of thing that we want to continue to do. We will look for opportunities, but we want to temper the aggressiveness with being really smart in how we invest our cash for growth. The other obligation we have, obviously, is to continue to return cash to investors in a way that is actually appropriate to where we are. So I would say the first objective is to continue to do smart deals where they can add value to the long term, and the second one is return cash to shareholders.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.","Charles Anthony Butler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Adam, a question around GARDASIL. This is, I believe, at least the second quarter you've pointed out boys as being somewhat of a driver. Can you actually discuss this little bit further?  What kind of percentage of revenue is actually coming from the male population versus females? And then the second question is around emerging markets, which, I think, are flat sequentially at $1.9 billion. Is that an expectation that we should have at least through Q4? Is there a reason to assume that, that can actually accelerate sequentially from this particular level based upon new products?","Adam H. Schechter","Tony, thanks very much for the questions. And let me give you some context on GARDASIL then I'll get specific to males. So we had 31% growth. If you look at the U.S. sales, we had 25% year-over-year growth, and a lot of that, we believe, is due to continued uptake by the male indication. Outside the U.S., we had about 46% growth, and that was due to the timing, in some part, of the public sector sales in Canada, Mexico and Colombia. If you look at our share globally, we've got over an 80% share, and in the U.S., we have greater than 95% share. If you look at the males, we are seeing nice uptake by males, and we have private sector data -- so we don't have data for everything, but in the private sector data, it suggests that about 55% of our first doses are being administered in males. That's now, therefore, exceeding the number of first doses for females for the first time. We think that there's still good opportunity to grow. If you look at the male indication, the ramp-up in sales has been slower than what we saw initially with a ramp-up for females. So we don't expect to see significant declines in that population. If you look at the emerging markets, I look year-over-year. I think you have to be careful looking at sequential trends, particularly because of tenders and government purchases and so forth. So as I said before, there tends to be lumpiness as you go through the quarters in the emerging markets because of the way in which the governments and the tenders move forward. I think that we have the potential for good growth in emerging markets. We're very pleased having 15% growth x ForEx versus the prior year, and I think we have good momentum, and we expect to keep that momentum.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to ask some questions about the IMPROVE-IT press release that you had issued, I think it was late March, early April. That release was written a little bit differently than the prior releases. I was just hoping since it's been 6 months since the DSMB told you that they were adding another look, I was wondering, number one, is that look designed in conjunction with Merck? And second, what additional details have you learned during the past 6 months that you can share with us?","Kenneth C. Frazier","Well, I would have to say, David, there's really nothing new to report. What we know is that there will be an additional review of 9 months of adjudicated data, and that's been scheduled for March 2013. We are confident in the study, and we continue to look forward to a good outcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein.","Tim Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Question on biosimilars. From what I understand, REMICADE does not have patent protection in a reasonable number of smaller European markets. In these markets, can you talk about when you think biosimilars might arrive? And then also, a number of years ago, Merck made quite a splash about its presence in biosimilars and what that would be going forward, but the company seems to have kind of gone quiet in this area for a while. And I know that earlier this year, you lost your head of biosimilars. I'm wondering if you can update us on your efforts there. And then on odanacatib, it's hard to know what to make of the product, because, obviously, we only have top line results. One of the things you described previously was some sort of potential safety issue. Can you please give us some idea of what this is?","Adam H. Schechter","So, why don't I start with REMICADE, Tim? So first of all, I think it's unclear how Celltrion's biosimilar will impact REMICADE. We have REMICADE patent protected in the major EU countries, where the vast majority of sales aren't till late 2014. We filed for pediatric market exclusivity in the EU based upon the new pediatric indications, and we're hoping that they may bring exclusivity to 2015. But when you think about biosimilars, we expect the impact in the first few years in any of these countries to be relatively slow for the following reasons: these will be the first monoclonal antibody biosimilars approved in EU. In general, we don't believe that they're going to take patients off of their current therapy. We think that the product will be limited to new patients, they won't switch if patients are controlled. And then you're going to need to have mechanisms for approval for reimbursement, for physician familiarity, because it's not going to be necessarily therapeutically substitutable. So it's going to take a lot of support and promotion to be successful in the marketplace. So we continue to watch it and monitor it well. But at this point, we feel confident that we'll continue to be successful with REMICADE and SIMPONI.","Kenneth C. Frazier","And Tim, with respect to your general question about MBV, I would say that we have a number of biosimilar molecules in earlier -- early development. They include Rituxan and Enbrel, which we're prioritizing. We're also prioritizing other candidates across our portfolio, both the biosimilars as well as the novel biologics, like we talked about IL-23 a little while ago. So what we are trying to do is to continually -- continue to look at our investments to select the molecules that have the highest potential relative to development costs, the ones where we think we have the highest probability of technical success and, of course, the molecules where we also think we have the highest probability of being one of the early first movers at the time of patent expiry. Turning to odanacatib, I can only say that there's nothing new to report at this time. We're waiting for the trial to close out, and we will have more data for that to present in 2013.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe I can ask a question just, I think, you have -- I think you have an announced meeting [ph] that you're planning on holding on the 1Q. I was wondering maybe if you could help us understand expectations for that meeting. I think most importantly on investor's mind is, is there -- are there plans in the company to perhaps reinstitute longer-term financial targets? And then just to build on ZOSTAVAX, the ZOSTAVAX number was, I thought, pretty impressive. And the fact that you're launching x U.S. seems to communicate that you think your supply issues are behind you. Can you speak to the state of the supply issues and also maybe give us an update on where penetration is in that market overall so we can get an idea of where this could go with time?","Kenneth C. Frazier","So let me start with the long-term guidance question and just say that at this time, there's no intention to reinstate long-term guidance.","Adam H. Schechter","And let me, Mark, give you some context on ZOSTAVAX x U.S. Right now, the majority of sales are in the United States. We're pleased with the launch in United States and Canada, but Canada only represents about $10 million of the ZOSTAVAX sales for the quarter. But we want to make sure we continue to invest in markets outside the U.S. Our top priority is to ensure uninterrupted supply where we launch, and we continue to build the inventory to support the anticipated demand. So when we launch into a country, we want to make sure that we will have enough supply to continue to be able to supply that country. We're planning additional launches in certain x U.S. markets beginning in 2013, and we'll let you know about those as we get closer. In terms of Durham, we're in the final stage of review and approval process, and we continue to expect approval in early 2013. But for the U.S. market and Canada right now, we're comfortable that we have the supply for those markets, and we'll keep you informed as we move forward outside the U.S.","Alex Kelly","Mark, it's Alex. In terms of the Analyst Meeting, we've not set it on a date yet, but we are looking at Q2 as probably target time line for the next Analyst Meeting. And as in the past, I would expect that R&D programs would figure very prominently in the discussions that we would have there as well as a review of the overall business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Do you expect the top line data -- top line results for HERS to thrive? And then secondly, Peter, you gave us a little bit of color around what to expect for gross margins in 2013. Was wondering if you could provide us a little bit of color around the pushes and the pulls to revenues in 23 -- 2013. Specifically, do you expect that 2013 could be flat, like 2012 versus 2011? Just remind us, please, what the -- aside from SINGULAIR going generic February 2013 if there's anything else that we should be aware of, and offsetting that, what are the product introductions?","Alex Kelly","Ken, why don't you start with TREDAPTIVE?","Kenneth C. Frazier","So Jami, thanks for the questions. We expect the trial to complete this year, and we expect to present the data sometime in 2013.","Peter N. Kellogg","So Jami, thanks for the question on the top line in the PGM. So the PGM, I did discuss. On the top line, I think the factors to consider as headwinds perhaps is that in addition to SINGULAIR having just gone off patent in the U.S. in August, in the first quarter of 2013, it'll go off in a number of the major markets in Europe. Additionally, MAXALT will go off-patent, I think, at the end of this year, and so that's just another consideration, not, obviously, at all as meaningful as SINGULAIR, but just another point to note. The flip, though, the question that you had was where will the revenue come from that will offset that or how close will we come, obviously, we'll be giving guidance for 2013 on the first quarter call, but we aren't really in a position to provide that today. But clearly, you can see in the third quarter results the kind of drivers we have around the world and across a broad range of products, quite frankly. I think that's pretty clear, and you've asked some questions already today relative to the performance of GARDASIL, of ZOSTAVAX and so forth. And we're continuing to focus on those products. I think Adam is obviously -- Adam and his team are obviously going to be getting ready to launch a lot of the products we talked about coming through filing in the pipeline as we go through '13 as well, so that will be -- may not be as much of a revenue driver, but are something they're getting us ready for. So while we are managing '13 really well to make sure we drive the short-term performance, as Ken likes to say, we're also going to be making sure that we're teeing up the business really well so that as we come through '13, we're going to be able to take a great advantage of the launches coming out of the pipeline.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen.","Steve Scala - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And I know 2013 guidance comes in 2013, but, Ken, everything you've said about 2013 suggests top and bottom line growth, and I'm just wondering if that's the message that we should take home. And secondly, assuming that Phase II is positive, what is the earliest you could move your BACE inhibitor into Phase III, and how soon after that can we see data? This looks like a phenomenal drug, and I'm just wondering when we could look forward to its late-phase development.","Kenneth C. Frazier","Thanks for the question, Steve. What I said thus far really relates to what we anticipated doing in 2012, and we've done what we've said, essentially that we wanted to maintain the top line at or above -- at or about the 2011 levels, and we've done that in 2012. We have not given any guidance yet for 2013 for revenue or anything else. We will do that on our fourth quarter call. We are also excited about BACE. Alzheimer's disease, first of all, is a priority area for Merck, and it's something important for us. We're planning to begin Phase II trials later this year, and we'll be able to provide more details at that time about what the trial will involve. And I just have to say stay tuned, but we share your excitement about this particular compound and the opportunity that we have in terms of Alzheimer's disease.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Catherine Arnold with Credit Suisse.","Catherine J. Arnold - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I have 2 questions. First of all, I wondered if you could comment on anacetrapib's Phase II extension study. It must be wrapping up soon, and I wondered if you can confirm that and talk about if you'll disclose these results and how we might see them. And then, secondly, I wanted to ask about the Animal Health business, and I thought the performance was a little bit light beyond FX, and I wondered if you could talk about some of the dynamics and the bigger sub-segments of that business.","Kenneth C. Frazier","On Animal Health, as we said before, our third quarter sales were 7% x exchange. Year-to-date, we're up about 10% x exchange. So we thought we saw, if you put aside currency, pretty strong quarterly performance of our cattle, our poultry and our companion animal and our fish businesses. So we are pretty excited about that. With respect to the questions about the DEFINE Extension Study, we are moving forward with our program. We don't anticipate filing on the basis of that data. The filing will be based on the data from the REVEAL Study, which is ongoing, which, you will remember, is a 30,000-patient study. And the good news for us is we are more than 2\/3 enrolled on the REVEAL Study. So we continue to move forward with that program, and we remain very committed to that development program for both anacetrapib as well as TREDAPTIVE.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Gilbert with Merrill Lynch.","Gregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Has your time line for HPS2-THRIVE slipped at all? And is it fair to say, Ken, that the outcome could have implications for your BD strategy and priorities? My second question is for Adam. What does your market research tell you about a once-weekly JANUVIA? Obviously, once weekly played well in osteoporosis. I'm curious how you see it playing out in a category where patients may be on several therapies that can't be put into a once-weekly format?","Adam H. Schechter","So Greg, let me start with the once-weekly first. And as you think about the profile of the DPP-4s, and in particular, drugs like JANUVIA, you can see that with the efficacy profile, the safety profile and the uptake of those products that there's a lot of need for new diabetes products in the marketplace. As we start to think about where the current drugs are positioned, in general, they're positioned after metformin in patients that are already being treated. In addition to that, still 37% of patients are taking sulfonylureas. As we think about the once-weekly DPP-4s, a question that, I think, will come to fruition is will physicians utilize a once-weekly product prior to metformin? This is a reason, if you have a younger, active, more healthy patient with diabetes, wouldn't you want to use a once-weekly product in that patient?  And therefore, I think it could represent additional opportunity above and beyond where JANUVIA is positioned today. And our market research is starting to demonstrate that there is a high likelihood that physicians will consider a once-weekly product for earlier treatment than where the current DPP-4s are utilized.","Kenneth C. Frazier","On TREDAPTIVE, I would say there hasn't been any slippages that relates to the timing of the trial. We're waiting for the trial to conclude. We expect it to conclude by the end of 2012. We expect to be able to present the data sometime in 2013. Our normal preference is to wait for presentation at clinical conferences. And as it relates to business development, I wouldn't say that, that would be a driver for our business, that development activity. We try to be proactive in business development across the therapeutic areas where we want to be focused, and so we'll continue to do that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Well, I'll be the first to congratulate you on the quarter. I think it's pretty impressive considering the headwinds you're facing. REMICADE seemed to be a little lighter than we expected. I was wondering if you can provide some comments on that. And then finally, with regards to your Alzheimer's drug, are you planning to evaluate that earlier in earlier-stage patients, such as prodromal patients, considering what we've seen from some of the agents that are a little bit ahead of you?","Alex Kelly","Adam, do you want to start?","Adam H. Schechter","So with regard to REMICADE, we had -- and you look at REMICADE and SIMPONI together, we had about 4% growth versus prior year. REMICADE sales were about $500 million in the third quarter, and it was a decline x FX of just over 10%. When you think about the austerity measures and the fact that we're competing primarily in major European markets, they're looking at the anti-TNF class as a way to reduce costs. So we continue to have a very good share of REMICADE, but there's been some real pricing pressure that we faced in Europe on that product. SIMPONI represents a growth opportunity, where with SIMPONI, we have 80 -- over $89 million of sales for the quarter. We are launching in France, which is a large market for this class. We're competing with the other anti-TNFs in the subcutaneous marketplace.  And therefore, I think that we'll be able to show growth as we move forward utilizing SIMPONI with France, but also the reintroduction of the auto-injector in Germany for that product.","Kenneth C. Frazier","And with respect to our BACE program, as I said before, we're planning to begin Phase II trials later this year and we'll be able to provide more details at the time the trial begins. But I will reiterate again, we're excited about this program. Alzheimer's disease is a priority area for the company, and the amyloid hypothesis remains a leading approach for disease modification for Alzheimer's disease. MK-8931, it appears, it can reduce cerebrospinal fluid, A beta peptides by greater than 90% in healthy volunteers without dose-limiting side effects. And so we will continue to study this drug as we move forward, and we have a tremendous opportunity to design clinical programs that allow us to exploit it across a variety of patients.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seamus Fernandez with Leerink Swann.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","So as you develop odanacatib, can you just give us a sense of what the key attributes were that you found would best correlate to long-term success, given the availability of generic bisphosphonates and other injectable products? And then second, we now have a pretty good sense of the tolerability of CORDAPTIVE. We're seeing some tolerability issues there and some dropout, which obviously is the case for niacin.  If CORDAPTIVE were to show that its benefits or effects were largely key to LDL reduction only, how would the -- how would you see this franchise evolving going forward, given the availability of ZETIA and its effects on LDL?","Alex Kelly","So Ken, you want to start with odanacatib?","Kenneth C. Frazier","Yes. So first of all, we think there's a tremendous opportunity for another once-weekly oral regimen. It has no special requirements in terms of how people take it or use it. There's a tremendous market need, there are 200 million women worldwide and only 20% of them are treatment -- treated. Remember, it was a $10 billion market prior to generic FOSAMAX, and we see bisphosphonate use declining. And on top of that, approximately 25% of people can't tolerate bisphosphonates anyway. So now you have a unique mechanism. It also shows positive data trends beyond FOSAMAX, and we're looking forward to the publication of our fracture outcome trial, because we think this is a product that could have tremendous usefulness in the marketplace.","Adam H. Schechter","So with regard to TREDAPTIVE, there's still a substantial residual CV risk in the marketplace of about 65%, and this is -- remains a very large market. One share point in the U.S. is still about $400 million. And if you just look at niacin alone, it's about $1 billion despite the tolerability profile of niacin. We have data that demonstrates less flushing with TREDAPTIVE than with niacin, and we've got some good data looking at the flushing and the incidence of flushing. If you look at the HPS2-THRIVE trial, it's well powered to detect a 15% improvement in the time to first cardiovascular event. We believe that a 20% reduction in LDL cholesterol and other lipid benefits, such as an 18% increase in HDL cholesterol, which is what we've seen in prior trials, will support the science behind TREDAPTIVE. And we believe that if you get a positive outcomes trial, which is what we expect for HPS2-THRIVE, then we could have a real place in the market to help reduce the residual risk that currently exists at 65%.","Kenneth C. Frazier","And niacin is a pretty strong market of about $1 billion despite all the tolerability issues.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Michael Tong with Wells Fargo Securities.","Michael Kallai Tong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Two of them. One, in terms of hepatitis C, and clearly the market and the science is moving pretty quickly to, perhaps, all-oral and 1-pill regimen. So where does Merck stand in the long term in that market, and how do you expect to get there? And then secondly, with respect to R&D expenses, as you look out several years, do you reach a point where you get to a certain critical mass and your R&D in absolute dollar terms stayed relatively constant because adding more doesn't necessarily give you more productivity?","Adam H. Schechter","I'll take the HCV question, Michael. So in the short term, obviously, we're looking to maximize the VICTRELIS opportunity. We're also aggressively pursuing new, more convenient interferon-free therapies, and we're focusing on K-5172, either in combination with internal candidates like 8742, which is our NS5A in Phase I, there'll be more data presented at AASLD on our NS5A, or a partnership with others.  And our goal is to develop an all-oral regimen that maximizes sBR, that shortens duration of treatment and minimizes side effects. If you look at clinicaltrials.gov you can see that there's a study that's planned to evaluate 12- and 24-week regimens of MK-5172 in combination with ribavirin, and that's in treatment-na\u00efve patients with genotype 1 infection and also an IL-28 CC genotype. And we think that MK-5172 could have an unprecedented profile and be the partner of protease inhibitor of choice for all-oral combination regimens, and that's what we hope. You'll see that there's new Phase IIb data for MK-5172 with peg\/riba at AASLD in just a few weeks as well.","Alex Kelly","Peter?","Peter N. Kellogg","So on the question on R&D, first of all, I'd just start by saying we really haven't given long-term R&D guidance. I just want to make sure that's clear. But in terms of the question of how we think about it, I'm not sure we really feel that there's an issue of critical mass. I don't think there's a scale or size that fits one company or another. Much more importantly to us is looking at the individual programs and really understanding the economics of those programs in driving a stiff prioritization process that assures very, very good return on investment and creation of value in that pipeline. And I think you've heard our -- Peter Kim and his team, partnered with Adam's team, has been very rigorous since the last several years actually in really going through that, and we continue to do that on a regular basis. And it has, I believe, now yielded a pipeline that is creating tremendous value and has a lot of potential for the company. So we're actually very excited to see how that will progress and continue to unfold. I think in terms of picking a size for the future of R&D, I think it really does come down to what are the opportunities we see and what are the opportunities that we have, both in terms of innovative pipeline and supporting the markets around the world. We have made a lot of effort in our R&D structure to make it a bit more virtual and partnered as we work with collaborators, which on the one hand, in a sense, variable-izes our cost so that the activity level goes down, we actually do see savings. But conversely, it really does actually open up more capacity. So if we see the right programs to really execute well that create a great return on investment, we would -- we should really be going after them. Now, that doesn't automatically mean we plan to grow or not grow. It just really means what's the portfolio as it goes through a strong prioritization effort, what do we choose to pursue?  So I think it's more really what are the opportunities, and we are now positioned, I think, well-set-up to pursue them properly.","Kenneth C. Frazier","Okay. So let me say a few things in closing. First of all, I want to say that I believe we should target a very strong operational performance in the third quarter, but more importantly, looking forward, our strategy is right on track. We said that we would continue advancing our pipeline, and that's exactly what we're doing on a number of important fronts. We said we would maintain sales at or near the 2011 levels, and we were able to do that. The important thing is that our underlying portfolio, including products like JANUVIA, JANUMET, ISENTRESS, GARDASIL, ZOSTAVAX and SIMPONI, is continuing to grow very strongly. We continue to grow strongly in the emerging markets, perhaps the strongest growth across the entire industry in the emerging markets. We continue to reduce costs in targeted ways so that we can continue to invest in our future growth, including the pipeline. So in the long run, what I think we are doing is we're setting ourselves up to create shareholder value in the long term, and we're very excited by the period of time we're going into, a period of time where we will be bringing new products to the market. So thank you very much, and I look forward to speaking to you soon.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"13983":["Merck & Co Inc.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Teri Loxam, SVP, Investor Relations and Global Communications. Please go ahead.","Teri Loxam","Thank you, Darla, and good morning. Welcome to Merck's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Conference Call. Today I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Labs, who will each have prepared remarks. In addition, I\u2019m joined by Mike Nally, our new Chief Marketing Officer and Frank Clyburn, our new Chief Commercial Officer who will both be available for the Q&A portion of the call.","Before I turn the call over to Ken, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results, such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation of these in our press release. We have also provided a table in our press release to help you understand the sales in the quarter for the business units and products.","I would like to remind you that some of the statements that we make during today's call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor Provision of the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.","If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.

You can see our SEC filing as well as today's earnings release on merck.com.","Finally, similar to last quarter, we have posted a presentation to the investor section of Merck.com, which highlights some of our financials from the quarter and the year. ","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken.","Ken Frazier","Thank you, Teri. Good morning and thank you all for joining the call. In 2018, Merck distinguished itself through its strong performance across its businesses, perhaps most significantly, our full year results demonstrate that our strategy to be the premier research intensive biopharmaceutical company is working. The investments we've made in R&D over the past several years and our commercial execution have culminated in the highest top and bottom line growth the company has seen in years and we expect our momentum to carry over into 2019. At its core, Merck is a science driven organization, motivated by a quest to improve human and animal health. We've spent the last several years, reinvigorating our labs, investing in three new research centers in South San Francisco, Cambridge, Massachusetts and London and refocusing our efforts on creating truly differentiated medicines that help solve big health problems for now and the future. ","This unwavering commitment to science and innovation enables us to retain the best talent in the industry, to drive our strategic priorities and to continuously enhance our pipeline of medically significant treatments and vaccines. Our clinical and commercial execution in the IO space has further separated KEYTRUDA from its competition and our leadership in oncology is further bolstered by the growth prospects for LYNPARZA and LENVIMA. ","GARDASIL is not only driving meaningful growth for the company after a decade on the market, but is also instilling optimism around the world that this vaccine could help prevent and maybe eliminate certain HPV related cancers. We are confident in our broad portfolio of market leading products and our diversified high potential pipeline, which includes significant innovations in oncology, vaccines and other special \u2013 and hospital care along with a robust industry leading animal health business. In fact, Merck is one of the broadest and most promising pipelines we've had over the past two decades.","In summary, we are excited by our progress, our pipeline and our future. We are energized by the work that we do and most importantly by our ability to help patients around the world while also creating sustainable long term growth and strong shareholder returns.","Before I turn the call over to Rob, I'm pleased to announce that we will be hosting an investor event on June 20 during which we will provide an update on our strategic progress and outline how Merck will continue to deliver innovative science and create value for all of our stakeholders. We'll be back to you with the details on location and other logistics, but we ask that you save the date.","Now, I'd like to turn it over to Rob for more color on our financial and operational performance. Rob?","Rob Davis","Thanks, Ken and good morning, everyone. Please note that my comments today will be on a non-GAAP basis. Our results in 2018 reflects strong execution across our key growth pillars, focused investment in our pipeline and disciplined expense management. We achieved meaningful top and bottom line growth and we also executed important business development transactions initiated in expanded capital expenditure program to increase our manufacturing capacity and return additional value to shareholders through increased dividends and share repurchases. We believe our company is well positioned to achieve future growth and as our 2019 guidance shows, we expect the recent momentum in our business to continue, as we execute on our growth pillars and invest in R&D, while remaining disciplined in our allocation of resources.","Turning to our fourth quarter results, total company revenues were $11 billion, an increase of 8% year-over-year, excluding exchange with strong growth in both our human health and animal health businesses. Human health revenues increased 8% ex-exchange to $9.8 billion, led by key products in our oncology, vaccines and hospital and specialty businesses. In oncology, KEYTRUDA sales exceeded $2.1 billion this quarter, extending the unprecedented launch of this foundational therapy and solidifying Merck as the clear market leader in renal oncology, with continued strong future growth prospects. ","Global growth was primarily driven by higher use in first line non-small cell lung cancer and utilization remained strong across the breadth of our indications, including melanoma, head and neck, bladder and MSI-high cancers. We're seeing strong uptake in squamous non-small cell lung cancer in the US where a good portion of newly diagnosed patients are now receiving either KEYTRUDA as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, following the approval of KEYNOTE-407 in October. In total, in the US, we now have 15 approved indications and are approved in 10 different tumor types overall plus a pan tumor approval in MSI-high patients.","In ex-US markets, first line lung is the key driver of growth, mostly due to further uptake of our monotherapy indication and PD-L1 high expressors, following reimbursement approvals around the world. In Europe, we're off to a great start launching the chemo combo in non-squamous patients, following approval of KEYNOTE-189 last September. We are already seeing adoption in select markets, such as Germany where reimbursement begins upon approval and we will be working through the reimbursement process in other major European markets throughout this year. ","Growth in Japan remains robust and we're very pleased with the recent approval of five new indications across lung, adjuvant melanoma and MSI-high cancers. Finally in September, we launched KEYTRUDA in metastatic melanoma in China, which will be an important market for the brand going forward, as we pursue additional indications. Overall, we remain very confident in the long term growth potential for KEYTRUDA based on increased utilization and currently approved indications and our expectation of additional approvals worldwide. ","We also remain very encouraged by the progress and potential of both LYNPARZA and LENVIMA in partnership with AstraZeneca and Eisai respectively. LYNPARZA growth this quarter was driven by continued uptake in ovarian and breast cancers as well as launches in new markets such as Japan and China. In the United States, across all tumors, LYNPARZA leads the PARP inhibitor class with over 50% total patient share. We're excited by the earlier than expected US approval of SOLO-1 and look forward to bringing this treatment to more women with ovarian cancer. Growth for LENVIMA reflected strong performance in hepatocellular cancer, following recent launches in US, Europe and more recently China. Performance in Japan remains strong with LENVIMA being used in a vast majority of hepatocellular patients.","Turning to vaccines, we have a significant and innovative portfolio. Our vaccines business reflected strong worldwide demand for GARDASIL, which achieved sales of over $800 million this quarter. Health systems worldwide continued to support increased immunization with GARDASIL with the goal of reducing the incidents of certain HPV related cancers. Growth this quarter was driven by strong uptake from our recent launch in China as well as increased demand in Europe, given the move towards more gender neutral vaccination programs. Sales of GARDASIL also grew in the US, mostly reflecting the difference in quarterly phasing of public sector purchases last year. Our hospital and specialty business was led by BRIDION, where growth in the US reflects continued strong demand. BRIDION sales approached $1 billion for the year and we remain confident in the potential for additional future growth. ","Looking now at our animal health business, we again saw strong growth this quarter with revenues increasing 11% to $1 billion, excluding exchange. Growth was driven by our broad portfolio with inline and newly launched products with companion animal products growing 16% and livestock sales growing 8%, both excluding exchange. Companion animal growth was driven by sales of vaccines while livestock benefited from increased sales of swine and poultry products. Animal health segment profit were $387 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 16%, excluding exchange compared to the prior year. Our animal health business continues to perform well and we view it as a key pillar of Merck\u2019s future growth. We continue to invest in new product development and launches and recently announced the acquisition of Antelliq, which will establish Merck as a leader in animal identification and monitoring, one of the fastest growing parts of the animal health industry.","Turning to the rest of our P&L, gross margin was 75% in the quarter. The increase of 70 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2017 was largely due to the favorable impacts of product mix this year and manufacturing variances related to the cyberattack that negatively impacted last year. This increase was partially offset by other headwinds, such as lower prices and catch up amortization of sales milestones, primarily related to the earlier than expected approval of SOLO-1. Operating expenses of $4.8 billion increased 1% year-over-year, including a favorable 1 percentage point impact from foreign exchange. ","Investments in oncology and vaccines clinical development portfolios as well as our discovery efforts drove the increase in R&D while SG&A remained relatively flat. Our tax rate of 22.5% for the quarter was 720 basis points higher year-over-year, reflecting a true up of our full year tax rate due to our mix of earnings. Taken together, we delivered earnings of $1.04 per share, an increase of 11%, excluding exchange.","Now, let's turn to our outlook for 2019. We remain confident in both our near and long term prospects for revenue growth, notwithstanding expected headwinds from price, foreign exchange and pressures on our mature and LOE products. For 2019, we expect full year revenues of $43.2 billion to $44.7 billion, which represents 2% to 6% growth, driven by strength in our key growth killers across oncology, vaccines, hospital and specialty as well as animal health. ","This range assumes an approximately 1 percentage point negative impact on foreign exchange, using mid-January rates. We expect our gross margin to be roughly flat year-over-year. As we've previously communicated, we believe tailwinds, including improved product mix, will generally be offset by headwinds, including lower prices, royalty payments, fluctuations in FX and the continued amortization of collaboration milestones. We expect our operating expenses to increase year-over-year at a low to mid-single digit rate with continued disciplined management of SG&A, allowing for meaningful further investment in R&D to capitalize on our pipeline opportunities. ","We expect our tax rate to be between 18.5% and 19.5% for the full year. We project average diluted shares outstanding to be approximately 2.58 billion for 2019. Taken together, we expect EPS to be between $4.57 and $4.72, including an approximately 1 percentage point positive impact from foreign exchange at mid-January rates. This would represent approximately 5% to 9% bottom line growth.","Before concluding, it's worth mentioning that our 2019 EPS guidance assumes that our other income and expense line will be roughly 0 in 2019. Due to an accounting standard implemented in 2018, we now recognize unrealized gains and losses related to our investments in equity securities and other income and expense. Based on current market conditions for our investment portfolio, we have assumed a negative impact from our equity investments in OIE in our guidance. We also expect higher net interest expense, given our cash and debt balances and given current interest rates. Market movements couldn't create additional volatility as we move through the year and we will continue to give you updates as we move forward.","In summary, we delivered strong performance in 2018. While 2019 continues to be another important investment year for R&D, we expect operational momentum across our growth pillars combined with disciplined resource allocation to deliver another year of meaningful top and bottom line growth as well as operating leverage. Longer term, we remain confident in our ability to drive strong sales growth and meaningful operating margin expansion. Our dedication to innovation and continued execution allow us to sustainably deliver for the patients we serve and in turn creates significant shareholder value.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Roger.","Roger Perlmutter","Thanks, Rob. As outlined in our press release, the fourth quarter was an especially productive period for Merck Research Laboratories, marking the climax of what was an extremely busy year. Beginning first with KEYTRUDA, during the fourth quarter, we obtained 3 new indications in the United States, first for the first line treatment for patients with metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer in combination with [indiscernible] based upon the results of the KEYNOTE-407 trial. ","Second for the second line treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients who\u2019ve previously been treated with sorafenib and third for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients with recurrent locally advanced or metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma probably or skin cancers. Separately and based on the results of our KEYNOTE-054 study, which was conducted with the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer, the European Commission approved KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment of stage 2 melanoma with lymph node involvement in patients who have undergone successful tumor resection.","Meanwhile in Japan, we obtained five new KEYTRUDA approvals at the end of December, including the first approval based on our KEYNOTE-042 trial for KEYTRUDA monotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, whose tumors contain greater than or equal to 1% of malignant cells, expressing that PD-L1 biomarker. Data from KEYNOTE-042 are also under review in the EU and in the United States for submission of additional data results and an extension of the PDUFA data by 3 months to April 11 of this year. ","Our other cancer programs also advanced meaningfully in the fourth quarter, in collaboration with our colleagues at AstraZeneca, we gained FDA approval for LYNPARZA as maintenance treatment for patients with advanced ovarian fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who have experienced complete or partial response to first line platinum based therapy and whose tumors contain deleterious or suspected deleterious, germ line or somatic mutations in BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 gene. This approval is based on data presented last fall at the European Society for Medical Oncology meetings from the SOLO-1 trial. ","We continue to see very positive results across our oncology portfolio, including the success of our KEYNOTE-181 trial, testing KEYTRUDA monotherapy in the second line treatment of advanced or metastatic esophageal or gastro-esophageal junction carcinoma with a 31% reduction in the risk of death as compared to traditional chemotherapy in patients whose tumors express the PD-L1 biomarker with a combined proportion score of greater than or equal to 10. This is the first demonstration of an improvement in overall survival in esophageal gastric malignancy through immunotherapy. Data from the study were presented to the ASCO GI meeting in January and have been submitted for regulatory review.","During the fourth quarter, we also announced the results of our KEYNOTE-426 trial, combining KEYTRUDA with Pfizer\u2019s axitinib in the first line treatment of renal cell cancer as compared with sorafenib treatment. Data from this study in which improvements in overall survival, progression free survival and overall response rate were demonstrated, have also been submitted for regulatory review. Progress has been made in other disease categories as well. ","For example, the FDA granted priority review with a PDUFA date of July 16 for a novel anti-microbial agent MK-7655A, which combines a new chemical entity, Relebactam with imipenem, thus blocking the activity of a bacterially expressed beta-lactamase that would otherwise inactivate imipenem. This represents an important advance in the struggle to control antibiotic resistance. We\u2019re also active on the business development front, joining with colleagues at MGM Biopharmaceuticals to advance MK-3655, a highly selective phase 2 monoclonal antibody, directed against the FGF receptor 1 to see beta close receptor complex for the potential treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. ","Our vaccine programs also progressed during the fourth quarter. At the end of the quarter, for example, we announced a collaboration with Instituto Butantan on the development of vaccines to protect against dengue virus infection. Instituto Butantan is currently conducting a Phase 3 study in Brazil with their vaccine candidate, while our own related dengue virus vaccine showed promise in the earlier phase 1 study. Finally, we commenced a rolling BLA submission for V920, our investigational vaccine designed to protect against infection with the Zaire strain of Ebola virus. We continue to provide tens of thousands of doses of this vaccine to the World Health Organization to assist them in the battle to contain an Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We hope that through the important work of governmental and non-governmental agencies and in part as a result of our V920 vaccine, it will be possible to bring this very serious Ebola outbreak under control in the near future.","Now, my colleagues and I will take your questions.","Teri Loxam","Thanks, Roger. Darla, we will get started on questions. I just wanted to remind everyone to try to keep their questions to a maximum of 1 to 2 to get as many people on the call as possible. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim.","Seamus Fernandez","Thanks very much for the question. So my first question is for Ken and my second is for Frank and Roger. Ken, can you just help us understand the core areas of focus for potential M&A or business development to bolster the Merck pipeline and maybe if you could just kind of give us a general sense of areas where -- areas of interest and perhaps even the range, obviously lots of questions around the current mega cap M&A that's occurred in recent days.","And then for Frank and Roger, can you just maybe each of you kind of characterize the key opportunities near and longer term to sustain or perhaps even accelerate the KEYTRUDA opportunity? We're seeing amazing growth in that franchise, but again we're just trying to get a sense of the key new opportunities, whether it be kidney cancer as a core opportunity or perhaps somewhat longer term in the adjuvant setting? Thanks so much.","Ken Frazier","Thanks, Seamus. Let me start by saying again that business development remains an important priority for us. First and foremost, we look for those scientific innovations that we believe will enhance our pipeline, because we believe that's what's important ultimately to drive long term growth and value for shareholders. In that regard, we don't try to predetermine what therapeutic areas are best. We want to find the best science that matches up to the best opportunities to help people and that's how we go about it and I\u2019ll remind you that we were very active last year in BD. We did about 60 transactions, spanning licensing and technology deals, clinical collaboration. ","We did the collaboration with Eisai, we did the acquisition of Viralytics, which expands our early immune-oncology, [indiscernible] with the Antelliq acquisition. So again, I think what we want to do, given our strong balance sheet, is to actively look across the entire spectrum of assets across therapeutic areas to create the strongest portfolio. I\u2019ll close by saying, we continue as we've said for years to want to focus on the kinds of deals that we can add with a minimum of disruption to our ongoing scientific efforts. So we have not really been focusing primarily on the large mega-mergers that you referred to.","Teri Loxam","And Roger, why don\u2019t you start on the second question around KEYTRUDA key opportunities and we can turn over to Frank for the commercial portion.","Roger Perlmutter","Right. Seamus, thanks for the question. First of all, I think it's important from a context point of view and you know this that we're still at an early point in the development of KEYTRUDA. So, keep in mind that it's just a little over 4 years since the first indication was obtained in the United States in 2014. And in that sense, the indications are still rolling out. KEYTRUDA, as I\u2019ve said and as you know is the first truly broad spectrum anti-neoplastic agent introduced into clinical practice with 15 indications and more coming and many of those indications have not yet been broadened around the world and Frank will have a chance to talk about that. So there's a great deal of opportunity to do good in helping patients around the world. ","But beyond that, we\u2019ve continued to work on a strategy in which we first demonstrate activity with monotherapy and different tumor types and the monotherapy studies are essentially complete. We have a few more studies coming through, but then move forward in combination studies, while simultaneously advancing from SALVAGE therapy, third line, second line to first line adjuvant, neoadjuvant and all of those studies are going on and we are expanding into new areas and in addition in combination with other agents, both those that have already been introduced into practice, axitinib in renal cell carcinoma and in addition our own pipeline. ","So there is just a huge set of opportunities. Looking forward, I think as I mentioned the data that we presented in esophageal gastric cancer in January at ASCO GI and the renal cell data, which will be presented in mid-February from the KEYNOTE-426 study are special highlights, but there are going to be a lot of presentations coming forward. There's a lot of new data coming out and we'll have a chance to talk about some of that for example in advance at ASCO. It's early days, but a lot of expansion opportunities and Frank, I think you can talk about that.","Frank Clyburn","Seamus, good morning. And to echo Roger's point, we have actually a very early stage launch going on and I just wanted to reiterate especially outside the US for lung cancer, we are right now launching KEYNOTE-189 and we're just in the early stages of that launch. So if you look at our ex-US growth, in fact this quarter, ex-US growth was over 86% and that just shows the early progress that we're making, not only with our monotherapy, but early on with our combination in lung. In addition, we have a number of other opportunities, you heard us announce the approvals in Japan, we're very excited about the opportunity that we have in China with our second line melanoma indication and we have a broad program that we are building in China. ","In addition to that, we have significant opportunities, as you've heard from Roger with regards to our renal cell carcinoma data that we're looking forward to presenting KEYNOTE-426 at ASCO GU. We\u2019re also excited about triple negative breast cancer, we presented our data now for KEYNOTE-048 for head and neck cancer with first line chemo combination, gastric cancer and others. So we're very excited about our current indications and expanding those around the world as well as the significant amount of data readouts that are going to be coming in the future that we think will provide very significant growth, not only this year, but in the long run.","Teri Loxam","Great. Thanks for the questions, Seamus. Darla, we\u2019ll move on to the next one please.","Operator","It\u2019s from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen.","Steve Scala","Thank you. A couple of questions. Ken, I was interested in your comment that Merck has one of the most broad pipelines in the past two decades and this is quite a statement given Merck\u2019s rich research history, what are we missing externally that Merck sees internally and will June 20th be the opportunity for us to learn a lot more about the pipeline?","And secondly, Merck\u2019s pneumococcal vaccine, I believe received breakthrough designation in children, but not adults. Is this an issue of timing or did FDA deliberately not grant the 15 valid product breakthrough in adults? Thank you.","Ken Frazier","Thank you for your question. Steve, I continue to believe that Merck\u2019s longer term revenue growth prospects are underappreciated in large part because people don't see the pipeline the way we do. So let me try to answer your question. So we see tremendous future growth, not only in KEYTRUDA, LYNPARZA and LENVIMA, but we have behind it a formidable internal pipeline of assets in oncology over 20 unique mechanisms. In the vaccine world, we think the GARDASIL opportunity is really significant going forward, but behind that are opportunities in next generation pneumococcal, RSV, CMV, dengue and other areas are the ones that we look forward to. ","As we also look beyond that, we just announced positive Phase 3 data for ZERBAXA, our antibiotic for hospital acquired and ventilator acquired pneumonia, which we believe could be a very sizable opportunity to go with our leading portfolio of hospital [indiscernible] which we acquired a couple of years ago is now being studied in phase 3 in chronic cough and [indiscernible] collaboration is just another example of that, not to mention great novel access in HIV and neuroscience. So to answer your question, I actually look forward to the June opportunity for us to talk about what it is that we see in our pipeline. I will say that we are genuinely excited, we see the opportunities for us to invest in across a broad area and again we look forward to speaking to you in more detail on June 20.","Roger Perlmutter","Right. And with \u2013 this is Roger, with respect to the breakthrough designation, yes, we did receive breakthrough designation in pediatrics for pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. And the reason was because of the very meaningful clinical data that we obtained, demonstrating the balance response across all 15 stereotypes, represented in that vaccine. We have very strong data in the adult segment as well and it's really a matter of timing with respect to how we interact with the agency, just to remind you breakthrough designation provides a mechanism whereby you can have more frequent consultation interaction with the agency on late stage trials and keep in mind that [indiscernible] is already in 8 phase 3 studies that we'll be reading out this year, and next year. So there's already a very substantial head of steam on this program.","Teri Loxam","Great. Thank you. Will we go to the next question please, Darla?","Operator","It\u2019s from Andrew Baum with Citi.","Andrew Baum","Many thanks. Couple of questions please. Some of the industry lobby has championed net pricing. Given the announcement last night, to find content, could you talk to the Merck assessment of the proposal, particularly probably to go through, how you see the risk as well as the potential public service and the spillover in terms of the commercial book of business when?","And then secondly, to Roger, I know that you recently initiated a trial of olaparib in tissue agnostic setting with HRR mutated treatments who are resistant to refractory standard treatment. The question is, number one, is that trial findable, given the advanced nature of the patients and number two, the size of that patient population, depending on what biomarker you use could be very substantial. Could you talk to how large that population may be in a percentage of addressable relapse refractory patients?","Ken Frazier","Thank you, Andrew. Let me start with your first question about the HHS rebate proposal. Let me start by saying we share the administration's goal of lowering out of pocket costs for patients, that's critical for patients, it's critical for our business. As you know, unfortunately, the current pharmaceutical supply chain includes various misaligned incentives that serve to support middlemen who are often neglected patients. We are evaluating the specific proposal released by the administration and we are hopeful that it will achieve the shared goal of ensuring patients have affordable access to innovative medicines.","Roger Perlmutter","And Andrew, I think you were asking a question and I'm having a little bit of trouble hearing you here, but you're asking a question about a LYNPARZA study, which was a tissue agnostic study and again this is part of the broader rollout of our LYNPARZA analysis because what we found with LYNPARZA as I think everyone recognizes is that the rate of activity of LYNPARZA is greater than we expected. First of all, any DNA repair, a variety of DNA repair defects, defects in homologous recombination seem to sensitize cells to LYNPARZA, but even in cell types in which those defects are not recognizable, there's evidence, accumulating evidence that we're seeing clinical responses. So we're beginning to think of LYNPARZA of having much broader activity and that's particularly the case when we look at LYNPARZA in combination with KEYTRUDA and other agents. So you can expect to see broader studies of LYNPARZA in a variety of different settings, both outside of the hormone responsive tumors and as well in combination with other agents. I hope that helps.","Teri Loxam","Great. Thanks, Andrew. We\u2019ll move on to the next question please, Carla.","Operator","Your next question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.","Chris Schott","I guess my first question was just on longer term margin expansion and just expenses in general. I guess, so when you think about the low to mid-single digit OpEx growth in 2019, is that a reasonable growth rate to think about on a go forward basis for Merck or should we think about spending starting to moderate as we look out to 2020 and beyond? I know in general, there's been a lot of discussion around kind of the magnitude of operating margin expansion, so is there any color on that front would be helpful?","And my second question was just focusing a little bit more on the launch dynamics in first line lung, specifically in the US. I guess, can you just give us a sense of where we are at this point in terms of share of new starts and are there any additional areas for growth within the lung market and I guess where you must focus on from a commercial standpoint as we think about just that indication playing through in the US?","Teri Loxam","Thanks, Chris. So we\u2019ll start with Rob.","Rob Davis","Thanks, Chris. And to your question on long term margin expansion, so as I said in the prepared remarks, we continue to believe we will see meaningful margin expansion, operating margin expansion as we go forward, but as we've been talking about, given the fact that we have such a wealth of opportunity right now in R&D, you start with KEYTRUDA and look at just what this drug could be and how unprecedented it is, we want to make sure we're investing fully behind that as well as with LYNPARZA and LENVIMA, those programs are now in full swing, not to mention our vaccines program. ","So as we've indicated, we do think you're going to see sales growth continue and with that, you're going to see R&D grow in the near term faster than sales over the next couple of years, as we really get to the bulk of that with R&D slowing down to a rate slower than sales thereafter and SG&A will continue to be managed very tightly. It's nice to see frankly that even despite the fact that we're making meaningful investments in R&D in 2019, we're actually going to see operating margin expansion in \u201919, so that actually is really I think a result of what we've done from disciplined expense management [indiscernible] and then you'll see R&D slow down after we get out of the next couple of years. So that's really what will drive it.","Teri Loxam","Okay. Thanks, Rob. Frank, we\u2019ll have you comment on the first line lung market.","Frank Clyburn","Chris, we are seeing significant share of newly diagnosed first line non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients that do not have an abnormal EGF or gene. Based off of KEYNOTE-189, we've seen that penetration very rapidly in the majority of the segments in the non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer setting. We do have room for further penetration in particular in the PD-L1 patient population in the US and that's where the team is focused and also we are seeing very rapid uptake with our KEYNOTE-407 approval at the end of October and we're penetrating the squamous cell carcinoma patient also very significantly. So I think in the US, I would say it's really in the PD-L1 negative population where there's opportunity for further growth in the non-squamous patients. I would highlight outside the US and just to reiterate that we're very early on in the launch outside the US in lung cancer. In fact, most of our growth outside the US is primarily being driven off of the PD-L1 high express patient population in KEYNOTE-024, so we're just rolling out our chemo combinations around the world and anticipate significant growth outside the US in lung.","Operator","It\u2019s from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger","So I just wanted to go back to the margin opportunities beyond 2019. It seems like Merck is increasingly becoming more of a specialty focused company and to that end, many specialty biopharma companies can generate higher margins, simply because they don't need primary care infrastructure and the other costs associated with a much broader portfolio and so could you discuss opportunities to further streamline Merck\u2019s cost structure in future years as you continue to pivot the company?","And then second, with respect to the data on February 16, the abstracts are coming out on Monday the 11 at 5 PM. So will we see the key data in the abstract release or will we really have to wait for the data on the 16?","Ken Frazier","All right. Dave, thanks for the question. Maybe, I'll take the first part and then Roger can take the second part. So, as you look at the profile of the business, given the mix of our portfolio, you are correct that as we go forward, we continue to believe that there is an opportunity to shift, as we move to the more specialty focused business to continue to optimize the resources we have on primary care. I think the important point though is this isn't a new thing for us, in fact, when we pointed this out in the past, we've actually been able to grow on an EPS basis through the years even when we didn't have sales growth at the same time, we were standing up an oncology franchise from scratch and investing meaningfully into R&D. ","And so, we did that because we have already started really harvesting some of the primary care resources we have in the marketplace, primarily through selling forces. We've been reducing selling forces over the last several years to be able to do that and there's opportunity for us to continue to do that going forward. That's why we do believe that we have -- we're going to continue to see SG&A get better as a percentage of sales, despite the fact that we're already at an industry best-in-class position with the fact that we still have the primary care resources in place although less than they used to be. ","So that is an opportunity that's out there and we're going to be driving it over the next couple of years as we move forward. So that is something you should look for, as we go forward. I think the thing that's important to note is while we're getting the favorable impact from mix, obviously given the strong volume growth and margin you get from positive mix, we do have the headwinds at the gross margin line that we\u2019ve talked about, that\u2019s going to cause gross margin to be roughly flat. So the operating margin expansion we're going to see will come from that SG&A leveraging we're talking about as well as the R&D I mentioned earlier.","Roger Perlmutter","And David, you're referring at February 16 to the renal cell carcinoma data from KEYNOTE-426. Of course, on February 16 is also the PDUFA date for the 054 study in adjuvant melanoma, but I think you're referring to the 426 data. And the complete data of course will be presented then. There will be an abstract that appears before hand, the abstract has some data and depending on what you view as key, there's some material in it. We're eager to gain publication also of the complete analysis just as soon as we can, so there will be various different parts of the data coming out, but the main presentation on the 16 is the part that I would focus.","Operator","It\u2019s from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI.","Umer Raffat","First, perhaps Roger, I feel like there's a trial which hasn't come up very much at all on Merck conversations, which is your stage 3 lung trial, KEYNOTE-799 and it's my understanding that it's a first line trial within stage 3, which would potentially position KEYTRUDA before the current label for infancy. However what I noticed was your slide today calls it a second line trial, so I just wanted to clarify that, a. And b, on the pneumococcal vaccine side, I know there's a couple of Pfizer patents, which you guys have prosecuted in the past and now appealing. And my question is, as it stands currently and let's say the appeal doesn't go favorably, do you have the freedom to operate?","Roger Perlmutter","Okay. With respect to KEYNOTE-799, just to provide a higher altitude context for this, from the very beginning, our concern with respect to administering KEYTRUDA in the setting of radiotherapy has been pneumonitis and we know that from a variety of different studies previously that we had come to associate proximity of radiotherapy with KEYTRUDA administration with more inflammation in the lungs. So 799 has a safety, an important safety component, which is the administration of KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy plus radiotherapy in different cohorts for the question of whether or not pneumonitis feeds 10%, because that's really an important issue. These are patients -- the actual study population is a population that has undergone resection, but is not widely disseminated. Let me get this right, the actual population is a population of individuals who have lung cancer that is radio responsive, potentially radio responsive and who can receive that in a first line environment, because they won\u2019t receive prior systemic chemotherapy, if that was your question.","Ken Frazier","And to your question with respect to V114, let me say that we continue to believe that we will have freedom to operate in that space and recently the IPR ruling from the PPAV was in the favor on a number of the patents that we have challenged. So we'll see what goes on as we move forward.","Operator","It\u2019s from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.","Tim Anderson","A couple of questions. Going back to the very first line of questioning on your pipeline and the perception by investors that at least late stage tends to run on the thin side. Here you and Bristol potentially share a common thread, which is all the heavy spending in IO has may be crowded out other R&D programs. So the question I have in this context is something that we asked you maybe about a year ago, when is R&D spending on KEYTRUDA going to peak, about a year ago, you suggested that wasn't very far off qualitatively, but it was never quite clear to me what that meant, I know with all the combination programs, maybe it doesn't peak anytime soon. So that's the first question.","Second question is just on your triple negative breast adjutant trial update on timing of seeing those results and how would you characterize the riskiness of that trial in terms of achieving a positive readout. Would you say it's low or medium or high risk?","Teri Loxam","Let's start with Rob to talk about the cost first.","Rob Davis","Good morning, Tim. So with R&D, so if you look at what's driving the bulk of our clinical spend right now, it is still KEYTRUDA, but it's actually now more combination studies than it is monotherapy studies, a lot of the monotherapy clinical studies are already starting to peak and come off. So really right now, what's driving it is the combination studies and then in addition to that, importantly, the investments in LYNPARZA and LENVIMA will be peaking over the next couple of years too. So, if you look at total R&D, it is being driven by those and then obviously our vaccines programs are contributing as well. So those are the main group categories and we do think though the bolus of KEYTRUDA for latest studies and the broader LYNPARZA, LENVIMA studies will peak in the next couple of years. ","So when we've been talking about that threshold happening, it's really those programs that are driving that change where we do think you'll see R&D slowdown, as we move forward. Obviously though, the good news from a long term perspective is Roger keeps turning over new positive things, so we always have to moderate as we have opportunity to invest, but the good news is, we have a great pipeline, we're investing behind it and we're going to invest, you should see a peak in the next couple of years.","Teri Loxam","Great. And Roger do you want to address the second question.","Roger Perlmutter","Right. I believe Tim that you're referring to the KEYNOTE-522 study, which is a neo adjuvant study and we did have the opportunity to see early data from the 522 study, we had the chance to share those data with the agency and we and they agree that it is important to get additional data with a longer term follow up, so that's what we're waiting for, for those, for that study and once we have those data available, we\u2019ll have a chance to look at it more carefully and then of course share with you.","Operator","It\u2019s from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.","Vamil Divan","So one, I appreciate the color you gave on the lung cancer side and the commercial uptake there. I\u2019m just trying to understand the adjuvant melanoma and also the front line renal indications as we need to see the full data on the labels, was there anything specific or unique with those two indications that may make the uptake faster or slower than what we've seen so far in lung cancer?","And then the second one, just going back to the topic of drug pricing, if you can just share just what you're assuming in terms of net pricing growth in the US in 2019 for your guidance and also sort of related to that question in terms of KEYTRUDA, if you can just sort of share your net pricing assumptions of US, Europe and also China would be very helpful.","Teri Loxam","So we'll start with Frank on the adjuvant melanoma RCC and maybe you can just call it broadly on pricing for KEYTRUDA before we turn it over to Rob for the other part of the question.","Frank Clyburn","Adjuvant melanoma, we're actually just starting and got approval in Europe for adjuvant melanoma. We do think this is a good opportunity for us. We have established a very strong foothold in metastatic melanoma, so we think this is a good opportunity to expand into adjuvant melanoma. As Roger mentioned, we're waiting on our PDUFA date for adjuvant melanoma in the US and we think we will be competitive there as well.","With regards to RCC, we're excited about the opportunity. The study was done across all risk groups and we're looking forward to sharing the data in the next several weeks, but we think that this will be a very important opportunity in RCC upon approval.","As far as KEYTRUDA goes with regards to pricing, we don't give out specific guidance from a pricing perspective, but in the ex-US markets, we're seeing very strong reimbursement for KEYTRUDA based off of a very strong value proposition that we have and we feel as though we're positioned very well from a reimbursement perspective outside the US. And then in the US, we also feel as though we're positioned very well with regards to reimbursement, especially because KEYTRUDA is reimbursed in Part B currently.","Rob Davis","Good morning, Vamil. To your question on the guidance, while our guidance range does assume multiple scenarios, we don't require any additional pricing in the United States to meet our guidance range.","Teri Loxam","Right. And we're going to try to squeeze in a few more questions. I know it\u2019s close to the top of the hour. Next question please, Carla.","Operator","It\u2019s from Jason Gerberry with Bank of America.","Jason Gerberry","Maybe just Frank, just a follow up on a couple of Vamil\u2019s questions. So in adjuvant melanoma, just curious in lung, you enjoy a first mover advantage. In adjuvant melanoma, Bristol already has roughly 70% share, so just kind of curious how you think you can make inroads if you think the first mover advantage is really that important or if you think you can actually capture share?","And then my second question, just on frontline renal, in the US, and may be that you\u2019re drawing from your experience that other tumor settings, are payers mandating that you -- they'll only reimburse the specific studied combinations and the reason I ask is I'm wondering if there's an advantage at all in terms of how these different TKI combinations will be used, will physicians ultimately migrate to using different TKIs which they're more familiar with and more commonly used or if there's going to be a winner takes all with potentially the study that gets there first with TKI.","Frank Clyburn","So in all things being equal, you would like to be first in most of the indications, however, we have experienced in several cancer types where we were not first, so I\u2019ll point you to bladder where we actually launched fifth in the US and we now have the leading market share in bladder cancer and really it was because of the strong data with KEYNOTE-045 and the overall survival benefits. So really the oncologists are going to look first and foremost to the data and we feel as though KEYNOTE-054 is a very strong data set and we feel as though will be competitive.","The other thing I would also say is that in the community, especially in the US, because of the breadth of our program and because of the use in lung cancer in head, and neck and now in gastric and other cancer types, we feel as though the community's very familiar with using KEYTRUDA. They're giving us very strong feedback on the profile of KEYTRUDA and we think that's going to help us, not only in adjuvant mel, but also being second in renal cell carcinoma.","And then the last one I mentioned on renal cell carcinoma is when we share the data in the next several weeks, we feel as though as Roger has highlighted, we\u2019ve top line having overall survival benefit, progression free survival benefit and strong response rate. So usually the oncologists will make a choice based off of the data they see and we're looking forward to upon approval competing in RCC.","Teri Loxam","Great. Let\u2019s move on to the next question please.","Operator","It\u2019s from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei","And Roger, could you please provide your thoughts or comments on KEYTRUDA lifecycle planning. Obviously, [indiscernible] you'll be more dependent on KEYTRUDA. I realize very few years away but given your valuation on potential size of this product, it does become an important investment consideration?","And then for Frank, could you please provide your estimates of KEYTRUDA sales by indication in both US and ex-US.","Roger Perlmutter","So the first question about KEYTRUDA, so obviously KEYTRUDA has been a winning franchise obviously for us and an important growth driver across all the opportunities that we have both as monotherapy as well as combination, but we continue to stress the fact that as we look at, we don't see ourselves as just a KEYTRUDA story. So, I\u2019ve emphasized before the other pillars of growth, including LYNPARZA and LENVIMA in oncology, what comes after that with 20 unique mechanisms, the vaccines programs that we have, [indiscernible]. We continue to think that even when we see an important drug like JANUVIA go off patent that Merck will have multiple sources of growth going forward. And then of course it's really important to recognize that in addition to our internal pipeline, we're continuing to seek to augment that pipeline with value creating innovative external assets in business development. So we feel very confident about our ability to drive sustained revenue growth going forward, recognizing that a major patent expiration is coming.","Teri Loxam","Great. We will turn it over to Frank next.","Frank Clyburn","In the US and this is very directional data due to the claims data lagging several months behind, but approximately 65 %to 70% of our users non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma represents about 10%, head and neck is approximately 5%, bladder approximately 5% and then we also are seeing good growth in the MSI-high agnostic indication that represents about 5% of our business and then the all other category or other indications represents about 10%. Outside the US, it's really hard to get specific breakdowns, but the majority of our use right now is in lung cancer.","Teri Loxam","Great. Thanks, Frank. So to get to our last question.","Operator","It\u2019s from Geoff Meacham with Barclays.","Geoff Meacham","Frank, I want to get a bit more detail about the OUS dynamics for KEYTRUDA in lung, you guys saw good trends in 4Q. But I wasn't sure if we're already at an inflection point based on the cadence of reimbursement, maybe just be helpful to go through how you see the pace of share gains in Europe in lung over the balance of the year?","And then Roger at a higher level, how are you guys thinking about the balance of therapeutic areas in the pipeline. I mean obviously, you want to press your advantage in oncology, but is expanding other existing categories a strategic priority or is there a capacity for a new therapeutic category?","Frank Clyburn","So in Europe, I'll give an example. So right now, we have reimbursement in most of the European Union for KEYNOTE-024 and that's where you're seeing a lot of the growth on our monotherapy indication. With 189, we have reimbursement in Germany, Austria, Netherlands and a couple of other markets, but we're very early on in getting an uptake for 189 broadly in Europe and I anticipate that will come throughout the year, very similar ramp to what we saw back when we launched KEYNOTE-024. So think of that, the timing you should be thinking about for that ramp.","In addition to that, as mentioned, Japan we think is a very significant opportunity now with not only the approval of 189, but 407 and also KEYNOTE-042. So we think Japan provides a very good opportunity outside of the US. And then as mentioned, we're in the very early stages in China with just our first launch in second line melanoma, so we see also outside the US, significant opportunities for growth there.","Roger Perlmutter","Yeah. And this is Roger, if I might I\u2019d say also today, the PHMP announced that they adopted a positive opinion with respect to 407 in Europe, so that of course reimbursement will be required in most markets and will take some time, but it's going to advance that still further. In terms of the balance of therapeutic areas, Geoff, our interests, certainly my interest is in having the greatest possible impact on improving and extending human life wherever we see that and so we're not going to be down to any particular therapeutic area. ","If you look at the kinds of things that we're doing, look at the work that's taking place in HIV right now, MK-8591 is an extraordinary molecule, the Phase 2 data in combination with [indiscernible], we hope we will have an opportunity to present those data probably sometime around the middle of the year and this is really a remarkable compound in terms of its potency, the durability of the treatment effect and it changes the landscape in a lot of ways in terms of how you think about HIV treatment. That's a therapeutic area which doesn't get enormous amount of tension externally, but which we're putting a lot of effort into, just as we're putting a lot of effort into other areas. So, there's a lot of work going so.","Ken Frazier","So let me close by thanking for joining us. We had a strong 2018. We're confident going forward in our execution and our pipeline and our future. We believe that we're well positioned to drive sustained revenue growth and we also expect meaningful operating margin expansion over time and that's largely the result of a differentiated pipeline that we believe will actually position Merck well going forward. So thank you.","Teri Loxam","That concludes our call. Thank you, Darla. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the Merck Fourth Quarter 2018 sales and earnings conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Merck's First Quarter 2018 Sales and Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Teri Loxam. Please go ahead.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thank you, Darla, and good morning. Welcome to Merck's first quarter 2018 conference call. Today, I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; Adam Schechter, President of Global Human Health; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Laboratories.","Before I turn the call over to Ken, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation of these in our press release. We have also provided a table in our press release to help you understand the sales in the quarter for the business units and products.","I would like to remind you that some of the statements that we make during today's call maybe considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.","Our SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2017 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements. You can see our SEC filings as well as today's earnings release on merck.com.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thank you, Teri. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining the call today. With our first quarter performance, we're off to a strong start for 2018, including the KEYNOTE-189 results that were presented at the recent American Association for Cancer Research Meeting. These compelling data showed longer survival in nonsquamous first-line lung cancer patients when KEYTRUDA was combined with chemotherapy as compared with chemotherapy alone. This should help establish KEYTRUDA as a new standard-of-care in this patient setting.","This is a significant advance, especially given that lung cancer kills more patients than any other form of malignant disease. KEYTRUDA offers new hope for these patients and KEYNOTE-189 sets a new bar against which future trials in first-line lung cancer treatment should be measured.","Delivering therapeutics and vaccines for unmet medical needs is what Merck is all about and doing it in a way that provides long-term value to shareholders in addition to patients is our top priority. Our solid first quarter performance provides good momentum for the rest of the year and into the long-term.","We firmly believe that our prospects for revenue growth through 2021 and then beyond to 2025 are underappreciated. We've always believed in KEYTRUDA, but we think our data from KEYNOTE-189 along with what we anticipate to be a strong program going forward firmly establishes KEYTRUDA as a foundation for cancer treatment and a substantial driver for this company.","We also believe we have tremendous near and long-term opportunities with our partnered products, Lynparza and Lenvima, along with the robust early-stage oncology pipeline. We believe our vaccines portfolio, including GARDASIL and complemented by our next-generation pneumococcal asset, V114, can drive significant value. Our early-stage pipeline, including vaccines, HIV, neuroscience and other areas should also be significant contributors.","The continued strength we expect from Animal Health further adds to our confidence. Business development remains a top priority and we will continue to look for opportunities to further augment our outlook. We must continue to execute, but I am very optimistic about our near and long-term growth trajectory driven by these key pillars.","And with that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Rob Davis, to go through our results in more detail. Rob?","Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results reflect continued strength in our key pillars and good operational discipline resulting in top and bottom line growth. Our underlying business continues to perform well, setting the company up for a strong start to the year.","I will note that our first quarter results included a one-time non-operational benefit of just over $0.03 related to the Apotex litigation settlement originally expected to occur in the second quarter as well as a more favorable-than-expected FX benefit.","Total company revenues were $10 billion, an increase of 6% year-over-year, driven by both the Human Health and Animal Health businesses. Excluding the impact of exchange, first quarter revenues grew 3%. Our Human Health business grew 4%, excluding exchange. Adam will provide more color on those results in a moment.","As we noted in our press release this morning, given the size of our Animal Health business, it became a reportable segment this quarter, resulting additional disclosure requirements, including segment profits. Animal Health sales totaled $1.1 billion in Q1, an increase of 13% compared with the first quarter of 2017, including a 6 percentage point positive impact from foreign currency.","Excluding the impact of exchange, livestock sales grew 6%, while companion animal sales grew 9%. Animal Health segment profits were $413 million in the first quarter of 2018, representing a roughly 39% operating margin.","Note that these profits exclude certain expenses and other overhead costs not directly incurred by the business.","When compared to a year-ago, the quarterly segment profits decreased 1% compared to $417 million in the first quarter of 2017, primarily driven by exchange, seasonality and one-time charges. We anticipate for the full year, the Animal Health business will deliver a leveraged P&L, excluding the impact of exchange.","As you can see, our Animal Health business is profitable, has strong growth, provides the company with significant diversification from the Human Health business and benefits from synergies with our Human Health R&D capabilities. As such, Animal Health represents an important pillar of growth for Merck in 2018 and beyond.","Turning back to the total company P&L, non-GAAP gross margin was 75.7% in the quarter, a decrease of 170 basis points versus the first quarter of 2017, largely due to unfavorable foreign exchange as well as amortization of unfavorable manufacturing variances, partly resulting from last year's cyber incident.","Non-GAAP operating expenses of $4.3 billion, increased 1% year-over-year, including a negative 3 percentage point impact from foreign exchange. Excluding FX, both M&A and R&D declined in the quarter with the decrease in R&D reflecting the timing of licensing costs, which more than offset the increased clinical development spending and investment in early drug development. Taken together, we earned $1.05 per share on a non-GAAP basis, up 18%, excluding exchange.","Turning to the outlook for the year, we are narrowing and raising both our revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance ranges for 2018. We continue to believe that several of our growth pillars, including oncology, vaccines and Animal Health, will drive both top and bottom line growth for the year. We also expect a more favorable exchange environment.","For the full year, we now expect revenues to be between $41.8 billion and $43 billion, including an approximately 2 percentage point impact from foreign currency at mid-April rates. This topline increase flows to the bottom line and we now expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $4.16 and $4.28, including a roughly 1 percentage point positive impact from foreign currency at mid-April rates. All other elements of our non-GAAP guidance provided during the fourth quarter earnings call remain unchanged.","In summary, we expect our momentum to continue through 2018. We will remain disciplined in our allocation of resources, while we fully fund our near-term opportunities and invest in our pipeline to drive long-term growth. This approach positions us well to maximize our ability to grow both revenues and earnings and to deliver shareholder value.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Adam.","Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. This morning I'll provide highlights in the performance of Global Human Health for the first quarter of 2018. My comments will be on a constant currency basis.","Merck's Global Human Health business achieved solid growth in the first quarter. Sales of $8.9 billion grew 4%, driven by several important franchises which more than offset competitive pressures and loss of exclusivity for select products. Merck sales outside of the U.S. grew 8%, representing now almost 60% of total Global Human Health sales.","I'll now highlight a few of our key franchises and I'll start with oncology. Our oncology business continues to expand rapidly, led by KEYTRUDA, which is now a foundational cancer treatment across multiple tumor types. Global sales of KEYTRUDA more than doubled to nearly $1.5 billion versus prior year.","In the United States, there are more new patient starts on KEYTRUDA than any other immunotherapy and KEYTRUDA remains the leader in patients with metastatic lung cancer. We have received overwhelmingly positive feedback from key opinion leaders and physicians based upon the recently-presented KEYNOTE-189 data. They were very impressed by the overall survival benefit across all PD-L1 subgroups. And given that OS is the gold standard, we expect the use of this chemo combo to substantially increase moving forward.","Beyond lung, KEYTRUDA remains the leading immunotherapy in head and neck and bladder cancers and it continues to be used extensively in metastatic melanoma. In addition, we're gaining traction in MSI-high, where testing rates continue to increase across many different tumor types.","Outside of the U.S., KEYTRUDA sales nearly tripled from a year ago, as access continues to increase and lung cancer is now representing the majority of sales in major European markets.","In summary, KEYTRUDA has become foundational in cancer care and the potential growth for KEYTRUDA in 2018 and beyond remains very strong. We're also very pleased by the performance of Lynparza in both ovarian cancer and more recently in metastatic breast cancer, where the launch is progressing well following the January U.S. approval. Lynparza leads the PARP inhibitor class in both new and total prescriptions.","In addition, Lenvima will be an important product for oncology portfolio through our recently announced collaboration with Eisai. We are accelerating the development and the commercialization of Lenvima, which has already established itself in several approved indications, including renal, thyroid and, and more recently, hepatocellular cancers. We are very optimistic about the long-term potential of both Lynparza and Lenvima and we believe they represent important additions to our growing oncology portfolio.","Now, moving to our vaccine business, global sales exceeded $1.5 billion in the first quarter, driven by continued strong demand for GARDASIL, which grew 20% despite pressure in the U.S. from the transition to the two-dose regimen. Ex-U.S., sales nearly doubled, driven by a strong launch in China following its approval last year and continued strong demand in other markets. We view GARDASIL in our vaccines portfolio as a key pillar of Merck's future growth.","Turning to the diabetes franchise, global diabetes sales grew to $1.4 billion for the quarter. U.S. sales declined as TRx and pricing trends remained consistent with past quarters. Ex-U.S., growth was strong, driven by increased demand in most markets around the world. We continue to view the diabetes franchise as a relatively stable franchise moving forward.","Moving to the Hospital\/Specialty portfolio where BRIDION stands out as a fast-growing product, driven by strong formulary acceptance and favorable customer experiences. In the U.S., BRIDION is used in a wide range of procedures and has gained significant share of the neuromuscular blockade reversal market since its launch just two years ago. BRIDION continues to grow strongly ex-U.S. as well, where it has launched in 60 countries.","In closing, it is a remarkable time at Merck to be launching so many important new oncology products and indications. With our broad portfolio and our global footprint, we were able to overcome several competitive pressures and patent expiries and deliver 4% growth in the quarter. We remain optimistic by what we see in front of us for the rest of this year and beyond.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","And thanks, Adam. The first quarter was an important one for Merck Research Laboratories with progress on many fronts. Much of the activity this quarter was focused in the oncology therapeutic area where we had the opportunity to present meaningful new data and to advance regulatory review across several important programs.","For example, yesterday, we announced that the FDA has granted Priority Review with the PDUFA date of September 23 to our supplementary Biologics Licensing Application seeking full approval for the use of KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer in patients whose tumors lack EGF receptor or ALK gene mutations.","Data supporting the filing were derived from our KEYNOTE-189 study, in which patients receiving this KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy combination showed a greater than 50% improvement in overall survival as compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone. These results were presented at the American Association for Cancer Research or AACR Annual Meeting in early April and published simultaneously in The New England Journal of Medicine.","Dr. Roy Herbst, the discussant selected by AACR to comment on the KEYNOTE-189 data, describes our KEYTRUDA chemotherapy regimen as a new standard of care for patients receiving initial therapy for metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer. The KEYNOTE-189 data are also under review at the European Medicines Agency and by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency or PMDA in Japan.","During the AACR Meeting last month, we were also able to present data from our KEYNOTE-054 study, performed in collaboration with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, which demonstrated that adjuvant therapy with KEYTRUDA reduced the risk of death or tumor recurrence by 43% as compared to placebo in patients undergoing definitive surgery for high-risk stage III melanoma. These results were also published in The New England Journal of Medicine.","During the first quarter, we also obtained important new results from our KEYNOTE-042 study, showing improved overall survival in patients with EGFR and ALK mutation negative metastatic or advanced non-small cell lung cancer, receiving first-line treatment with KEYTRUDA as a single agent as opposed to traditional platinum-based chemotherapy when the tumor cells of these patients showed PD-L1 tumor proportion scores of at least 1%. Because this was a monotherapy study, patients with both nonsquamous and squamous tumor histologies were included in this study, details of which will be presented at the upcoming American Society for Clinical Oncology or ASCO Annual Meeting next month.","These data extend those from our KEYNOTE-024 study for which we received regulatory approval from the FDA in 2016, which demonstrated improved overall survival in the smaller cohort of patients whose tumors expressed the PD-L1 biomarker on greater than 50% of cells. The new results therefore offer the promise of extending the benefit of KEYTRUDA monotherapy to the majority of patients with non-small cell lung cancer.","KEYTRUDA has already received approval from the FDA for use in 10 different settings involving 7 different tumor types, melanoma; non-small cell lung cancer; squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck; gastric cancer; classical Hodgkin Lymphoma; urothelial cancer; and in solid tumors with evidence of DNA mismatch repair deficiency or microsatellite instability. During the first quarter, the FDA also granted Priority Review with a PDUFA date of June 28 to our supplementary filing for the treatment of advanced cervical cancer following progression on or off chemotherapy.","KEYTRUDA is also under review for the third-line treatment of patients with primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma and especially aggressive malignancy. The PDUFA date was extended until July 3 to permit analysis of additional data that we have provided.","Another filing based on our Phase 3 KEYNOTE-040 trial and supporting the use of KEYTRUDA in the second-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck has also been accepted for review by the FDA with a PDUFA date of December 28. In all, there are now more than 750 studies of KEYTRUDA listed on clinicaltrials.gov, including more than 400 combination studies. Not all of these studies will succeed of course.","During the first quarter, for example, we announced that a Phase III study exploring the utility of Incyte Corporation's epacadostat, used in combination with KEYTRUDA, failed to meet its primary endpoints of progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with metastatic malignant melanoma as compared with KEYTRUDA therapy alone. However, numerous other combination programs employing other agents appear quite promising.","Beyond KEYTRUDA, the first quarter saw important progress in the development of Lynparza, our PARP inhibitor that we are developing with our colleagues at AstraZeneca. Already approved in the United States for use as maintenance therapy for patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who've had a complete or partial response to chemotherapy, the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion for a similar indication, so it will become applicable in all participating European markets following ratification by the European community.","Lynparza is also under review by the EMA for use in patients with BRCA-mutated HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer following treatment with traditional chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic setting, an indication that was approved in the United States during the first quarter.","Progress has also continued in our infectious disease research. During the first quarter, we announced that the combination of imipenem, cilastatin and relebactam, our new beta-lactamase inhibitor, demonstrated a favorable overall response in patients with imipenem-insensitive bacterial infection, which was the primary endpoint of our first Phase III study. The addition of relebactam promises to expand the utility of imipenem, an important broad spectrum antibiotic. These data will form the basis of a new drug application which we intend to submit in the very near future.","Separately, we announced the initiation of two Phase III studies of V114, our novel polyvalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Based on favorable serology data from our earlier studies, some of which we presented at the 2018 International Society on Pneumococci and Pneumococcal Diseases in Melbourne, we are optimistic that this new vaccine will demonstrate improved immunogenicity along with satisfactory safety and tolerability findings in healthy adult subjects and in adults receiving therapy for human immunodeficiency virus infection.","As has already been mentioned, the first quarter was also an important one for business development with the announcement of our collaboration with Eisai Corporation on the development of Lenvima, an orally available protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor already approved in the United States as monotherapy for the treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer that is no longer responsive to radio-iodine and for the second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma in combination with everolimus.","Initial studies combining Lenvima and KEYTRUDA treatment defined a dose and schedule for the combination and yielded intriguing results regarding efficacy in multiple tumor types. Indeed a Phase III program for the first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma testing the Lenvima-KEYTRUDA combination versus Lenvima plus everolimus or monotherapy sunitinib began in October of 2016. So, we've been engaged in studying Lenvima in combination with KEYTRUDA for some time.","Lenvima has broad activity as monotherapy and it was recently approved for the first-line treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma in Japan, the first new systemic therapy for this disease approved in Japan in more than a decade.","During the first quarter, we also announced the acquisition of Viralytics, Incorporated, providing us with a coxsackie A21-derived oncolytic virus called CAVATAK that has been studied as both monotherapy and in combination with KEYTRUDA. Details of these clinical programs involving CAVATAK will be presented at upcoming scientific meetings.","Speaking of which, during the first quarter, we submitted more than 100 abstracts for presentation at the ASCO Meeting next month. Included in these presentations are examples of many combination studies, including those involving traditional chemotherapy, targeted agents like Lenvima and exploratory immunological manipulations.","Data to be presented at ASCO also include the previously mentioned KEYNOTE-042 monotherapy study in the first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, our KEYNOTE-407 study, a KEYTRUDA plus traditional chemotherapy in the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma, and our KEYNOTE-427 monotherapy study in the first-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma. We look forward to sharing these data with the broad international community of oncologists at ASCO in 2018.","I'll now turn the call back over to Teri.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Roger. Darla, we're ready to move on to our Q&A phase. I would like to remind everybody to keep your questions to one or two maximum, so we can try to get as many people on the call as possible.","So, with that, Darla, let's turn it over.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question is from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. Congrats on the performance. I wanted to ask two questions. First, could you just update us on the potential approval timing for KEYNOTE-189, ex-U.S., in major markets?","And then, second, with respect to the company's operating leverage potential, it appears that some of the negative pressures on key franchises will subside after 2018 and there should be operating leverage in coming years. But I just wanted to ask you to characterize how you're thinking about the opportunity to drive potentially faster operating profit growth and revenue growth in coming years. Thank you.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","David, it's Roger. With regard to the approval timing for KEYNOTE-189, ex-U.S., the files are moving forward in a variety of jurisdictions. We expect them to move in the usual sort of way. There are no special accelerations that we see in Europe or in other jurisdictions, but the files will move forward and, as we learn more, we'll update you on their progress.","Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks, David. This is Rob. I'll address your question on operating leverage. The answer is we do expect \u2013 as we've been signaling for quite some time, that we do expect long-term operating margin expansion and improvement due to the fact \u2013 really several things. One, obviously, as we continue to see growth in our sales line and the shift in our mix of our products, that should drive operating margin improvement.","And as we have been talking about over the last several quarters, we've been in a period of heavy investment, particularly into the clinical studies behind KEYTRUDA and just the vast oncology portfolio we have in total moving through the clinic. So, that obviously has been putting some pressure on our ability to drive leverage in the near-term and will continue to make leverage more challenging over the near-term. But long-term, we are focused on driving operating margin improvement. So, you should see them.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Great. Next question, please, Darla.","Operator","It's from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. Ken and Rob, I know you like the Animal Health business for the reasons you've articulated many times. So, don't need you to repeat those, but how do you balance those attributes with the fact that the business could be much more highly valued outside of the company?","And my second question is on the Eisai collaboration. Roger, what are the important points of differentiation you see for Lenvima versus other TKIs? Thanks.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.","Well, so, thanks, Gregg, for the question. Let me start by saying what we've stated in the past, which is that we think this is a key growth driver for the company with healthy margins and a strong market outlook. Our goal over the longer term is to drive long-term growth and we think Animal Health, a business that generates really good cash flows, that actually helps fund the Human Health R&D we intend to do, is a way of generating long-term shareholder value within Merck.","In addition, I guess, ironically, I might add that from time to time, we're told that a concern is the concentration risk around KEYTRUDA and this provides diversification from KEYTRUDA as well as the rest of our Human Health portfolio. So, I guess, I would say we view this business as an important future pillar of growth for Merck.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Right. And, Gregg, the Lenvima is, just as you point out, is one of a large number of tyrosine kinase inhibitors that are active across a broad range of malignancies. It's pretty difficult to compare them, because the different protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors have related, but not identical spectra of activity with respect to the VEGF receptor family, PDGF receptor and others.","As a result, one just has to look at the clinical data. I'd say that Lenvima data, first of all, as a monotherapy in renal cell carcinoma and in differentiated thyroid are strong and the hepatocellular data are really very good that provided approval in Japan.","Our knowledge of this led us to begin the initial combination studies. We found we were able to combine Lenvima with KEYTRUDA effectively and the results which we presented in part for the combination of the two in renal cell carcinoma are really very, very encouraging. Additional data on the combination of Lenvima plus KEYTRUDA will be presented at ASCO and they're really quite interesting results. That Phase III program, of course, is still ongoing and won't be available until next year, but it is a formidable combination.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Great. We'll take the next question, please, Darla?","Operator","It's from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much for the questions. The first one was on KEYTRUDA and just your thoughts on the role of monotherapy KEYTRUDA relative to combo in light of KEYNOTE-189, the data from KEYNOTE-024 as well as the data from the upcoming KEYNOTE-042 study. When we think about the high expressors as well as that 1 through 49 population, I was trying to understand how you're thinking about how people will be using monotherapy versus combo in those two settings specifically.","My second question was a broader question just for Ken. I guess what we're seeing here is just the success you've had with KEYTRUDA and the visibility that provides to the longer-term business, does that change at all how you think about either investing in the portfolio today, your business development priorities or just how you think about core versus non-core assets at all? Thank you very much.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Roger, you want to start on KEYTRUDA?","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Yeah. So, Chris, the decision as to whether to use monotherapy versus combination therapy, I think, will be a very personal one that results from the discussions that go on between physician and patient.","In a general sort of way, as you can imagine, for patients who have substantial comorbidities and where there is concern about the adverse effect profile of adding chemotherapy, monotherapy is a sensible alternative. For patients who are younger and where comorbidities are not a concern, combination therapy might be the right answer, but it will be a very personalized decision. I guess the important thing to emphasize is that in either case, KEYTRUDA provides the foundation for a therapy either with or without chemotherapy and the data on that becomes stronger and stronger over time.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.","And, Chris, with respect to your broader question, first of all, let me just say that we're pleased that due to the strong execution we've had, KEYTRUDA has the potential to be the largest product Merck has ever had, which is a good thing for Merck, but also for the patients that we can help. But we are and aspire to be much more than just a KEYTRUDA story.","And so, as it relates to business development, as I've always said, it's an important priority for the company. Everything is in scope, in terms of acquisitions, we look at our portfolio to decide what's better in our portfolio, what's better outside our portfolio, but as we move forward, we're going to continue to look for those opportunities to drive and enhance our pipeline, like the deals we've done with Eisai and AZ.","The challenge is obviously \u2013 recently, as we've looked at a number of acquisitions over the past couple years, the competition for assets has been such that often the prices became unreasonable based on the assumptions that we were able to make. But I just want to say again, we have a strong balance sheet, we have the power and the flexibility to do deals at any size and stage and we're going to continue to look for things that can drive long-term value and growth for our company.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Ken. Darla, we'll move on to the next question, please.","Operator","It's from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Just a couple questions, mostly for you, Ken. Congrats again on winning the I-O war with KEYTRUDA which has been phenomenal news for patients, but that has not translated into shareholder value creation as Merck shares have been sort of a chronic underperformer for the past one, three, five years.","So, just as you sort of wind down your period as CEO and I also want you to touch upon succession plans, what are your priorities to unlock shareholder value? You just said you're not going to spin out Animal Health. I believe that would be one very easy way to unlock value, but in the absence of doing that, what are the other plans to unlock value? Investors have been frustrated that there has been less aggressive BD activity. Can you talk more about that?","And then, Rob, you touched upon margin leverage, but will this be primarily just coming from mix or is there an opportunity for absolute cost cuts?","And then, Ken, again, if you could comment on succession plans. Thanks very much.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thank you, Jami, for your questions. So, first of all, of course, we would like to see our stock perform better than it has in recent years, particularly given the fact, as I've said, we have executed, I think, exceptionally well in the I-O space and we also think we've positioned the company for long-term growth and value creation.","As I've said in my opening comments, we actually believe that our revenue growth opportunities are somewhat underappreciated, but moving to, I think, the thrust of your question, we continue to look for opportunities to augment our growth in our pipeline through business development. I won't repeat what I've said before. There are challenges. I think, as you know, across this industry, there are challenges as it relates to finding the right kind of assets to drive our long-term growth, but that is what we expect to do and that's what we intend to do.","As it relates to succession, all I can say is that that's obviously an issue that our board is very, very focused on and that's something that totally in their viewpoint and something that they intend to proceed with. When we have something to announce, we'll let people know, but I'd just assure you that is something that's primary in the board's concerns right now.","Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.","And good morning, Jami. On your question on what's driving operating margin, obviously, given the strong revenue growth we expect between now and 2021 as well as more broadly through 2025, along with our product mix shifting to a more specialty focus, we do anticipate operating margin expansion as we move forward. I would point out that if you look back over the last few years, we've actually done aggressive reductions mainly in our SG&A spend.","If you recall, we went through over $2.5 billion cost-cutting exercise from 2013 to 2015. That allowed us to drive EPS growth during that period, while we were seeing the revenue decline and importantly build out an oncology franchise from scratch and invest in R&D. So, as we look forward, we really are more focused on how do we drive leverage by being productive in seeing our expenses grow to the rates slower than sales with the focus in SG&A of continuing to show discipline in allocation to our areas of growth.","I do think there's opportunity to see SG&A as a percentage of sales continue to improve. I'd point out at 24.9%, we're already pretty much near the best-in-class within our space and that's what's allowed us to fund R&D. So, there is some opportunity there, but this is much more about how do you manage the growth of spend in a disciplined way at a rate smaller than sales long-term to take advantage of product mix through revenue growth to drive operating margin, not cost-cutting initiatives.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Rob. We'll move on to the next question, please, Darla.","Operator","It's from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions. So, one, I know there's been a lot of focus on lung cancer market and, obviously, the data you presented there. Just maybe, I guess, this is for Adam, just some thoughts on the commercial impact you think that might have on the use of KEYTRUDA in other indications and could there be the sort of halo effect that some of us have been talking about in terms of just driving KEYTRUDA to be the sort of preferred PD-1 across a whole range of indications?","And then, my second question is more for Roger I guess. With the IDO news that you mentioned, I'm just wondering how that changes, how you think about advancing mechanisms. As you think about combinations, does it make more of an emphasis on finding monotherapy activity from agents before you move them into combinations or just any sort of thoughts, you have so many different combinations that you're working on, how do you think about prioritizing ones that maybe more likely to succeed than others? Thanks so much.","Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Hi, Vamil. This is Adam. Thanks for the question. And I'll start with the U.S. In the U.S., we're already seeing growth across all indications. We're seeing a particularly strong uptake in first-line lung, but we're also encouraged by the recent launches, so there's a strong launch in bladder, we're already number one. Head and neck is continuing to perform very, very well. We see good traction in MSI-high with increased testing. And when you look at the clinical program that Roger talked about, I think we will be a leader in many indications as you move forward. And I do think that there becomes a halo impact as you see the efficacy data across multiple indications where KEYTRUDA really does become foundational in cancer care.","International markets are seeing not only increase in melanoma, but lung is now driving significant revenue, particularly in the larger European markets and I also believe that there would be a halo over time as we continue to get more and more data moving forward.","The last thing I'd say is that the key opinion leader and the physician feedback on KEYNOTE-189 coming out of the Meeting is just remarkable and we're hearing it in all markets around the world. We're hearing it in community-based physicians as well as in the key opinion leader landscape and I do think that there is a very positive mindset coming out of the AACR Meeting.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Right. And, Vamil, with respect to other, I think what you meant is immunological mechanisms for combinations, first of all, I think we should say that with respect to IDO-1, the thing that was most attractive about it was its safety and tolerability profile and in single-arm studies, it looked as if responses were broader and deeper. With that favorable tolerability profile, there was reason to want to advance it.","Sure, we'd love to see combinations with agents that have profound single-agent efficacy. There are some that one can employ in that regard. I think that we do need to look much more carefully at the data from the epacadostat study and understand in more detail exactly what was seen there.","We have, as has been announced by our colleagues at Incyte, scaled back the epacadostat combination program, but are continuing some Phase II studies now in lung cancer and we'll look at these data from an immunologic perspective and try and understand exactly what happened there. There are many other programs involving, for example, toll-like receptor agonists, our STING program, our RIG-I program, oncolytic viruses. Some of those, for example, in the combination with TVEC, have already demonstrated combined responses. So, there's reason for optimism that we will find the right combinations, but it's clearly going to require quite a lot of clinical experimentation.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Roger. Next question, please.","Operator","It's from Tim Anderson with Bernstein.","Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. I'd like to press you again on M&A, because I have kind of been confused what the message is. Merck has talked about not doing transformative deals, which I think really speaks to big pharma tie-ups and how that doesn't create value. At AACR, Roger talked about deals not really \u2013 deal focus not really being revenue-based, yet today, you mentioned your balance sheet is strong, you kind of suggest you're looking at everything. You claim that asset prices are high. I don't think that's really true when you look at big biopharma names.","And so, my question is this, can you really rule out that it's not realistic that Merck is looking at a big biopharma name? It'd be great if you could just kind of narrow down what it is you're willing to consider versus not. I understand nothing transformative, but that still leaves open a very broad bandwidth of target companies potentially.","Second question is on KEYNOTE-042. I know results haven't been released. Can you say, at least directionally, whether you saw a meaningful benefit on efficacy in low expressors such as the 1% to 20% segment, I think that was one of your cut offs or could the benefit in the ITT group really have been driven by primarily the high expressors?","Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Tim. Let me just start by saying what I said earlier which is that when we look at the possibilities, we try not to restrict our scope in terms of what we look at. What I've said before and I will say again is that a large, what some people would call, transformational deal is not our preference. It is not consistent with our strategy.","What we are trying to do is to enhance our pipeline with those kinds of deals, collaborations, acquisitions, whatever they may be, that actually enhances the pipeline long-term. I also would say that we are not looking to do deals solely for revenue.","At the same time, if we're able to do deals that enhance our pipeline \u2013 and again, we're looking at all kinds of deals in terms of size and scope, if we're able to enhance our pipeline and at the same time increase revenue, that will be something that we would be very interested in doing. And indeed, I think, that characterizes the Eisai and the AstraZeneca deals, because in both those cases, we have immediate revenues as well as access to what we think are good scientific opportunities.","So, I'll just say again, we continue to look for good opportunities across all acquisitions, partnerships, collaborations and licensing.","And on your point about pricing in the marketplace, what I was referring to is in the past, we have looked at assets that, based on the competition, got too expensive for our assumptions. I was not making a general comment about the valuations in today's marketplace.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Right. And, Tim, on KEYNOTE-042, what we announced was \u2013 remember, this study was designed to look at a population of cancer patients who had PD-L1 scores at baseline of 1% or greater. For reasons having to do with appropriate statistical analysis, the analysis looked first at the population that had greater than 50% and then stepped down ultimately to the total population and we announced that it met the endpoints of overall survival in those analyses.","Really not going to be able to give you a lot more detail on that study, more color and shading, because we will be presenting that study at ASCO in June, so very soon, and you'll have a chance to see the totality of the data there.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Roger. We'll move on to the next question, please.","Operator","It's from Steve Scala with Cowen.","Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks. A couple questions. First, Ken, you mentioned with more intensity than in the past that Merck revenue prospects are underappreciated. Consensus looks for a 3% compound revenue growth through 2022. Are you saying that revenue growth will be more like mid-single digit, if not higher, through 2022 and beyond? And if that's the case, then you probably don't need to do M&A.","And then, one for Adam on GARDASIL. Can you give us a sense of GARDASIL's potential in China? For instance, can China double the current GARDASIL sales base from $2.5 billion to $5 billion alone? Thank you.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.","Okay. Steve, with respect to your first question, I'm not going to be specific about numbers and I'm not giving long-term guidance. What I can say is that we look at our portfolio, we look at the growth that's possible, for example, in oncology and we are very confident about our ability to grow the company in the near- to long-term based on our key pillars, as I said before, oncology, vaccines, Animal Health and Hospital\/Specialty.","So, we are very confident in our ability to drive that growth and I can't be more specific in terms of specific guidance.","Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.","And then \u2013 hi, Steve, this is Adam. GARDASIL continues to perform very well in many markets around the world and we see it as a continuing growth driver for us as we move forward.","I mentioned in my script that outside the U.S., we saw significant growth in this quarter and that was partially driven by the performance in China. There's no doubt that China represents a strong opportunity for GARDASIL moving forward. We're just in the initial launches in China. We're off to a very strong start, but we're going to have to really wait to see a period of time to understand if that demand will continue over time. So, I believe that represents a very good opportunity for us, but the magnitude of which we're not going to talk about today, we have to give it more time.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Let's move on the next question, please.","Operator","It's from the line of Andrew Baum with Citi.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Morning. Couple of questions, please. First to Ken and Adam. The FDA and the HHS have made clear that they want to see commercial success for biosimilars. I note on the PBM side, many PBMs, including Express today, have voluntarily adopted to adopt pass-through of rebates to patients. The question on the biosimilars' side is do you think shareholders will voluntarily adopt the biosimilars' first strategy before anything gets mandated by CMS through the legislative or regulatory pathway?","And then, second, Merck has been a pioneer of tissue-agnostic approvals with KEYTRUDA in MSI. Given the reimbursement of next-generation sequencing on the Medicare as of the beginning of this year, I'm somewhat surprised Merck isn't exploring a trial of KEYTRUDA in patients with germline DNA damage repair, given the stats. Do you have a trial ongoing? Do you have one planned? Given the size of the market, isn't that an obvious area of interest for you? Thank you.","Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Yeah. So, hi, Andrew. This is Adam. And I'll start with biosimilars and I'll be focused on the U.S. market. I think that there will continue to be a significant potential market for biosimilars in the U.S. and I do think that there's a lot of energy to ensure that cost savings can occur by the appropriate utilization of biosimilars. Whether it's through regulatory environment or payers that \u2013 who are volunteering to try to use biosimilars first, I do believe that there will continue to be an increase in their utilization.","At the same time, I think that you'll continue to see price pressure and you'll see the free market work the way in which it's supposed to work. So, the parent compounds or the originators might come down in price in order to compete with the biosimilars. I think at the end of the day what payers are looking to do is to reduce cost by the appropriate utilization of the biologic products. So, I do believe you'll see continued pressure for increased use of biosimilars.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","And, Andrew, it's Roger. We are very interested in the question of what exactly is driving appropriate anti-tumor responses in KEYTRUDA-treated patients and have done a lot of work on DNA sequence substitutions as part of that. The story is more complex than, of course, all of us would like it to be. We have a quite large study in press describing the relationships among these things.","The answer, of course, is that we believe the DNA damage repair does contribute to response in this to KEYTRUDA and that's one of the reasons, of course, that we've been especially interested in the combination with Lynparza. Our colleagues at AstraZeneca have done quite a lot of work on DNA damage repair and the combination of the two is a likely mechanism for exploiting further the ability of KEYTRUDA to illicit profound anti-tumor responses and improve overall survival. So, we're deeply involved in this. We're looking at it from a number of perspectives. It's a complicated story and we'll have a lot more to say about it in the next few months.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Great. We'll move on to the next question, please.","Operator","It's from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Adam or Roger, on first-line lung in the U.S., you touched on this, but I want to get a better sense from you as to who the incremental prescriber is or what overall share you think could now be in play based on the full KEYNOTE-189 dataset. I'm assuming that low expressors could be the biggest opportunity.","And then on \u2013 Ken, another strategic question for you, you mentioned Animal Health diversifying the model and concentration risk. Investors have long been worried about the LOE from diabetes and how much of a strategic priority is filling this gap over the long-term? Thank you.","Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Yes. Hi, Geoff. This is Adam. And as I mentioned before, the key opinion leader and even the community-based, there's an excitement on the KEYNOTE-189 data is very strong. As I mentioned in the past, I think we did a very good job with penetrating the greater-than-50% PD-L1 marketplace previously and a lot of that was the monotherapy use.","Where we weren't as successful, it was in the patients with 1 to 49 or the patients below 1. And what we're hearing is now that we've shown the overall survival data in all of those segments that there will be increased utilization of the combination therapy for those segments and I think that there's a lot of runway to go into those two segments.","Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.","And, Geoff, this is Rob. I'll answer the question about filling the gap related to JANUVIA, JANUMET. As Ken mentioned in his prepared comments, we are feeling very confident in the growth potential we have. And if you look at some of the recent deals we've done, we are focused on filling that gap. And I believe doing deals like the Lenvima deal with Eisai, doing the deal with AstraZeneca for Lynparza, as well as you look at assets we have in our pipeline like our PCV V114 asset for pneumococcal pneumonia, all of these are starting to fill that gap.","So, we are focused on it and we think we're making progress. There's more to do and that's why business development continues to be a focus, but I think if you look at where we are today on revenue going forward, given these new assets and the increasing confidence we have in them, we're making progress.","And Animal Health is also an important part of that. It continues to perform extremely well. It is a diversification. I think people don't give credit for the Animal Health business for what it is. It's an annuity stream and it carries a risk profile very different than the pharma business and, as a result, gives us both diversification and good growth at rates above both Merck and the Animal Health industry. So, in that sense, it also should help to fill that gap. So, we're focused on that, we're making progress, more to come.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Rob. We'll move on to the next question, please, Darla.","Operator","It's from Jason Gerberry, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jason M. Gerberry - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Just first question, just wanted clarification. I thought I heard you say KEYNOTE-407 would be presented at ASCO, but we didn't see it in the titles or the study hasn't been top-lined. So, Roger, could you just provide some clarification there?","And then on your 15 valent vaccine that you initiated Phase 3 studies on, just wondering if you guys can comment a little bit on how you see the products competitively positioned relative to Prevnar. Is it basically roughly about 15% (54:43) coverage with no additional negative trade-offs? Is that sort of the ultimate value proposition if that study is successful? Thanks.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Jason, it's Roger. KEYNOTE-407, it was actually \u2013 the title was in the abstract publication and it will be presented at ASCO. So, those data will \u2013 people will have a chance to see them. It wasn't specifically named, but the title was there with respect to squamous and lung cancer.","And regarding V114, the serology data, which we had a chance to present in Melbourne just recently, are really very, very strong for the V114 vaccine. And it provides the opportunity to both strengthen the response to serotypes covered by other pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, but also to add additional stereotypes which will be important in terms of preventing invasive pneumococcal disease.","So, we see opportunities there in both areas and we anticipate that assuming that we can get those same kinds of results in the Phase 3 studies, then we'll have a very attractive profile.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks. We're going to try to squeeze one more question in here.","Operator","It's from Alex Arfaei with BMO.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking the questions. A few quick ones, if I may. Rob, on your tax rate, we're seeing notably lower tax rate from some of your peers. I'm just wondering if there's a further opportunity for lowering your rate as well.","Roger, you're obviously showing a very strong execution, R&D execution with KEYTRUDA, but there seems to be a notable difference in your R&D productivity with KEYTRUDA and the rest of the pipeline. I'm just wondering if you have a comment on that please and if there's any additional steps being taken to close that apparent gap.","And then, finally, Adam, not sure if I missed it, but could you please provide estimated KEYTRUDA sales by different indications? Thank you.","Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.","Good morning. This is Rob. I'll answer your question about the tax rate. So, if you look at where we are, we are guiding for 19% to 20% for this year. As we indicated on our fourth quarter call, we do expect \u2013 as we move into 2019, there is the opportunity for us to see a further reduction in our tax rate of up to 1 percentage point. So, you will see our tax rate improve as we move forward from 2018 into 2019.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","And, Alex, I guess you and I might have to agree to disagree on the issue of the rest of the pipeline. I thought you were going to say the pipeline execution outside KEYTRUDA is even stronger. If you look at things like the registration for PREVYMIS, which is an extraordinary drug in CMV, it is already being adopted as the standard in hematologic transplant and the solid organ transplant work is going along.","Look at the work that was done in the development of BRIDION. Look at the work that's being done in the totality of infectious disease programs. I guess I would say I feel really good about the way in which the clinical development organization is prosecuting these the way in which our regulatory affairs organization is gaining registration for these molecules and with the balance of new molecules that are coming out of the pipeline, including 20 in the immuno-oncology area alone. So, I'm actually feeling pretty good about it. And let's talk.","Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.","And then, with regard to utilization of KEYTRUDA by indication, I'll start with the U.S. Based on the latest data we have, and these are rough estimates, we think about 60% is in lung, 15% in melanoma, about 5% in head and neck, about 5% in bladder and about 15% in other indications. Outside the U.S., metastatic melanoma and lung is where the majority of utilization is. What we're already seeing in some of the large European markets is that lung is becoming the largest indication.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.","Okay. So, thank you all for participating in today's call. I want to reiterate again that we're starting 2018 with strong momentum. And as I mentioned at the beginning, I am confident about our near and long-term trajectory. That confidence doesn't provide any basis for us not to continue to look to BD to augment our pipeline, but we are confident in the near and long-term trajectory of the business.","And I thank you for being on the call today and I hope you have a good day.","Operator","This concludes Merck's first quarter 2018 sales and earnings conference call.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Peter Dannenbaum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Peter Dannenbaum","Thank you, Jerome and good morning. Welcome to Merck's Third Quarter 2019 Conference Call. Today, I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Labs, who will each have prepared remarks. In addition, I'm also joined by Mike Nally, our Chief Marketing Officer; and Frank Clyburn, our Chief Commercial Officer, who will be available for the Q&A portion of the call.","Before I turn the call over to Ken, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. You should know that, we've excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation in our press release. We have also provided a table in our press release to help you understand the sales in the quarter for the business units and products.","I'd like to remind you that some of the statements that we make during today's call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.

Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements. You can see our SEC filings as well as today's earnings release on merck.com. We have also posted a presentation to the Investors section of merck.com, which includes some of the highlights from our results.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken.","Ken Frazier","Thank you, Peter. Good morning and thank you all for joining the call. We're extremely pleased by the performance of our business this year. Execution both in the Merck Research Labs and in our commercial operations has been exceptional and Merck again achieved one of its best quarters in many years. This success reinforces our belief that our science-led approach and the significant focus and resources we are putting into innovation is the right strategy and the best path towards delivering meaningful and sustained value to our patients and shareholders.","As we highlighted at our Investor Day in June, we have good visibility into the growth of our derisked portfolio of innovative products over the next five years. We are also confident that the investments we are making now in cutting-edge science focused on areas of significant unmet medical need from discovery through late-stage clinical development, will help us deliver breakthroughs over the next decade and beyond.","Notwithstanding the strong momentum we are seeing in our business, we will continue to prioritize business development aimed at supplementing our portfolio and strengthening our pipeline, and we are very happy with additions of Antelliq, Peloton, Immune Design and Tilos this year. We are realizing the benefits of focusing on our key growth drivers and are now operating from a position of strength.","With that said, we're also mindful of the changing industry landscape. At Investor Day, Rob spoke about our efforts to best position Merck for the future by becoming a more focused innovation-driven company. In order to realize this vision we are evolving our operating model, driving productivity across our operations and looking for ways to optimize our human health portfolio all in an effort to create sustainable growth.","With that, I'll now pass it over to my colleague Rob to review the details of our quarterly performance.","Rob Davis","Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. As Ken stated, the strong results we achieved across our clinical and commercial operations this quarter highlight the successful execution of our strategy to drive sustained revenue growth through innovation. As such, we remain committed to continuing to fully invest in our pipeline, while also delivering meaningful operating margin expansion over time through disciplined resource allocation and improved operating efficiencies.","Now, turning to our results. Total company revenues were $12.4 billion, an increase of 15% year-over-year, or 16% excluding the negative impact from foreign currency. Both our human health and Animal Health divisions contributed to the growth this quarter. The remainder of my comments pertaining to sales will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our human health revenues grew 16% led by key products in our oncology vaccines and hospital businesses.","In oncology, KEYTRUDA sales increased 64% year-over-year and for the first time exceeded $3 billion in a quarter. In the U.S growth was driven by strong demand across all indications. In squamous and non-squamous first-line lung KEYTRUDA continues to penetrate all eligible patient populations, including low and non-PD-L1 expressors. The survival benefits demonstrated across our four first-line lung cancer trials, have firmly established KEYTRUDA as the standard of care in these settings.","We are also encouraged by our recent launches in new indications. In advanced first-line renal cell carcinoma, we are seeing strong uptake across all three patient risk groups for which we are indicated. And in adjuvant melanoma, the positive momentum continues since our approval earlier this year. We're early in the launch of KEYTRUDA monotherapy and in combination with chemo and first-line head and neck cancer and we've received positive feedback from both scientific leaders and the prescribing community.","Outside the United States, KEYTRUDA sales grew 75%, driven by lung globally. In the Europe and the EU, we recently received additional reimbursements for KEYNOTE-189 and we look forward to bringing KEYTRUDA to more patients in those markets. In Japan, we're seeing strong usage across all PD-L1 patient subgroups in lung and we continue to grow our share in bladder cancer. And in China, first-line lung is the primary driver of growth and we are excited by the recent approval based off of KEYNOTE-042.","Our results also reflect continued strength for both Lynparza and Lenvima, important products from our collaborations with AstraZeneca and Eisai respectively. In fact, our revenue from both products more than doubled in the third quarter. Lynparza growth reflects further uptake in ovarian cancer based on results of SOLO-1 in the United States, as well as strength in Europe, China and Japan.","In the United States, Lynparza has over 60% total patient share in the PARP inhibitor class. This leadership sets us up well as we look to broaden the use of Lynparza across additional indications in the future. Launches in hepatocellular carcinoma particularly in the United States, China and Japan, continue to drive increased use of Lenvima. Also, we are early in the launch of the first approved combination of Lenvima and KEYTRUDA to treat certain patients with endometrial carcinoma and we expect more approvals in the future.","Turning to vaccines. Our vaccines business reflects continued growth in our pediatric portfolio as well as strength in GARDASIL, which is primarily due to growth outside of the United States. The timing of public sector purchases negatively impacted our U.S. revenue in the third quarter. Our hospital business benefited from 32% growth in BRIDION, reflecting strong performance in the United States due to increased share within the reversal market.","Animal Health revenue increased 12% this quarter to $1.1 billion. Livestock grew 12% due to the contributions from the products acquired in the Antelliq acquisition. Companion animal sales also grew 12%, driven by our BRAVECTO line of products, partially due to the timing of purchases last year.","Turning to the rest of our P&L, my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 75.9% in the quarter, a decrease of 80 basis points year-over-year, driven by unfavorable manufacturing variances. Operating expenses of $4.8 billion increased 6% year-over-year. Higher administrative and promotional expenses for our growth pillars drove higher SG&A costs in the quarter, while higher clinical development spend and costs associated with our discovery efforts, drove higher R&D expense.","Other income and expense was unfavorably impacted by lower income in our equity securities portfolio as well as higher net interest expense. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.7%, driven by a lower assumed full year effective tax rate as a result of favorable earnings mix. This represents a decrease of 320 basis points year-over-year. Taken together, we earned $1.51 per share, an increase of 27% excluding exchange.","Now, turning to our outlook for the year. We are narrowing and raising both our revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance ranges for the full year of 2019. We now expect revenues of $46.5 billion to $47 billion, which represents a 10% to 11% growth versus 2018. This includes the impact of the GARDASIL CDC stockpile borrowing, which will negatively impact our fourth quarter revenue by approximately $120 million.","Our updated revenue range assumes a negative impact from foreign exchange of roughly two percentage points using mid-October rates. We are lowering our non-GAAP expected tax rate to roughly 17.5% for the year. Our revised non-GAAP EPS range is now $5.12 to $5.17, which represents growth of approximately 18% to 19% versus 2018, including a roughly one percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange. All other elements of our guidance provided in July remain unchanged.","Before I conclude, I'd like to take a moment to put our 2019 results into context. Our expected top and bottom line growth rates for the full year are exceptional. While we continue to expect strong revenue and EPS growth in 2020, there are a few things, I'd like you to keep in mind as you think about your models. First, we expect increased pricing pressure in 2020. Second, demand for GARDASIL continues to outpace supply and we expect tempered growth rates for the product versus what we reported over the last couple of years. And third, as you'll recall, we expect to face elevated pressure mainly on Noxafil and NuvaRing.","That being said, we remain very confident in our business. We continue to expect strong revenue growth each year through and including 2023, a year where we still believe our revenue prospects are underappreciated.","In summary, our third quarter results and updated guidance are another proof point of the confidence we have in our business and our strategy. More importantly, our innovation-led approach continues to positively impact the patients we serve. As such we will continue to invest in research and development, which we believe will be the source of significant and sustainable value for both patients and shareholders.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Roger.","Roger Perlmutter","Thanks, Rob. During the third quarter, we advanced important new indications for key products, presented significant new data at scientific meetings and made meaningful progress in building our research portfolio.","Turning first to progress in oncology approval. During the third quarter, received accelerated approval from the U.S. FDA for KEYTRUDA when given in combination with LENVIMA in patients with advanced endometrial cancer whose disease have progressed following prior systemic therapy and whose tumors are not mismatch repair deficient for MSI-High.","This approval marks the first of what we believe will be a large set of opportunities to combine LENVIMA which we're developing in collaboration with our colleagues at Eisai in Japan with KEYTRUDA in the treatment of advanced malignancy, including hepatocellular carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and urothelial cancer.","As noted in our press release, the FDA also accepted our sBLA filing for the use of KEYTRUDA as monotherapy in the treatment of recurrent or metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma that is not curable by surgery or radiation, with a PDUFA date of June 29, 2020.","Separately, we also received European Medicines Agency approval for the combination of KEYTRUDA and Pfizer's Inlyta based on data from our KEYNOTE-426 study. This regimen, as Rob mentioned, is one that has gained substantial traction in the United States.","Meanwhile, in China, full approval of KEYTRUDA for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, whose tumors express PD-L1 on at least 1% of tumor cells based on our KEYNOTE-042 study, was also obtained. We are optimistic that this new indication will provide benefit to the very large number of patients in China, who each year are diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer.","Outside of oncology, the U.S. FDA granted approval for PIFELTRO when combined with other agents and DELSTRIGO as a single-tablet combination in HIV-infected patients who are virologically suppressed and on a stable regimen. This is the so-called switch indication.","We believe that PIFELTRO, our second-generation non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor offers many opportunities for combined regimens including with islatravir, our investigational nucleoside transcriptase and translocation inhibitor.","Also in the infectious disease area, we obtained Phase 3 data in the hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia where RECARBRIO met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority versus the combination of piperacillin and tazobactam.","Together with ZERBAXA, RECARBRIO will offer we believe a full suite of options for the treatment of serious bacterial pneumonias. I'm exceedingly proud of my colleagues in clinical development and in regulatory affairs, whose exemplary performance in 2019 has led to these approvals.","The third quarter also saw the presentation of important new data at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting including the PAOLA-1 trial, demonstrating the activity of Lynparza, which we are developing with colleagues at AstraZeneca, in this case, in combination with bevacizumab for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in patients who had previously responded to platinum-based therapy.","But we also have the PROfound trial in which delayed radiographic progression of malignancy was demonstrated in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, whose tumor cells bear homologous recombination repair gene defects. And we have progressed our next-generation hormonal ablation therapy.","Studies incorporating Lynparza have now yielded positive Phase 3 data in four different tumor types: breast, ovarian, pancreatic and prostate. Phase 2 trials encourage the view that the addition of KEYTRUDA to Lynparza therapy could prove advantageous, especially in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Phase 3 trials exploring this hypothesis are currently under way.","Also at the European Society for Medical Oncology meetings, data from our KEYNOTE-522 study of KEYTRUDA as neoadjuvant therapy for triple-negative breast cancer demonstrated a statistically significant increase in pathologic complete response rate, confirming what we have seen previously in the Phase II I-SPY 2 trial.","These data, coupled with additional results from the adjuvant portion of KEYNOTE-522 which demonstrated a trend favoring KEYTRUDA administration on event-free survival, auger well for future outcome measurements in this ongoing Phase 2 trial.","Time does not permit me to highlight the many advances that have been made in earlier segments of the pipeline where critical work is being done. However, I wish to note that as the third quarter came to a close we celebrated the opening of our new discovery research facility in South San Francisco, where we expect over a period of time to accelerate the translation of fundamental breakthroughs in biologic understanding into therapies that improve and extend lives around the world.","In this context, I cannot fail to mention that The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency has recently adopted a positive opinion for V920, our experimental vaccine designed to prevent transmission of the Zaire strain of Ebola virus.","As all of you are aware, V920 has been thoughtfully deployed to help slow the spread of a recent outbreak of Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Our teams have shipped nearly 0.25 million doses of V920 with colleagues in the World Health Organization and other agencies, health care workers who are performing heroic work in very dangerous environments by immunizing those at highest risk for exposure to this deadly virus. They and we believe that approval of the V920 vaccine will ultimately permit routine use of this important tool to prevent outbreaks of Ebola virus infection, wherever and whenever it is needed.","We will now take your questions.","Peter Dannenbaum","Jerome, can you line up the queue please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Ken Frazier","Good morning, David.","David Risinger","Great. Thank you very much. Good morning. So, obviously, the results were very impressive. Congrats on the quarter. My questions are first, could you just talk a little bit \u2013 excuse me, about what inning Merck is in with respect to 189 adoption in Europe? My understanding is that you haven't booked any 189 sales in certain countries yet in the third quarter, but I just don't know how you would characterize the adoption of 189 in Europe to-date.","And then second, Roger, could you please discuss the market opportunities and timing for KEYNOTE-604 in small cell lung cancer and KEYNOTE-355 in triple-negative breast cancer? Thanks very much.","Peter Dannenbaum","Frank, do you want to start off?","Frank Clyburn","Sure. Good morning, David. With regards to Europe in 189, we received reimbursement in Germany in mid-Europe. That was approximately last year. It's almost been a year when we had launched in Germany and got reimbursement. We now are very pleased that we have reimbursement in all of the major European markets.","Spain just came onboard with reimbursement this past quarter, and we now have added Italy for reimbursement, which is just taking place this month as well as France. So we are in early innings in some of the markets with regards to 189. As I mentioned, Germany and mid-Europe we've had that product in combination reimbursed now for a while.","Peter Dannenbaum","And Roger?","Roger Perlmutter","Right. David, look clearly the major opportunity in lung cancer is in non-small cell lung cancer. But small cell lung cancer is important as well and so we are encouraged to think the breadth of activity of KEYTRUDA are ambiguous and we're encouraged to believe that there will be meaningful opportunity in small cell lung cancer as well based on the 604 trial.","For triple-negative breast cancer, I mean, again, I would highlight that the KEYNOTE-522 data demonstrate a really quite dramatic improvement in pathologic complete response rate under circumstances where optimal neoadjuvant therapy is given and the trend is really quite impressive.","I mean, there's a 27% roughly improvement in pathologic complete response; the event-free survival data had -- has a ratio of 0.63. That's really quite remarkable. And although we had set an extremely high bar there and didn't meet our statistical test at that point, as I said it, certainly augurs well for what the subsequent outcome measures will look like.","Over time, I think that will really have a big effect on the how triple-negative breast cancer is treated. And those individuals who are not treated with a neoadjuvant kind of regimen KEYNOTE-355 offers a real opportunity. Obviously, we have to wait for the data and we're looking forward to seeing that at some point in the future.","Peter Dannenbaum","Great. Next question, Jerome ","Operator","Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.","Chris Schott","Great. Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. I guess my first question was just on operating margin expansion. I know you had previously moderated some near-term operating margin expectations based on investments you're making, et cetera, but we are seeing strong year-over-year improvement. So can we think about continued strong margin improvements as we look out into 2020 and 2021 assuming solid top line trends? Or is there another step-up of investments we need to be keeping in mind as we think about margins over the next year or two?","My second question was on GARDASIL capacity at this point. I think you noted that growth may moderate in 2020. Can you just give us a bit more color on how much capacity you have left at this point, as we think about just how to kind of quantify that slowdown? And then as a follow-up to that longer-term, can you just give us an update of when we should think about more substantial expansion of GARDASIL capacity? Thank you.","Peter Dannenbaum","Great. Thanks. Rob, you want to start off on margins?","Rob Davis","Yeah. Yeah. Good morning, Chris. To your question about operating margins, I think what you're looking at as you see the results year-to-date in the third quarter of 2019 is really just the power of what happens when you get accelerated revenue growth. And frankly, we've seen revenue growth as you've seen from the way we've been raising guidance for the year is outpacing even our own expectations. So, as a result of that, we have actually seen stronger operating margin improvement in 2019 than we expected.","As we look forward we continue to see increases in operating margin every year, but our view really hasn't changed that as we look at 2020 that is still a year of investment where we do expect to continue to make sure we fully invest behind what is a growing and exciting pipeline of opportunities both in oncology and vaccines and other areas that Roger has touched upon.","And then we really do expect to see operating margin then to be more meaningful as we look in 2021 and beyond as we see the rate of R&D growth slow to rates lower than sales. So, our overall view hasn't changed 2019 is just really exceptional because of the strength we're seeing in the topline.","Peter Dannenbaum","And Frank on GARDASIL capacity?","Frank Clyburn","Sure Chris. And so we are seeing continued strong underlying demand which was highlighted once again for GARDASIL, this quarter growing 27% and significant growth outside the U.S. What we have done and put in place is we are increasing our production from our existing plants.","And as we mentioned on Investor Day, we commissioned the construction of two new bulk GARDASIL manufacturing facilities which we hope to bring online in 2023. So, in 2023, that is when we will expect to be able to ramp our supply up to meet the ex-U.S. demand.","We decided to borrow from the stockpile, as Rob mentioned in his comments, really to support routine vaccinations in the U.S. as well as to free up some manufacturing capacity to make doses for other parts of the world. So, anticipate additional supply coming onboard significantly in 2023. We do believe we can still grow GARDASIL over the next several years as we continue to match and move supply to match our demand around the world.","Peter Dannenbaum","Great. Thank you. Next question Jerome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question.","Tim Anderson","Thank you. A couple of questions. The first is on your tax rate. You mentioned favorable product mix impacting the tax rate guidance for the year and in the quarter. Is KEYTRUDA one of those favorable mix drivers? And specifically is it set up in a tax-advantaged way such that as this product continues to do very well the tax rate for Merck could continue to drift lower beyond where it is in 2019?","Second question is on KEYTRUDA. Data sets starting to roll in showing that CTLA-4 has activity in lung. Data sets like Checkmate-9LA and Poseidon, you have a program in this area. When can we expect Phase 3 data from Merck on KEYTRUDA plus Yervoy in lung?","And then more broadly can you just kind of comment on the market's perception and fears that we've got competitive threats coming to KEYTRUDA in front-line lung from Bristol and Astra and whether that's something that analyst models accurately capture in your view?","Peter Dannenbaum","Thank you, Tim. Rob will start off with the tax rate.","Rob Davis","Yes, good morning Tim. With regard to your question, actually I think the comment I made in the prepared remarks is that it's due to favorable earnings mix. And the reason I'd just clarify that is that both are based on product mix as well as geographic mix. So, it's both and it's more than just what you see with KEYTRUDA, although KEYTRUDA is produced in a tax-favored jurisdiction. So, we do get benefit from seeing growth in KEYTRUDA, but it's not the only thing driving it.","I would highlight as you look at this year's tax rate and just to remind you that in the first quarter, we did have some discrete items that drove our rates a couple of points lower. So, we are benefiting from that as well.","And as we look forward into 2020 we have not finalized our plans so I'll only give official guidance. But I would just make sure you kind of keep that view in your mind as you balance your thinking around positive trend forward relative to where we are and where we've been.","Peter Dannenbaum","And Roger on CTLA-4 and maybe to Frank on the competitive dynamics.","Roger Perlmutter","Yes. So, of course, we do expect that over time there will be many, many different programs that will try and address non-small cell lung cancer and it's important that that happen. I should point out that the set of studies that we have already performed provide an enormously strong foundation for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.","When you look at monotherapy the 024 data and PD-L1 greater than 50%, that's an extremely strong data set, similarly with KEYNOTE-189 similarly with 407. So, the platform is enormously strong and that's what you see reflected in the market.","I think all of us are eager to understand whether anything else could be added to KEYTRUDA. But thus far we don't have any data that really support that. Our own study, our 598 study with KEYTRUDA and ipilimumab will provide, we hope, definitive information on whether the addition of ipilimumab CTLA-4-directed monoclonal antibody actually improves results as compared to what is seen with KEYTRUDA alone.","Now, thus far it's kind of a mixed bag from what we can see. Of course we don't have the data to really look at with respect to 9LA or Poseidon. And so we'll have a chance to look at those data and on the basis of that to make a judgment about benefit, risk profile and how best to treat these patients. Frank?","Frank Clyburn","And what I'll add is that in the marketplace right now and I'll separate a couple of things in the U.S., we have established KEYTRUDA very strongly as a standard of care in first-line non-small cell lung cancer. Approximately eight out of every 10 eligible patients are receiving a KEYTRUDA regimen either a monotherapy or in combination.","And what we're hearing from both the academic community or academic physicians I should say and the community physicians is that they really believe KEYTRUDA now has established itself as a standard of care in lung.","I think also importantly, we have to note that there's significant real world experience based on our first-mover advantage with KEYTRUDA in lung. So while we know, it'll be eventually competitive in this space, we feel very confident on our position.","If I look outside the U.S., I think it's important to note not only the significant regulatory approvals we received, but also the HTA reimbursements we now have. And that takes time. And it also is important to note that HTA bodies really do look at the magnitude of the effect of the data that you're bringing compared to other standards of care and we have done extremely well from a reimbursement perspective and positioned-well as I mentioned in Europe.","China we also are very well-positioned with our first-mover advantage in lung based off of 189 and KEYNOTE-042 now in monotherapy. And also we're very well established in Japan.","So as I look around the world, I feel very confident about our overall lung position. Clearly as Roger mentioned we'll have to wait and see some of the additional data sets. But going forward, we're very confident in our ability to continue to grow KEYTRUDA and continue to grow in lung cancer.","Peter Dannenbaum","Great. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim. You may ask your question.","Seamus Fernandez","Great. Thanks for the question. So I was hoping, Roger might be able to give us some thoughts on data that were presented at ESMO in combination with an antibody drug conjugate in bladder cancer. Specifically, Roger I'd just love to get your thoughts on how you think about ADC technology at this point in time? And just, sort of, your broader thoughts on the ability of ADCs, which historically have been a little bit difficult to manage as linkers have improved, as data has improved along those lines? Just wondering what your thoughts are on the -- how validated ADC technology is? I know it's not an area where Merck has an obvious presence. So just wondering what other work might be -- Merck might be doing there.","And then a second question, Rob as we see the numbers continue to expand, I have to imagine that the cash on the balance sheet that continues to accumulate, it needs to have some thoughts around capital deployment. Can you just give us your thoughts on where Merck is most focused in terms of deploying that building cash forward in the context of the concentration that we're starting to see increasing in KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL going forward? And we've certainly had a very narrow conversation around Merck and the future of Merck on the call so far today. Thanks.","Peter Dannenbaum","Roger take ADCs.","Roger Perlmutter","Seamus, so with respect to ADC technology, well as you point out there's a long history here on the attempt to couple toxins to anybodies with the idea in mind that one could selectively deliver toxins to tumor cells goes back nearly 50 years to work, for example, done at Texas Southwestern by Jonathan Noah [ph] and Alan Butetah [ph] over a period of decades now, refinements have taken place first with the substitution of more selective monoclonal antibodies, a better linker technology. As you point out initially, hydrolyzable and non-hydrolyzable and back. And the choice of toxins, it started out with ricin and then more convention toxins -- more conventional toxins were used.","And I think we're beginning to see some evidence of selectivity. I think there are a few points to make. First, it's worth keeping in mind that when you're administering this toxin conjugate, there still is a pretty significant body burden of toxin. And so the benefit, risk profile has to be examined very carefully in such setting. And second is that what we've learned over time is that the choice of the antibody target really matters a lot. And finding selective tumor targets is extremely important.","With that as background, I would say that the data that we obtained in collaboration with our colleagues at Seattle genetics using the EV, I'll abbreviate it that way toxin conjugate that they've developed, really were very impressive. They have monotherapy results, which they presented in a combination with KEYTRUDA looked really quite impressive on a first pass, which certainly is intriguing. And we're looking at all of those kinds of things and asking ourselves are those areas where additional leverage can be made and gained in combination with KEYTRUDA?","Rob Davis","Thanks Seamus. To the question on cash flow, you are correct that the business is doing quite a nice job of generating cash flow really which is testament to the overall strength we can see in the business. As you look at our capital allocation as you're going forward, it's really unchanged.","First and foremost, we will continue to fund the operations. As you know we continue to invest meaningfully within our growing R&D portfolio of opportunities. We are investing meaningfully in capacity expansion to address the growth we see in our vaccines business oncology business and our Animal Health business. And so we will continue to do that.","Beyond that we are still very committed to our dividend. But as you look at the excess cash flow beyond that, our goal continues to be to invest in business development, I would point out to your one comment about the call being narrowly focused on KEYTRUDA. I do think it's important that people continue to realize while KEYTRUDA is truly a foundational product, we are a lot more than just KEYTRUDA.","We have growing excitement about the broader oncology pipeline we have with Lynparza Lenvima the over 20 mechanisms we have in development that Roger has talked about in the past.","Our vaccines portfolio continues to grow very nicely. I think overall vaccines grew 18% in the quarter. And you saw obviously good growth with GARDASIL our pediatric vaccines. I mean, we have a great pipeline with CMV, dengue, RSV. A lot of excitement around our HIV portfolio we have that Rogers touched upon in his prepared comments and broader in our antibiotic space and then obviously Animal Health.","So we have a lot internally just to be excited about. But with that said, we are looking to continue to augment that through business development. And that's our hope to deploy the cash flow we'll generate to that. And then obviously to the extent we have any cash left over after those efforts we will return it to shareholders. So that is our strategy and pretty consistent with where we've been.","Peter Dannenbaum","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Daina Graybosch with SVB Leerink. You may ask your question.","Daina Graybosch","Hi, thank you for the question. I have a few on the early-stage setting and how I-O and KEYTRUDA may evolve there. You have several adjuvant studies that have a neoadjuvant component like KEYNOTE-756 and KEYNOTE-7 -- 671 among other. The first question is, do you expect these to release the neoadjuvant results from the interim analysis?","The second question is, what do you think will be required for regulatory approval in neoadjuvant settings in breast cancer triple negative as well as hormone positive and other indications?","And then finally what are your expectations that you do get approval for KEYTRUDA in neoadjuvant settings? Do you think physicians will also use KEYTRUDA in the adjuvant setting? Or will they wait for adjuvant data for that use?","Roger Perlmutter","Well Daina lots of questions there. Let me try and break them out. First of all, we do have a lot of studies in neoadjuvant and those studies are driven by fundamental observations. I think what we've come to recognize is that KEYTRUDA works well in settings where there is a inflammatory response in the tumor.","And tumor cell death however it's caused, whether that's the result of radiotherapy or the result of chemotherapy or potentially even the result of surgical wounds that inflammation that takes place is augmented by the presence of KEYTRUDA which improves responsiveness. And we see that in preclinical models and it's played out in the clinic as well and are -- has driven a lot of our thinking about combination studies.","And so that naturally led us to perform neoadjuvant studies and we began these some time ago. And we're beginning to see results in early stage and even in Phase III studies. And I talked about the KEYNOTE-522 neoadjuvant data in triple-negative breast cancer which of course were built on the I-SPY 2 data we have earlier all of which suggest that neoadjuvant can provide good responses.","You specifically asked though about release of data from interim analyses. And clearly we will release those data as those data are important and that we -- and people need to hear about them. So it's really just a function of the -- what data we get. And generally we tend to see these as important results that we want to present in scientific meetings, so we generally don't provide detailed information in the context of an investor presentation. But we tend to present these in a scientific setting as we did at the European Society meeting in September.","Now the requirements for regulatory approval are the traditional requirements here and that is the agency is going to be interested either in evidence of a favorable benefit\/risk profile in the outcomes of treatment or they're going to want to have a surrogate that they believe is validated with respect to those kinds of endpoints.","And I think that that will be true for the neoadjuvant studies and adjuvant studies as we've seen in the past. And our expectations are as I've indicated that this is going to prove to be an extremely important area which is why we have so many neoadjuvant and adjuvant studies currently under way. We have something on the order of 100 of them altogether in various different settings. So it's really quite an important area for us.","Peter Dannenbaum","Great. We are hoping to get to everyone\u2019s question. So I\u2019d like ask if everyone could limit it to one or two that would be great. Next question please, Jerome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore. You may ask your question.","Umer Raffat","Hi. Thanks so much. Rob, I actually wanted to touch up on operating margin, a little more specifically. And by my math, I'm seeing 37.1% operating margin this quarter, which is materially higher than where consensus is in 2020 and 2021 as well. And my question is, do you expect operating margin to be lower in the next couple of years versus where it stood in 3Q 2019?","And then secondly, maybe different - Animal Health for a second. It seemed like BRAVECTO has been a very strong driver over the last several years. And my question is, how do you expect your reported Animal Health revenues to change now going into next couple of years with Zoetis launching their Trio. And what's your timing of a potential Trio filing? Thank you very much.","Rob Davis","Yes, I appreciate the questions. On the operating margin, I don't want to get into specific guidance. As I said, I think, if you look at this year the growth we had in operating margin is exceptional because of the fact that sales outpaced our expectations and frankly outpaced our spend. So that's really driven by the power of what the revenue line can give. And beyond that I would wait till we get to our 2020 guidance to get more specific as we look forward.","With regard to Animal Health and what we're seeing there so you are correct BRAVECTO has been an important growth driver for that business. We're now actually now also though seeing good growth overall coming from the production side of the business as well. You saw that livestock grew 12% in the quarter driven by the benefits of the Antelliq products we brought into the company as well as good growth in companion animal.","As we look forward, we continue to believe that the Animal Health business will grow at a rate faster than the overall market driven by the innovative products we have both in companion animal as well as across the broader vaccines portfolio and other portfolio of products we have. So our view of the strength of the growth in that business hasn't changed long-term.","As we look at the triple combo that's coming from competitors we actually have some programs in development. We haven't really commented specifically on those, but safe to say, we're aware of that and work is under way in our own portfolio. But I'd bring you back to the benefits we see from our BRAVECTO product. It is the only 12-week oral therapy in the marketplace today and we continue to see that in very good demand and frankly believe that that will be a competitive product even in light of an evolving competitive set through innovation which we will eventually match through our own development efforts.","Peter Dannenbaum","Great. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.","Geoff Meacham","Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks so much for the question. Just have a couple of quick ones. Rob or Frank when you talk about the opportunity in China broadly, can you talk about the pricing strategy at a high level? I'm just trying to understand given the size of the population, the upcoming competitive I-O backdrop when you think about companies in the region?","And the second one is for Roger. I know, 522 questions have already been asked, but I wanted to ask you more broadly. Given the results in triple-negative breast is this an indicator of success in the bigger segments of the market in cold tumors? I know you got to look at each study individually, but I-O activity in cold tumors obviously has thus far been pretty underwhelming. Thank you. ","Peter Dannenbaum","Great, thanks. Frank on China?","Frank Clyburn","Sure. So on China, we feel very pleased and we mentioned this too on Investor Day at our current growth rate. This quarter you see we grew 98% and year-to-date we've seen very strong growth in China. It's really been driven by KEYTRUDA, GARDASIL Lynparza, Lenvima and also Januvia, when it was added to the NRDL in 2017.","With regards to some of the pricing dynamics in China, we do anticipate based off of volume-based pricing and the rollout to additional provinces that there will be some headwinds and pressure on some of our more mature brands in China. As we mentioned even with that we're still very confident because the majority of our portfolio is now pivoted to the innovation side and that is what is going to drive the growth going forward.","As far as NRDL and access we are still working -- we are actually working through the NRDL process right now in China. We'll have to wait and see how all that plays out but we're encouraged about China both today in the self-pay market. And then obviously if we do receive NRDL reimbursement it opens up a significant amount of new patients that we could treat with KEYTRUDA as well as other parts of our portfolio.","Peter Dannenbaum","Great. Roger?","Roger Perlmutter","And Geoff, thanks for the question. I think as you point out the fundamental issue is that while we see terrific results with KEYTRUDA in a substantial fraction of cancer patients that still leaves a substantial fraction -- a very substantial fraction in some tumor settings, who just don't respond and the question is why. And we've published sort of data in which we presented 2-axis plot of inflammatory response versus tumor mutational burden, which are related but only weakly. And it is the case that tumors with higher mutational burden, especially very high mutational burden as you see in the MSI population respond extremely well.","The question is that \u2013 that we are asking in a whole variety of studies is how can we take this less responsive tumor populations and make them more recognizable and a better trigger for immune responsiveness that can involve combinations with other agents that can involve interventions that cause mutations to become fixed a whole variety of other things that we're pursuing. Ultimately, that will be an important frontier. We do see KEYTRUDA as a foundation for that treatment. It will be KEYTRUDA plus other things that will enable us to gain access to these less responsive patient populations. But we're hard at work on it.","Peter Dannenbaum","Great. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mara Goldstein with Mizuho. You may ask your question.","Mara Goldstein","Thanks so much for taking our questions. The first one is I recognize that China has had very good growth at 90%-plus this quarter. But I'm just wondering what the thoughts are around economic sensitivity. Should there be some type of projected economic slowdown? And then I want to ask a question on Gefapixant and the endometrial pain study. We noticed in ClinicalTrials.gov that there is a slight lengthening of the estimated completion and I'm wondering, if this is a function of why was this rolled out in that indication?","Peter Dannenbaum","Frank, on China?","Frank Clyburn","Yeah. So on China, what is happening is with regards to the four plus seven pilots so there are pilots that are under way in China that are looking at tendering processes for some of the more mature brands across the industry. Right now, the impact to us has pretty much been Cozaar and SINGULAIR the two products. However, for us as we go forward and as that process, we do anticipate will expand into the 31 provinces over time in China, it really will put some additional pricing pressure on our more mature portfolio as I mentioned. Just to give you a perspective, the reason why we're seeing the significant growth in China is because two-thirds of our portfolio already is in the innovative part of our business.","So those products, we feel very confident will not be a part of the volume-based procurement rollout, which we believe will allow us to continue to grow not only near-term, but also over the next several years and long term in China. And it's really being driven by the innovative portfolio of KEYTRUDA, Lynparza, Lenvima, GARDASIL JANUVIA and some other additional launches that we plan. So, while there'll be headwinds to the older portion of the portfolio, we feel very good that our pivot to innovation has really helped us not only in the near-term but will continue to help us in the long term.","Peter Dannenbaum","Roger on gefapixant.","Roger Perlmutter","On gefapixant, I mean we \u2013 as you indicated Mara, we're pursuing a set of interesting indications with this P2X3 antagonist set, because we think it could turn out to be broadly useful beyond the chronic cough indication where we are in Phase 3. But I wouldn't read anything into the timing of completion of studies. We update ClinicalTrials.gov as we get more information from clinical operations. When we start out particularly in these syndications endometrial pain and other areas where we're not 100% sure about feasibility we make a guess on what we think enrollment rates are going to be in sites. And of course, every study is different because the enrollment criteria are different. And as we prosecute these studies, and we get better estimates of when trials will actually complete we update ClinicalTrials.gov. It's not a tool that helps one resolve specifically what's going on in the marketplace.","Peter Dannenbaum","Great. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Navin Jacob with UBS. You may ask your question.","Navin Jacob","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Two questions. On GARDASIL the U.S. was strong this quarter despite a tough comp from last year. Wondering if that's partly what you're attributing the decline in Q4 to. You're saying Q4 will be down I think $150 million or there'll be a work-down of $150 million. Is that part of just a push out of what was supposed to happen this quarter on a relative basis? Or is there growth this quarter in underlying demand above and beyond I think what any of us expected? And then just maybe a question for Roger. Roger wondering your thoughts on cell therapy some of the new modalities whether it's TILs or APCs as a means for targeting particularly checkpoint inhibitor refractory patients? Thank you very much.","Peter Dannenbaum","Great. Frank, U.S. GARDASIL?","Frank Clyburn","So GARDASIL grew in the U.S. approximately 3% if you exclude -- or excluding FX. Underlying demand growth and price did drive growth, which was partially offset in Q3 by CDC purchasing timing. So we did not see CDC purchases in 3Q as we expected, which is why you saw a 3% growth. The borrowing that we mentioned or that Rob mentioned earlier on in the call will be borrowing that will take place in the fourth quarter of this year which will reduce our fourth quarter sales by approximately $120 million compared to Q4 of 2018.","Peter Dannenbaum","And Roger on cell therapy?","Roger Perlmutter","On cell therapy, we love the data in hematologic malignancy and I think it challenges how to translate into -- that into solid tumors where the tumor-specific antigens are less clear. Obviously, if you're targeting CD19 and you get rid of all the lymphocytes well patients can live with the elimination of all the lymphocytes including of course the malignant ones, but normal ones too. If you're targeting on the other hand antigens which are not sufficiently tumor specific in solid tumors then you potentially do enormous damage to normal structures and that's problematic.","I think there are some things on the horizon, which will improve that and we're watching them carefully. And clearly with the other areas you mentioned tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, so better protocols are evolving. So it's an area of great interest and clearly something that we would want to incorporate as time goes by and things get better.","Peter Dannenbaum","Great. We\u2019re going to try and get it two more questions please. Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. Your may ask your question.","Steve Scala","Thank you. First Roger as a medical doctor, if you were caring for a first-line lung cancer patient where would you prescribe Opdivo plus Yervoy instead of KEYTRUDA plus chemo? And how big is that population? And then one for Frank. PROQUAD had a strong Q3, which followed a strong Q2 which in Q2 you said was attributed in part to buying in the private sector. So how sustainable is the strength we've now seen several quarters in a row? Thank you.","Peter Dannenbaum","Great. Roger?","Roger Perlmutter","Well Steve with respect to first-line non-small cell lung cancer, it is -- looking at the data that we've seen presented in some detail which is the 227 data both in publication and presentation at ESMO, it's difficult to identify the patient population in which a combination of in this case Opdivo and Yervoy would be the right choice. But I think that the argument that has been made by our colleagues at Bristol-Myers is in particular they're looking at those individuals in whom there is less PD-L1 expression.","I think you'd have to look at those data very carefully because of course our data in PD-L1-negative patients in the chemo combo setting is I think really quite strong and the safety profile that we've rollout to a KEYNOTE-189 data and as it's being used in the marketplace is also very good. So I'm just not sure where I see a special niche for the use of a combination of a CTLA-4 antibody. And I'm eager to see our own data as I indicated for the 598 study to actually get a better sense of what ipilimumab, Yervoy will add to KEYTRUDA. And that might help to refine that question a little bit, but I can't really come up with a specific answer to it.","Peter Dannenbaum","And Frank on pediatric vaccines?","Franklin Clyburn","Yes. And so we saw to your point another very strong quarter of 19% growth. In the U.S., the growth was about 12%; ex-U.S. 52%. The growth is being driven in the third quarter by increasing demand. There were some price benefits.","And there is some offset by a buyout that did take place in Q2. We'll expect to see some additional buyout as we get into Q4. But overall the demand for our pediatric vaccines continues to remain strong.","Peter Dannenbaum","Great, and last question please.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Terence Flynn","Great, thanks for taking my question. Maybe two follow-ups, just wondering if you are planning to file for approval of KEYTRUDA, in neoadjuvant, triple-negative breast based on the PCR data from 522 or if you're going to wait for the EFS data.","And then, Rob, you mentioned, pricing pressure in 2020. Can you quantify the impact there relative to what you're seeing in 2019 and any particular areas to call out? Thank you.","Peter Dannenbaum","Great, Roger, on 522?","Roger Perlmutter","On 522, we are -- pulled the data together. And we're having discussions with regulatory agencies. And we'll see exactly how that goes over time. And of course in the meanwhile additional data will accrue. So we'll see where we get to.","Peter Dannenbaum","Frank or Rob?","Rob Davis","Yeah. And on the question of pricing pressure really the context in which I was commenting was just to make sure as we look at what is truly exceptional growth in revenue and earnings, in both the quarter of 2019, third quarter of 2019 as well as what we had guided for the full year.","And as we think about growth going into next year, and as you think about your models to be cognizant of the fact that we do expect to see incremental price pressure over and above, where we have been in 2019. I'm not going to specifically quantify it, but it was really to give you directional thinking as you look at your growth models for next year.","Peter Dannenbaum","Great and Ken?","Ken Frazier","Okay. In closing 2019, is shaping up to be a year of very exciting growth for our company. And we're looking forward with great confidence, in our ability to execute and innovate. We're confident, but we're not complacent.","To the contrary, we're determined to use our strong current position, as an opportunity to take the steps necessary to ensure Merck's continued success long into the future, including pursuing the best avenues for inorganic and organic growth, as well as evolving our operating model to drive productivity across the operations, and look for ways to optimize our human health portfolio, all in an effort to create sustainable growth for the long-term.","Thank you very much. And we look forward to updating you on our progress as we go forward.","Peter Dannenbaum","Great, thank you all very much.","Operator","Thank you.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Teri Loxam. Please go ahead.","Teri Loxam","Thank you Darla and good morning everyone. Welcome to Merck\u2019s fourth quarter 2015 conference call. Today I\u2019m joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; Adam Schechter, President of Global Human Health; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Labs.","Before I turn the call over to Ken, I want to point out a couple of items. First, you will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items. You should note that we\u2019ve excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provided a reconciliation of these items in Table 2 of our press release. We\u2019ve also provided a table to help you understand the sales results in the quarter for the business units and products, which can be found in Table 3 of our press release.","Second, I would like to remind you that some of the statements we make during today\u2019s call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current belief of Merck\u2019s management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.","Our SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2014 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements and you can see our SEC filings as well as today\u2019s earnings release on merck.com.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Ken.","Ken Frazier","Thank you, Teri. Good morning. Thank you all for joining the call today. 2015 was a year of considerable progress and execution for Merck. We continued to focus on the most exciting scientific and commercial opportunities in front of us, advancing our pipeline, securing new product approvals and launching expanded indications for key products.","I\u2019m pleased that our operating performance across our research and commercial organization including vigorous cost management enabled us to exceed our EPS commitment in 2015. Despite strong currency headwinds, we were able to deliver growth in 2015 and we expect to deliver growth again in 2016. In fact, 2016 represents the first year in several years in which Merck\u2019s new product sales growth driven primarily by ZEPATIER, our new hepatitis C product and KEYTRUDA are expected to contribute meaningfully above the impact of the products that are losing exclusivity.","To ensure continued progress, it is imperative that we remain focused on three priorities: First, we must innovate across all aspects of our business that we can pursue and deliver the most products in medical breakthroughs; second, we must execute in our labs and in markets around the world to deliver results by prioritizing resources for the highest growth areas, key markets and customers; and finally, we must adapt our culture and business model to evolve as the world changes around us. Specifically this includes driving the success of our key in line brands including JANUVIA, launching new indicators for KEYTRUDA in more tumor types, and launching ZEPATIER which received approval from the FDA just last week.","We also anticipate several important pipeline catalysts this year, which Roger will discuss in more detail shortly. Augmenting our pipeline with the best scientific and medical innovations also remains a key priority for us. And we are eager to continue to aggressively seek attractive external opportunities that can further bolster our scientific leadership, while complementing the current assets in our pipeline.","In closing, in 2016, we will build upon the strong foundation we established last year. We will continue to invest resources to launch and grow our strongest brands; support the most promising internal assets; enhance our pipeline with the best available external science; and maintain our balanced and differentiated portfolio, all with the goal of delivering long-term growth and shareholder value.","And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to my colleague Rob Davis.","Rob Davis","Thanks Ken and good morning everyone. As Ken referenced, 2015 reflected another solid year of operational performance at Merck. We delivered full year revenues of $39.5 billion, which was in the upper part of our original guidance range, despite a slightly higher than expected foreign exchange impact for the year. In addition, as a result of our continued focus on transforming our business model, we were able to deliver full-year non-GAAP EPS of $3.59, $0.12 higher than the upper end of our original 2015 guidance range.","We also returned over $9 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This strong performance was driven by our continued focus on prioritizing resources to our highest growth areas, and reducing net cost by more than $2.5 billion versus 2012, while investing in key in line brands, including JANUVIA, maximizing launches such as KEYTRUDA, and strategically investing in R&D and business development to drive a pipeline that would deliver long-term results.","Now, let me turn to some specifics for the fourth quarter, and my remarks will focus on our non-GAAP financials. In the fourth quarter, we delivered a leveraged P&L with growth excluding exchange on both the top and bottom line. Total Company revenues were $10.2 billion in the quarter, a decrease of 3% year-over-year, including 7 percentage points of negative impact from foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of exchange, fourth quarter revenues grew 4%. It\u2019s worth mentioning that approximately $110 million of our foreign exchange impact on revenues in the quarter was due to a devaluation of our operations in Venezuela where we began using the Simadi rate in the fourth quarter. Given the current and expected conditions in that market, we anticipate continuing to use the Simadi rate for P&L in 2016.","In addition, the solid results for Global Human Health in the quarter, which Adam will discuss in a few minutes, the animal health business also had a good quarter with sales growing 8%, excluding exchange. Sales of companion animal products led by BRAVECTO as well as swine products accounted for the majority of the growth.","Turning to the other parts of the P&L, non-GAAP gross margin was 74.8% in the quarter, an increase of 20 basis points year-over-year. Full year gross margin increased 150 basis points to 75.4%. Lower discards and foreign exchange drove the overall improvement in margin percent. We continued to manage expenses in Q4 with decreases in both marketing and administrative cost as well as R&D as operational efficiencies more than offset our investments supporting key products and new launches. On a full year basis, we delivered operating expenses in line with our guidance with meaningful savings in marketing and administrative expenses more than offsetting modest increases in R&D.","Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.4%, resulting in a full year tax rate of 21.7%. The quarterly and full year rates reflect the benefit from the renewal of the R&D tax credit. Taken together, we earned $0.93 per share on a non-GAAP basis in the fourth quarter, delivering 13% growth excluding exchange on the bottom line and significant P&L leverage.","Now, let\u2019s turn to guidance and our outlook for 2016. Given the continued strength of the U.S. dollars against virtually all other currencies, we anticipate foreign exchange will have a meaningful impact again in 2016. We expect revenues to be $38.7 billion to $40.2 billion using mid-January exchange rates, which reflects an approximately 3 percentage-point negative impact from foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of exchange, we expect low to mid single-digit revenue growth in 2016 as new product launches more than offset the impact from generic and biosimilar competition.","Our guidance range also assumes negligible revenues from Venezuela compared to $625 million in the full year 2015. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be $3.60 to $3.75, which also reflects an approximately 4 percentage-point negative impact from foreign currency at mid-January rates. 2016 EPS growth would be in the mid to high single-digits excluding the impact of exchange. On a GAAP basis, we expect to earn between $1.96 and $2.23. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes 2016 product gross margin will be roughly flat compared to 2015.","In addition, we expect operating expenses to be generally in line with prior year. We will continue to invest in direct selling and promotion to support new product launches while reducing administrative expenses, as we continue to focus our operating model. We remain committed to delivering a leveraged P&L and we will monitor our new launches and key products throughout the year in flex resources as appropriate.","Regarding tax, we expect the full year non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range 21.5% to 22.5%, which includes the benefit from the recently renewed R&D tax credit. Finally, we project average diluted shares outstanding of 2.78 billion for 2016, reflecting a decrease versus the prior year as we continue our share repurchase program.","The fourth quarter was a strong finish to a solid year of execution. We expect this momentum to continue into 2016 as we further innovate in our labs, invest behind our launches and continue our focus on disciplined resource allocation and continuous productivity to deliver a leveraged P&L and shareholder returns.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Adam.","Adam Schechter","Thank you Rob and good morning everyone. This morning I\u2019ll provide highlights on Global Human Health performance for the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2015. My comments will be on constant currency basis. Total sales reached $34.8 billion in 2015, reflecting growth of 4%. In the fourth quarter, sales reached $9 billion and also grew 4%. Excluding Cubis and divestitures, Human Health sales grew was 2% in 2015.","Moving now to product and franchise updates, I\u2019ll start with the JANUVIA franchise. The JANUVIA franchise grew 7% in 2015 driven primarily by volume increases. However, in the fourth quarter, U.S. revenue was impacted by a significant reduction in channel inventory, following buy-in that we saw in the third quarter. It\u2019s important to note that underlying volume maintained growth of about 3% in U.S. in the fourth quarter. Despite increased pricing pressure, we expect to grow the JANUVIA franchise in 2016 ex-exchange. We have maintained a high market share of about 75% in the U.S. and 65% globally. Volume increases in the U.S. and internationally, physician and patient experience with our medicine and macro trends that support a growing market, all reinforced our confidence in JANUVIA.","Moving to hospital and specialty care. Our hospital acute care business grew 11% in 2015 excluding Cubis. Sales in the fourth quarter reached more than $600 million and grew 7%. Performance was driven by our antibiotic and antifungal treatments as well as by BRIDION in the international markets. In addition, we are currently launching BRIDION in the U.S. While it\u2019s still early, customer feedback is very positive on this new product that uniquely reverses the neuromuscular block following surgery.","We are also excited to be launching ZEPATIER for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection in the U.S. and Canada. ZEPATIER offers a competitive profile and high cure rates with 12 weeks of therapy for the vast majority of patients in a one pill once today treatment. ZEPATIER is differentiated versus other options including consistent dosing regardless of cirrhosis status, renal impairment or use of PPIs and other acid-reducing agents. We believe our payor and pricing strategy will maximize ZEPATIER revenue and market share, as well as broaden and accelerate patient access. We\u2019re enthusiastic to be backing this important market and our teams are rapidly deploying to capitalize on this opportunity.","Moving to vaccines, the vaccines portfolio grew 3% with sales of $5.7 billion in 2015. In the fourth quarter, sales reached approximately $1.7 billion and grew 5% on strong performance for GARDASIL. GARDASIL growth was aided by timing of public sector purchases in the U.S. of about $50 million and timing of government purchases in Brazil in the fourth quarter. GARDASIL 9 now represents approximately 90% of sales in the U.S. as our teams have executed well on converting customers to 9-valent vaccine. ZOSTAVAX sales declined 11% in the fourth quarter, resulting from a very weak flu season in the U.S. We continued to work to educate customers on the reimbursement for ZOSTAVAX and to invest in direct to consumer advertising for this important ramp.","Finally, I\u2019d like to spend a few moments commenting on the continued launch of KEYTRUDA. In the fourth quarter, sales were approximately $215 million, driving strong full year sales of more than $560 million. Our performance was driven largely by the refractory melanoma indication in the U.S., as well as ongoing launches in more than 40 markets ex-U.S. In late 2015, we received approval in United States for first line treatment of advanced melanoma regardless of BRAF status. The sales force is launching this indication as we speak.","Looking into 2016 and beyond, we remain enthusiastic about the portfolio for KEYTRUDA across markets and across cancer types. We are building a critical foundation for PD-L1 testing in lung cancer as we launch in second line. We believe this will help to set the stage for when our first line indication is achieved. We have now demonstrated overall survival benefits [ph] for KEYTRUDA versus standard of care in both lung cancer and melanoma, which strengthens our belief that KEYTRUDA has a potential to become foundational in the treatment of cancer over time. With more than 200 clinical trials and more than 100 combinations in over 32 tumor types, we see the potential to drive significant growth for KEYTRUDA over the long term.","In summary, Global Human Health delivered a solid performance in 2015. In 2016, we\u2019ll continue to prioritize resources focusing on JANUVIA, hospital acute care, vaccines and important product launches including ZEPATIER and KEYTRUDA. The strength of our underlying business, the continued execution of our strategy, and the launch opportunities before us position us well for the year ahead.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Roger.","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","Thanks Adam. I\u2019ll provide a brief update on our progress in key programs during the fourth quarter and will note opportunities for further advancement in 2016.","The fourth quarter was an important one for KEYTRUDA. Our U.S. label was updated to include data from our 006 study in melanoma, demonstrating that KEYTRUDA treatment is superior to ipilimumab, the prior standard of care in the first line treatment of advanced melanoma and is judged by improvements in overall survival and progression-free survival.","Data from the 002 study in which KEYTRUDA treatment proved superior as judged by progression-free survival to traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy was also added to our label. Hence in United States as in Europe, our KEYTRUDA label documents the superior effect of this treatment for advanced melanoma as compared with other interventions.","Also in the fourth quarter, we presented data from our KEYNOTE-010 study demonstrating that KEYTRUDA provides superior overall survival as compared with docetaxel treatment in non-small cell lung cancer in patients with PD-L1 expression of 1% or more. This study was presented at the ESMO Asia meeting, simultaneously published in the Lancet and it\u2019s already been included in NCCN guidelines for lung cancer treatment. These data have also been submitted for review in United States and in Europe.","Looking ahead for KEYTRUDA, 2016 promises to be a very exciting year. We\u2019ll see data from our KEYNOTE-024 first line non-small cell lung cancer trial comparing treatment with the range of cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens to KEYTRUDA monotherapy by mid-year. Primary endpoint is progression-free survival. Our KEYNOTE-055 study, which evaluates response rates in head and neck cancer following KEYTRUDA monotherapy in patients who have failed both platinum agents cetuximab, will also provide important new data.","Looking still further ahead, there are multiple opportunities for filings in other tumor types including bladder cancer and classical Hodgkin lymphoma depending upon the results that we observe. As we have noted, the KEYTRUDA development program is exceptionally broad with registration-enabling studies underway in more than a dozen tumor types. We do view KEYTRUDA as providing a foundation for the next generation treatment of malignant disease. Along these lines, we\u2019re also setting combinations with cytotoxic agents, targeted therapies, vaccines and other immunomodulatory agents.","In 2015, we gained access to a Phase1 CEACAM directed anti-body program, which complements our internal clinical programs that target GITR, IL-10 and many other access. In all we have more than 100 combination studies underway as Adam mentioned.","A few weeks ago, we announced the acquisition of IOmet, through which we will gain access to a set of IDO1 and TDO1 small molecule antagonists. We previously presented data in collaboration with our colleagues at Incyte suggesting that KEYTRUDA may be fruitfully combined with their IDO1 inhibitor. And a Phase 3 study using this agent will soon begin enrolling patients with melanoma. Our acquisition of IOmet will permit us to explore the utility of IDO1 inhibition much more broadly.","Last week, we announced the approval of ZEPATIER in the United States. ZEPATIER was the subject of two breakthrough designations and was evaluated promptly by a priority review. A key strength of ZEPATIER is the fact that it can be used without dose adjustment in patients with chronic renal failure, a group that suffers from increased rates of HCV infection.","Going forward in 2016, we expect to complete Phase 2b and initiate Phase 3 studies for new regimens that include MK-3682 uridinal nucleoside polymerase inhibitor and MK-8408, a next generation highly active NS5A inhibitor. These programs emphasize our commitment to complete a care of patients HCV infection where the goal should certainly be to cure as many patients as possible using appropriate and effective regimens.","Our 2016 plan includes numerous several approvals and filings. As we have announced previously, bezlotoxumab, our therapy designed to reduce recurrences of Clostridium difficile associated enterocolitis received priority review designation from the FDA with PDUFA date in July. In 2016, we expect to complete our Phase 3 program and our filing for ertugliflozin as both agent and in combination JANUVIA. And we will obtain adjudicated data supporting the filing of odanacatib. We\u2019ll have the opportunity to review Phase 3 data from our inactivated varicella-zoster vaccine in immunocompromised populations and from our Phase 3 program studying letermovir as prophylaxis for Cytomegalovirus activation in patients receiving bone marrow transplant.","In collaboration with our colleagues at Bayer, we will begin a Phase 3 heart failure program for vericiguat based on Phase 2 data that we presented last year. And we also have a chance to see important early clinical data from our collaborations with NGM Pharmaceuticals in metabolic disease and from Moderna in the vaccine space. It will be a busy year.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Teri.","Teri Loxam","Thanks, Roger. We\u2019re going to be moving on to Q&A. We would like to try to get as many questions as possible this morning. So, I\u2019d ask that you try to hold your questions to one or two each. Thanks. Darla, we can go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays.","Geoff Meacham","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I have a couple for Roger on KEYTRUDA and lung. So, the first question is for the first line data this year. How much do you think the OS data will be and will that matter to regulators sort of competitive landscape? And then, on the 010 study, how much do you think it will play a role when it comes to -- the overall survival data will play a role when it comes to looking at the PD-L1 minimal expressers when you think about kind of that sort testing as a lever going forward, vis-\u00e0-vis competition with Bristol? Thanks a lot.","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","Geoff, first of all, with respect to first line, the primary endpoint of the study is progression-free survival. In these studies, we do permit crossover. It\u2019s really necessary to do that in these studies. And so, you\u2019re really comparing the early versus late access to KEYTRUDA. That\u2019s understood, progression-free survival is an accepted endpoint. So, I think that\u2019s where we\u2019ll be with respect to first line. And with respect to the 010 study, not sure exactly what you mean by PD-L1 minimal expressers, and what we showed in the 010 study of course was that there was a treatment effect in the 1% expressers as well as in the high expressers. We have noted that in PD-L1 negative populations with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, it\u2019s not at all clear that there is a benefit that inures to patients who receive PD-1 directed therapy. And that\u2019s true for every agent that\u2019s been studied, not just our own agent. So I think it is important to be looking at PD-L1 expression in order to decide who in fact should be treated with these agents.","Adam may have some other thoughts about the PD-L1 expression in the second line.","Adam Schechter","The only thing I\u2019d add Geoff is that if you look at reimbursement broadly in the U.S. right now we\u2019re being reimbursed for PD-L1 positive. So, it\u2019s irrespective of its\u2019 1% or above 50% for the vast majority of the plan, so we\u2019re seeing reimbursement already for anybody that shows up as PD-L1 positive.","Teri Loxam","Next question please, Darla?","Operator","It\u2019s from Tim Anderson with Bernstein.","Tim Anderson","A question on ZEPATIER, payers and your competitors in the space talk about long-term contracting. Knowing where your net pricing is coming in or at least I think know where it\u2019s coming in and knowing the positioning of the product which has some reasonable attributes, can you just talk about what we should expect in 2016 -- consensus has around 600 million. I know you don\u2019t guide on individual products normally. But give us some guidance here if you can, especially in the context of trying to bump what could be of high prevalence of long-term contracts? Second question on 4-1BB, Pfizer made some positive comments yesterday. One of the products they\u2019ve been setting with is your drug KEYTRUDA. But I am wondering about the longevity of that deal and whether they could kick you to the curb, potentially now that they have their own PD-L1? And then just a very quick question; does KEYNOTE-24 have an interim analysis? Bristol\u2019s first line trial does not.","Teri Loxam","Adam, why don\u2019t we start with you on ZEPATIER and then we can move to Roger for the other two?","Adam Schechter","Sure, Teri. And let me give you some context, and then I\u2019ll try to answer the question specifically on how we\u2019re thinking about the pricing reimbursement contracting strategy. But first of all, I agree with your comment that we do have a competitive product. And we have high cure rates. And if you look at our clinical trials in GT1 patients, it was 94% to 97%. If you look at GT4 patients, it\u2019s 97% to 100%. So, we start off by showing we have very good efficacy with the product. I also believe we have some important differentiation with the product, right? Our dosing is not affected by the presence of compensated cirrhosis. If you look at the competition, they have to change their dose there. You can use us with any degree of renal impairment. If you look at the competition, particularly in certain patients with renal impairment, they can\u2019t be used there. And also, you don\u2019t have to adjust our dose for acid-reducing agents such as PPI. So, I think those are some things we feel good about in terms of differentiating our product versus the competition in the marketplace.","I think what we did was develop a real deliberate and I believe innovative pricing strategy to try to maximize the product and increase the number of appropriate patients treated. But the first thing I want to say is we want to be competitive across all segments, and we want to look at public, private, we want to work with managed care organizations and government agencies et cetera, et cetera. So we plan to be competitive across all segments. And I believe that the strategy that we implemented could accelerate access to patients in certain segments where access frankly has not been as broad to-date, including those patients with medical needs in stage 4 and 5 CKD.","So, I\u2019d just say, we don\u2019t give guidance for individual products, but we will provide updates as we go through the year. We\u2019re just launching right now the products not available in the marketplace yet but it will be in a matter of days. And then, I\u2019ll provide updates as we go through the year to give you a sense of where we are.","Teri Loxam","Great. And Roger, do you want to address the 4-1BB and KEYNOTE-024 interim?","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","Right. Tim, so on 4-1BB, just first in context, as you know this is just a huge number of combinations that potentially can be studied. We\u2019re studying 100 and 4-1BB is one of those. The expectation is that we\u2019re going to see a lot of opportunities to combine KEYTRUDA with other drugs; we\u2019re already seeing those and have talked about them. For example, in combination with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, with immunization with TVEC, the oncolytic virus, and of course we\u2019re doing our own studies with other checkpoint inhibitors and other immunogens.","We\u2019re very pleased with other collaboration with Pfizer on 4-1BB. I believe that plan is assuming that it\u2019s accepted to be able to present some of those data at ASCO. And our expectation is that if it turns out that there is a good opportunity there that we\u2019ll continue to collaborate. So, I\u2019m not really terribly concerned about not being able to take advantage of an important opportunity to help patients.","With respect to KEYNOTE-024, the study is of course being continuously monitored by data monitoring committee. But importantly, I mean here we are in February, clinicaltrials.gov I think has the end of June. So, we\u2019re getting close to the end of the study anyway. And my expectation is that we\u2019ll have the opportunity to see the data in too long time and can use that as a basis -- potentially assuming the data come up correctly, as a basis for filing.","Teri Loxam","Thanks Roger. Next question please?","Operator","It\u2019s from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin","Thank you very much. Ken, the first question is for you. At our CEO conference, probably the last month, you talked about your increasing desire to be more aggressive with M&A, now that you have a strong scientific team on-board, thanks to Roger? Given the fairly significant de-rating of the biotech space since that conference, I would think you are absolutely licking your chops. Can you talk about the M&A landscape? And most importantly, when you think the buyers and sellers start to come together? And then a question for you, Roger -- I think to Roger. It\u2019s again on KEYTRUDA and the first-line study. Can you say the opportunity? How large is the highest PD-L1 expressers in the front-line lung market? And when we will see the study that targets the entire PD-L1 patient population in front-line lung? Thanks very much.","Ken Frazier","Thanks Jami. Let me start by just reiterating what I said before. The business development remains a critical part of our strategy because we need to pay both our internal growth with the best external innovation opportunities and we\u2019re looking to augment our Phase 2 as well as our early stage pipeline with these kinds of partnerships and collaborations and bolt-on acquisition. As it relates to re-rating of the biotech industry, of course we\u2019re very focused on value creating opportunities. Our team has looked at this very carefully and we are very active in looking for opportunities in oncology and other therapeutic areas where we can build our pipeline. So, I can just assure you that we paid attention to what\u2019s happened in the marketplace and we are looking very actively to reach the right kinds of deals whether they\u2019re M&A or partnership with collaborations to advance on pipeline.","Jami Rubin","Great. Roger, do you want to\u2026","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","Jami, on the first-line opportunity size, just to remind you and everyone that our approach has been to ask the question of whether or not we can identify populations that would benefit especially from the treatment of KEYTRUDA. And we chose to use the PD-L1 expression as a marker for that. It\u2019s turned out that that is a marker. And the reason of course is not because specifically the PD-L1 is the counter ligand for PD-1, but rather because PD-L1 is a marker for the presence of an immune response and that PD-L1, as a result is telling us that there already is the pre-existing immune response that can be enhanced by the addition of KEYTRUDA.","The 024 study looks at those that are PD-L1 high. And what we\u2019ve done in all of our studies is that we have looked at the PD-L1 high, those with the proportion scores above 50% and then looked at those that are expressing PD-L1 above 1% and also looked at that those that appeared not to be expressing PD-L1 as we move across the line. So for example and we published in the New England Journal that there was in general, in general terms in the 001 study in melanoma, in general that those patients who are expressing more PD-L1 had better responses. We similarly published data in 010-study recently, showing that responses were better in the highest in the PD-L1 expressers, again reflecting immune status. The 024 study looks at those that have the highest PD-L1 expression with about 25% of the first-line patient population. The 042 study will go on and look at patients who have the 1% cut point. And we\u2019ll begin to see the data across the entire first-line. So, we\u2019ll have an opportunity to look at that. Frankly, from a biological perspective, I really can\u2019t understand why would be any difference in the first-line population from what we\u2019ve previously shown in other tumor populations because again PD-L1 is a expression reflection of immune activity.","Teri Loxam","Thanks Roger. Next question please, Darla.","Operator","Your next question is from Chris Schott with JP Morgan.","Chris Schott","Great. Thanks very much for the questions. Just two here, first, can you elaborate on JANUVIA sales in the quarter? I guess how much the destocking impact results? And maybe more broadly, just latest thoughts on the SGLT2 impact on DPP-4 classes, as you talk about growing JANUVIA in 2016? And then a follow-up on HCV, can you just comment specifically on how much you see price driving share and broader adoption of these agents in the space? I think just a lot of focus on how the price dynamics play out here, no specific comments but just generally speaking, do you see price as a lever that is relevant [ph] to the space going forward for you guys? Thanks.","Adam Schechter","Hi Chris, this is Adam. Let me start with the JANUVIA franchise. So, I think it\u2019s important to give some additional context. So, I want to start by saying we\u2019re really pleased that JANUVIA grew 7% in 2015. And if you look at our underlying performance in fourth quarter, it was similar to the other quarters in the year. What you saw on fourth quarter was volume growth in the U.S. of about 3%, which was about the same as what you saw the quarter before and so forth. What happened was there was significant channel reductions that followed the third quarter buy-in which I noted on the last call was more than $100 million. And as you may recall, last quarter the U.S. grew 22% for JANUVIA and that\u2019s why I noted that there was buy-in and we would expect to see buy out. So when you look at fourth quarter, I would look at the underlying performance, which remains similar to the other quarters. And I think we have a good year with JANUVIA, showing 7% growth versus prior.","When you look at 2016, despite increasing pricing pressure that we\u2019ll see in the United States and the biannual price declines that you see in Japan, we expect to grow the franchise globally when you exclude exchange. And what that means with regard to EMPA-REG, we don\u2019t see a significant impact in 2016. In fact, if you look at the earliest data that you can look at, we\u2019re seeing market share shifts within the SGLT2 class but we\u2019re not seeing shifts between classes, between DPP-4s and SGLT2s. We\u2019ll continue to monitor that closely. We\u2019ll see when there is label changes or if there is potential guideline changes. But at this point in time, we feel confident that there should not be a significant impact in 2016 from the SGLT2 class.","So, let me answer your question on ZEPATIER. And I already stated that we think that we have a competitive product profile and that\u2019s where it all starts. You have to have a competitive product profile to be successful in the marketplace. Our efficacy is good. We think we have strong differentiation versus the competitors. So, price is always a lever that you can choose to utilize, but you don\u2019t necessarily have to utilize it nearly as much when you have a differentiated product that you think you can bring to market. So, we\u2019ll continue to keep you updated on ZEPATIER, as we move forward. But we\u2019re going to do everything we can to optimize or maximize that brand.","Teri Loxam","Thanks Adam. Darla, let\u2019s go to the next question please.","Operator","It\u2019s from Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert","First for Rob. It looks like you\u2019re guiding to a currency effect on the bottom line that\u2019s more extreme than the top line \u201816. So, can you just help us understand that relationship for \u201816 and for Merck in general, and comment on what share count you\u2019re factoring in to guidance for the year? And then for Ken, going back to the aggressive deal strategy described. What are your latest thoughts on, on deals like the Cubis deal and whether those are the kinds of deals you\u2019re looking as sprinkle in [ph] as well? It sounds like you have a scientific and pipeline focus, but what about deals that sort of leverage or build out certain commercial verticals you have and whether you do those deals again? Thanks.","Rob Davis","This is Rob. Good morning, Gregg. So, on your question, we are seeing a little bit more pressure to earnings when we earn sales from foreign currency. The biggest single driver of that is really how our hedging is flowing through on a year-on-year basis. Recall that in 2015, we flagged in prior quarters that we have received a meaningful benefit from hedge gains, as a result of the positions we took. And that benefit declined as you look from \u201815 into \u201816, assuming constant rates basically because of the fact that why those hedges are in place and the gains on them are smaller. So that impact does cause a little bit more of the leveraging effect you\u2019re seeing between the top and the bottom line. Other than that, we generally see a proportional move between sales and earnings, but that\u2019s the biggest single driver. And then to your question of what we\u2019re looking out from a share count, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re assuming 2.78 billion shares as an average for 2016, which is a reduction from where we were in \u201815.","Ken Frazier","And Gregg, thanks for the question on M&A. Let me start by saying that the Cubis deal actually has been a good deal for us, as you can see from this year\u2019s results. It also positions us well in the antibiotic space, a space that\u2019s a priority space for us going forward from that standpoint. But I also want to reiterate what I\u2019ve said, which is our main focus going forward will be to augment our Phase 2 in early stage pipeline. So, our focus is on getting the best external science because we believe that\u2019s how we could drive the greatest long term value. So, I would say going forward, our main focus will be more on those kinds of scientific acquisition deals than on things that augment necessarily our commercial table.","Teri Loxam","Thanks Ken. Let\u2019s go to next question please Darla.","Operator","It\u2019s from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez","So, just a couple of quick questions. Ken, as I just listened to your comments, one of the things that I am trying to better understand is, can you give us a little bit of the history of stage 2 and earlier stage deals where Merck has successfully brought forward a product like that into development? When I look at the deal history, Schering-Plough is really one of the acquisitions that was quite successful with regard to gaining access to KEYTRUDA, having your base inhibitor advance forward. Can you just help me understand why the smaller acquisitions are really a way to go? Obviously you guys -- and identified those assets, but it actually came from a larger deal and was clearly value generating.","And then separately for Roger. Roger, where I\u2019m a little perplexed on the timing, if I look at the development of the front-line lung situation, it seems like studies that finished faster in immuno-oncology consistently show a less robust results. So, can you help me understand how the KEYNOTE-024 study has an opportunity to successfully complete earlier than expected and before some of the other competitor studies that are out there?","And then my final question just for Adam. When you look at -- I think you guys have been really respectful, basically not saying that you\u2019re going to win, but that you will have a foundational product in KEYTRUDA. When other competitors claim and they\u2019re going to win particularly from a third or fourth or fifth position, how likely is it given what you\u2019ve seen historically that that is a realistic possibility, particularly in a space were new standards-of-care are being created? Thanks.","Ken Frazier","Let me first start with your first question Seamus, which is sort of a perspective on how early stage deals have created value for Merck. And I will start by saying that at Merck we\u2019ve always been focused on being a company that tries to develop really strong insight to human biology, and that has helped us to find things earlier on that have actually become important. So, some examples are FOSAMAX, which was licensed in or COZAAR. In my own experience when I was on the legal side, the work that we did to get access to the DPP-4 technology through a German company called Probiodrug, when those deals were done, people don\u2019t necessarily sit up and take notice of that, but JANUVIA was the result of that deal, which was done a number of years ago.","And so what we have found in the past is the best way for us to create value is do those insights early on that allow us to acquire the kinds of things that you heard Roger talk about NGM and Moderna. Our goal is to find those kinds of things before there is a bidding war to apply our scientific knowhow, our development knowhow, our molecular -- I\u2019m sorry our medicinal chemistry knowhow and to bring forward the kinds of molecules like sitagliptin that can actually be pretty important contributions to human health.","Adam Schechter","So with regard to KEYTRUDA, I\u2019ll answer your question next. I\u2019ve always said that I believe that this market is going to be a very large market and that there is room for multiple competitors. I also believe that there will be certain competitors that do really well in one tumor type and another competitor might get it in a different tumor type first. And therefore you\u2019ll see differences based upon tumor type. It\u2019s not too different if you look at the anti-TNF field where you have multiple products, one might be better in GI, the other might do better in rheumatoid arthritis but they all tend to do very well and grow very fast.","At the same time, I believe building a wall of data is important. And when you look at the size and the magnitude of our clinical trials and when you look at the number of tumor types that we\u2019re studying, I think we\u2019re going to be in a very good position over the long-term. And it\u2019s hard to think about late entrants coming in and having a strong position, once you have that wall of data built. So, I think the strategy that we put in place is the right strategy over time. And I think over time, you\u2019ll see us in a leadership position.","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","Seamus, I\u2019m not sure exactly what you mean by faster studies giving less robust results. Just to outline again what our strategy with respect to -- broadly with respect to these tumor types, as I mentioned in response to Jami Rubin\u2019s question is that we\u2019ve gone in said let\u2019s look at the patient populations in which we expect to see the best results and those are the PD-L1 highs in the current formulations. It\u2019s not the only biomarker that we have; in fact we\u2019ve evolved other better biomarkers we believe, but it\u2019s one that\u2019s useful.","In those patient populations because higher percentage of the treated patients in principal should respond, the result will be faster, but it shouldn\u2019t be less robust. In fact, in many cases, it would be more robust simply in terms of the efficacy window. So that\u2019s the basis for why the 024 study which is reading out in mid-year has a good chance of succeeding. We don\u2019t know what the data are, but we\u2019re eager to see the data and PFS. And thereafter, the populations will broaden through 042 and through a whole variety of other studies that we\u2019re doing. That\u2019s the general strategy. And I think it\u2019s a good one, because it focuses on those patients who need these therapies most.","Teri Loxam","Thanks Roger. Next question please Darla.","Operator","It\u2019s from Andrew Baum with Citi.","Andrew Baum","Thank you. Couple of questions, please. First Roger, some of your competitors are beginning to make investments in cancer antigen vaccine platforms to address the nonimmunogenic tumor subsets which are obviously sizable. I am unaware that Merck has such a collaboration right now. Obviously it involves logistical complexities [indiscernible] off the shelf solution might share a point. I\u2019m interested in your appetite moving to that strategy? And then second question for Ken, obviously pharma has been positioned as a rogue [ph] industry in light of the pricing issues within the U.S. To what extent do you think some of the negative attention on reimbursements spill over into other areas? I noticed an uptick in investigations from the DoJ, the SEC the HHS. Do you see any additional risk there for the industry as a functional scrutiny, almost certainly driven by political focus? Thank you.","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","Andrew with respect to neoantigen vaccine strategies, again this is -- conceptually the idea is okay, we\u2019ve introduced checkpoint inhibitors now and we can get good responses in a significant percentage of patients, but in a large number of patients, on more than half, we actually don\u2019t see a response. So, why don\u2019t we see a response in those patients? And one possibility certainly is that there isn\u2019t enough pre-existing immune response. And if we could stimulate that through as you say in neoantigen vaccine, things might go better. We\u2019re interested in those kinds of strategies. We of course have used other vaccination strategies. I point out again the oncolytic virus strategy which appears to have some traction. And we are looking at the question of whether or not it\u2019s possible to use neoantigens. And one of the issues is as I am sure you realized that introducing bespoke therapy where each patient receives neoantigen cocktail will be very challenging from an industry perspective. So, we\u2019re looking for those situations where there might be groups of neoantigen s that could be used and would but able to improve responses in a large set of patients.","Ken Frazier","With respect to the political and regulatory and legal issues around pricing pressures, obviously the whole issue of pricing and affordability for patients is a significant one; it\u2019s the challenge that we have in the society. I think it\u2019s unfortunate that that debate is being amplified and in some ways distorted by some of the political rhetoric, especially having to do with the presidential election cycle. So from a pharma standpoint, as Chairman of pharma, we continue to work, educate constituents in Washington DC and around the country on how pharmaceuticals actually help reduce cost in the overall healthcare system as well as the impact that they have on individuals as well.","Now, reality of the world is as we\u2019ve seen when there are these headlines, you tend to get congressional hearing and you tend to have state attorneys generals writing letters and things of that nature. And I take those things very seriously but I also think that the most important thing that we can do as an industry is to continue to price our products consistent with the value that they provide to our customers and to continue to try to educate again people about the long-term positive impact that appropriate use of pharmaceuticals has on overall healthcare costs.","Tori Loxam","Thanks Ken. Next question please.","Operator","It\u2019s from Tony Butler with Guggenheim Securities.","Tony Butler","A couple of brief questions for Roger, one is, interesting BD solution with IOmet, given some early data that you presented at CTSI on melanoma. But the real question is do you actually have data in house that an IDO and\/or keto inhibitor in combination with KEYTRUDA would have utility in tumors outside of melanoma? Second question is around GITR, what we see KEYTRUDA, GITR combos this calendar year at clinical meeting. Ad forgive me Teri. But Adam quickly on REMICADE non-U.S., do you actually have countries which are actively switching patients onto the biosimilar today, or is that simply a new patients who go on an anti-TNF inhibitor?","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","Tony, so with respect to the question of whether IDO1 inhibitor data exists outside of melanoma, we have a lot of data that we generated in combination with Incyte. In order to really know whether you have evidence for combined efficacy, you\u2019d have to have detailed really comparisons between monotherapy versus combination therapy. And those kinds of data don\u2019t exist really anywhere. Those really have to be done in robust Phase 2 or certainly Phase 3 studies. And we\u2019re moving forward with that. But we\u2019re interested in pursuing the field in more detail. And in order to do that, we really need to have access to a whole range of different compounds. And that\u2019s really what drove the IOmet deal. We\u2019re pleased with our interaction with Incyte but we need to be able to look at a broader range of starting materials.","And for the GITR data, we are doing combination studies right now, GITR in combination with KEYTRUDA. Depending on who enrolment goes and how much data we have, we hope to be able to present some of that data this year.","Adam Schechter","With regard to the question on REMICADE, if you look at share by volume, we had about 85% share in the fourth quarter. That came down from about 90% share that we had the quarter before. So, we\u2019re definitely seeing biosimilar business wins for new patients. And the percent of new patient is going to only grow over time. So right now about 10% to 20% of the business per year is new patients. We are seeing substitution of existing patients in some smaller markets, such as the Nordics. At this point in time, we\u2019re not seeing it in the larger markets. But we continue to anticipate that the impacts of biosimilars is going to accelerate as we go into 2016, as there is more and more new patients coming into the market and they become a larger percent of the sales.","Teri Loxam","Next question please Darla.","Operator","It\u2019s from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei","Roger, on the KEYTRUDA 024 first line study and forgive my ignorance on this. But can you provide the rational why PFS was selected as a primary endpoint given that it has not been a reliable endpoint with anti-PD1s in general? Basically I\u2019m trying to assess the risk for this trial. Could we see a situation where PFS is not significant, but overall survival is eventually significant, which would actually be similar to what we\u2019ve seen in more advanced setting?","And the follow-up for Rob. What\u2019s driving the 14% FX headwind in animal health? Obviously it\u2019s more significant than what you\u2019re experiencing overall and that\u2019s solid [ph] operational growth. Is this mostly Venezuela and when can we expect this to moderate? Thank you.","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","Alex, it\u2019s Roger. On the PFS endpoint, if you look at the 010 study, I think that\u2019s a good model for you to look at, because you look at overall survival and you look at PFS. The PFS hazard ratio is really excellent. And you can see the progression free survival for both doses and for PD-L1 high as well as PD-L1 1% populations. So again, I don\u2019t really see why first-line should look any different from second-line in that kind of setting and we should therefore be able to see a PFS signal. And you can do the power calculations based on the hazard ratio of less than 0.6 that we saw in that study. So that looks pretty good. And if you can\u2019t know until you do the study but that\u2019s really what it all look like, I think.","Teri Loxam","Next question please. Sorry.","Rob Davis","Alex, the other part of your question on the animal health. The reason you see a higher FX impact in animal health is predominantly due to the fact that the sales of animal health relative to our human health business are even more weighted outside of United States, pretty significantly outside of United States. So, it\u2019s really just a proportion of the sales coming from markets exposed to currency more than anything else. Venezuela did have a nominal impact on animal health, but it\u2019s not the driver, it\u2019s just general trends across all currencies.","Teri Loxam","Thanks. Next question?","Operator","It\u2019s from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger","So, with respect to hepatitis C, could you please talk a little bit more about your list pricing decision relative to the competition and how the market should think about discounting? Obviously there is a lot of speculation, so it would be good for you to help frame these topics, so that people understand your perspective on the list pricing and discounting? And then second, with respect to odanacatib, investor expectations are very low for this drug. Roger, I was just hoping that you could share your level of enthusiasm for this drug to be approved and have a successful launch? Thank you.","Adam Schechter","Hi Dave, this is Adam. So, let me start with ZEPATIER. I always think it\u2019s important to remind everyone that we have a competitive product profile and it all starts with having a competitive product profile. And I think we potentially even have some areas of differentiation that could be important. In addition to that, I think we\u2019ve developed a great pricing strategy that\u2019s going to help ZEPATIER be successful in the marketplace. What we did was we priced our list price to be competitive where the market\u2019s current net prices are. And our list price makes us competitive across all segments. And I think it could potentially help I think some currently underserved segments. I think also lower list prices could potentially have a positive impact on out-of-pocket medication costs for some patients. There is some patients in part D, where the list price does matter in terms of the out-of-pocket cost. And I think it could be beneficial for us there. I wouldn\u2019t read into our discounting strategy based upon our initial pricing strategy. What we intend to do is to compete in all segments of the market and to have an appropriate discounting strategy that allows us to have access.","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","And Dave, it\u2019s Roger on odanacatib. Back in May of 2014, I talked about odanacatib because we had the early results memo available for the Phase 3 study and noted that odanacatib had hit the three critical endpoints in osteoporosis process, namely reduced vertebral fractures, non-vertebral fractures and it reduced factures at hip. And I said at the time that the benefit risk profile for odanacatib appeared favorable. And so, it\u2019s a novel oral therapy that does what it\u2019s supposed to do in terms of reducing fractures. Actually quite dramatically, quite impressively in terms of clinical vertebral fractures, it\u2019s really the best that I\u2019ve seen and I\u2019ve been doing this for a while. So it looks really quite good.","One of the things that we pointed out when we presented these data at the end of 2014 was that there was a larger than usual discrepancy in adverse experience reporting for investigators versus central review. And in order to resolve that problem, we undertook an adjudication process. And adjudication process has taken much longer than we imagined. We worked with FDA to find that process and we\u2019ve worked with an external organization to go through it; it took all of last year.","We are nearly done. We want to get these data in and have the opportunity to file it. But I don\u2019t think there is any question that odanacatib does what it\u2019s supposed to do, we just want to see those data pull together.","Teri Loxam","Thanks Roger. Darla, we\u2019re going to try to get in two really quick ones, if we can.","Operator","Your next question come is from Mark Schoenebaum, Evercore ISI.","Mark Schoenebaum","I wanted to talk a little bit about your BELSOMRA launch. Scripts are doing fine; we are curious about the performance though above and below your expectations at this point. And really quick, is there anything in the pipeline that investors are ignoring?","Adam Schechter","With regard to BELSOMRA, I think we started off with a really good launch and we had nice growth. It has flattened a little bit. We ran direct to consumer advertising and we saw an increase again in TRx volume. We\u2019ve since seen it flatten a bit and we\u2019re working right now on augmenting our digital capabilities and our online capabilities. At the same time, we\u2019re working with physicians to understand that 10 milligrams which is the start dose isn\u2019t effective that they should titrate the patient to 20 milligrams. So, I would say that we were off to a good start. I am not pleased it\u2019s currently flat at this point in time, but we\u2019re working on that.","Dr. Roger Perlmutter","And Mark with respect to the pipeline, your colleagues are always telling me that based on our current share price, it appears that the pipeline is being completely ignored because there is almost no value that is ascribed to it. And it surprises them that here we have a really major effort in Alzheimer\u2019s for example and don\u2019t get an enormous amount of credit for that. When you check through all of those Phase 3 opportunities, some of which I mentioned that are coming forward as well as the large number of Phase 2 programs in the early space, and I could go through them one after another. I think we\u2019ve got an enormous opportunity here and would love to have the opportunity to talk about in more detail.","Teri Loxan","Thanks Roger. I think unfortunately we\u2019re out of time. So, I am going to just turn it over to Ken for some final comments.","Ken Frazier","Okay. Well, again thank you for joining us this morning. We\u2019re pleased with the growth that we saw through continued execution in our key areas including, diabetes. We\u2019re looking forward to additional growth. I think if you look at our 2016 guidance ex-FX, you see we expect to grow low to mid single digits. I think it\u2019s important to look at our EPS also. We continue to be very vigorous in our cost reductions and we are able to provide guidance here that again will allow us ex-FX to grow mid to high single digits. So we\u2019re pleased that we\u2019re back in a growth mode. And we\u2019re very excited to have opportunities to launch important products like ZEPATIER and KEYTRUDA.","So, thank you for your attention this morning. We look forward to talking to you in the future. Bye-bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."],"14254":["Merck & Co.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Alex Kelly, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Alex Kelly","Thanks, Christine. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Merck's first quarter 2012 conference call. Before I turn the call over to Ken, I'd like to mention a few housekeeping items. First, there are a number of items in the GAAP results this quarter such as acquisition-related charges and restructuring costs and certain other items, and you should note that we have excluded those items in our non-GAAP reconciliation tables and we've put those in the press release and also in Table 2, so that you can get a better sense of the true underlying performance. ","Next, we've also provided tables to help you understand the revenue trends, so there are tables with the GAAP results, and then there are also tables that -- Table 2, which reconciles GAAP P&L to non-GAAP, and Table 3 provides the sales performance of the company business and the units. During the call, we're going to primarily refer to Table 2 and Table 3 when we talk about performance. ","Finally, I'd like to remind you that some of the statements we make during today's call might be considered forward-looking statements. And as such, such statements are based upon the current beliefs of management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. The company's SEC filings, including our 10-K which was filed for 2011 back at the end of February, identifies certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from any projected this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement and you can find our SEC filings, as well as today's earnings release and tables on our website at merck.com. ","This morning I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board; Adam Schechter, our President of Global Human Health; and Peter Kellogg, our Chief Financial Officer. ","Now I'd like to introduce Ken Frazier.","Kenneth C. Frazier","Thank you, Alex. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining the call today. Our performance in the first quarter underscores key things that we've emphasized since early 2011: growth and execution. We remain committed to building shareholder value through continued execution while focusing on both performance and innovation. All in all, this quarter shows a strong start in a year when we intend to overcome a significant patent expiry. We are building momentum, particularly with our key growth drivers and plan to achieve numerous major milestones in our late stage pipeline, including a series of important filings with significant commercial potential. Our focus on aligned execution across geographies and divisions allowed us to deliver worldwide sales of $11.7 billion in the quarter, with solid growth in each of our 3 major businesses, 6% in the global pharmaceutical and vaccines business when one excludes the impact of the J&J arbitration, 7% in Consumer Care and 8% in Animal Health. It should be noted that we delivered this growth while also tightly managing costs, resulting in an 8% growth in non-GAAP EPS. Once again, we saw double-digit growth from a number of key products in our global pharmaceutical and Vaccines business. As always, Adam Schechter will discuss the performance of our product portfolio in more detail. ","Consumer Care growth was due to strong performance from brands across the consumer product portfolio in both developed and developing markets, including the U.S., Canada, Russia and Brazil. Animal Health growth was driven by the top 20 products in the portfolio, which grew a combined 18%, excluding foreign exchange, in the quarter. Overall, I remain pleased with the long-term global trends and the growth prospects for both the Consumer Care and Animal Health businesses. ","As you know, this is a challenging period for many companies in the industry due to major patent expirations, continued uncertainty in the global economy and increasing external pressures in the macro health care environment. However, we are confident in our ability to successfully manage these pressures and improve Merck's competitive position over the long term. In fact, we believe the growth momentum of our underlying business and the strength of our late stage pipeline position us well as we prepare for the SINGULAIR patent expiry and beyond. ","In 2012, we intend to maintain our revenues at or near 2011 level on a constant currency basis and drive bottom line growth. In addition to executing our core business strategies, we also made progress in our efforts to expand in the emerging markets. For the quarter, emerging market sales represented 17% of total pharmaceutical sales. China alone grew 19%, including a 5% benefit from foreign exchange. We continue to estimate that the emerging markets will represent about 1\/4 of our total pharmaceutical and vaccine sales by the end of 2013. ","Our recently announced joint venture partnership with Supera Farma, a Brazilian pharmaceutical company, is just one example of how we intend to grow. The new JV will market, distribute and sell a portfolio of innovative pharmaceuticals and branded generic products in the Brazilian retail sector. ","Earlier this year, we outlined a series of upcoming events that we anticipated would impact our business during the course of 2012. Since then, we've received FDA approval of JANUMET XR, a new treatment for type-2 diabetes that combines JANUVIA with extended-release metformin. In addition, we remain on-track for our 5 major filings between now and the end of next year, including Suvorexant, a new first-in-class treatment for patients with insomnia, which we'll have data presented at an upcoming fleet meeting; BRIDION, a first-in-class neuromuscular reversal agent; V503, a vaccine that provides broader coverage for the prevention of certain HPV-associated cancers; odanacatib, a once-weekly oral compound with a unique mechanism of action for the treatment of osteoporosis; and finally, TREDAPTIVE, our novel cholesterol medicine that improves multiple lipid parameters. Each of these 5 programs is consistent with our research strategy to develop clinically differentiated drugs which are either first in class or best in class. In either case, we believe our regulatory submissions will include data that allows these products to have significant market opportunities at the time of launch. ","Speaking of our research strategy, as we've said in the past, we are not relying on internal discoveries alone. In fact, we are devoting significant management, time and energy to identifying and accessing external innovation. Our goal is to find those assets that help position us for success in key therapeutic areas, and which we can access on terms that create shareholder value. One example is our recently announced partnership with Endocyte for a late stage oncology drug that will enhance our pipeline and give us a potential near-term commercial opportunity. The partnership is a good strategic fit with our own approach to oncology, and we believe this exciting first-in-class innovation could have utility in a variety of tumor types, including ovarian and lung cancers. We expect the drug to be our sixth major product filing between now and 2013, beginning with an application for accelerated approval and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer in Europe later this year. ","Turning to cost management, we continue to strategically manage our cost in a way that affords us the flexibility to make appropriate investments for growth, which we believe is critical in our business. Moving forward, we will continue to make the right investments to capitalize on growth opportunities while driving continuous efficiency improvements. We remain on track to achieve our full synergy targets by the end of this year. ","Before I close, let me take a moment to discuss our strategy in the context of the health care environment. Merck remains fully committed to discovering and developing innovative medicines and vaccines that save and improve lives. We're being judicious about where we invest in R&D. We want to put our resources behind the right opportunities, internally and externally that best address the substantial unmet medical needs globally while also creating shareholder value. In the long run, we believe it is those companies that can execute on a platform of innovation that will achieve the market acceptance, growth and margin strength necessary to succeed in a world of increasing resource scarcity. ","In order to take risks to bring new medicines and vaccines forward, we must continue working with governments, payers and regulators to foster an environment that encourages innovation and access to medicines and vaccines. In the U.S., that means supporting PDUFA IV, which will help a strong stable FDA with the resources necessary to ensure timely drug review. Across the globe, that means focusing on the value that our innovative products bring to individual patients in the health care system. Put differently, this means an unbiased assessment not only of the costs associated with allowing patients meaningful access to innovative medicines, but also the consequences of denying or impeding such access. ","In closing, let me emphasize again that we remain confident in our core strategy and our progress in transforming Merck's business. Overall, our focus on successful execution, combined with the strength of our pipeline and product portfolio, will allow us to continue growing both the top line and the bottom line and delivering shareholder value on a sustainable basis. ","With that, I'd like to turn the call over now to Adam Schechter.","Adam H. Schechter","Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to speak with you today and provide you with an overview of Global Human Health results. This year is off to a strong start. Reported pharmaceutical and vaccine sales are $10.1 billion. This represents 3% growth compared with the first quarter of 2011 or 6%, excluding the REMICADE and SIMPONI sales from transfer territories in 2011. This performance demonstrates strong execution on our 3 strategic priorities: growing the core with our key brands in established markets, expanding the core into new key growth markets; and accelerating new launches. I'll review with you the highlights of each of the 3 segments in my comments today. What you're going to see is that our base is strong, it is diverse and it continues to grow. ","So let's begin with the core business, which includes our largest markets and core brands. In the United States, sales grew 7%. Pilots with long exclusivity like JANUVIA, JANUMET, ISENTRESS, GARDASIL, ZOSTAVAX and VICTRELIS drove the majority of growth. Moving to Europe and Canada, sales declined 4% in the first quarter. However, if you exclude REMICADE and SIMPONI in Canada which were transferred to J&J, sales were up 2%, excluding foreign exchange. This was due to strong contributions from JANUVIA and JANUMET, SIMPONI and the launch sales of VICTRELIS, which I'll discuss shortly. While many of our key brands are growing in volume in the EU, we continue to anticipate an unfavorable mid-single-digit impact from pricing measures in 2012. This is in line with our previous expectations. ","Moving on to several core brands, I'll start with JANUVIA and JANUMET which continue to have strong performance, growing 26% to $1.3 billion this quarter. Despite multiple competitors in the market, JANUVIA and JANUMET retained a 75% share of the global DPP-4 market. JANUVIA's efficacy and broad product offering, including the recent launches of JANUMET XR and JUVISYNC in the United States, support our continued strong leadership in this fast-growing DPP-4 class. ","Sales of SINGULAIR were comparable to the first quarter of 2011. SINGULAIR was not a key growth driver this quarter as we are already seeing pressure from generic competition in certain markets such as Canada and Mexico. When SINGULAIR loses exclusivity in the United States in August, we expect multiple generic entrants. However, SINGULAIR will retain exclusivity in the major European markets until February of 2013 and in Japan until 2016. We expect continued growth for SINGULAIR in Japan and many of the emerging markets through this period. ","ISENTRESS continues to be a strong core brand for Merck and a valuable treatment option in the fight against HIV. ISENTRESS grew 15% in the quarter. We are confident that ISENTRESS will continue to be a strong choice for patients because of its efficacy, tolerability and demonstrated safety profile. In our cholesterol franchise, ZETIA and VYTORIN global sales reached $1.1 billion and were comparable to last year. In the U.S., ZETIA returned to growth, while VYTORIN continued to decline. Outside of the U.S., both ZETIA and VYTORIN continued grow in the high single digits. ","Combined REMICADE and SIMPONI sales grew 10% in the retained territories of Europe, Turkey and Russia this quarter. If you look at REMICADE alone, sales grew 5% despite continued austerity measures. When looking at SIMPONI, it remains a strong launched brand, with $74 million of sales versus $42 million for the same quarter last year in the Merck territories. We recently secured reimbursement for SIMPONI in France for all 3 rheumatology indications and we'll be launching there soon. ","Moving to Vaccines. Vaccines had a strong quarter of double-digit growth, and are benefiting from broader utilization and stable supply. GARDASIL maintained a strong performance this quarter, with 33% growth over the prior year due to continued uptake of the male indication in the United States and the launch in Japan. ","Sales of ZOSTAVAX were $76 million this quarter. We continue to build inventory to ensure a stable supply, and we're increasing our promotional efforts to grow demand. Earlier this month, we launched a national television disease education campaign in the United States. This is intended to increase awareness of shingles risk. We will begin a new branded print and online campaign later this year. ","Now let me highlight how we're expanding the core. In the first quarter, emerging market sales of $1.7 billion were in line with the previous year. Excluding REMICADE sales in the relinquished territories, the emerging markets grew 9% this quarter or 11% excluding exchange. Our growth in the emerging markets was driven by China, Brazil, Asia Pacific, Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa. Although there is pricing pressure in certain emerging markets, we are maximizing the growth of our core brands. We are launching new brands and we are building capabilities with our diversified brands to leverage life cycle management opportunities. ","For example, in several emerging markets, we're now launching COZAAR XQ, a combination of COZAAR and amlodipine. China continues to be a key growth driver with 19% growth this quarter or 14% excluding exchange. The growth was driven by hospital specialty business lines, as well as contributions from our diversified brands and our core brands. It is important to note that we have not yet received national reimbursement for key products like JANUVIA and ZETIA, and we have plans to file for approval for additional innovative products in the near future, all of which will drive continued growth. ","Our growth in Japan this quarter was 9% or approximately 4% excluding exchange. Our sales this quarter reflect the expected biannual price cuts and lower wholesaler inventory levels. In addition, first quarter of 2011 and 2012 comparisons were affected by Japan's very strong allergy season last year versus a late start to the season this year. We continue to see strong growth from many of our top-selling brands, including JANUVIA and the ZETIA and for launched brands, including BRIDION and GARDASIL. Looking ahead, we believe we have continued opportunity for very strong growth in Japan. ","Moving to the third part of our growth strategy, accelerating new launches. We're now launching many products, including DULERA in the United States, GARDASIL in Japan and VICTRELIS around the world. New products contributed more than $180 million in revenue this quarter. ","Now I'd like to give you an update on VICTRELIS. Global sales in the first quarter were $111 million. In the United States, share continued to grow and VICTRELIS ended the quarter with approximately a 38% TRx share. This share does not include the VA. While we are pleased with the consistent share gains over the last 6 months, we're keeping a close eye on recent Rx trends for the class. There is still a high number of patients needing treatment, and we are working to widen our universal positions prescribing VICTRELIS. Internationally, VICTRELIS was launched in Australia and Mexico this quarter. We're now launching in about 20 markets in total. VICTRELIS maintains a greater than 50% patient share in many of these markets including France, the U.K. and Canada. This rapid uptake signals the value of VICTRELIS and what it represents to patients, physicians and to payers. ","In summary, Global Human Health continued its consistent strong operational performance, and we execute in our growth strategy this quarter. We believe this momentum positions us well for success in the remainder of 2012 as we face the SINGULAIR U.S. patent expiry in August. So if there's one thing I'd like you to remember, it's that our base is strong, it is diverse and it continues to grow. I believe we can deliver strong results in 2012 through our key growth drivers, our core products, our launched brands and our performance in the emerging markets in Japan. We look forward to updating you on our performance throughout the year. ","Now I'd like to turn the call over to my colleague, Peter Kellogg.","Peter N. Kellogg","Thank you, Adam, and good morning. As you heard from Ken and Adam, we delivered another high-quality quarter. We drove revenue growth and managed expenses carefully, resulting in even faster bottom line growth and we achieved this performance while continuing to make strategic investments necessary to fuel future growth. Our results in the first quarter have established a strong foundation for 2012 as we build momentum ahead of the SINGULAIR patent expiration. This morning, I'll briefly talk about our performance in the first quarter and I will discuss our outlook for the second quarter and our financial targets for 2012. ","Now let me start with the operating results. My remarks will focus on our non-GAAP financials, which exclude acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. On this basis, we earned $0.99 this quarter, 8% higher than the prior year. As Ken and Adam mentioned, we drove revenue growth in each of our 3 major business units, up 3% in Human Health or up 6%, excluding the impact of REMICADE and SIMPONI in the territories transferred to J&J, up 8% in the Animal Health business and up 7% in Consumer Care. ","Now despite the strong growth in each of our major businesses, our total revenues grew only 1% due to a 43% reduction in alliance revenue and third-party manufacturing sales. On the third-party manufacturing front, remember that we divested our total Biomanufacturing business to Fujifilm during the first quarter of 2011. We've now annualized that divestiture so we don't expect it to have an impact going forward, but it did impact Q1. Additionally this quarter, our supply sales to Astra reduced due to 2 things. First, lower commercial demand for Nexium; and second, the timing of supply to Astra, which can create variability in the top line for us, and it did this quarter. Both of these factors resulted in lower supply sales for Merck. ","Now let me turn to our expenses in the first quarter. Total operating expenses were flat in the first quarter despite making growth driving investments. On product costs, our cost of sales were $113 million higher this quarter, resulting in non-GAAP gross margin of 76.1%. The gross margin was lower on a year-over-year basis primarily due to exchange. ","Moving onto M&A, this quarter, marketing and administrative expenses were $3 billion, a decrease of about $100 million. The decrease was due to the year-over-year impact of reduced field forces, actions that improved our operating efficiency across the company and decreased promotional spending on certain more mature brands such as SINGULAIR. Our research and development expense this quarter was $1.8 billion, which is in line with the first quarter of 2011. Now moving to tax, our non-GAAP tax rate was 24.8% in the first quarter, which included about 30 basis points of unfavorable discrete items. However, this rate is still within the range we previously provided. ","Now let me provide some commentary on our 2012 guidance which, based on our performance in the first quarter, is unchanged from the guidance we provided in February. As you will recall, our guidance has taken into account the known 2012 headwinds such as the U.S. SINGULAIR patent expiration in August, the full year impact of the J&J settlement, mid-single-digit pricing pressure in Europe and the biannual price reductions in Japan. And despite these headwinds, the underlying momentum of Merck's business and the growth of our key products enable us to maintain our 2012 revenues at or near 2011 levels on a constant currency basis. Consistent with our prior guidance, at current exchange rates, full year sales will be adversely affected by about 2% to 3%. As expected, foreign exchange had a 1% unfavorable impact on revenues in the first quarter. And at today's exchange rates, for example, sales in the second quarter would be adversely affected by about 3%. ","Now let me discuss how we expect revenues to be spread throughout 2012 just as I did in our early -- earlier prior earnings calls. We continue to believe that the second quarter will be the strongest quarter due to the allergy season in the last full quarter of SINGULAIR sales in the U.S. prior to patent expiry. Meanwhile, sales in the fourth quarter are expected to be the lowest, primarily due to the U.S. SINGULAIR patent expiration. ","On R&D expenses, we expect to maintain non-GAAP R&D expenses at about the same level as in 2011 on a full year basis, but there will be some upward pressure from upfront payments for any deals that we complete in 2012. For example, the recently announced Endocyte deal will add $120 million to our second quarter R&D spending, so you should adjust your models accordingly for that. The Endocyte deal is indicative of the active business development program we are pursuing. However, it is hard to predict which other deals may be consummated, their size or their timing. ","Regarding tax, we continue to expect our 2012 non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%. Finally, at current exchange rates, we expect our non-GAAP EPS to be between $3.75 and $3.85, which includes the impact of the Endocyte deal. As I mentioned before, our guidance also assumes that we will retain revenue and equity income from the Astra JV for at least half of 2012. As Astra said yesterday, they have up to 6 months to exercise the option beginning in May. In fact, the working assumption in our plan is that we will retain the JV roughly through September. Now keep in mind the timing can be different from our assumption and Astra retains the final decision about the option. As with revenues, we expect second quarter EPS to be the strongest quarter and fourth quarter EPS to be the lowest of the year. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be between $2.04 and $2.30. ","So to wrap up my comments, we are off to a very good start. We grew the top line and we delivered a leveraged P&L, which resulted in even faster bottom line growth. As a result of the underlying momentum, the growth of our core products and the promising R&D projects we highlighted in our pipeline, we continue to be optimistic about our outlook for 2012 and the years ahead. Thank you. ","Now I'll turn the call over to Alex.","Alex Kelly","Thanks, Peter. Now we'd like to open up the call to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Christie, we're ready to take our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Ken, just the first one for you. In calling out the strong performance of Animal Health and consumer, are you saying that you are committed to keeping these businesses? Or are you considering or would you consider monetizing these assets, which would more than likely trade at much higher multiples than where Merck currently trades as we've seen with a recent disposal on this business? And my second question is to Adam. Adam, there was clearly a lot of very exciting data presented at EASL last week in Barcelona which would suggest the very high bar to compete in an all oral hepatitis C regimen. In light of that, can you just elaborate again on your plans for MK-5172? Many of your competitors have been busy collaborating and partnering and we have seen less of that activity with you, but if you can just sort of put that into perspective.","Kenneth C. Frazier","So first of all, Jami, thanks for your questions. So what I would say is that first of all we, as I said a few minutes ago, we are pleased with the assets that we have in the company's business portfolio and we believe that both Animal Health and Consumer Care complement our human health business and contribute to the top and bottom line growth and you saw this quarter Consumer Care grew 7%, Animal Health grew 8%. So I think what we're trying to do around here is focus on creating long-term shareholder value and we believe that both Animal Health and Consumer Care can help contribute to that. For us though, I think we believe that our R&D pipeline is the most undervalued and underappreciated part of our business, and we are committed to unlocking the value that we believe that pipeline represents, and data from important clinical trials that are coming due in 2012 and 2013 should help in that regard. So once again, what we're trying to do is to create long-term shareholder value. We look at our assets and we try to determine where we can create the most value going forward.","Adam H. Schechter","Jami, with regard to your question, so first of all, there was a lot of interesting assets in HCV as the science continues to move forward. And as you look for shorter, better-tolerated, more effective therapies, it was absolutely exciting at EASL for sure, and what EASL did -- showed us is that there's a need for multiple mechanisms and that there is room for improvement. Our hepatitis C strategy in the short term is to maximize VICTRELIS. It's remarkable to think that we can now get up to a 70% cure rate and thinking just several years ago, that cure rate was closer to 35%, so we've basically doubled the cure rate, but we're also aggressively pursuing new, more convenient and interferon-free therapies. We're focusing on MK-5172 either in combination with other internal candidates. So you saw our NS5A data in Phase I. So we're also looking for partnerships with others, so it goes to develop an oral regimen, you want to maximize sBR, shorten duration of therapy and minimize side effects, and we believe that 5172 has a great profile and it could be the partner protease inhibitor of choice for oral combination regimens, and we don't comment on our business development. But as you can imagine, we're in discussions with multiple potential opportunities.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just 2 questions here. Maybe first, talking by the JANUVIA competitive dynamics, I guess I didn't see a lot of large categories, particularly primary care with multiple competitors, where you get 1 asset holding the vast majority of market share. At the same time, we haven't seen a lot of traction from Tradjenta. We've seen the Melogliptin delay. I guess longer term, do you think Merck can hold this high level of share in the category? Or do we inevitably see a shift throughout less consolidated market share position over time? And the second question is on ISENTRESS. How are you thinking about competitive dynamics as we look out a few years with a potential once-daily product coming to market? Do you believe you can continue to grow this franchise longer term if that one stated product, I guess, with comparable efficacy is approved? Or just how are you thinking about that product kind of progressing over time?","Kenneth C. Frazier","Thanks for the question, Chris, and I would say that long term, I do believe that Merck can continue to hold a very strong part of the DPP-4 market despite having multiple competitors, and Adam will give you his views as to exactly why that's the case.","Adam H. Schechter","So thanks for the question, Chris. And I think the first thing to note is that we do have a 75% share with DPP-4 class. And if you look at the U.S., we have an 80% share. In Japan, we have about 70% share. In some markets, we already have 5 competitors in that class, and we're still able to maintain our share. I think that positions are very comfortable with the efficacy profile and the safety profile of JANUVIA. And if you look at the data we have, it shows that JANUVIA maximizes the mechanism. They really see that the efficacy you can get from this mechanism, you can see from JANUVIA. And when you combine that with the safety profile, you have to ask why would there be a need to use anything other than JANUVIA. The other key thing is that sulfonylurea still have 37% patient days of therapy. So it represents a very big opportunity for us to continue to move into other classes and continue to have strong DPP-4 growth. Therefore, I think the future potential is still very, very strong. And that's what makes me excited about 3102 in our pipeline because I believe ultimately, when you move to a once-weekly DPP-4 inhibitor, that's could even penetrate into other classes such as sulfonylureas even more. So we remain excited, we remain committed and we have significant support that we book behind JANUVIA.","Kenneth C. Frazier","And we're going to Phase III in that in 3102 this year.","Adam H. Schechter","Just let me address ISENTRESS. So ISENTRESS remains a very important product. And when you think about ISENTRESS, the amount of efficacy data that we have, the safety data that we have, the drug interaction data that we have, it all is very important, particularly as more and more HIV patients are living longer and have comorbidities. So it's now about 70% of patients have comorbidities while they're on ISENTRESS. I think a VIP drug in this class will be okay because many of these patients are taking multiple drugs already. But in addition to that, you'd have to trade-off the long-term safety, efficacy and tolerability data that you have with ISENTRESS for a newer drug with a lot of unknowns. So I believe trading-off once a day versus a very well known product that has a long history is not something that we're concerned about, particularly with the Quad. We think that having 2 drugs in the Quad, a boosting agent that hasn't been utilized or a new integrase inhibitor versus staying with ISENTRESS, which has such long data with it, we'll continue to be successful with ISENTRESS.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen and Company.","Steve Scala - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","First on ZOSTAVAX, I'm surprised the sales were down quarter-over-quarter, given the resolving manufacturing situation. To what extent is the $76 million reflective of underlying demand? So that's the first question. The second question is on AZLP. AstraZeneca seems intent on exercising option 2 at the earliest opportunity, and their primary objective seems to be to gain their strategic freedom. If it's AstraZeneca's gain, I assume it's a lost opportunity for Merck. So would you explain what opportunity Merck is losing via AstraZeneca gaining its strategic freedom? And this goes beyond the contingent payments, it's some element that has nothing to do with the financials. So can you explain that, please?","Adam H. Schechter","Okay, so let me start with ZOSTAVAX. So quarter 1 sales were $76 million, most of which was in the United States. And as I said before, it was going to take a quarter or 2 before we can actually see revenues predictive of demand. We wanted to wait until we had enough supply to feel confident to really start to generate additional demand and run our direct-to-consumer advertising, which you saw we just started to run very recently. We now have about 4 months of supply in the market -- available to us for the marketplace, so we were confident that we can start to run our direct-to-consumer advertising that we can increase our promotional efforts behind ZOSTAVAX. So it really is going to take us another 3 to 6 months to have a much better understanding of the underlying demand. But there really is a large unmet medical need that still exists. If you look at data from the CDC in 2010, only 15% of the 60-plus age group has been vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX. So as we continue to build demand, we think that there's a lot of opportunity here.","Kenneth C. Frazier","I'd also add that we have continued to work very hard on making the right kinds of manufacturing enhancements and investments that are necessary to increase our long-term supply of ZOSTAVAX, and we're encouraged by the progress that we're seeing right now. And we expect additional varicella bulk capacity of production this year and next year, and I think this will give us the confidence to enable the expansion of ZOSTAVAX in the U.S., as well as in additional markets overseas.","Peter N. Kellogg","So I can take the AstraZeneca LP joint venture question. Steve, I appreciate the interest in that. Obviously, that's an event -- that's a relationship that's been great long-term and there's this option coming up shortly. And I think what we've tried to do is provide the financial profile of what the business looks like, and give you some sense of how to think about it in the future if the option is exercised. But in terms of strategic implications, I do apologize. I think that -- I would suggest that you address those questions to our partner, and get a sense of how they might take about that. I think one of the nice things about this relationship is it is one that's been well designed. I think the relationship of how it moves forward is pretty well articulated. So we'll just wait to hear from our partner.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein.","Tim Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","On REMICADE and biosimilars, can you tell us what you have in your planning assumptions for when biosimilars will arrive in Europe? Dossier has been filed, and it seems like it could happen as soon as 2013. On emerging markets, if you correct for the REMICADE settlement, what was your year-on-year growth rate? And then on Odanacatib, have you done the first interim look yet? And if not, is that a second quarter event?","Kenneth C. Frazier","Peter, you want to start?","Peter N. Kellogg","Sure. On the REMICADE biosimilar question for Europe, so I think there's a lot of news flow out there in terms of different companies are developing biosimilar, and I think it's just sort of a triangulation. We actually think the REMICADE position is quite unique. It's a very strong therapy and it's used in a particular way for the group of patients or the user. Clearly, biosimilars is an opportunity everywhere around the world, but I think actually we're optimistic REMICADE simply will hold a nice position over there. I think the patent goes out to August 2014, and so that would be roughly what we'd be thinking about. But nonetheless, we'll see how things evolve. On the emerging market one, why don't I let Adam take that.","Adam H. Schechter","So if you look at the emerging markets, if you remove REMICADE from the relinquished territories in emerging markets, we had 9% sales growth or 11% x exchange. I think it's important to note, though, if you excluded China from that number, we still had 10% growth with Rx in all the other emerging markets combined. So the emerging market strength is broad across the emerging markets.","Kenneth C. Frazier","So on Odanacatib, Steve, there's a -- our 2 interim looks at our plans for the trial. We have one interim planned at 70% of the events, and one interim will get 85% of the event, and I would just say there's nothing to report at this time on that trial.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, can you talk about Japan just a little bit more, what kind of expectations you have for growth this year just given the price cuts that we're expecting? How much is price going to impact you and what kind of volume growth are you expecting? I mean -- and what are the kind of the key growth drivers? Do you have any key more launches this year? Second question is can you just tell us on GARDASIL, what percent the male orders are taking up right now?","Kenneth C. Frazier","Okay, Adam?","Adam H. Schechter","So let me start with Japan. So our sales grew 9% this quarter, up 4% x exchange. And there were 4 items that affected our sales this quarter. The first one is the buy-in of price decrease, as well as some lower inventory levels. If you look at the average reduction across products in the national registry in Japan, it's about 6%. Our buy-in of price decrease was about the same as that. Also, I mentioned that there was a stronger allergy season in the first quarter of 2011 versus 2012. We also had supply sales our current marketing partner recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011. That happens every other quarter, so we didn't have supply sales for JANUVIA in the first quarter of this year. And then the last thing, if you remember, the beginning of last year after the first quarter, we mentioned that there was buy-in of about $50 million in Japan that did not occur this year. So there's some reasons why the growth in Japan was 9% versus some -- if you look at fourth quarter in particular. But with that said, we see continued growth for a lot of our top-selling brands. We see a lot of growth for JANUVIA, for ZETIA, for BRIDION, and we're still just launching GARDASIL as we speak. So there's still a lot to move forward there. With regard to GARDASIL, we still have a lot of growth that we can continue. We're seeing strength in vaccinations of males. It's very hard to tell exactly how much is coming just from males. The data is not easy to get. Based on the latest sector claims, which is about 50% of sales that go through the private sector, the first phase of GARDASIL is among adolescents of 11 to 18, of males is about 30% of the first dose claims. That's the best data we have to try to give an indication of what that means and what the penetration to males is, so that was not exact. The penetration, we believe, is still less than 20% overall in males.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Boris with Citi.","John T. Boris - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just first question on VYTORIN. The trial between generic manufacturers concluded in the latter part of December and then a summation hearing occurred in early March in the Newark courts. You adopted, at least Schering did, to settle with Glenmark on ZETIA. Just -- can we get any ideas as to your thinking about settling versus allowing this thing to go to decision here going forward and what your strategy is? And then second question for Peter, just any thoughts on the amount of shares that you repurchased within the quarter?","Kenneth C. Frazier","It's Ken. So I'll start with VYTORIN. We believe we have a very strong case. We believe this is a patent that is valid and enforceable, and we believe that the court heard the evidence well, and we are anticipating a favorable decision in this case. And so that's the basis upon which we look at how we will go and deal with that going forward.","Peter N. Kellogg","So John, this is Peter. During the first quarter, we purchased a little over 12 million shares, which was about $450 million of spend. And I think you'd note that that's pretty similar to the trend we had last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.","Alison Yang - Barclays Capital, Research Division","This is Alison Yang, asking questions on behalf of Tony. Two questions. First of all, Adam, on your comment about VICTRELIS, are you seeing any patient fatigue or difficulty recruiting new patients? Are you seeing warehousing? Your comment regarding standing disposition reach, I'm just curious because based on our research, most physicians that treat Hep C in the U.S. have already prescribed either VICTRELIS or Incivek. So where is this potential headroom in the U.S. patient base? And secondly, could you, Adam, please describe your Phase II asset in oncology, dalotuzumab, the Endocyte agents, the AKT inhibitor 2206? Can you kind of give us a sense of what's the going forward plan there?","Adam H. Schechter","So let me start with your question on VICTRELIS. And if you look at VICTRELIS, there's still a significant number of physicians that have not yet prescribed either of the 2 protease inhibitors. In fact, of the -- anywhere from 9,000 to 11,000 physicians that prescribe these products, there's still about 3,500 to 4,000 that we see in the IMS data that have not yet prescribed. So we think that there is still significant room to get additional physicians to prescribe the product. In addition to that, there were some other prescribing physicians that had written for Incivek, but not yet VICTRELIS. And we're seeing an increase in the number of physicians that are writing for both products now, so we still have room to get additional physicians that have not yet prescribed VICTRELIS, but have prescribed Incivek to move over and try both of those agents. So I think they both represent significant opportunities, getting new physicians to begin to treat, and then getting physicians who have not yet used it, but are treating to use VICTRELIS. With regard to our oncology strategy, it really is to look at patient subpopulations that we can define and use biomarkers in order to treat those patients. If you look at the licensing deal that Ken mentioned with Endocyte, that's exactly the types of products that we're looking for because we believe that by identifying targeted therapy, we can get better payer payments, we can get better treatment rates, and we can actually increase our ability to penetrate into the marketplaces. So we really are building our pipeline. There's data coming out of ASCO on a variety of our programs of targeted therapies, and we're excited about our future in oncology.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask a question that's probably for Ken or Peter. The first is I've just noticed it seems like for several quarters now your SG&A, as well as your R&D seems to come in a little bit below what Wall Street is modeling. So I'm wondering if you share that opinion, and maybe you could give a little color as to why the analyst community seems to be overestimating your spend on the margin? And then the second question is more of a capital allocation question, and it's a little bit more open-ended. I recognize it will be challenging to answer. But last year, obviously, at your Analyst Meeting late in the year, you boosted the dividend, a significant amount of stock reacted. The stock also reacted very significantly. And I wonder if you could help us think about what your plans are this year regarding a hike in the dividend, whether or not our expectations should be similar to last year were in some fashion different?","Kenneth C. Frazier","Okay. Thanks, Mark, for the question. Let me first start with the patterns of the SG&A and R&D spend that you are seeing over the last few quarters. What we've tried to say is that we will look for the right opportunities to invest in launches, for example, DTC on the SG&A side and of course, there's a normal up and down that goes on in the clinical programs in our R&D budget. So I would say that we will see some up and down around that to trend over. Overall, we've been trying to show much more efficiency going forward and you may see some seasonal timing changes, but our goal is to tightly manage our cost structure going forward. That's the best that I can say on that. On the dividend issue, as you know, we have a long history of returning cash to our shareholders, and we did increase the dividend back in January. At the same time, we've been very active in our share repurchases, buying back about $450 million worth of shares in this past quarter. So I would just say we don't have a set dividend policy, but we intend to remain shareholder-friendly in terms of returning cash to shareholders, while at the same time building and maintaining a very strong financial profile and business profile.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Risinger.","Thomas Chiu - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is Tom for Dave. We have 2 questions. One is how will you be communicating the odanacatib fracture outcomes interim look later this year? And second is, does the new IMPROVE-IT look in December include a fertility analysis?","Peter N. Kellogg","So you're talking about the IMPROVE-IT trial. So what we know from the DSMB is that they have looked at the data, the 75% look. They recommended the trial continue on unchanged, which now they have quite a few years worth of data in this program, and they've asked that they -- or suggested they will take another look at 9 months, and that's the extent of the details that we have regarding the -- the next IMPROVE-IT look.","Kenneth C. Frazier","I think there was an odanacatib question, too.","Peter N. Kellogg","Yes, so in terms of the odanacatib look, those interim looks could take place this year, but the timing is really dependent on the occurrence rate for the events. The thing I would note is that we would plan to file that odanacatib in 2013 regardless of whether we get a successful interim look or whether the trial goes to completion. So our timing is set on 2013. And it's really unclear whether we could see any data this year from that trial unless there's some kind of outcome from the interim looks, but we'll keep you informed about that going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Greg Gilbert with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Gregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have 2. First, a strategic question on diabetes here, obviously well covered in DPP-4 globally and with combos and stuff, and you seem excited about some earlier stuff like smart insulin. But can you comment on your appetite to fill any gaps in particular with drugs or devices sort of between those 2 in the middle of that continuum? And then secondly, on the consumer front, I asked the company about the potential for OTC statins back at the time of your Analyst Day, and the company seemed skeptical at that point. But given the FDA's apparent interest in the area, I thought I'd revisit the issue. Do you see an OTC or some modified behind-the-counter model that could take shape? And if so, over what rough time frame?","Kenneth C. Frazier","Well, I would say that on the OTC question, we don't see any real guidance from the FDA that changes our perspective on this. Obviously, it's a product-by-product decision that the FDA will make, and we continue to see that. With our product portfolio, there will be opportunities going forward, but I can't say that anything's changed in terms of our logic as it relates to the consumer business in the OTC business going forward. The other question, I believe, had to do with our perspective on building out our diabetes franchise. What I would say about that is, as I've said earlier with respect to the other areas where we want to compete going forward, we are going to look for opportunities to build out our portfolio in the near term and the longer term, as long as those opportunities will help us have market leadership. We want to find assets that will grow, and we also want to find assets that we can buy or bring in on a basis that provides us an opportunity to create long-term shareholder value. So diabetes is a critical area for us. It's one of the ones that we are -- intend to be winners in, in the long run.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seamus Fernandez, Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Just Adam and Ken, this is, I guess, for both of you to some degree. Just remind us with both odanacatib and Suvorexant, I would assume that you'll probably leave with efficacy as best you can. But can you just give us your thoughts on the real differentiating attributes of both of these products, whether it be trial design features or specific product attributes that are going to position you to win versus the current options again, and this is including multiple generics out there?","Kenneth C. Frazier","So I'll start off, and then I'll let Adam fill in. The first thing that I think has been true for Merck is that our sweet spot is really coming to market with new science and clinical differentiation. And I think that's going to be true for both of these medicines, notwithstanding the fact that there are generic competitors in the marketplace both on sleep, as well as osteoporosis. So with respect to the sleep compounds, we have a number of attributes. We've pointed out that we have good sleep offset efficacy, good sleep maintenance efficacy, lack of meaningful next-day residual effects and a safety profile allowing for chronic use, and about 30% of the patients who are in this market need chronic sleep therapy. So we think that Suvorexant comes to market in a way that's differentiated for people who have to travel, people who have to use sleep medication, not having that drowsiness. Those next-day residual effects are important to them. We have data with respect to drivers, where we see that it really does make a difference. On odanacatib, I'd start by saying that a quarter of all the women who are eligible for osteoporosis treatment cannot tolerate bisphosphonate. There's also declining use of bisphosphonate due to some concerns that have been raised around long-term safety, and what we have here is a unique mechanism that shows positive trends beyond what the bisphosphonates provide. We're actually expecting also to have a fracture outcomes trial, which should read out in 2013, which should demonstrate the benefit of this product vis-\u00e0-vis the bisphosphonate. This is a classic example of what I was saying before that if people just focus on the differential in cost, they're missing the differential and efficacy and the consequences that come from things like hip fractures later, which are debilitating to women.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Catherine Arnold with Credit Suisse.","Catherine J. Arnold - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, 2 drugs I just want to ask you about, one is PD-1 and the other is odanacatib. On PD-1, could you remind us in terms of timing and priorities and if this is a research program that might be able to accelerate given that you would obviously be studying it in stage disease and how it might be different than the other PD-1s in the industry pipeline. And odanacatib, I just wanted -- could you give us just some background, just remind us what the fracture baseline rates you're expecting in the control arm for the study. And also, Ken, on your comments regarding the market deceleration in bisphosphonates, obviously, it's a dramatic change in prescription demand for the category. So I'm wondering how that's featuring into the market research you're getting on the interest in odanacatib.","Alex Kelly","So Catherine on -- this is Alex. On the PD-1, I believe there's going to be an abstract presented at ASCO, so it's pretty early phase for us right now, but it's certainly an interesting area, and it's something that we'll be interested to see as that data is presented at ASCO, how the oncologists are starting to think about that class. On odanacatib, there's no publication at this point on the real background of these patients, but I think we have some information provided relative to the power of the study, but there's no baseline study in terms of characteristics of the patients that's been studied published so far.","Kenneth C. Frazier","Yes, in the study, it's 90% power to detect a 35% reduction in the relative risk of hip fracture. I also would answer your other question, Catherine, about market research by saying that we have been interacting with key opinion leaders in the osteoporosis field. And remember, this is a field that Merck essentially pioneered a number of years ago with FOSAMAX. And what those opinion leaders are telling us is that they're extraordinarily excited by what they see in odanacatib. They're glad that Merck stayed in this field, that there is a need for an improved set of therapies for these women. Women are living longer, they are living -- they want to be independent longer and these fractures, whether they're vertebral fractures or hip fractures are in fact really big issues for those women and for societal cost in terms of people going in a long-term care, et cetera. So we're very pleased to be in these marketplaces. Again, I will come back and say that I think osteoporosis is a field where there's still very much unmet need. ","So let me close by saying a couple of things. First of all, thank you for hearing us out this morning. We said from the very beginning that our ultimate goal would be to create long-term shareholder value, and that we thought the way that we needed to do that was to have sustainable revenue growth and faster growth on the bottom line. And I think this quarter was another quarter where we showed that profile. And importantly, in a year in which we're losing our biggest product, SINGULAIR, we see strong portfolio performance across our key growth drivers. And going forward, we look forward to multiple pipeline catalysts in 2012 and 2013. So thank you very much for your attention, and I look forward to seeing you soon.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"13797":["Merck & Co., Inc.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Teri Loxam. Please go ahead.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thank you, Darla, and good morning. Welcome to Merck's fourth quarter and full-year 2016 conference call. Today I'm joined by: Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; Adam Schechter, President of Global Human Health; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Laboratories.","Before I turn the call over to Ken, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation of these in our press release. We have also provided a table in our press release to help you understand the sales in the quarter for the business units and products.","I would like to remind you that some of the statements that we make during today's call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

You can see our SEC filings as well as today's earnings release on Merck.com.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken Frazier.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thank you, Teri. Good morning, everyone.","In 2016, we drove growth across many areas of our portfolio, which enabled us to exceed our EPS commitments for the year. Looking forward, we remain confident in the ongoing performance of our key inline franchises and core brands as well as the growing momentum behind our pipeline and major product launches.","Business development remains an important priority for us, as we are committed to building on our current portfolio and pipeline. We continue to seek the best scientific opportunities via acquisitions, partnerships, and collaborations at the right financial valuation, with a particular focus on augmenting our early to mid-stage pipeline.","As you are all aware, we are operating in a period of significant volatility and uncertainty, including the current political and policy environment in the United States. Merck, however, remains steadfast in our mission to produce biomedical innovations that save and improve lives. We believe our broad and balanced portfolio will enable us to weather these uncertainties and positions us well to deliver long-term value to shareholders.","Earlier this week, along with a small group of industry CEOs representing pharma, I participated in an initial meeting with President Trump. We discussed how we can work together on areas of common ground, such as reforming our country's tax code, removing outdated and counterproductive regulations that drive up costs and hinder biomedical progress, and using market forces like competition and choice to make medicines more affordable and accessible to the patients who need them, all with the ultimate goal of stimulating greater innovation and growth on the part of U.S.-based companies. I came away encouraged by the open and constructive dialogue of this first meeting, and we look forward to working with the administration and Congress to develop and advance solutions that will achieve this goal.","In closing, we remain committed to investing in R&D and to discovering and developing transformational medicines and vaccines that create significant therapeutic and shareholder value. While planning in the current environment has its challenges, we believe we've put forward reasonable expectations for 2017, which Rob will discuss next in more detail. We will stay focused on driving the performance of our core business, advancing our late-stage pipeline, including expanding the use of KEYTRUDA, our foundational immuno-oncology agent, and executing on our key launch products to maximize long-term growth.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over now to Rob.","Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. I will make a few remarks on our full-year and fourth quarter 2016 results as well as provide some commentary on our 2017 guidance. My remarks will focus mainly on our non-GAAP financials.","2016 reflected a year of strong execution and disciplined resource allocation. We delivered full-year revenues of $39.8 billion, which is in the upper end of our original guidance range. This represents top line growth of 1% or 3% excluding the impact of FX, and was driven by new product launches such as KEYTRUDA, ZEPATIER, and BRIDION, as well as growth in the JANUVIA franchise, vaccines, and our Animal Health business, somewhat offset by generic competition.","We were able to reallocate costs from other areas of our portfolio to support these growth drivers, resulting in full-year 2016 operating expenses that were generally flat to 2015, with higher R&D expenses offset by a decline in marketing and administrative expense. As a result, the company delivered a leveraged P&L with full-year non-GAAP EPS of $3.78, exceeding our original 2016 guidance and representing 5% growth over the prior year or 7% excluding the impact of exchange.","Now, turning to the fourth quarter, despite significant headwinds in the fourth quarter from generic competition for ZETIA, CUBICIN, and NASONEX in the U.S. and REMICADE in Europe, we were able to deliver sales and EPS that were roughly flat on an ex-exchange basis. Total company revenues of $10.1 billion in the quarter were flat versus prior year excluding a 1% negative impact from foreign exchange.","Our Human Health business decreased 1% excluding exchange while our Animal Health business grew 7% excluding exchange. Recall that our Human Health sales in the third quarter included an approximately $150 million benefit from the pull forward of customer purchases from the fourth quarter due to the timing of shipments in Japan in anticipation of an ERP go-live. I should also note that fourth quarter KEYTRUDA sales in the U.S. include approximately $40 million of revenue that had previously been deferred. Now that we have sufficient sales and returns history, deferral is no longer necessary and the one-time adjustment was made in the fourth quarter.","Looking to the other parts of the P&L, non-GAAP gross margin was 74.8%, which was flat year over year. Full-year gross margin increased 30 basis points to 75.7%. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $4.3 billion were slightly lower versus the fourth quarter of 2015 due to a slight decline in R&D, mainly driven by lower licensing expenses.","Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.3% this quarter, an increase of roughly 7 percentage points year over year, resulting in a full-year tax rate of 22.3%. Recall that the fourth quarter of 2015 reflected the full-year benefit from the renewal of the R&D tax credit.","Taken together, we earned $0.89 per share on a non-GAAP basis, a decrease of 4% versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, non-GAAP EPS decreased 1%. When looking at the year-over-year comparison, our fourth quarter EPS was also negatively impacted by the pull forward of customer purchases in Japan into the third quarter, which we had said was about a $0.04 EPS favorable impact in Q3.","On a GAAP basis, we earned $0.42 in the quarter, which includes a $625 million pre-tax charge to settle the worldwide KEYTRUDA patent litigation.","Now let's turn to guidance and our outlook for 2017. Launches of KEYTRUDA and ZEPATIER, as well as strength in our inline brands, including JANUVIA and our vaccines business, largely mitigate the headwinds that we anticipate this year from LOEs on an ex-exchange basis. We expect full-year 2017 revenues to be in the range of $38.6 billion to $40.1 billion, which includes an approximately 2% negative impact from foreign exchange using mid-January rates.","While there are many potential pushes and pulls across our business that our guidance range encompasses, for clarity, we would like to specifically mention that we have included risk-adjusted sales from the potential opportunity for a KEYTRUDA indication based on the KEYNOTE-021G filing. We expect our 2017 product gross margin to moderately increase year over year, despite having to absorb the impact of a 6.5% royalty on our worldwide sales of KEYTRUDA.","We expect operating expenses to increase year over year at a low single-digit rate, driven by an increase in R&D spending, coupled with marketing and administrative expenses that are anticipated to be relatively flat. The increase in R&D expense is a reflection of the investments needed to continue to fund KEYTRUDA, along with the rest of our pipeline, at optimal levels to maximize potential long-term growth. We have made a significant effort to look across our portfolio to reallocate resources, and we will continue this discipline and make appropriate trade-off decisions to balance near and long-term results.","Regarding tax, we expect the full-year non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 22%. We project average diluted shares outstanding of approximately $2.75 billion (sic) [2.75 billion shares] (10:55) for 2017, reflecting a decrease versus the prior year, as we continue our share repurchase program.","Taken together, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be $3.72 to $3.87, which reflects an approximately 2 percentage point negative impact from foreign currency at mid-January rates. Projected 2017 EPS growth would be flat to up 4% excluding the impact of exchange. Despite the significant generic competition we face in 2017, our non-GAAP EPS guidance demonstrates growth at the midpoint versus 2016, and fully absorbs the impact of the KEYTRUDA royalty to BMS.","It's also worth noting several items that will make year-over-year comparisons more difficult, especially in the first half of the year. While we are facing rapid erosion of sales from our products that have lost patent exclusivity, we will not get the full benefit of the ramp from new product launches, such as KEYTRUDA and ZEPATIER, until the second half of 2017. In addition, the timing of customer purchases for JANUVIA will further contribute to the difficult comparison, particularly in the first quarter. While we expect sales to build over the course of the year, we anticipate operating expenses will be somewhat front-end loaded, driven largely by higher promotional expense for KEYTRUDA and the phasing of clinical spend.","In summary, 2016 was another example of our commitment to delivering shareholder value through the prioritization of resources toward innovative products that will contribute to long-term growth. We expect this momentum to continue as we further innovate in our labs and invest behind our launches. We are confident the investments we're making today will realize continued shareholder value in the future.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Adam.","Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. This morning I'll provide highlights of Global Human Health performance for the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2016. My comments will be on a constant currency basis.","Global Human Health annual sales reached $35.2 billion and grew 2%. All core areas: oncology, vaccines, diabetes, and hospital and specialty care, contributed to the growth. In the fourth quarter, sales of $8.9 billion declined 1%. We were able to mostly offset the impact from LOEs in the quarter from growth products, from new products including KEYTRUDA and ZEPATIER, but also from inline products such as JANUVIA and our vaccine franchise.","I'll now highlight a few of our product launches in key franchises, and I'll start with oncology. We continued to execute well on the launch of KEYTRUDA globally, and we are confident about the opportunity we see for this important brand. In the fourth quarter, sales were $482 million, driving strong full-year sales of $1.4 billion. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA fourth quarter sales of $311 million were driven by continued strength in melanoma, rapid penetration of head and neck cancer, and the launch of first-line lung.","Since our first-line lung approval in late October, we have seen a significant acceleration in PD-L1 testing in non-small-cell lung cancer. Our early data suggests that about two-thirds of new patients are being tested. And the vast majority of first-line patients that are tested and also have PD-L1 greater than or equal to 50% are being treated with KEYTRUDA.","Outside of the U.S., melanoma continued to be the primary driver of sales of $172 million in the quarter. In addition to the nearly 60 markets in which we have melanoma approvals, launches are underway in second-line non-small-cell lung cancer in more than 50 markets. We're working through the reimbursement process for each country, and we expect a meaningful contribution in 2017 from second-line lung as many of these countries come online. We'll also begin reimbursement discussions on first-line lung as we gain additional approvals outside of the U.S. Of note, we're looking forward to launching in Japan, where we've recently been approved for first-line and second-line lung as well as melanoma.","This is only the beginning of opportunity that we see for KEYTRUDA in 2017 and beyond. Similar to melanoma and head and neck cancer, we are committed to building a leadership position in lung. We're moving forward with additional investment to leverage our unimpeded position in first-line lung. And as you may have seen, we've recently initiated a consumer campaign in the United States.","We're also looking forward to further broadening the opportunity for KEYTRUDA, with three PDUFA dates upcoming in just the first half of 2017, and we expect even more to come.","Now I'll move to primary care. The JANUVIA franchise grew 4% globally in the fourth quarter, driven by strong performance in the U.S., where sales grew 12% due to increased volume and some customer buy-in. TRx trends remained strong in the U.S. with growth of over 3% in the fourth quarter. We've now seen more than 10 consecutive quarters of volume growth in the U.S. Outside of the U.S., sales declined slightly due to the unfavorable impact of customer shipment timing in Japan. For the full year, the franchise generated sales of $6.1 billion or 2% growth.","We remain encouraged by the underlying volume trends in the U.S. and around the world for JANUVIA, and we continue to see opportunities to grow our diabetes franchise. We have maintained very good managed care coverage in 2017, though this access comes with higher discounts and rebates, as we said before. Despite this increased pricing pressure, we remain confident in the franchise.","Our vaccine business grew 2% in the fourth quarter to $1.7 billion, with the increase primarily driven by PNEUMOVAX and GARDASIL. Full-year sales also grew, increasing 10% to $6.2 billion, with GARDASIL, pediatric vaccines, and PNEUMOVAX all delivering double-digit growth.","GARDASIL sales in the fourth quarter grew 9% to $542 million on another strong quarter in the U.S. Sales for the full year increased 14%, as we continued to transition sales to GARDASIL 9 around the world. We expect a rapid transition to the two-dose regimen in 2017, and that will have a negative impact on sales in the U.S. But we are confident in GARDASIL 9 over the long term. In addition, we completed the termination of our vaccine joint venture in Europe in with Sanofi in the fourth quarter, and we have fully integrated our vaccine operations as of January 1.","Moving now to hospital and specialty care, sales grew 2% to $8.1 billion for the full year. Fourth quarter sales of $1.9 billion declined 3%, as the decline in REMICADE continued to accelerate and CUBICIN sales were subject to generic competition in the U.S. These declines were partially offset by contributions from launched products, including BRIDION and ZEPATIER. BRIDION had another strong quarter with nearly 50% growth, driven by strong uptake from the launch in the U.S. as well as continued demand in Europe, the emerging markets, and Japan. Surgical trends support the increased use of BRIDION, and we are excited about the opportunity we see for BRIDION in 2017 and beyond.","We also continue to be encouraged by the progress made with ZEPATIER in its first year of launch. Sales were $229 million in the quarter. In the U.S., we've continued to gain market share, and we remain focused on driving greater utilization across the public and private plans in which we've gained access. Some of these formulary wins had effective dates of January 1, and they are expected to meaningfully contribute to our results in 2017. Outside of the U.S., we are encouraged by the initial uptake following recent launches in Japan and the EU late in the fourth quarter. We're pleased with the reimbursement discussions that are still ongoing across Europe as well as the expansion of reimbursement criteria in several large markets.","All together, Global Human Health delivered solid results in 2016. While we'll have to contend to the significant impact in 2017 of revenue from the loss of U.S. exclusivity for several large brands, including ZETIA, VYTORIN, CUBICIN, and NASONEX, we will continue to execute on the opportunities we have in front of us. We are committed to building our leadership position for KEYTRUDA around the world, and we'll continue to prioritize resources behind key franchises like JANUVIA and vaccines. And we will maximize other product launches such as ZEPATIER and BRIDION. This together will position us well for years ahead.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Adam.","As Ken, Rob, and Adam have outlined, the fourth quarter was an important one for Merck Research Laboratories. Much of the excitement in the fourth quarter resulted from accomplishments in our oncology programs. First, in late October we received FDA approval for the use of KEYTRUDA in second-line non-small-cell lung cancer in patients whose tumors exhibit greater than 1% of cells expressing PD-L1, as determined using our companion diagnostic. This represents a meaningful broadening of the utility it featured in the second-line setting and was based on results from our KEYNOTE-010 study showing improved survival in patients receiving this therapy as opposed to those who received traditional chemotherapeutic intervention.","Follow-up data from KEYNOTE-010 presented at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer [IASLC] meeting in December provided strong evidence for durable KEYTRUDA-induced responses in patients who completed two years of therapy. Dr. Roy Herbst presenting these data noted a doubling of overall survival in KEYTRUDA-treated second-line lung cancer patients as compared with what was achieved using traditional chemotherapy.","Also in late October, the FDA approved KEYTRUDA for the first-line treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer patients whose tumors contained 50% or more tumor cells expressing PD-L1. This approval was based on our KEYNOTE-024 study, which was presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology [ESMO] meeting in Copenhagen and published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine. Compared with traditional platinum doublet therapy, KEYTRUDA treatment in this setting resulted in a 60% improvement in the overall response rate and a 40% reduction in the risk of death. Moreover, KEYTRUDA treatment was associated with a lower rate of serious adverse effects than was observed in the chemotherapy treatment arm.","The importance of the KEYNOTE-024 results was highlighted by the recommendation for approval by the European Committee on Human Medicinal Products [CHMP] in mid-December, with subsequent EC ratification just a couple of days ago. KEYTRUDA was also approved by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare based on the KEYNOTE-010 and KEYNOTE-024 results on December 19. In each of these cases, KEYTRUDA is recommended at unit dosing 200 mg given by intravenous infusion every three weeks, which simplifies patient management. With each passing month, we are learning more about the potential of KEYTRUDA to improve treatment for patients suffering from cancer.","Since our last earnings call, we received three new Breakthrough Designations from the FDA for the use of KEYTRUDA to treat malignant disease: first, in patients whose tumors irrespective of histology are found to have evidence of DNA repair defects, as demonstrated by so-called microsatellite instability. Our U.S. filing for this indication was accepted with a PDUFA date of March 8; second, for treatment of urothelial malignancies based on data from our KEYNOTE-045 study; and third, we received Breakthrough Designation for the treatment of primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, a relatively rare tumor where KEYTRUDA monotherapy may have a meaningful impact. Finally, we received a Priority Review for our file supporting the use of KEYTRUDA in the treatment of relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin's lymphoma. The PDUFA date for this U.S. submission is March 15.","Beyond monotherapy, the FDA has also accepted our file supporting the use of a combination of KEYTRUDA with more traditional chemotherapy, as described in our KEYNOTE-021G study. Here, in first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer irrespective of PD-L1 expression, the combination of KEYTRUDA with pemetrexed and carboplatin therapy yielded response rates of 55% and a near doubling of progression-free survival. The FDA has granted Priority Review for this filing, with a PDUFA date of May 10.","Filings for U.S. supplementary biologics licensing approvals for KEYTRUDA are expanding logarithmically, which together with our worldwide support of filings contributes to the enormous workload that we are experiencing in clinical research and regulatory affairs.","I've said before that KEYTRUDA is changing the landscape of cancer treatment, representing a fourth pillar, if you will, beyond surgery, radiation therapy, and traditional chemotherapy that provides hope for further progress in the treatment of malignant disease. We are currently supporting more than 430 studies of KEYTRUDA in various settings, including an ever-larger fraction of combination protocols using novel new modulators as well as traditional chemotherapeutic agents.","Beyond oncology, we continue to support very active programs in metabolic disease, cardiovascular disease, neuropsychiatric illness, and the development of improved vaccines. Many of these programs will begin to deliver results in the middle of 2017. The REVEAL study testing whether anacetrapib reduces cardiovascular events in adverse patients already optimally treated with statin therapy should provide data sometime after midyear.","At around the same time, we will also see Phase 3 data from verubecestat, our beta-secretase inhibitor, which we hope will delay progression of dementia in patients who already have mild to moderate cognitive impairment. A second Phase 3 study testing the use of verubecestat in patients with prodromal disease is now fully enrolled. I look forward to providing updates on these and other programs as the year progresses.","Now I'll turn the call back to Teri.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Roger. Darla, we will move on to our Q&A portion of the call. If I could ask the analysts to please limit your questions to just one or two so we can get as many people in as possible, that would be appreciated. Darla, we'll go to Q&A, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question is from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, thanks very much. So I guess I'd like to start just by asking a high-level question. Ken, could you just talk about how the meeting with President Trump concluded and the next steps that you expect from the administration?","And then, Roger, most physician experts are skeptical that FDA will approve the KEYTRUDA\/chemo combo based upon the small Phase 2 data set with the no overall survival benefit. What do you think the naysayers underappreciate about your chemo combo application and the likely FDA assessment? Thank you.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.","Okay, this is Ken Frazier, Dave. Thanks for the question. It's important to recognize that this was a first meeting with President Trump. In this meeting, we got a lot of issues on the table. The President was really clear that his ultimate goal is twofold. One is to create U.S. jobs, and the second one is to ease the cost burden on patients. But he was also quick to say he recognizes the importance of this industry, and he doesn't want to interfere with the incentives in the marketplace for us to continue to take risks and make the kinds of investments that are needed to discover and develop long-term innovation. We also talked, as you know, about reforming taxes, easing regulation, ensuring that we have the right kinds of negotiations around value-based health care.","Where we decided to go from there is that we would have regular check-ins after that. We don't have a second meeting today established on his calendar, but we said that we would continue to have regular check-ins to ensure that there was good communication between us and the administration. Obviously, the administration is focused on repealing and replacing the ACA, and they're very early in those thought processes also. And we will continue, along with our colleagues at pharma, to reach out to both the administration and Congress to ensure that our interests are represented and that patients continue to have access to high-quality and affordable health care.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","And David, this is Roger. With respect to KEYNOTE-021, it's worth recognizing that the KEYNOTE-021G results confirmed, with respect to response rate, the prior monotherapy study, that is cohort C of KEYNOTE-021, so in essence this is a second study. I think the data stand on their own. The fact that the results we're seeing with respect to response rate and progression-free survival, and at this point, there is no separation in overall survival, is unsurprising in a way because: first of all, follow-up is really quite short, six months; and secondly, because there's a substantial amount of crossover between the two arms. These data represent, to my knowledge, the first controlled data comparing a combination with chemotherapy, and as a result, I think are quite significant. I will not predict how FDA or any regulatory agency will respond to those data, but I do think the results stand on their own.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Next question please, Darla.","Operator","It's from Steve Scala with Cowen.","Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you very much, two questions, both on KEYTRUDA. On KEYNOTE-189, do you expect PFS to read out before OS? And if yes, how long after the initial PFS will OS assessment be likely? Roche said yesterday on their call that they could get a simultaneous readout from their chemo combo trials.","And the second question is, the FDA put a pembrolizumab study sponsored by NCI [National Cancer Institute] in glioblastoma on hold due to an adverse event. Can you provide more color on what signal they saw? Thank you very much.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Right, on KEYNOTE-189, we could get a simultaneous readout. It's really a function of the magnitude of the treatment effect. So I can't speculate on what exactly we're going to see for KEYNOTE-189, but again, it's a comparison that looks at the ability of combination with chemotherapy to have a meaningful treatment effect. And if there is an overall survival benefit of substantial magnitude, we'd see it.","Again, I think one should keep in mind that crossover does occur in these studies, and more and more, we will be seeing the impact of crossover. We are in the process of evaluating that, because there are some interesting issues with respect to the sequencing of KEYTRUDA therapy and chemotherapy and the impact that has on results, so there's a lot of information we're going to get out of KEYNOTE-189.","With respect to the study on hold that you mentioned, that study actually is not on hold. That's a misstatement in ClinicalTrials.gov, and I believe they're busy correcting it, but it's not on hold. What was seen in the study is, we believe, of course, what you would expect to see in grievously ill patients who have intercranial malignancies. And there's really nothing represented in that study, so nothing to pay attention to really, I think.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Roger. Darla, we'll move on to the next question, please.","Operator","It's from Tim Anderson with Bernstein.","Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. Going back to KEYNOTE-189, unless something has changed, my understanding is that PFS is the only primary endpoint for that trial, which makes it unique if true, because all the other I-O combo trials by other companies have PFS and OS as co-primaries, so I'm trying to understand the rationale behind this. Is it so you can put more dedicated alfa (32:33) only to this primary endpoint, or does it say you're worried about the crossover hurting OS potentially or what?","And then another question on KEYNOTE-042, so another monotherapy trial, but this time I think it's in all-comers, and I believe you're supposed to have that in early 2018. Might you change the cutoff for the primary analysis to widen it beyond KEYNOTE-024, but not maybe go as low as 1%? I would imagine to keep the momentum going, you don't want have a negative trial on your hands. So how might you might address KEYNOTE-042?","And then last question, just on CTLA-4 combo, is that still something you might be considering, or with Bristol's increased caution, could that not be something you pursue?","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Okay, so first of all, with KEYNOTE-189, not much to add to what I've said previously. Again, we are expecting that there will be a meaningful impact of crossover in all future studies, because of the widespread appreciation of the value of KEYTRUDA therapy, and the desire on the part of physicians and patients, to gain access to that when they have progressive disease. The impact of crossover will depend upon its timing and also the sequencing phenomenon that I mentioned. PFS is a sensible endpoint in that context, and that contributes to our study design.","With respect to KEYNOTE-042, you should expect that study to go to completion. We are eager to understand whether the superiority that we demonstrated in KEYNOTE-024 vis-\u00e0-vis traditional doublet chemotherapy applies across the totality of patients, in lung cancer patients beyond those who just have PD-L1 expression in 50% or more of cells. So that study is going on. I have no expectation. In general, we don't change the endpoints of our studies once we've embarked upon them. We think hard about them and we try and get those endpoints right at the beginning. We could in principle do that, but I see no reason to at the present time.","And with respect to combinations with immunotherapies, including those directed at CTLA-4, we remain interested in the broadest possible set of combinations that can have beneficial impact to patients, and that includes immunotherapies, not just CTLA-4, but other things as well. My expectation is that with time we will see that treatment regimens are more and more personalized. I do not expect that one size will fit all here and that every cancer patient will receive the same combination, whether it's chemotherapy or immunologic manipulation. My feeling is though that KEYTRUDA will prove to be foundational in these settings because of its very broad impact in a wide variety of different tumor types at different stages of disease, as we've shown.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Roger. Darla, we'll move on to the next question, please.","Operator","It's from Geoff Meacham with Barclays.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Rob or Adam, you mentioned including KEYNOTE-021G in the 2017 outlook. Can you speak more qualitatively about your expectations for the MSI indication or for broader monotherapy use beyond the 50% cut point?","And then, Ken, you've talked in the past about biz-dev being a priority I think for over a year now. Is there a tipping point to put it into action via, say, valuation expectations from sellers or tax policy or ACA? Thanks.","Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Hi, Jeff. This is Adam. So with regard to KEYNOTE-021G, as you know, right now KEYTRUDA is approved first-line use in patients that have PD-L1 greater than or equal to 50%. Assuming that KEYNOTE-021G gets put into the label, we anticipate that that would open up the non-squamous lung market. So we would have patients that are negative on PD-L1 all the way from PD-L1 of 1% up through greater than 50%. So it certainly would open up the rest of the market.","The way I would think about it, though, is that from what we can tell, physicians will be much more apt to use the combination in patients that they deem to be relatively healthy. They're going to evaluate it patient by patient and see where they believe that the combination of the two would outweigh potential side effects and so forth. So I think initially, it will be used in patients that are relatively healthy and those where they would be thinking about using ALIMTA anyway. After that, we believe that it will go into patients that are relatively healthy where they're not necessarily thinking about ALIMTA but they might start to use ALIMTA in combination with KEYTRUDA to treat those patients and get better results. And then lastly, over time, we think that even in patients that are less healthy, they'll probably, after having a lot of exposure to the combination, begin to use it in those patients as well.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Before I go (37:51)","Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.","Yes, so thanks for the question. I'll start by saying that valuations have come down, and that has caused us to continue to look very hard at various options that we have across the marketplace. I would say you shouldn't infer from the fact that you haven't seen a deal that we're not making every effort to try to do the right kind of deal for our shareholders in the long run. We still have to find a willing seller and we still have to find a price where we think we can actually create value, and that's generally the issue that we've actually encountered up until now.","I would also say with respect to your question about exogenous factors like tax policy and ACA that we feel like we have the firepower now in terms of a strong balance sheet to do the kinds of deals that we need to do across the entire spectrum of opportunities and assets. So I would just say we keep reminding you that BD is important to us because we want you to know that we're being very diligent and looking for the right deal at the right valuation.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Ken. Darla, we'll move on to the next question, please.","Operator","It's from Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Hi, guys. Teri, I have a question with two parts and one sub-part. I was just wondering, they're very simple. Roger, can you just remind us what your development strategy is in the squamous lung cancer setting for front-line?","And then number two, I'd love to hear, Roger, your thoughts on ALIMTA versus ABRAXANE in particular, but just other chemos. Do you think the chemo is ultimately \u2013 the choice of chemo is going to matter very much?","And then the impact of the solanezumab failure on your thinking about the A-beta hypothesis, you've been very \u2013 you made some very interesting statements. You thought a lot about this, the A-beta hypothesis and made some memorable statements. I was just wondering what you think the solanezumab trial date is. And also thanks to Teri and the team for all the help that she gave my team while I was out. Thank you.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Mark.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Right, so a number of questions, Mark. Thanks for that. First of all, we do have a squamous front-line study which will be coming out and we expect sometime in 2018, the first part of 2018, KEYNOTE-407. And our expectation is that we'll be able to demonstrate the same kind of effect in first-line with squamous, but time will tell.","As far as chemo combinations are concerned, it is early days. If you look at the KEYNOTE-021 program, you can see that there were improvements in response rates in a variety of different settings in combinations with different therapies. And of course, our colleagues at Roche have demonstrated combination results with chemotherapy using their PD-L1 antibody. So I think that over time we're going to find out that there are probably a lot of things that work in combinations fairly well. Certainly pre-clinically that's what we see, combinations with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immune manipulations, a variety of kinds including vaccinations, oncolytic viruses, and then of course our recent interesting data that we have in combination IDO1 antagonists with our colleagues at Incyte. So all of that suggests that there are going to be many different combinations and there will be quite a lot of customization over time. And as I say, I don't think that one size will fit all in that regard.","And finally with respect to the results from Lilly, the disappointing results with solanezumab, again, I don't think that that speaks specifically to the validity of the A-beta hypothesis or the general hypothesis that processing of amyloid precursor protein into potentially toxic peptides contributes to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's dementia and other dementias. I think the genetic data are very clear that in general one associates an increase in processing as a result of which alleles one inherits, whether the precursor protein itself or of the beta secretase. One associates increased processing with a higher likelihood of progressing to dementing illness during life.","The question is if we block that, if we phenocopy a reduction of beta secretase activity, will that reduce progress of dementing illness or the likelihood of becoming demented, and how early do we have to do that? And of course, that's what we're testing with our beta secretase inhibitor, verubecestat, which is an excellent beta secretase inhibitor. We can dramatically reduce beta secretase activity and reduce the levels of A-beta peptides and cerebrospinal fluid. The question is are we getting in early enough, and time will tell.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks. We'll move on to the next speaker, Darla.","Operator","It's from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA)","Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. So I just had a couple here. One, you talked a little bit about the BACE and the CHMP data you'll have later this year. Are there any other data readouts that you'd highlight as being important from the pipeline perspective? Maybe people are underappreciating beyond BACE and CTP and I guess beyond KEYNOTE-189, which has also been discussed here.","And then my second one, if you could just maybe provide a little bit more of a breakdown in terms of the percentage of KEYTRUDA sales in the fourth quarter that came from each of the different indications, especially in the U.S., as you gain more of the lung impact so far? Thank you.","Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.","So let me start with the KEYTRUDA numbers. And again, the data is not perfect, but I'll give you a rough estimate. The total sales were $483 million globally. The U.S. was $311 million. Rest of the world was $172 million. A rough estimate for the U.S. is that about 40% of sales were melanoma. About 30% of the sales were in lung cancer, about 15% in head and neck, and then 15% in all other categories.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Right. So, Vamil, there's a lot of data coming out over the next year. And of course, there's a very substantial amount of KEYTRUDA data that we'll be seeing, which we've already mentioned, that relates to the enormous breadth of indications. That's the first thing. The second thing, of course, as we talked about already, is we're going to be seeing data from the REVEAL study and from BACE.","Beyond that, of course, you're going to be seeing additional data from our ertugliflozin data that is in diabetes, Type 2 diabetes. We have a lot of data in the HIV setting and generally in infectious diseases. So both doravirine Phase 3 data, which should be presented relatively early in 2017. And we're going to be seeing a lot more information coming from as well the letermovir CMV data that you'll have a chance to look at, which could be quite important. And finally, there's data from our acquisition of Afferent in the chronic cough setting. This is our P2X3 antagonist, and that could be quite interesting. And you'll have a chance to see some of those Phase 2b data as well. So a lot of data coming out in 2017.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Okay, we'll move on to the next question, please.","Operator","It's from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, just a question maybe for you, Adam, on what you expect for the uptake of chemo combo. Assuming you get approval, which we are, how do you see the uptake of KEYTRUDA\/ALIMTA given that this trial was a limited trial, only 60 patients in the KEYTRUDA arm, KEYTRUDA\/chemo arm? We don't yet have overall survival. The reason I'm asking the question is that your own KEYNOTE-189 will be reporting out just a few months later. I don't recall how many patients are in the KEYTRUDA\/chemo arm. But also the Roche trial with about 1,100 patients or 400 in each arm with PFS and potentially OS will be reporting out, again, a few months later. Do you expect physicians to wait for the larger Phase 3 clinical trials, or is your expectation that there is so much pent-up demand that you would expect a strong uptake?","And then secondly, there are still so many questions that the key debates have yet to be resolved. I think market expectations on I-O\/I-O have changed, but we really haven't seen data yet. How are you thinking about KEYTRUDA front-line lung and the competitive dynamic in 2018 and 2019, when presumably others will be on the market? Thanks.","Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Hi, Jami. So, first of all, when you think about KEYNOTE-021G, it certainly opens up the entire market for first-line for non-squamous patients. And once it's in the label, I think physicians will tend to use the product. Our representatives will be able to promote it appropriately. They'll be able to talk about the data and the information. And typically, the physicians will follow the label on something as important as first-line lung cancer, where people don't have great alternatives. I think that we will be able to see physicians begin to use it as soon as we have the data in the label.","With regard to progression-free survival versus overall survival, remember, we launched melanoma with progression-free survival, and we were able to get very rapid uptake there. And I think physicians understand that having that in your label is going to make a difference. So I do believe that it will give us a lead in first-line lung for sure, once the data are available. And obviously, once the second study is out there, then I think it's even going to help us further into the future.","As I start to think about I-O\/I-O combinations, I'm glad that we're doing those trials, because we don't have all the information that we need to figure out exactly where the future is going to take us. But the good news is, we're off to a great start. Hopefully, we'll get KEYNOTE-021G in the label, which will give us even a further head start in first-line lung. Physicians will become very comfortable using KEYTRUDA as the drug of choice in first-line lung where it's approved. And then over time, I think we'll have a very solid position in the trials that Roger and his team are looking at across I-O\/I-O combinations will only be helpful as we learn more.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Great, we'll move on to the next question please, Darla.","Operator","It's from Tony Butler with Guggenheim.","Charles Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yes, thanks very much, two questions. One for you, Rob, on the operating expenses of some modest increase, or expectations for some modest increase in 2017. I'm struck by the notion that, even in the midst of VYTORIN and ZETIA's LOEs, where that, I would argue, free up some capital, you are still going to grow op expenses. But moreover, is that simply dependent upon what might occur with KEYNOTE-021G midyear? Is it dependent upon that approval or not?","And second, Roger, back to the notion of types of chemo that one might utilize with pembrolizumab, I was struck in ClinicalTrials.gov of your own CDK inhibitor. I think it's MK-7965 in conjunction with pembro, I guess in malignancies in the KEYNOTE-155 trial, but it may have utility in others, and just your thoughts around different mechanisms, more specific mechanisms, than simply something like ALIMTA or paclitaxel. Thanks for your time.","Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.","Tony, this is Rob. Thanks for the question. As we look at this, I think this really goes back to something we started talking about even back in the third quarter, as we started giving some indications of what we saw coming into 2017.","Clearly, we recognize the need to pivot and try to manage expense in the year of patent expiries. However, we also recognize, and frankly feel good about, the fact that we have such a strong opportunity with KEYTRUDA that to try to pull back on some of those important clinical studies \u2013 as you know, we have over 420 studies underway for a product that clearly is starting to show it can be a leader in the space, only to manage for the short term, we felt, was not the right decision. So we made a decision to still invest in R&D. That's why R&D is actually growing. We are holding SG&A relatively flat. And I think that's also important because, on the back of what's coming with KEYTRUDA in first-line lung cancer and across the other indications it has, we want to make sure we're also investing for a successful global launch of those products.","As far as to the specific question of, is this dependent on KEYNOTE-021G, the answer is no. Obviously, we will adapt our spend depending on what we see happening throughout the year, but there's not a specific trigger tied to KEYNOTE-021G. And I would point out that we will remain disciplined and continue to make the right decisions and resource allocations so that we can ultimately, in the long term, get back to a leveraged P&L. I think we're in a unique situation where we have such an opportunity, we don't want to lose it. We're going to invest behind it, but we're going to do so in a disciplined way.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Tony, it's Roger. So I think the general logic of this is that, if we want to improve responses to KEYTRUDA, we need to recruit more immune cells and lower the barrier to activation of those cells. That's the general logic.","When you look at indices of responsiveness to KEYTRUDA, there are two things that clearly contribute, as has been reported by us and by others. First of all is mutational burden, so the representation of things that, in principle, immune cells could recognize. And the second is the pre-existing immune response, usually judged by something like PD-L1 expression or gamma-interferon or something like that.","The combination with chemotherapy can improve immune responses just by releasing a lot of material from cell death, and in essence, cross-priming immune systems, so it can do that. It can improve responses through mutagenesis, or it can more generally change the inflammatory milieu. All of those things are possible, and the different chemotherapeutic agents can do those different things. So as we learn more about each patient and what the problem is that is required to achieve a better immune response, we should be able to harness those things better.","Maybe the answer is to increase mutagenesis in a particular patient, and maybe radiation therapy is the best thing to use. Maybe, on the other hand, it's really a matter of tumor lysis to present more antigen, in which case, for example, directly cytotoxic drugs or cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors might be good. So a whole variety of things to explore, and we're trying to do that in a sensible and scientific way.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks. We'll move on to the next question. We're going to try to squeeze in a couple more here.","Operator","The next question is from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, folks, and congratulations on a strong 2016 and all the progress with KEYTRUDA, a couple for Roger on the BACE inhibitor and the EPOCH study in Alzheimer's. Does the design and the statistical plan account for some of the potential limitations, such as not screening patients for beta amyloid and also including moderate patients? Also, to what extent \u2013 can you give us an approximate breakdown of what we should expect in terms of mild and moderate patients in that study? And will you be looking at activity in those patients in a prospective manner as an endpoint as opposed to the ad hoc analyses that we often see? Thank you.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.","Right, Alex. So with respect to the first study, you're right. There was no imaging done for amyloid in the first study, in part because at the time of the start of the study that was not so easy to do. We did, however, try and pay attention to the representation of APOE subsets by stratification, which will improve the representation of individuals who likely have amyloid-enhanced Alzheimer's by the traditional definition.","In terms of the study itself, measuring the progression of cognitive improvement, it's a fairly traditional set of measures. And roughly speaking, the representation of mild versus moderate is about 50:50. So we're eager to see the results. We will do a lot of subset analyses no matter what. And we are in a position, I think, because of the size of the study and the care with which the study was conducted, to get a lot of information. Fingers crossed, we're hopeful that we'll actually see a positive result.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","It's from Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. First for Ken, you and your colleagues seemed quite constructive post the meeting with the President. I just want to make sure you're confident post the meeting, that there's not a proposal in the works to create some sort of bidding or direct negotiation process. I just want to make sure there's not a false sense of security building here. I'm not sure to what degree that came up, but perhaps you could go beyond just what you learned at the meeting on that front.","And secondly for Rob on gross margin, is KEYTRUDA gross margin still well above the corporate average even after that new royalty burden? And is there anything else you'd like us to understand about product-specific gross margin as we think about the evolution of your gross margin this year and longer term as we model revenues for the different products? Thanks.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.","I'll start with the question you asked. So obviously, we can't say what people in the Trump administration are thinking beyond what we heard in that meeting. And what we heard in that meeting I think gives us a lot of confidence that the Trump administration does understand the challenges associated with research-based pharmaceutical industry growth going forward. What I heard from Mr. Trump was a concern less around the cost of drugs in the aggregate but more around how patients need to be able to afford their co-pays and things of that nature.","So since that was the discussion in the meeting, we were thinking about okay, we know that under the Part D benefit it's coming way under what was forecast. We know that substantial discounts are being negotiated by large players in the system. The question becomes how do we get some of that value to come to individual patients at the counter. The discussion went in that direction, and I think that's a legitimate issue for American patients. And we want to see how we can harness the private markets to actually help patients afford their medicines more on an individual basis. But we did not have a conversation in there that leads me to believe that they think the solution to that problem is secretarial negotiations. Now there will be politics around that. We know that there will be bills that are introduced in Congress calling for that. But the fact of the matter is I think that that is not perceived to be the solution to the problem.","Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.","And with your question on gross margin, yes, KEYTRUDA's gross margin, even with the royalty, is above, well above the corporate gross margin. And as we look at the mix of headwinds and tailwinds that drive gross margin going forward, growth in KEYTRUDA is clearly one of the larger tailwinds for our overall gross margin into the future, even with the royalty included.","Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Rob. Darla, unfortunately I think we're almost out of time here. Ken's got a few final words. But for any analyst that didn't get on the call with questions, the IR team is around throughout the day to answer those questions, and I'll let Ken finish off.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.","So I want to thank you all for being here this morning. If I could leave just one comment, we are extremely confident going into the future. I think you can see from our guidance that we are actually implying EPS growth despite headwinds in loss of exclusivity and FX and the other challenges we face. We're looking forward to our progress at first-line lung, to the KEYNOTE-021G filing and things of that nature, and I think we look forward to having tremendous opportunities going forward.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Joseph Romanelli, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Joseph Romanelli ","Okay, thank you, Jackie and good morning, everyone. We\u2019d also like to say good afternoon and good evening to everyone listening outside the United States. Welcome to Merck\u2019s third quarter 2014 conference call. Before I turn the call over to Ken, I want to remind you of a couple of items.","First, there are a number of items in the GAAP results, such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items. We've excluded these items at our non-GAAP reconciliation tables and you can see them in our press release in table two. This will give you a better sense of our underlying performance.","There are three tables in the press release. The first table provides the GAAP results, Table No. 2 reconciles our GAAP P&L to the non-GAAP results and Table 3 provides sales performance for the Company\u2019s business units and our products, both on a reported basis and excluding foreign exchange. During the call, we will be referring to Table 2 when we discuss the P&L and Table 3 when we talk about revenue performance.","Finally, I would like to remind you that some of the statements we make during today\u2019s call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are based upon Merck\u2019s current beliefs and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.","If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. The Company\u2019s SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2013 10-K identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement. Our SEC filings can be found on the web site at merck.com and you can also find our earnings release and all the tables there as well.","Now with that, I'd like to say good morning to Ken Frazier, our Chairman and CEO; Rob Davis, our CFO; Adam Schechter, Head of Global Human Health; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, Head of Merck Research Labs. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ken Frazier. Ken?","Ken Frazier ","Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining the call today. We again reported solid earnings this morning, but before I discuss our performance, please allow me to remind you of the strategy that consistently guides us. ","Merck remains focused on bringing forward medicines and vaccines that make a difference to patients, payers and healthcare systems around the world. In a healthcare marketplace, where resources are increasingly scarce, our strategy continues to be all about meaningful innovation. To accomplish this, last October, we announced our global initiative to sharpen our commercial and R&D focus, redesign our operating model and reduce our cost base. We launched this multi-year initiative to transform Merck into a more competitive, more innovative company and to build a platform for sustained future growth.","Now one year later, I'm pleased to report that this quarter's results reflect the steady progress we've made in each of these areas. We identified four areas of focus where we will compete to win and our investments are paying off. In our diabetes business, we reallocated resources and invested significantly in JANUVIA and have now reported our second consecutive quarter of growth in the U.S. and in international market. This marks an important turnaround from where we were last year.","Our acute care business grew by double digits this quarter as we're now seeing the impact of our investments. These brands will continue to be key drivers of growth in emerging markets. Our vaccines business remains a fundamental contributor to Merck, despite a decline this quarter due to the timing of U.S. public sector purchases. We're also looking forward the regulatory action for V503, our next generation 9-valent vaccine for HPV.","And in oncology, our integrated business unit has made strides to file and launch KEYTRUDA. This quarter, we received approval from the FDA for KEYTRUDA, the first anti-PD1 therapy approved in the U.S. for advanced melanoma. And I'm happy to report that we also recently received breakthrough designation from the FDA for KEYTRUDA as a potential therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer.","We continue to study KEYTRUDA in more than 30 different tumor types and are encouraged by recent data presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology in five different cancers. Roger will talk more in a few minutes about the progress we continue to make with the KEYTRUDA program and Adam will discuss the recent U.S. launch in advanced melanoma. ","Also during the third quarter, we received U.S. approval from the FDA for BELSOMRA, our novel treatment for insomnia, which we anticipate launching early next year. In addition to increasing our focus on the key therapeutic areas that represent our best opportunities, we continued to rigorously prioritize our portfolio to ensure that all of our businesses have the potential to be market leaders and create value for shareholders. This approach led us to divest human health product business areas that amounted to nearly $1 billion annual revenue. That focus also led to the recently completed sale of our $2 billion revenue consumer care business to buyer.","We then employed the proceeds of that sale to complete the acquisition of Idenix and to increase our return of cash to shareholders this year. The same approach let us to a different conclusion with regard to our animal health business, which we believe will continue to generate long-term value for Merck. ","Animal health saw strong growth this quarter across all species. We look forward to additional innovation coming out of our animal health pipeline and remain committed to growing this business, which is already a market leader in key segments of the global animal health market.","Let me now turn to the progress we made in sharpening the focus of our R&D organization. Along with the strong progress we\u2019ve made on our KEYTRUDA program, we continue to advance our work to develop a highly effective once daily oral pan-genotypic regimen of the treatment of hepatitis C. As I mentioned earlier, we also completed the acquisition of Idenix Pharmaceuticals and its promising portfolio of hepatitis C candidates which complement our internal development efforts. We will continue to focus on our highest potential growth opportunities, while rigorously prioritizing our pipeline, bolstering it with external assets while divesting our out licensing programs and candidates that are better suited to create value elsewhere.","For example this quarter we entered into an agreement to out-license MK-3222 our investigational treatment for chronic fasciolosis to Sun Pharma. All of these actions are keeping with our intention to be the premier research intensive biopharmaceutical company.","Lastly we\u2019ve made significant progress in redesigning our operating model and reducing our cost base. You will recall that last October we targeted a net reduction in annual operating expenses of approximately $2.5 billion off our full year 2012 expense levels by the end of 2015. As a result of disciplined cost management, I\u2019m pleased that we remain on track to achieve our target for 2014 and our overall savings goal by the end of 2015. These savings have enabled to better target resources to key priorities across the enterprise and to accomplish the goals I\u2019ve mentioned today.","At the same time, this discipline allowed us to return a high level of cash to shareholders through both the dividend and our stock repurchase program. Over the past 12 months we\u2019ve returned nearly $11.5 billion to our shareholders. We are rebuilding Merck for sustainable future growth. We've sharpened our commercial focus and on launching products with the potential to make a significant difference to patients, while providing value to payers, providers and healthcare systems.","We focused and prioritized our R&D efforts so that we may continue to translate cutting edge science into medicines and vaccines that have meaningful differentiated attributes, and we continue to aggressively manage our costs to ensure that our resources are focused on our most promising opportunities for growth. Taken together, these actions have created nearly and longer term opportunities that will allow Merck to continue drive value for both shareholders and society.","And now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Adam Schechter.","Adam Schechter","","Thank you Ken and good morning everyone. This morning I\u2019ll provide you with an overview of Global Human Health third quarter results and also provide some commentary on the early days of the KEYTRUDA launch. My commentary will be on a constant currency basis. Overall sales reached $9.1 billion reflecting the following: growth in core areas such as diabetes, immunology and acute care, which were offset by more than $150 million in product divestitures, hepatitis C market dynamics and patent expiries.","First I\u2019ll review our core product areas and then I\u2019ll provide an update on our regional performance and I\u2019ll start with primary care. The JANUVIA franchise reached more than $1.4 billion in sales and grew 5% in the quarter, reflecting growth in the U.S. and international markets. In the U.S. sales grew 6% on continued volume increases. We are encouraged by the growth trends we saw in the third quarter in the month of October. We are seeing positive results from our efforts to defend our 75% market share and to grow the DPP-4 class.","In our international market sales grew 4%, driven by Europe and the emerging markets. Sales declined in Japan due to the 10% re-pricing that occurred in April and the overall competitive environment for DPP-4s. We are confident that we will deliver global sales growth for JANUVIA franchise in 2014.","Next in hospital and specialty care; sales of ISENTRESS were approximately $410 million in the third quarter, a decline of 3%. Internationally our growth in Europe was balanced by the timing of tenders in the emerging markets. In the U.S. ISENTRESS sales were impacted by customer buying patterns and the competitive dynamics in the HIV market.","Several immunology products reached more than $770 million in the third quarter, growing 9%. We are seeing continued strong uptick with Simponi across multiple indications and Simponi remains the fastest growing anti-TNF in markets where we promote. REMICADE grew 3% reflecting growth in core markets and offset by biosimilar competition in some of the smaller EU markets. In acute care, sales exceeded $600 million and grew by 17% this quarter.","Growth was driven by continued up take of Bridion in Japan, Europe and emerging markets and solid performances across our portfolio of antibiotics and antifungals. While growth rates may vary from quarter to quarter due to timing of tenders, we continue to expect this core area to be an important contributor to future growth.","Now turning to our vaccine business. In the third quarter vaccine sales were approximately $1.7 billion, a decline of 6%, primarily due to roughly $100 million of U.S public sector purchases of GARDASIL and RotaTeq in the third quarter of last year that did not occur in the third quarter of this year. Sales of ZOSTAVAX were approximately $180 million in the quarter, declining 2% compared to last year.","As we enter the flu season in the United States, we have initiated promotional efforts, including a new direct-to-consumer campaign to educate consumers of the importance of talking to their physicians and their pharmacists about shingles. We have broad access for ZOSTAVAX and we are working with customers to help them understand the reimbursement process.","Now turning to some geographic highlights in the third quarter, in the United States sales declined 8% as growth in the JANUVIA franchise and Dulera was offset by lower vaccine sales, the loss of exclusivity of TEMODAR and declines in our HCV portfolio.","In Europe sales are 1%. We drove continued growth in diabetes, immunology and ISENTRESS, where sales were impacted by the divesture of our ophthalmology products continued declined in HCV portfolio and a generic erosion for NASONEX. Sales in Japan declined 14%, primarily due to biannual price decreases and ophthalmology price divestures.","Sales in emerging markets grew 8%. China grew 33%, in part due to timing of purchases. Demand in China remains strong for a broad portfolio of innovative and also established products. Other important emerging markets such as Turkey and Mexico also delivered solid growth in the quarter.","For the full year, we continue to expect that the emerging markets will be good growth drivers. Now I\u2019ll spend a few more minutes speaking about the early days of the KEYTRUDA launch. First let me say, we are very excited to launch the first and the only anti-PD-1 therapy approved in the United States. We are still in the early days of launch but we have been moving rapidly to ensure the medicine is available to patients and feedback from our customers is very encouraging.","Upon approval, we think KEYTRUDA will be available within a week and we were taking orders and shipping in just a couple of days. Our colleagues in manufacturing worked tirelessly to ensure that patient would have access to this important medication as soon as possible.","On the commercial side we reached the top ipilimumab prescribers in a matter of days from approval. We\u2019ve now expanded our reach into community practitioners. We have reached more than 75% of the key physicians and we have made multiple call into many of the high volume prescribers.","Regarding access, most payers are covering the cost of KEYTRUDA for its current indication without restrictions. Additionally we offer patient assistance for patients requiring reimbursement assistance. As we said at approval, we believe there are about 1,200 patients in the U.S, who are eligible for KEYTRUDA based upon our current label. Additionally we expect a few hundred new patients to become eligible for treatment with KEYTRUDA each month.","Since approval in early September, we believe that approximately 900 patients are being treated with KEYTRUDA. Many of these patients were previously part of the expanded access program and are now in a process of moving from the EAP to promotional product. Our global oncology business unit is passionately engaged on maximizing the potential for KEYTRUDA for appropriate patients. We are looking forward to sharing more launch details with you on the fourth quarter earnings call.","In summary, Global Human Health is transitioning to through a period of patent expiration divestures. Since late last year we have consciously re-directed our focus to core product areas, to core markets and to new product launches. We drove growth in many of these core areas and we are successfully introducing KEYTRUDA to the U.S market for patients suffering from advanced melanoma. We continue to prioritize our investments and we are intent on driving future growth and broadening our impact in Global Health.","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to my colleague, Rob Davis.","Rob Davis","Thanks Adam. Good morning everyone. We've had solid results in the first nine months of the year. Our third quarter results demonstrate that we continue to sharpen our focus as a Company and as Ken mentioned our cost production program is on track. This morning I\u2019ll provide additional color on our P&L and comment on our outlook for the rest of the year. My remarks will focus on our non-GAAP financials.","Total company revenues were $10.6 billion for the quarter a decrease of 4% year over year, with a 1% benefit from Foreign Exchange. This decrease reflects in part the loss of more than $400 million of sales in the prior year from divestitures and the now ended joint venture with AstraZeneca. ","As Adam stated, our sales in the pharmaceutical business were driven by solid performance in our key brands, which have benefitted from continued resource allocation to our priority therapeutic areas by diabetes and acute care. Animal health revenues increased $83 million or 10% year-over-year, excluding exchange. These results were driven by strong performance across the portfolio, including significant growth in our companion animal and poultry businesses. Consumer care revenues decreased 9%, excluding exchange. As a reminder, this is the last quarter in which we will record sales results from consumer care business since the transaction of Bayer closed on October 1st.","Moving now to expenses, gross margin was 74.3% in the quarter, which represents a 30 basis point increase year-over-year. We continue to expect the 2014 full year gross margin to be slightly lower than 2013's full year ratio of 74.3%. Marketing and administrative expenses were $148 million lower than the prior year, driven by reductions in direction selling and promotion costs.","We continue to focus our resources on key markets and core products, while ensuring we appropriately invest in our product portfolio launches, and in support of these efforts, we expect M&A expenses to be sequentially higher in the fourth quarter. Research and development expenses were $1.5 billion in the quarter, a $109 million lower than prior year. We expect our R&D expense in the fourth quarter to be higher year-over-year as we invest in our portfolio. ","Finally, regarding the tax rate, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 26.5% in the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. We continue to anticipate the tax rate for the full year to be between 24% and 26%. In terms of our bottom line performance, we earned $0.90 per share in the third quarter as compared to $0.92 per share in the prior year.","Now, our outlook for the rest of the year. On the top line, we are narrowing our revenue guidance to $42.4 billion to $42.8 billion at current exchange rates. This takes into account recent currency movements, as well as a public sector vaccine purchase in the third quarter of last year that did not occur this year, which Adam described earlier.","We are also narrowing our non-GAAP EPS range raising the bottom end of the range to $3.46 and lowering the upper end to $3.50, while maintaining the same midpoint. Our EPS range reflects our strong performance in the first nine months of the year and includes the absorption of roughly $0.06 to $0.09 of dilution from the consumer care divestiture and the Idenix acquisition.","On a GAAP basis, we expect to earn between $4.06 and $4.29 in 2014. Both M&A and R&D expense in 2014 are expected to be lower than 2013 and as I said earlier, we remain on track to achieve our target of $2.5 billion reduction in expenses off of the 2012 base by the end of 2015. ","Now touching briefly on capital allocation, by the end of the year, we will have deployed the balance of the after tax proceeds from the Bayer transaction, net of cash used for the Idenix acquisition for share repurchase. We continue to project our average diluted shares outstanding will be slightly lower than 2.95 billion shares for 2014.","We remain focused on our commitment to return cash to shareholders, and as Ken said, we have returned over $11 billion to shareholders over the past 12 months in the form of dividends and share repurchases. As we look at capital markets more broadly, we recently took advantage of favorable market conditions and restructured some of our debt through a tender offer and a $2.5 billion debt offering. We are pleased with the results of the transactions which created economic value for the Company and will benefit annual interest expense in 2015 and beyond. ","In summary, the third quarter was another solid quarter for Merck. Since our announcement at this time last year, we have refocused our business and divested non-core assets with 2013 full year sales of approximately $3 billion. In addition, we continue to term our expense base putting a solid way on track to achieve our expense reductions by the end of 2015, while also investing in our promising new product launches and pipeline.","Now I will turn the call over to Roger. ","Roger Perlmutter","","Thanks, Rob. The third quarter was an especially busy one for our regulatory affairs group, with multiple product approvals in several important areas. In August, our novel first-in-class orexin receptor antagonist, BELSOMRA was approved by the U.S. FDA. BELSOMRA acts to improve sleep initiation and sleep maintenance in patients suffering from insomnia. As Ken mentioned, the BELSOMRA launch will begin early next year. In September, we gained approval of BELSOMRA in Japan, where we also gained approval of vaniprevir, a potent highly selective protease inhibitor for the treatment of genotype-1 hepatitis C virus infection. ","Also in September, we received approval for KEYTRUDA, our monoclonal antibody directive against PD-1 for the treatment of patients with advanced malignant melanoma refractory to currently available therapies. As I had previously mentioned, our development program of KEYTRUDA has expanded to include more than two dozen studies around the world, involving more than 6,000 patients and addressing more than 30 different tumor types.","At the European Society for Medical Oncology meetings earlier this month, we presented data documenting the activity of KEYTRUDA in patients with gastric, bladder and head and neck cancers and also presented more comprehensive data describing the activity of KEYTRUDA in patients suffering from ligand melanoma or non-small cell lung cancer. Today we announced that the U.S. FDA has granted breakthrough designation to KEYTRUDA for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer in patients who have failed platinum-based therapies and whose tumors do not bear EGF-receptor or alk gene mutations.","We are working closely with the FDA to define an optimal data set that would permit registration of KEYTRUDA for this important indication. Later in the year we expect to have a chance to describe our studies of KEYTRUDA in patients with so called triple-negative breast cancer at the San Antonio Breast Cancer conference and then some hematologic malignancies at the American Society of Rheumatology meeting. ","Combination studies employing KEYTRUDA for the treatment of a variety of devastating malignancies are also underway. These studies employing conventional therapeutic modalities as well as novel targeted agents will benefit enormously from the broad understanding of KEYTRUDA monotherapy that we are developing. ","Turning now to infectious diseases, we are looking forward to the upcoming American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases meeting next month. During the meeting we plan to present complete data from Phase 2 studies of our MK-5172 8742 doublet. I will remind you that the FDA has granted breakthrough designation to these agents for the treatment of Hepatitis C virus infection. Indeed the Phase 3 registration program for MK-5172 8742 is now completely enrolled and we expect to see data from these studies in the first half of 2015.","At AASLD, we will also present early data from the C-Swift study, which pairs the MK-5172 8742 doublet with the nucleoside polymerase inhibitor, Sofosbuvir. The goal of these studies, which we announced five months ago at our business review to is advance the case given the case for an all oral ribavirin-free genotype independent regimen that can be used in patients irrespective of comorbidities, for example in patients with established cirrhosis, simultaneous infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus and\/or renal insufficiency; and that will achieve sustained virologic responses over a shorter course of therapy. ","Because of the difficulties in ensuring patient adherence in the real world, shorter course therapy is clearly desirable. Our triple-therapy regimens have been enabled by our recently completed acquisition of Idenix Pharmaceuticals, through which we gained access to potent nucleoside polymerase inhibitor that we now call MK-3682. Data describing the effectiveness of MK-3682 monotherapy will also be presented at the AASLD meeting.","Beyond HCV, we continue to make very good progress in rolling other Phase 3 infectious disease therapeutics programs, including once daily ISENTRESS and letermovir, a treatment for patients at risk from disseminated cytomegalovirus infection. During November we also expect to present the results of IMPROVE-IT. Our study testing weather a cholesterol lowering regimen of ezetimibe plus simvastatin versus simvastatin alone improves outcomes in patients at high risk for major cardiovascular events.","The first patient was enrolled in this trial exactly nine years ago. With design and protocol review, it has been a decade since the question that the trial addresses was first posed. In all, IMPROVE-IT enrolled 18,145 patients presenting with stabilized acute coronary syndromes. There been more than 5000 composite events that will soon be reviewed.","The MRO clinical team and I along with the rest of Merck management remain blinded to the data, and our statisticians have only a very short period to conduct analysis before the presentation in mid-November. My number one consideration regarding the study has been to ensure that we work closely with our academic colleagues to obtain a complete and robust dataset generated during the decade that it has taken to conduct IMPROVE-IT.","Given the size and complexity of this study, I expect that the IMPROVE-IT data will provide important insights into the appropriate care of patients at high risk for major coronary adverse events. Returning briefly to regulatory affairs, we have now submitted our complete response to FDA questions regarding Sugammadex, our parenteral agent for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade during anesthesia.","Included in this response are new studies designed to examine hyper sensitivity reactions that can occur with Sugammadex administration, as well as an updated review of our Pharmaco-Vigilance experience, with Sugammadex, which is marketed in more than 50 countries as Bridion.","Separately we have had a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA to discuss our Odanacatib results. We have agreed together upon a plan to characterize more completely the adjudicated adverse event reporting in this study, which will mean that our filing will be delayed until 2015. The data that we presented at the ASPMR meeting in September demonstrate that Odanacatib could provide a meaningful therapeutic option to reduce the frequency of osteoporotic fractures in women at high risk for these events.","Finally as Ken mentioned we continue to work closely with the FDA on the review of the V503 our 9-valent Human-Papillomavirus vaccine for the reduction of cervical malignancy. We expect that the FDA will complete its review before the end of the year. Joe?","Joseph Romanelli","","Great, thank you Roger. And Jackie I think, we're ready to start the Q&A segment of the call. Just as reminder, if you can limit yourself to one or two questions, that way we can get to as many as caller possible. So Jackie, I think we'll turn it over to the first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Chris Schott - JPMorgan","","Just two questions here. First, with the breakthrough status in lung for KEYTRUDA, can you just update us on anything about your filing strategy or at least key data points we should be watching for that could support a filing in lung? And then second, just your thoughts on TECOS and risk of heart failure with JANUVIA; there's obviously been a lot of discussion around this point as of late and we want just to get Merck's perspective on the risks associated with that study. Thanks very much.","Roger Perlmutter","","Yes, Chris, just with respect to the filing strategy I think -- we certainly are pleased to have gained breakthrough designation for non-small cell lung cancer. As you know, we have a number of studies underway, large studies and we have the opportunity to look at those studies and we are working closely with the agency to develop and ideal registration strategy as I indicated. So we won\u2019t just have any more to say about that than what I have said to this point. With respect to TECOS, I think that we do expect that the final patient will be available -- patient data will be available, last patient, last visit by the end of the year. This is of course a study that's been conducted -- led by academic institutions. So we\u2019ll be made aware of those data.","I think it\u2019s important to recognize that the data safety and monitoring board has been following this study extremely carefully. The observations that have been made in other studies, employing regimens to treat diabetes are well known to the data safety and monitoring board. The last data safety and monitoring board review was in December of last year. Given that, the fact that the DSMB came back and said the study should be continued without change, I think it provides some reassurance with respect to the overall conduct of the study. It's a large study and would important answers to questions about the meaningfulness of intervention with sitagliptin in patients with type two diabetes.","Joseph Romanelli","","Okay, great. Thank you, Roger. Jackie next caller?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink ","","So a couple of quick questions for Roger. Roger, can you talk to us a little bit about -- I don\u2019t see PD-L1 status highlighted for the breakthrough designation for KEYTRUDA, but my understanding is that much of the data that was generated in non-small cell lung cancer was in the PD-L1 positive patient population. Can you just clarify for us if this indication is specific to the PD-L1 patient population or if it isn\u2019t and it is actually for the broader patient population.","And then as we think about the next sort of data points in the KEYNOTE-010 study, can you just update us on whether or not you've officially taken the look at the response rates which is sort of specified on clinical trials.gov relative to the 2 milligram and 10 milligram dose and if that look included a comparison to Taxotere. The reason I ask is if that can be utilized as supported evidence for a potential filing. Thanks.","Roger Perlmutter","","Thanks Seamus. First of all, the breakthrough designation is not specific to PD-L1 positive patients and as you know, we have done quite a lot of work. I\u2019m trying to understand the meaningfulness of PD-L1 positivity, what we\u2019ve shown in a whole variety of settings is that patients whose tumors are judged PD-L1 negative, or more precisely the fall into the PD-L1 staining less than 1% category, nevertheless do demonstrate some responses and we and other groups that studying this are still in the midst of trying to understand exactly how to correlate PD-L1 expression status with outcomes. We know there is a relationship but exactly what the meaningfulness of that is, I think remains to be elucidated.","With respect to the KEYNOTE-010 study, as I've indicated, we have a variety of different ways that we can look at these data in order to come up with an optimal registration strategy and that something that through the close interaction that we have with the FDA, and we\u2019ll have more particularly because of the breakthrough designation that we\u2019re going to be doing in order to come up with the best possible strategy.","Joseph Romanelli","","Thank you, Seamus. And Jackie, next caller?","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI.","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI ","","Maybe just a follow on Seamus. The KEYNOTE-010 Roger, what is the timeline for data readout on that? Can you update us? I believe last time you spoke about it, you had talked about late 2015. Could you just remind me if that\u2019s correct or incorrect data? And then on hepatitis C if I may Roger, last call you expressed a great -- what I interpreted to be a great period of optimism for the four week regimen. Obviously the bar is very, very high given the Gilead data that is out there. I was wondering if you could update us on your expectations for the four-week data? And I know this is the third but this is just a yes or no. Just to be clear, the breakthrough designation was for -- if I'm reading the press release -- so that was actually for second line and later lung. Is that correct?","Roger Perlmutter","","Mark, first of all the breakthrough designation doesn\u2019t specify line of therapy. The breakthrough designation is for patients who have failed platinum based therapies, and that\u2019s understandable of course, because you get breakthrough designation for those circumstances under which there is the anticipation of a meaningful intervention beyond what exists as standard of care. So that's understandable I think.","With respect to the KEYNOTE-010 study, again I think the timing remains as before. We continue to march forward with that study. We as I said have opportunities to examine that data at different times and one of the things that we'll be doing is discussing that with the agency, but we do expect to have data available by the end of next year for sure.","And then with respect to hep C, I think the important thing to remember here is that what we proposed when we described the study back in May was that a triplet regimen would provide the opportunity to test whether it was possible to get sustained virologic responses that is eradication with very short regimens. We don't know what the nature of those regimens would be. And so we've tried to bookend those for genotype 1 and genotype 3 in the C-SWIFT study. We have access now of course to 3682, our own nucleoside polymerase inhibitor, and the things that we learn, from our studies was Sofosbuvir can then be applied to our triplet studies with 3682 recognizing of course that no two polymerase inhibitors will behave in exactly the same way, but it basically provides the kind of guidance that we need in order to design effective Phase III study. So we're looking forward to having the opportunity to review in those data in detail.","Joseph Romanelli","","Great, thank you Mark. And Jackie, next caller. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets","","Roger, just a follow up on those comments. Could you please remind us what the similarities and differences are from what you can tell from your [indiscernible] Sovaldi? And Adam, could you please give us a little bit more on the Gardasil performance and your outlook. It seems to have been a little bit lower than expectations?","Ken Frazier","","Roger?","Roger Perlmutter","So Alex, you will have the opportunity to see Phase Ib data for MK-3682 at AASLD, which will be interesting. But of course it's very difficult to compare two different agents, when they're not studied in the head-to-head context because of differences in patient population. I can't really speculate about that. We'll have the opportunity to look at those kinds of data sometime later but right now I think the important thing will be to look at the data -- the Phase Ib data which I think you will find intriguing. ","Ken Frazier","","And Alex, regarding Gardasil, let me provide some additional context. So sales in total were $590 million for the quarter. The U.S. declined 7%. The U.S. declines were mostly due to higher public sector purchases in 2013. That did not occur in 2014. If you look at the cumulative 15 to 18 year old penetration rates in the U.S., it's about 65% for females, and about 50% for male. So there's still room to grow there.","If you look at males, we continue to have good uptake and if you look at the private sector data, it suggests that about 50% to 55% of first doses are now being administered to males. If you look outside the U.S., the declines were due to Korea, and also there is the end of the catch up cohorts in several of the smaller markets. But overall we continue to be pleased with our market share greater than 90% on a global basis and 99% in the U.S. and we believe that there is still room for additional growth in the future.","Joseph Romanelli","","Okay, great. Thank you, Alex. And Jackie, next caller.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of John Boris with SunTrust.","John Boris - SunTrust","","First question just for Ken. I think you traditionally go through your planning process this time of year. I know you can't give, or not ready to prepare -- to give guidance for 2015, but if you can just help us understand what some of the pushes and pulls are? Especially since 2015, you've indicated us return to growth year going into that year. So that would be very helpful? And then for Roger, if you can just characterize why it's so difficult to potential to get four weeks of therapy in the HCV population at either four or eight weeks going forward that would be real helpful?","Ken Frazier","","So let me start by saying of course we are not giving 2015 guidance today. We'll do that on our fourth quarter call. But you're correct. We still expect to go off our 2014 base and there are number of factors that are going on outside, right now. For example there has been a change in currency rates which will have an impact on 2015. But also on an operational standpoint, we are looking forward to several launches, we are looking forward to the continued development of several key programs in our pipeline.","So from an operational standpoint, we're pleased with the progress that is being made and with the upcoming launches and obviously they will have to be looked at in the context of the overall headwinds that I think everyone is experiencing from things like currency. Roger?","Roger Perlmutter","","John, the duration of treatment in infectious disease is always a difficult process to assess. I think first of all there are aspects of molecular cell biology to consider that you have hepatocytes that are infected with HCV. They differ almost certainly one cell from another in terms of replication rate and those that are replicating more slowly, it can be difficult to inhibit that process and there will be variability in terms of the degradation of the viral nucleic acid. So there is lot of heterogeneity in the liver itself. And then there is also variation in terms of the exposure to drug in individual liver cells.","And beyond those sort of molecular sales are considerations there is also the clinical context. So we all recognize that despite that fact we\u2019ve more or less understood the nature of -- for example, just to pick one the nature of osteomyelitis, bacterial infection in bone, the length of treatment in the clinical setting is different in different parts of the world and different regions. We really don\u2019t have an established length of treatment that we can justify with good clinical data. And one can expect that it will be easier in HCV because we can measure viral burden much more readily. But still the clinical context will change depending upon the, for example the degree of liver disease. So you can imagine where there's a lot of fibrosis and it's difficult to get drug penetration, that that will make things more challenging. ","All of which means that it may be hard to get to a single, short course recommendation for all patients, but instead patients will have to be satisfied and may be the satisfaction can be determined before treatment begins. But most likely it will be in response to therapy. These are the things that we have to learn, now that we have these potent direct acting anti-virals and our C-SWIFT studies I think will provide an important data on this.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs","","Just a few questions. Roger, do you expect to receive priority review for your doublet hep C therapy? I know you mentioned you've completed enrollment. Those trials should be completed by the end of I guess middle of next year, Should we anticipate priority review in timing of approval? Second question on KEYTRUDA for lung. When is the earliest we can expect to see randomized data showing overall survival for KEYTRUDA. And then thirdly a question for you Ken we had read, I guess rumors in the past about Merck considering selling its diversified product line or its legacy business. Can you give us an update in terms of how you're thinking about that? There have been a couple of trades as you know of those businesses. I\u2019m just wondering how we should think about that for Merck. Thanks very much.","Ken Frazier","Roger.","Roger Perlmutter","Jami thanks. The first question, of course, we do have break through designation for the doublet and that doesn\u2019t by any means stipulate that priority review would occur. I think it will be driven in large part by the strength of the data and the assessment of meaningfulness. So we\u2019ll get to that point when we have a chance to evaluate all the Phase III data and get it submitted. With respect to the randomized overall survival, again we do have data coming from the KEYNOTE-010 study. There are other possible approaches to this but certainly one would expect towards the end of next year, we'd have an early look at that. Again, a lot of depends of course of the survival statistics for the population but we\u2019ll have data around that time.","Ken Frazier","Thanks Jami for the question. And let me start with a broader focus on it. And as I said, we continue to prioritize and focus within our business and as we communicated last October, that required us to look across the entire business to determine which assets might have more value outside Merck versus inside the Company. As part of that you\u2019ve seen us take action and divest assets with approximately $3 billion of 2013 sales including MCC certain GHH products.","We will continue to evaluate opportunities as appropriate. But specifically with respect to the diversified plans, we will also be considerate of the fact that a lot of these more mature assets also provide strong cash flow, which enables us to continue to invest behind meaningful innovation that's at the heart of our strategy. So we\u2019ll continue to look at opportunities as we move forward but we\u2019ve got to balance the cash flow concerns as well as what we can do to monetize assets where appropriate.","Joseph Romanelli","Okay great. Thanks, Jackie. Next caller.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson with Sanford C. Bernstein.","Tim Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein","Thank you. I\u2019d love to get your thoughts on the KEYNOTE-006 trial, pretty important in that it compares your PD-1 head to head versus it'd be in first line melanoma and I am wondering if you can update us on timing of read out and just more generally, your views of CTLA-4 antagonist and specifically your views of those products from a risk-benefit standpoint as part of combination therapy with PD-1s in two settings, melanoma and lung? And then just a quick question on TECOS. Is it possible you would topline those results by late 2014 and more generally how we handle data disclosure when you do have those results?","Ken Frazier"," ","Okay Tim, for KEYNOTE-006, yes we do expect the data moving along and then we will have comparative data versus sifalimumab and there is nothing particularly to update with respect to KEYNOTE-0063. What you see on clinicaltrials.gov is a fair reflection of what we have and we are expecting to have data next year. You asked a more general question of how we view PD-1 antagonism versus CTLA-4 ipilimumab in particular and there is been a lot of discussion of this is as you know very well, there has not been an opportunity for us to compare KEYTRUDA vis-\u00e0-vis ipilimumab directly to this point, although ultimately we will have those kinds of data.","I think what we've seen from the registration materials for these drugs is that at the current exposure levels, there is substantial amount of systematic toxicity that has seen with CTLA-4 antagonists. But time will really tell how that plays out, particularly as their dose adjustments and different approaches to combination therapy. So I don\u2019t think we can say that that\u2019s going to turn out to be an impossibility. I think that the important thing, in order to design combinations correctly, speaking not just for ipilimumab or CTLA-4, but speaking for the totality of combinations, is we have to have firm understanding of how these molecules behave as monotherapy.","And we have a very large monotherapy program for KEYTRUDA which involves more than 6,000 patients as I've noted. In addition we have 17 combination studies currently underway, which explore KEYTRUDA in a variety of other settings used with other drugs. So we'll have the opportunity with this firm foundation of monotherapy results to understand the meaningfulness of combination therapies, including combinations with CTLA-4 antagonists by ipilimumab. ","Tim Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein","And now on TECOS?","Ken Frazier","","TECOS. So the TECOS data -- as I've indicated but we should have, last patient, last visit, I remind you, this is a study that is coordinated by an academic group. They are managing the study but we should have last patient, last visit by the end of this year we hope and the data will be presented in 2015. That\u2019s all we know about it. I mentioned before the data safety and monitoring committee that is overseeing the study as well. But we don\u2019t know anything more than that. ","Joseph Romanelli","","Great, okay. Thank you Tim. And Jackie next caller?","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS","","Ken, obviously the restructuring program takes your expenses down pretty significantly by the end of the next year. I'm just curious from there -- are we now rest and as we start to see this top-line from the new launches kick-in, will we get the operating leverage that we would expect to see, given that Hepatitis C oncology, these businesses that are not primary care kind of drive the top line. And curious how much investment you need to make in those areas that would offset and that we wouldn\u2019t see that operating leverage. And then Adam if you could just talk about the emerging markets just little bit more; obviously China was really strong. What type of one-timer was there or was this kind of a catch-up for the year? And maybe you could talk about just some of the key drivers and what\u2019s going on in the emerging markets. Thanks. ","Ken Frazier","","Adam, why don\u2019t you start with emerging markets?","Adam Schechter","","Yes, so if you look at the emerging markets, I've always said that growth can vary from quarter-to-quarter and timing of tenders becomes very significant in the emerging markets. China as you mentioned had strong growth of 33%. A lot of that was in the acute care products, of which timing played a part in, and also the diversified brands continued to show good growth, which was not related to timing. I also mentioned that in Turkey and Mexico we had very good quarter as well and that was driven by specialty products, but also cardiovascular products.","Ken Frazier","","And on the overall issues with respect to our cost structure and how we're approaching it, we have been pretty aggressive in the first nine months to reduce costs and change our operating model, and we're on track for the overall $2.5 billion in cost savings by 2015. And so we think that actually positions us well as we move into the future. Beyond that I can\u2019t say much because we're not providing guidance in today\u2019s call. ","Joseph Romanelli","","Okay, thank you Mark. And Jackie next caller?","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Baum with Citi.","Andrew Baum - Citi","","Regarding anacetrapib, a question for Roger. Would a positive protocol analysis for IMPROVE-IT at AHA make you any more confident about the anacetrapib trial, given the beta about its proposed LDL mediated mechanism of action? And I know you are aware that two presentations are scheduled.","Second, just following up on the KEYNOTE-010 trial, should I be thinking about an earlier interim analysis for your trial compared to Bristol's equivalent given you are selecting PD-L1 patients and it's obviously much larger and therefore where would that put the interim just on your modeling? And then just an adjunct to that, do you still remain convinced that looking at PD-L1 expression on tumors rather than on the different cohorts of white blood cells is the right way to go to optimally select patients?","Ken Frazier","","Okay Andrew. Three questions. First of all, for anacetrapib, as I've indicated, we have no idea what the results of IMPROVE-IT are going to be. IMPROVE-IT tests the question as you know of whether or not one can be aggressively lowering LDL cholesterol levels in patients who already are optimally managed with simvastatin, one can achieve a beneficial effect on cardiovascular events and the magnitude of that effect.","Our studies with anacetrapib are different and because we have an anacetrapib, both the significant LDL cholesterol lowering effect, but also the HDL elevating effect, I\u2019m not sure that I can read out much of anything from IMPROVE-IT to anacetrapib. I think anacetrapib is testing really quite a different question and we\u2019ll just have to wait for the results of the reveal study.","With respect to the KEYNOTE timing, I can\u2019t speculate about how Bristol-Myers is pursuing their analysis versus our own. I\u2019ve indicated when we expect our data to become available and we\u2019re going to examine those and make decisions based on that. And with respect to the PD-L1, we've presented really quite a lot of data using our proprietary PD-L1 antibody to look at expression in tumors, and what we've shown is that there is substantial associated between PD-L1 expression and tumors, which is judged at different cut points and responses to KEYTRUDA; and we've shown that in a number of different tumors and most recently we showed it in our presentations at ESMO.","The important thing to recognize as I said, that doesn\u2019t mean that there are no responses in those who PD-L1 negative. It's simply an association. It is an association that is biologically plausible, but we don\u2019t by any means feel that we are able to inventory all of the PD-L1 that's expressed in an around those cells that might be responsible for tumor killing and so no matter what, we only get a partial picture of it. My feeling is that PD-L1 assessment in the tumor is much more likely to be revealing than PD-L1 assessment and circulating white blood cells as an example and certainly that\u2019s our experience.","Joseph Romanelli","","Okay, great, thanks. Jackie, next caller?","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Colin Bristow with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Colin Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","","Sorry if I missed this, but on hep C, how importantly do you view hitting four weeks from commercial standpoint? It feels like physician feedback has not indicated a high level of importance as perhaps we would expect. And then just a second one on the IMPROVE-IT study. If the trial does not meet the primary endpoint, how do you think about the level of investment in the franchise going forward?","Adam Schechter","","This is Adam, Colin. With regard to hep C, this is a very large market. In U.S. alone there's about 3.2 million people with chronic HCV, of which only about 50% are diagnosed and only about 150,000, 200,000 are cured.","So the market is very large. I believe that four weeks would be helpful, but as long as in comparative dynamics, there is quality in terms of the regimens, I think that you can be successful commercially under either circumstance. So at this point we\u2019re not commenting specifically on IMPROVE-IT. We continue to believe in the LDL cholesterol hypothesis and of course we\u2019re prepared for all scenarios but there is nothing specific at this moment.","Joseph Romanelli","","Great. Thanks Colin. And Jackie, next caller?","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. ","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank ","","I have. Adam, you mentioned that roughly 900 patients are being treated with KEYTRUDA. I was curious if you\u2019re seeing orders and shipments that are pretty consistent with that? Is it a pretty tight relationship between individual patient and managed shipments or is the system kind of gearing up for broader usage, even though you can't talk about broader usage from Merck's standpoint.","And Roger, how confident are you in the scientific community, if you can speak for the community in the reproducibility of a particular patient's PD-L1 status? It sounds like investors want things in neat boxes. I\u2019m not so sure it\u2019s actually going to play-off that way but curious on your thoughts there on the testing and the status and whether that could flux within patients? Thanks.","Adam Schechter","","It\u2019s Adam. So first of all, as I said before, we're pleased with the uptake in customer feedback that we have early in the launch, but we are still very early in a launch. We're taking orders KEYTRUDA since the first day of availability. Nearly all the top 50 accounts are purchased since we launched the product and a majority have made repeat purchases and at this point in time we believe we have about 900,000 patients that are being treated with the product.","Ken Frazier","","Roger?","Roger Perlmutter","Yes, and Gregg; you\u2019re absolutely right with respect to PD-L1 status in that the PD-L1 gene itself is responsive to a variety of different stimuli, including cytokine. So the inflammatory [indiscernible] could easily influence how much PD-L1 is expressed and that could be different from one; for example size of metathesis to another. So there could be quite a bit variability. That variability may underlie the challenges that people have experienced in trying to dissect the relationship between PD-L1 expression and responsiveness to anti-PD-1 therapy. Nevertheless the fact is there is such an association. So summiting over everything, there still is a general relationship between PD-L1 express and in tumors in responsiveness that's been seen many times.","Joseph Romanelli","","Okay, great, thanks, Gregg. And Jackie, next caller.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Tony Butler with Guggenheim Partners.","Tony Butler - Guggenheim Partners ","","Two brief questions Roger on, we've talked about 010 and platinum failures. The question is, what's the difference between 024 and 042 in the Phase III setting at least in first line advanced non-small cell lung? And the second question Adam, the top 50 accounts having ordered KEYTRUDA, can you provide any additional color on the percentage of patients who were already on therapy in the access program and have moved on to if you will as a pain customer and those that are actually new to therapy? Thank you.","Ken Frazier","","So, Adam do you want to take the first question.","Adam Schechter","","So right now as we said we have, we believe there's about 900 patients that are being treated with the product. Many of those we believe are coming from the EAP program. And if you look at the top 50 accounts, it's not easy to tell where the purchases go, to which patients exactly. So you can't comment on that. But I think the bottom line is we're on track for all in 60 days to move from the EAP program into the commercial area. So we are working hard on that and we're on track for that.","Ken Frazier","","Okay, Roger. ","Roger Perlmutter","","Yes, if you look at the 024 and 042, you will see that there, we're talking about similar kinds of studies but they differ in size and differ on primary outcomes and that's kind of understandable and not atypical for registration strategies in these sorts of settings. ","Joseph Romanelli","","Okay, great. Jackie, and next caller.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley","","I have a couple of questions. First, with respect to your hep C program, could you talk about your development vision for Idenix nuke, including the timing for Phase III? And then second, I have a little bit of a lengthy question on KEYTRUDA and this relates to the KEYNOTE-06 trial. So the approved dose of KEYTRUDA is 2 milligrams per kilogram every three weeks and it costs a $150,000 a year. But in KEYNOTE-06, the KEYTRUDA dosing is 10 milligrams per kilogram every two or three weeks, which would cost $1.15 million or $750,000 a year respectively.","So since KEYNOTE-06 is supposed to read out early next year and assuming that it shows that KEYTRUDA is superior to YERVOY in first line melanoma, it should get Compendia be listed at 10 milligrams per kilogram, but how should we think about actual use in the real world and how should we think about pricings for that compound? Thank you.","Ken Frazier","Hey Roger.","Roger Perlmutter","Yes, so I guess the question is first of all with respect to MK-3682 and the timing; I should note that for MK-3682, and again the data will be -- Phase Ib data will be at AASLD. We do have an IND now in United States for that molecule and Phase II studies will begin shortly and thereafter based on the results of that, we will begin to decide how best to conduct registration strategy. So that's more or less how we are thinking about it. It's fairly conventional.","And then with respect to KEYNOTE-06; well as you know, we began our studies of pembrolizumab in a variety of different doses, 2 milligrams Q3 and 10 milligrams Q2 and 10 milligrams Q3 and what we've learned in the course of those studies is that the dose response curve is relatively flat and 0.02 milligrams Q3 was selected as the dose to go forward in melanoma. And we're also working on a fixed dose at 200 milligrams Q3, which will give the equivalent exposure 2 milligrams Q3 for most patients and doesn't require the weight calculation. And my expectation is that because we'll have large amount of data from all of these different settings, we'll be able to make the appropriate analysis. I can't speak of course to how Compendia will look at this in any other aspect of the commercialization process.","Ken Frazier","And Dave what I would say is we've been very active to ensure that patients that are in need of KEYTRUDA have access to it and claims are being paid for KEYTRUDA consistent with the indication without restrictions and we've got our clinical presentations, where all of our top 30 target health plans either occurred or are going to occur. So as we look at the future, of course we continue to work to maintain access as appropriate. ","Joseph Romanelli","","Thank you, Dave. Jackie I think we have time for just two more callers.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Vamil Diwan with Credit Suisse.","Vamil Diwan - Credit Suisse","","A couple here. One on JANUVIA and JANUMET. From what we understand I think that product starting in 2015 is not going to be available to people with United Healthcare commercial plans. Can you just confirm if that is indeed the case, if there's been a change there? And while I assume that losing one plan is not likely that material to you guys, are there any other changes to the access of that franchise that we should be aware of as we start thinking about 2015? And then the second question just on the PD-1 side of things; any update you can provide on the status of the lawsuit that you guys filed against Bristol in Europe and also the one that Bristol has filed in the U.S. against you guys once you get the approval for KEYTRUDA?","Ken Frazier","So Adam, do you want to go first?","Adam Schechter","","JANUVIA continues to have good access in 2014 and based upon preliminary reviews in \u201815, we expect to continue to have good access. JANUVIA is still on preliminary for United Part D plan in 2015 and continues to have preferred assets. The contract with United was signed recently but since it not had been signed when United filed their 2015 formulary with CMS, the United Part D website and CMS required notice to insurees that that did not list JANUVIA as on formulary, but I would just want to repeat that it still is on formulary for Part D in 2015. ","Ken Frazier","","And Vamil, we\u2019re confident with respect to PD-1 and the litigation issue with the patent. We\u2019re confident we'll be able to market KEYTRUDA to any country in which it is approved. Litigation appeals -- they are a multiyear process. So you won\u2019t hear anything much for a while. If there are any updates we\u2019ll provide those in the queue. ","Joseph Romanelli","Jackie, I think we have time for the last caller.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Jeff Holford with Jefferies.","Jeff Holford - Jefferies ","","I wondered if you can just give us a bit more color on what the biosimilar situation in Europe looks like, what you are really learning from the early stages of this and what you\u2019re going to take forward as access to biosimilars becomes more prevalent in Europe?","Roger Perlmutter","So if you look at Remicade and Simponi, as I said, we had about $775 million of sales about 9% growth. We continue to have growth with Remicade about 3%. That was driven by the core EU markets driven by gastro indications. But there was some offset due to biosimilar competition in the smaller markets.","If you look at the biosimilar specifically, there has been relatively limited uptake of either biosimilar product or acceptance on tenders and formularies and what we\u2019ve seen so far is there has been movement of the biosimilars, it\u2019s been limited to new patients only. However we have seen increase pricing pressures that are required in order for us to compete with the biosimilars. So we expect the pressure to continue into small markets this year and then we expect there to be some pricing pressure and new patients in the core EU markets after February 2015 loss of exclusivity.","Joseph Romanelli","","Okay. Thank you Adam. And Ken?","Ken Frazier","","So just in closing, we reported another solid quarter Company performance. As I mentioned earlier, we are making great progress on our strategy initiatives we announced last year. We're now seeing the benefit of investing in our core therapeutic areas like we\u2019ve seen in diabetes. We've made significant advancements in some of our most important research programs, including the launch of KEYTRUDA and receiving breakthrough therapeutic designation in non-small cell lung cancer and as Roger mentioned this morning, we\u2019re making steady progress in in hepatitis C as our registration study for the doublet is now fully enrolled.","We also continue to focus on improving our operating model. Over the past year we've seen our operating expenses decline significantly. We will remain on track to achieve our $2.5 billion cost saving. Our prioritization is also let us to divesting $3 billion in sales through the MCC transaction with Bayer and other divestiture in human health. We've used those proceeds to fund the Idenix acquisition, and repurchase shares this year.","Over the past 12 months we\u2019ve returned more than $11 billion via the dividend and share repurchase program. We remain strongly committed to returning cash to our shareholders. So again, thank you for joining and hanging in with us for little bit of lengthy call, and we look forward to updating you again on our fourth quarter earnings call.","Operator","","Thank you.

Today's call is being recorded.","At this time I'd like to turn the call of the Joseph Romanelli, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Darla, and good morning, everyone. We'd also like to say good afternoon and good evening to everyone listening outside the United States. Welcome to Merck's First Quarter 2015 Conference Call.","Before I turn the call over to Ken, I just want to point out a couple of items. First, you will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as the acquisition related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded those items from our non-GAAP results. There are reconciliation tables available in our press release so you can get a better understanding of the underlying performance. We've also provided tables to help you understand the sales results in the quarter for the business units as well as for products. This can be found in table three of our press release and the reconciliation table I mentioned earlier is in table two of the release. During the call we will be referring to table two for the P&L and table three as it relates to revenue.","Second, I would like to remind you that some of the statements we make during today's call might be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor Provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current belief of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.","Our SEC filings, including item 1A in the 2014 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements and you can see our SEC filings as well as today's earnings release on Merck.com.","With that, this morning I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Adam Schechter, President of Global Human Health; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Labs.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Ken. Ken?","Kenneth C. Frazier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone and thank you all for joining our call today.","We are off to a very promising start this year in 2015 and we are seeing additional confirmation that Merck's scientific and business strategies together with our focused investments are paying off. In the first quarter, we saw strong topline growth from our core human health therapeutic areas and our Animal Health business. At the same time, our late stage pipeline and the product approvals we gained last year are now coming to fruition with launches like KEYTRUDA, BELSOMRA, and ZERBAXA. It's an exciting time at Merck because we believe that our pipeline will continue to deliver medically important products over the coming months and years.","By bringing greater focus and discipline to all aspects of our business, we will continue to transform Merck into a more competitive, more innovative company built on a platform for sustainable future growth. Adam will discuss the quarter's product performance in greater detail later in the call.","Looking to the future, what we at Merck find most energizing is the progress we are making across our pipeline, progress evidenced by strong data presented during several recent major medical meetings.","For example, last week at AACR, Merck presented KEYTRUDA data in three tumor types. It was both inspiring and encouraging to see and hear the impact KEYTRUDA is having in patients with lung cancer, melanoma and mesothelioma, which is a particularly challenging cancer with limited treatment options. Not surprisingly, the feedback we've received from physicians has been overwhelmingly positive. We also announced new filings for KEYTRUDA in lung cancer and melanoma, which brings us another step closer to reaching more patients with this life-saving medicine.","Additionally, we presented new Phase 3 data from our HCV doublet program at EASL last week. We are seeing robust responses to the doublet with significant cure rates across all patient types including hard-to-treat patients. As you know, we also received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA for some of these patients who have a clear unmet need.","Finally, this week at ECCMID, this past week at ECCMID, we continued to reinforce our long-standing commitment to the global fight against infectious diseases, including antibiotic resistant infections. This is another area where Merck will continue to lead the charge to address an unmet global need. Roger will discuss the progress of our pipeline in greater detail later in the call.","Immuno-oncology, hepatitis C and cardiometabolic disease are just a few examples of our most promising late stage programs, programs that are predicated upon what has long defined Merck, our ability to generate innovative, medically important products that address global unmet medical need. In the evolving healthcare environment, commercial success will accrue to those who develop medicines and vaccines that help patients to live healthier and more productive lives and reduce overall healthcare expenditures.","We will remain focused on bringing forward the best scientific and medical innovations sourced both internally and externally, because we believe that this is the best path to intrinsic long-term value creation. By capitalizing on the significant and exciting scientific and clinical opportunities that lie ahead, Merck intends to play a major role in transforming healthcare for the benefit of patients, payers and shareholders alike.","The advances in immuno-oncology, hepatitis C and anti-infectives I mentioned earlier are just the beginning. There are numerous other examples ranging from chronic and debilitating neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's, to urgent and pressing global threats, like Ebola. These remind us both of the immensity of unmet global medical need and the unprecedented opportunity we have to address that need with transformational medicine. It is an exciting time to be at Merck on both the research and commercial fronts.","And with that, I will now turn the call over to Adam Schechter.","Adam H. Schechter - Executive VP & President-Global Human Health","Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone.","This morning I will discuss the first quarter results for Global Human Health. My comments will be on a constant currency basis. We are off to a strong start in 2015. We continue to drive growth within the core portfolio while entering a phase of important launches.","Sales in the first quarter grew 5% reflecting the following: growth in all four core areas of diabetes, hospital acute care, vaccines and oncology; the integration of the Cubist portfolio; and product divestitures.","Now I will review performance of several key products followed by a brief update by region and then commentary on a few of our most important launches. So I will start with JANUVIA.","The JANUVIA franchise reached approximately $1.4 billion in sales and grew 10% in the quarter. In the United States, sales grew 4%. Strong performance this quarter was driven by continued focus and investment to defend our 75% market share and to grow the DPP-4 class. As you may recall, TRx volume was declining during the first quarter of last year, also allowing for a favorable comparison.","In the international markets, sales grew 17%. Europe grew as a result of market events last year, which led to share gains, particularly in Germany. Emerging markets continued to show strong demand. We are off to a strong start to deliver global growth for JANUVIA in 2015.","Next in Hospital and Specialty Care, sales of ISENTRESS grew 6% to approximately $390 million, primarily as a result of tenders in certain emerging markets.","In immunology, sales of REMICADE and SIMPONI were approximately $660 million, growing 1%. Continued strong growth in SIMPONI was mostly offset by a 3% decline in REMICADE. All remaining European markets lost patent protection for REMICADE in February. We are still in the early stages of biosimilar competition in core EU markets. But the discounts offered by biosimilars are higher than our original expectations of 30%. Discounts are closer to 45%. However, we have yet to see many of the initial tender results to understand what the net prices may become over time.","We continue to maintain the vast majority of patients who are already well controlled on REMICADE. We anticipate that the impact of biosimilar competition, particularly for new patients, will accelerate throughout the year as more tenders occur in the core European markets.","In hospital acute care, sales grew to approximately $800 million. Strong double-digit growth from our broad portfolio, coupled with the addition of sales from Cubist products, solidifies our position as a global leader in hospital acute care. With important in line brands and new product launches such as ZERBAXA, we continue to expect that this segment will be a core contributor of growth for Merck.","Now turning to the Vaccine business. In the first quarter vaccine sales grew 9% to approximately $1.3 billion. Growth was driven by pediatric vaccines, given the recent public attention to measles, which has now subsided, and also by ZOSTAVAX. Sales of ZOSTAVAX were $175 million in the quarter reflecting growth of 25%. Sales in the United States grew as a result of continued DTC efforts. Globally, we also saw positive contributions from Canada as well as in markets in Asia, which are continuing to launch.","Combined sales of GARDASIL and GARDASIL 9 reached approximately $360 million in the first quarter, a decline of 5%. Growth in the United States, which reflects higher public sector purchases of about $30 million, was more than offset by timing of government purchases in Brazil.","In February, the ACIP recommended GARDASIL 9 for routine use in line with the GARDASIL recommendations. Managed care coverage continued to build following the ACIP meeting, and coverage is rapidly approaching that of GARDASIL. Physicians currently are transitioning to this new vaccine that offers increased protection from cervical cancer-causing HPV.","Now I will provide some geographic commentary for the quarter. In the United States sales increased 10% excluding Cubist. There was growth across primary care, oncology, vaccines, and hospital acute care. Sales in Europe decreased 5%. Growth from the JANUVIA franchise and SIMPONI was offset by ophthalmology product divestitures and declines in HCV and REMICADE.","Japan sales declined 13% as growth in Pneumovax was offset by ophthalmology product divestitures and the biannual price decreases that took effect in April of last year. Emerging markets sales grew 7%, including 16% growth in China.","Now I will spend a few moments speaking to several important launches, and I'll start with BELSOMRA. We are pleased with the initial months of the BELSOMRA launch in the United States. As of the end of March, there were about 4000 total weekly prescriptions. To date, we have achieved positive coverage decisions for nearly 50 million commercial lives, and half of those lives required no step edit. Our teams are continuing to drive awareness with this exciting, first-in-class treatment for patients suffering with insomnia.","Moving to ZERBAXA, following the acquisition of Cubist in January, we rapidly began working with our new colleagues in the launch of ZERBAXA, a new treatment for certain complicated gram-negative infections. We are just beginning to see formulary additions. As expected in this market, formulary access is critical before use occurs. The growing resistance issue with gram-negative pathogens is driving positive discussions and positive formulary uptake for ZERBAXA.","In oncology, we saw strong performance in the continuing launch of KEYTRUDA. Sales reached $83 million in the quarter. We have achieved rapid penetration of the on label indication in advanced melanoma. Additionally, NCCN guidelines recommend reimbursement in the first line treatment of melanoma. Importantly, physicians continue to gain comfort and experience treating patients with KEYTRUDA, a product that will become foundational in the treatment of melanoma and potentially in a number of other cancers. We continue to believe that the immuno-oncology area holds great promise for patients and that it will be a very large and significant market.","Lastly, we are excited about the future opportunities we see, particularly with our hepatitis C portfolio. This is a market where we have succeeded in the past, and we are excited for what the launch can mean for patients and for Merck.","In summary, Global Human Health is off to a strong start in 2015. We drove growth as a result of strong performance in focused areas of diabetes, hospital acute care, vaccines and oncology. Furthermore, the integration of Cubist is fortifying our growth platform in hospital acute-care. The strength of our underlying business, our focused commercial strategy and the launch opportunities in our hands position us well for the remainder of 2015 and for future growth.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to my colleague, Rob Davis.","Robert M. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Adam, and good morning everyone.","As Ken and Adam shared with you, our results this quarter demonstrate our ability to simultaneously grow our businesses and effectively reduce our cost base. We continue to remain focused on transforming our operating model, achieving our cost reduction targets and ensuring we have a leveraged P&L.","This morning I will provide some additional detail on the quarter and comment on our outlook for the rest of the year. My remarks will focus on our non-GAAP financials.","Total company revenues were $9.4 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 8% year-over-year, which includes a negative five-percentage point impact from foreign exchange. The 5% impact from exchange is net of a 2% hedging benefit we realized in the quarter.","Our sales decline reflects approximately $700 million of lower revenue from divestitures, including the sale of our consumer care business to Bayer as well is $379 million in decline in other revenue in the quarter due to the termination of the AstraZeneca JV and the sale of U.S. SAPHRIS rights. The overall top line decline was partially offset by a $208 million increase in revenue from the integration of the Cubist portfolio following the close of the transaction in late January.","Excluding these items and the impact of foreign exchange, the underlying base business grew 6% in the quarter. As Adam stated, our sales growth in the pharmaceutical business was driven by growth across our core therapeutic areas of diabetes, hospital acute care, oncology and vaccines.","Our animal health business delivered another strong quarter of growth with revenue of $829 million, an increase of 13% year-over-year excluding exchange. The growth this quarter was primarily driven by our companion animal business, reflecting the continued strong launch of BRAVECTO. We're excited about the progress we've made in this first full year of BRAVECTO's launch.","Now moving to expenses, gross margin was 76.5% in the quarter, which represents a 240 basis point increase year-over-year driven by product mix, including the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange. We now expect full-year gross margin to be approximately 100 basis points higher versus 2014.","Marketing and administrative expenses were $354 million lower in the quarter driven by declines in direct selling costs and net favorability from acquisitions and divestitures. We remain focused on funding opportunities for growth while reducing our overall cost base. Overall, we continue to expect a decline in marketing and administrative expenses compared to 2014.","Research and development expenses were $1.7 billion in the quarter, $149 million higher than prior-year, driven primarily by licensing costs incurred in the quarter. We continue to expect a modest increase in R&D expense versus prior-year.","We expect total company operating expenses to be lower versus last year and we remain on track to reduce our operating expense by $2.5 billion compared to 2012 by the end of this year.","Other income and expense was $69 million of expense in the quarter compared with income in the prior-year primarily due to a nonrecurring gain from the divestiture of Sirna in 2014.","Finally, regarding our tax rate, our non-GAAP effective tax rate this quarter was 22.4%. We continue to anticipate the tax rate for the full-year to be between 22% and 23%.","Taken together, we earned $0.85 per share in the first quarter, which reflects strong operational performance as well as $0.06 benefit due to higher equity income from our research investment fund, revenue hedging gains, and other one-time items. This compares to $0.88 per share in the prior-year, which included $0.11 of gains from the sale of U.S. SAPHRIS rights and the divestiture of Sirna.","Turning to our outlook for the year, we now expect the strengthening U.S. dollar to have a roughly $2.8 billion impact on our full-year sales results. Despite additional FX pressure, we are maintaining our sales guidance of $38.3 billion to $39.8 billion.","Now regarding EPS, we continue to expect FX to have a $0.27 impact in 2015. We anticipate that most of that impact will occur in the remainder of the year. In light of our strong first-quarter performance, tempered by our nonoperational gains this quarter, and the anticipated incremental negative impact of FX we now expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $3.35 to $3.48 which reflects an increase from our prior guidance.","In summary, we're off to a strong start in 2015. As we continue to focus on execution we are seeing the benefit of our efforts in revenue growth in core products and markets, a lower cost base, and this first wave of innovation and new product launches. Lastly, as I previously mentioned, we remain on track to achieve our cost reduction goals by the end of 2015.","Now I will turn the call over to Roger.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Executive Vice President & President, Merck Research Laboratories","Thanks, Rob.","We had a very busy first-quarter in research and development culminating in several important regulatory filings and research presentations.","Turning first to KEYTRUDA, our PD-1 directed monoclonal antibody designed to promote activation of pre-existing tumor directed immune responses, we have previously announced that the Data Monitoring Committee recommended early conclusion of our KEYNOTE-006 study, which compared KEYTRUDA to ipilimumab in the first and second line treatment of patients with advanced melanoma.","Details of this study, including the favorable outcomes observed for response rates, progression free survival, and overall survival were presented at the American Association for Cancer Research meeting in Philadelphia last week and published in the New England Journal of Medicine.","Also presented at the AACR meeting and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine, were the results of KEYNOTE-001 cohorts including patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with KEYTRUDA following progression after systemic chemotherapy. In these studies we observed that expression of PD-L1, one of the two ligands for PD-1 the target of KEYTRUDA, in greater than 50% of tumor cells was associated with substantially higher response rates than what was seen in patients whose tumors did not express PD-L1. These responses occurred irrespective of the underlying histologic classification of the presenting non-small cell lung cancer. These data were included in our recent submission to the FDA seeking approval for KEYTRUDA in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer that has progressed despite platinum-based chemotherapy and where EGF receptor or ALK-directed therapy is not indicated.","This filing joins another filing based on our earlier KEYNOTE-002 study, which is now under review at the FDA demonstrating that in a randomized comparison KEYTRUDA therapy is superior to conventional chemotherapy in patients with advanced melanoma as judged by progression-free survival. We expect to file the results of our KEYNOTE-006 study, which I mentioned earlier, by the middle of the year.","Data from our melanoma studies is also under review by the Committee on Human Medicinal Products at the European Medicines Agency. I should note that during the first quarter, KEYTRUDA was approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma in Canada and Australia, among other jurisdictions. We are particularly gratified that melanoma patients in Australia will now be able to benefit from KEYTRUDA treatment since this is the region of the world with the highest incidence of this life-threatening disease.","I also wish to emphasize that although we have studied a range of KEYTRUDA doses in our clinical trials, our data are persuasive that 2-milligrams per kilogram given every three weeks is as efficacious as higher doses across all tumor types studied. Indeed we are advancing a unit dose of 200 milligrams every three weeks, which we hope to show is equally effective. This will simplify dosing for the vast majority of patients for whom KEYTRUDA is an appropriate therapy.","Finally, I will mention again that during 2014 we provided data indicating that KEYTRUDA has activity in seven different tumor types: head and neck cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma, as well as melanoma, and non-small cell lung cancer; and we are pursuing registration enabling studies in each of these indications.","At the AACR meeting, we presented the first data from our signal detection study called KEYNOTE-028, demonstrating tumor shrinkage in patients with malignant plural mesothelioma following KEYTRUDA administration. This represents an eighth malignancy for which data supporting further potentially registration-enabling studies can be pursued.","During the upcoming American Society for Clinical Oncology meetings in June, we will present 33 abstracts, including nine oral presentations describing the activity of KEYTRUDA in different settings, which can potentially be used to sharpen treatment algorithms for malignant disease. In all we now have more than 14,000 patients enrolled in clinical trials aimed at defining the attributes of KEYTRUDA therapy.","Also during the first quarter, we completed Phase 3 studies of grazoprevir\/elbasvir treatment for patients suffering from chronic hepatitis C virus infection. Some of these data were presented last week at the European Association for the Study of the Liver meetings in Vienna, demonstrating that our doublet regiment produced 95% sustained virologic responses at 12 weeks in patients suffering from genotypes one, four or six infection with hepatitis C virus.","In addition, data presented at the meeting showed responses in patients simultaneously infected with immunodeficiency virus or suffering from renal insufficiency including those on hemodialysis.","Summarizing across this very large data set, much of which was also published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, we conclude that combined treatment with grazoprevir\/elbasvir presented together in a single oral dosage form given once daily permits control of hepatitis C infection in a broad range of patients. I remind you that we have received breakthrough designation for this doublet therapy in the treatment of patients with genotype four infection and for the treatment of chronic HCV genotype one infection in patients receiving hemodialysis, an important subset of the total HCV infected population. We plan to file for approval of this combination with the FDA by midyear.","Yesterday we announced the results from our TECOS study in patients with type-two diabetes. This study compared treatment with JANUVIA as a means of maintaining lower levels of glycated hemoglobin, a measure of diabetic control, with alternative standard regimens, and was designed to collect data regarding the cardiovascular safety of JANUVIA treatment as compared to these other regimens. The TECOS study, conducted under the sponsorship of the University of Oxford Diabetes Trials Unit and the Duke Clinical Research Center is the largest one of its type, enrolling almost 15,000 patients from 38 countries and with a median follow-up of more than three years.","As I have indicated previously, the study investigators will present their data at the June American Diabetes Association forum in just a few weeks; and hence, I will not describe the results in detail. I will say, however, that the study met its primary endpoint. JANUVIA therapy was non-inferior to treatment with alternative regimens with respect to the composite cardiovascular endpoint. Observed adverse experiences were generally consistent with what has been previously reported in post-approval studies of JANUVIA.","I should note that during the month of April, the FDA convened an advisory committee to examine the safety of two other DPP-4 inhibitors for which cardiovascular outcomes data have previously been made available as a result of the SAVOR-TIMI and EXAMINE trials. Of special interest to the FDA and to committee members were results suggesting that DPP-4 inhibitors might be associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for heart failure. This was an explicit endpoint of the TECOS study, and I can report that there was no imbalance in heart failure hospitalization comparing the JANUVIA treatment arm with the treatment group receiving other therapies designed to reduce hyperglycemia.","Beyond TECOS, I will remind you that we are also engaged in a 30,000 patient outcomes study called REVEAL, testing whether anacetrapib, our novel CETP inhibitor, can when added to standard therapy reduce the frequency of major cardiovascular events in patients at significant risk for such events. Earlier this month, we received a proposal from the steering committee of the trial to change the study protocol to include ischemic stroke as a complement of the primary composite endpoint.","This proposal is based in part on data that emerged last year from the IMPROVE-IT study which documented a reduced risk of ischemic stroke associated with LDL cholesterol-lowering. With this in mind, in advance of any interim analysis of REVEAL, it was proposed that ischemic stroke, rather than revascularization, would prove to be a more appropriate measurement for the cardiovascular composite endpoint.","The letter from the steering committee should not be taken to mean that investigators are aware of any outcomes from the REVEAL trial itself, the study remains blinded. However, given the proposed change in endpoint, they also wish to adjust the timing of the proposed interim analyses. Their proposal must be fully vetted by governance committees and regulatory agencies, and I expect that they will publish the proposed modifications. The steering committee estimates that the first interim analysis with this new protocol would take place towards the end of this year. In the meantime the study is proceeding as planned in a fully blinded fashion.","A few final notes on regulatory activity. We've received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA regarding our submission of BRIDION, which is approved in more than 60 countries for the reversal of certain types of neuromuscular blockade during anesthesia. The agency has asked for additional sensitivity analyses regarding the data that we have submitted. We expect to be able to respond to these requests in the very near future.","And now, I will turn the call over to Joe.","Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great, thank you, Roger. Darla, I think we are getting ready for the Q&A segment of the call. For callers, I will ask you that you ask only one or two questions so that we can get to as many callers as possible.","Darla, can you turn it to the Q&A session? Thanks.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein.","Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. Congratulations on TECOS. I'm not going to ask any questions, I'm imagining you won't say much.","But on KEYTRUDA in lung, the debate continues to rage on about the utility of a biomarker and you filed your product. Are you willing to say that you have asked for a label that is specific to high expressers of PD-L1? Or was the data set you submitted really broader than that and you did not explicitly ask for a biomarker limitation?","And then you raised guidance for the year on earnings. Is part of that related to hep C? Specifically, what is baked into your 2015 guidance about a potential launch before year-end, or would that not make a difference anyway?","And your breakthrough therapy designation was limited in terms of what that status applies to. Can you talk about when the drug does get approved, is it likely to be a broad label?","Roger M. Perlmutter - Executive Vice President & President, Merck Research Laboratories","Tim, it's Roger. First of all with respect to KEYTRUDA in lung, of course the entire data set, the totality of our data, has been filed with the FDA. And in those data, as I've said previously, what we know is that patients who have a high proportion of tumor cells expressing PD-L1, experience a higher likelihood of response. And in fact, the response rates for those who are above the 50% representation are really very significant. But that doesn't mean that patients with low or even no visible PD-L1 expression failed to respond, inevitably. There are responses in those patient populations as well, and I would expect that the labeling would want to capture that information to best advise physicians as they make decisions about how to treat their patients.","Adam H. Schechter - Executive VP & President-Global Human Health","Maybe I will take the other question with regards to the hepatitis C. I'd just remind you that as we look to file in the first half of 2015, our guidance really has multiple scenarios around how does it plays out, but it's not material this year given the timing of the launch.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Executive Vice President & President, Merck Research Laboratories","Finally, Tim, with respect to HCV and our breakthrough designation, the breakthrough designation provides a mechanism whereby we can work closely with the FDA to design studies and our filings because the FDA recognizes, we believe, and the FDA recognizes that our therapy, our HCV therapy, has the potential to provide meaningful and important benefits to an underserved population. However, the data set that we submit is the entire data set, and it is that entire data set that they will review. And that data set, as you know from the EASL meetings, and from what we've published, and from other presentations, spans the entire range of HCV infection.","Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Thank you, Roger. Thank you, Tim. And, Darla, our next caller?","Operator","It's from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher Thomas Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Congrats on the quarter. Just two questions here. First maybe just more broadly on KEYTRUDA in non-small cell lung cancer, can you just talk about a little bit more about your product's relative competitive position in this market and how you're thinking about the commercial rollout here? I know you just mentioned your filings with the entire data set, but commercially how do you think about your initial data versus your competitor which has OS data from a controlled study and how that plays out in the market?","The second question was on the BACE program in Alzheimer's and just updated thoughts there following the recent Biogen data. I guess be interested in your views if I think about BACE versus plaque-specific antibodies and just how the treatment paradigm in Alzheimer's ultimately shapes up? Thanks very much.","Adam H. Schechter - Executive VP & President-Global Human Health","Yeah, hi, Chris. This is Adam. I'll answer the question on the lung cancer market readiness.","So we've been building our oncology business unit to make sure we maximize the potential of KEYTRUDA over time. And just like we were ready to launch in melanoma, we see lung cancer as a very significant opportunity for KEYTRUDA, and we will be ready to launch. Of course you'd prefer to have overall survival data to promote, but these data are maturing in our broad clinical program. We've been building our lung cancer capabilities, adding sales representatives and customer facing teams. We've been working with key scientific leaders, and we are just getting ready for the launch.","In terms of competitiveness, we feel really good about the data we've shown, and if you look at the value in the PD-L1 diagnostic, I think that can really help identify patients who will have an enhanced likelihood for improved efficacy and benefit most from KEYTRUDA. And when I talk to opinion leaders but also when I've talked to governments, they see this as a way of allowing physicians to potentially have a different conversation with patients depending on their PD-L1 expression, particularly when we can see such a large effect of 45% in the high expressers, but it also allows physicians to prioritize treatment options which they're looking for.","Payers around the world, particularly in Europe, have noted their interest in potential health economics and those that can be associated with identifying patients who could benefit most from KEYTRUDA and thinking about algorithms of treatment. So we feel very good about the data we have and our competitive position at this time.","Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations","Okay. Roger?","Roger M. Perlmutter - Executive Vice President & President, Merck Research Laboratories","And, Chris, with respect to BACE, as you know, of course, our BACE inhibitor is currently under study in two large Phase 3 trials, one in patients with mild to moderate cognitive impairment and the other in patients with prodromal disease. The data set from Biogen, which, as you know and as they characterize, is a small data set, is intriguing because it appears to show that there can be a dose response curve for plaque reduction using an antibody directed against Abeta.","The data with respect to cognitive improvement, of course, are, as everyone has commented, immature. I think what we would say is to the extent that one believes that actually reducing Abeta and plaque has an effect on cognitive function, we feel very good about our clinical trials. However, the trials are the trials. We wait to see how they develop and we are eager to understand whether we can have an impact on this horrible disease.","Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Thank you, Roger, and, Darla, our next caller, please?","Operator","It's from Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","...taking the question. Maybe I could just double down on Tim's question at the risk of annoying you but, Roger, is it your expectation that the FDA will write a label for KEYTRUDA in lung cancer that will allow for broad use irrespective of PD-L1 status in the commercial setting? Yes or no?","And then perhaps for Adam, if the answer is yes, how do you think physicians are going to choose between KEYTRUDA and OPDIVO given that at least for a while OPDIVO will be the only one with a \u2013 presumably, the only one with an overall survival benefit actually described in label?","And then also, Roger, you mentioned, this is what everyone on Wall Street wants to hear you say so I'll just ask it. I don't know what you'll say, but you mentioned no \"imbalance in hospitalizations for heart failure.\" I assume that that clearly means no statistical difference between the arms. What everyone is asking though in our world is, can you also give us some comfort that there wasn't some sort of numerical difference that just optically is going to frighten us when we see the data? Thank you.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Executive Vice President & President, Merck Research Laboratories","Okay. Mark, so first of all, there is no yes or no answer to your question about FDA labeling. The FDA will make its own decision based on the data which you've seen and which we presented. I think that the data with respect to KEYTRUDA in lung cancer speaks for itself and FDA will want to inform physicians of the actual information that's available so that they can make their best judgments, and we'll see how that turns out. I can't predict yes or no what exactly that labeling language will look like. So that's the first answer.","With respect to the issue of TECOS, just to take that off the table, again, with respect to heart failure hospitalization the results in the two arms were balanced. They were completely balanced. That's, I think, all you need to know.","Adam H. Schechter - Executive VP & President-Global Human Health","And then, Mark, what I would say with regard to the marketplace, the first thing I'd like to say is that this is a very large market and it's not just looking at KEYTRUDA for one indication. If you look at KEYTRUDA, we're studying it over many, many different indications. I believe that this market can handle several competitors. So I don't think it should be looked at as one company versus the other, I think it should be looked at, these companies, including Merck, versus cancer and trying to change the way the world thinks about treating cancer.","If you look specifically at lung, I think that having the data we have is good. I think having high expressers and understanding what the benefit is in those patient types will allow the not only physicians but payers to start to think about the treatment algorithms they want to utilize to best treat patients. But I would look at this class more like the anti-TNFs where you have multiple competitors, they all do very well, they all have strong growth, some do a little bit better in one indication than another indication, but over time there's room for multiple, multiple competitors.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Thanks. I really appreciate it.","Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks, Mark. Thanks for the call \u2013 the question, excuse me. Great. Darla, next caller, please?","Operator","Is from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Just a follow up, Roger, what gives you confidence that the FDA will approve KEYTRUDA without a survival benefit just given that Bristol has now proven overall survival both squamous, non-squamous in both PD-L1 positive and negative express patients? So just if you could share that \u2013 your level of confidence in that issue.","And secondly, when do you plan to file in lung in Europe?","And then thirdly a question for you, Rob. I noticed that you highlighted a revenue hedging benefit and based on my math that would seem to be $200 million or about $0.06 to earnings. Is that how we should look at that and is that something that's going to continue for the rest of the year? Thanks.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Executive Vice President & President, Merck Research Laboratories","Jami, I have confidence that the data that we have provided to the FDA are registration worthy. We've identified a population of patients for whom we received breakthrough designation. We've had lots of discussions with the FDA. I think we recognize the benefit that inures to these patients from treatment with KEYTRUDA and we'll move forward on that basis.","With respect to the European filing, of course, as I mentioned, and as you know, KEYTRUDA's under review in Europe for melanoma and while that review process continues we'll wait and sit back and once we know what that answer is we'll be in a position to file with respect to non-small cell lung cancer.","Robert M. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Jami. With your question on the hedging, it's a little less than the number you quoted but generally you understand it correctly. It flows pretty consistently from the revenue down to earnings and as you look for the rest of the year, obviously it will depend on where currency rates end up. But assuming they continue where they are today, you should expect to see a proportion of benefits similar to what you saw in Q1 for the remainder of the quarters.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Jami. And, Darla, next caller?","Operator","It's from Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, guys. First question is if you could give more detail on KEYTRUDA and what's happened so far, number of patients on drug? How's it being used? Mono versus combo? First line, second line, that kind of thing?","Second question is on Hep C, can you talk about the potential here that there's some limitations just in the experienced patients just given the data that we saw?","And then third just on BRIDION, we keep hearing the same thing on BRIDION, is this ever going to make it through the U.S. FDA? Is there something new that they're bringing up or is this just the same old stuff and we're going to have to go back and do more data or what's happening here? Thanks.","Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations","Okay. So, Adam, do you want to take the KEYTRUDA mix of patients?","Adam H. Schechter - Executive VP & President-Global Human Health","Yeah, absolutely. Good morning, Marc. First of all, what I'd say is we had rapid penetration of our on-label indication, and if you look, we had sales of about $83 million. The U.S. was $66 million of that. Most of the patients that have been treating are on label. So we think about 75% of the patients are in the approved indication. This is where we promote KEYTRUDA. The NCCN coverage takes some time for physicians to become aware of and for them to adapt. I think that that will increase over time, but it's still early.","Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations","Roger?","Roger M. Perlmutter - Executive Vice President & President, Merck Research Laboratories","And, Marc, with respect to \u2013 you had two questions. First, with regard to our doublet treatment of HCV, and spoke of limitations, I actually think the data are extremely strong, and they are especially strong actually in patients that are difficult to treat who have for a variety of reasons fit into the category where it's difficult to get therapy to result in sustained virologic response. So I actually think the totality of the data set, and it's a very large data set, is really quite strong. I don't see it as limited in that way.","With respect to BRIDION, we think our data set well characterizes the hypersensitivity reactions that can occur with BRIDION administration. FDA is eager to get additional information about that study in particular, which they have asked for sensitivity analyses about, and they also intend to scrutinize the data from each individual site. And as soon as we can get that done, I'm hopeful that we and they will agree that BRIDION is appropriate for the U.S. market, but it's important that they have their questions answered, and we're doing everything we can to get those answers to them.","Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Thanks for the question, Marc. Darla, next caller?","Operator","It's from Gregg Gilbert with Bank with Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. First for Adam a KEYTRUDA commercial question. In the PD-1 space, so far I assume that the price is the price from the two companies. But my question is about whether you see these products moving into a contracting environment in lung cancer or perhaps not until there are more players or perhaps never in this class? What's your views on that and how it evolves over time?","And then for Roger, where do you see the field settling on first-line melanoma treatment, monotherapy PD-1 or combo therapy with ipi [ipilimumab]? Obviously some data out in both of those cases recently.","And lastly, Roger, beyond CETP, are there any sweet spots in cardiovascular research that you think make sense for Merck internally or externally given your current portfolio and heritage in the area? Thanks.","Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations","Adam?","Adam H. Schechter - Executive VP & President-Global Human Health","Hi, Gregg. The first thing is if you look at KEYTRUDA, the vast majority of formularies have put both products on formulary. And they are looking at this as a way to allow physicians to have choice. In this class, obviously, reimbursement is different, so the way in which you can contract is different than in other classes and how you might think about it. But I'd also say with so many different tumor types being developed, with so much different data by indication being developed, I think that over time there will be multiple products that will continue to be available so physicians can choose which product they want for which indication, which tumor type, and I don't see that necessarily changing right now over time.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks.","Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations","Roger?","Roger M. Perlmutter - Executive Vice President & President, Merck Research Laboratories","And, Gregg, with respect to therapy for melanoma, just to elevate a little bit, the good news is that more and more profound results are being obtained in patients who previously had no hope of treatment. And the results that we saw with KEYTRUDA monotherapy versus ipilimumab, previously the best available therapy for people with advanced disease, were so impressive that the Data Monitoring Committee had to stop the study early for a difference that emerged very early with respect to overall survival. So that's very good news.","The question is can we get beyond what we see with monotherapy in combination therapies and do better yet? And for there, first of all we need to see direct comparisons between the combination of a PD-1 directed therapy plus, let's say, a CTLA-4 directed therapy versus a PD-1 directed therapy alone. We are doing such studies. Bristol-Myers is doing such studies. We'll have an opportunity to see what those kinds of data look like, and that will be important. And beyond that there are other combinations, which may prove to be attractive, and we and others are pursuing those as well.","I see a better bright future for this, and I think we're going to continue to make strides. The platform of PD-1 directed therapy is, I believe, foundational for the treatment of this malignancy and for many others, and we're going to see further advances over the next few years; all good news.","With respect to cardiovascular disease, obviously we're doing a great deal. One of the things that we have been working on is the soluble guanylate cyclase activators. As a result of our recent interaction, we now have access to Adempas and in addition, we have a set of other compounds which come from Bayer and from us too, which address a whole family of interesting potential indications in that area. So we are doing a lot of work in cardiovascular research, and we're finding (48:38).","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks.","Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great, thank you, Gregg. Darla, our next caller.","Operator","It's from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning. Thank you for taken the questions. Congratulations on the quarter. Roger, do you anticipate having difficulty recruiting for the KEYNOTE-024 study in PD-L1 positive lung cancer patients given what you showed at AACR? If a patient has greater than 50% PD-L1 expression, why would they agree to go on chemo?","And then a follow-up for Rob. How much of the gross margin was driven by FX versus product mix? Thank you.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Executive Vice President & President, Merck Research Laboratories","Yes, Alex. It is a changing environment and data are coming in very, very rapidly. I think it's important to recognize that these studies are conducted around the world, in a variety of jurisdictions where we are at different stages in terms of the availability of PD-1 directed therapies. As is typical in such cases there are opportunities to do studies directly comparing the therapies that exist locally. There are important questions that are being asked in KEYNOTE-024, and so we are eager to see those studies completed and to be able to present those data.","Robert M. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And then with your question to product gross margin, if you look at the gross margin in the quarter, it grew about 240 basis points. And one of the major impacts was the fact that we had the divestitures of MCC and some of the other products, so the change in product mix. But if you look at it, a little less than half would have been coming from the benefit of FX.","Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks, Rob. Thanks, Alex. Darla, our next caller.","Operator","It is from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. I've had a number of my questions asked and answered already, but I guess I have a few more. First, can you comment on the expected EPS accretion from Cubist in 2015?","And then, could you provide a little bit more color, I know that you commented on the hedging benefit, but other revenues stepped up dramatically in the first quarter of 2015 relative to the fourth quarter of 2014. Could you provide any more quantification of the hedging benefit?","And then, as we look to modeling the second quarter of 2015, how should we model other revenue sequentially versus what you just reported in the first quarter of 2015? Thanks very much.","Robert M. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So if maybe I will take the second question first, and then we can jump into the Cubist question, as well. So if you look at other revenue in the quarter, it's really probably worth unpacking it a little bit because while in some ways it looks like a decline year-on-year, I would have you recall that in the first quarter of last year, we did have the gain from the sale of the U.S. SAPHRIS rights as well as the fact that we do have AstraZeneca joint venture revenues that were in that line that no longer repeat.","So in reality, we did see year-on-year an increase of about $250 million in that line. And if you look at it from that perspective, the vast majority of that was FX hedging gains we had in the quarter, as well as we did have the third-party manufacturing sales as a result of the MCC divestiture we still were supplying Bayer, and that sits in that line, and then we had alliance revenue. So those really are what drive the change in other revenue, but the single biggest piece of it, if you look at it year-on-year or frankly sequentially, is going to be the foreign currency hedge gains we had.","And then with regard to the Cubist accretion, recall when we gave the guidance on this deal earlier, we said we would expect it to be modestly accretive in 2015, and that continues to be the case.","Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Rob. Thank you, Dave. And Darla, our next caller?","Operator","It's from the line of John Boris with SunTrust Robinson.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thanks for taking the questions. First one on KEYTRUDA. There certainly has been a lot written in the trade publications, especially from the head of the FDA oncology division; he certainly has put his pen to approving products. We saw CYRAMZA approved in nine weeks, OPDIVO approved materially earlier than anticipated. Just your thoughts on is this a new paradigm out of the FDA, and could we see potentially earlier than expected approval of KEYTRUDA in lung, and if so are you ready commercially to match share of voice within the marketplace?","On HCV, just reiteration of your filing timeline there, and then Adam, any comments about Europe and Japan growth dynamics? Certainly it would appear that a lot of the growth is coming from ex-U.S. relative to U.S., but your commercial readiness to potentially launch HCV before the end of the year?","And then just lastly, can we anticipate Zilmax back in the model before the end of this year or back in the market? Thanks.","Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations","Okay. You want to start, Roger, with KEYTRUDA and timing, and Adam, go to share of voice?","Roger M. Perlmutter - Executive Vice President & President, Merck Research Laboratories","Yeah, so for KEYTRUDA and the KEYTRUDA review, I just would say that Dr. Pazdur speaks for himself. He is the head of the oncology review division, and he's made plain that he is eager to advance these programs as best he can working with his colleagues. He spoke at the meeting (54:28) directly to this point. We've tried to provide the agency with the information they need to make their decision, but it is their decision. I really can't speculate on timing.","With HCV with respect to filing, again, we will file by midyear.","Adam H. Schechter - Executive VP & President-Global Human Health","And then with regard to lung, so we are ready. As soon as we have approval, as soon as the FDA provides that to us we're ready to launch. We've been building our lung capabilities. We've added sales representatives. We already have sales representative selling Emend in many of those offices already, so we've built the customer facing teams, we've begun working on our scientific platform with key scientific leaders. So we are ready as soon as Roger and the team can work with the FDA to get us approval.","In terms of HCV, so we've been in this market for a long time, and if you look at our success when we launched our protease inhibitor, we did very well everywhere around the world. And if you look at markets in Europe, our market share was very high, I think higher than most people would have expected.","When we no longer promoted our PI in those markets, we kept a commercial presence because we knew at some point we'd be launching again into the marketplace. So we never left the market for HCV in Europe or Japan. In fact, in Japan we continued to promote PI in that market. So we are ready for HCV. We are very excited about that opportunity, and frankly as soon as Roger and the team work with the FDA to get us approval, we'll be off to the races. We think this is a very exciting opportunity for Merck. It's an exciting opportunity for patients, and we are certainly ready.","Robert M. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And, John, with your question regarding Zilmax, recall that we voluntarily withdrew that product. Right now we are in the midst of trying to work through an infield study working with our industry partners and given the timing of that we really can't speculate when we'll be back in the market. We're continuing to work through that, but right now for purposes of how we'd look at the year, I would not assume any Zilmax.","Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, John. Thanks for the call \u2013 questions. And, Darla, next caller?","Operator","It's from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.","Seamus C. Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks for the questions. Just a couple of quick ones on KEYTRUDA. I know it's short-lived but maybe, Adam, if you can help us with the percent of sales in the community versus academics? And if you can't give us that number maybe you could help us in terms of the increased penetration of physician \u2013 oncology physician practices for the on-label indication?","And then separately for the on-label indications, can you give us a sense of where you see the duration of therapy evolving at least in the melanoma setting?","And then my last question, as we think forward to your update on anacetrapib, can you just remind us how that sort of fits in terms of what your expectations were in terms of timing previously? What is the anacetrapib update coming toward the end of this year a little bit of a delay implying that events are coming in just a little bit more slowly? Thanks a lot.","Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations","Adam?","Adam H. Schechter - Executive VP & President-Global Human Health","Yeah, Seamus, so first of all with regard to KEYTRUDA, if you look at our sales, right now the vast majority of those, we believe greater than 75%, are for the approved indication in melanoma, and if you look at the break out between community-based versus not-community-based physicians, the majority of sales still are from the non-community-based physicians, from the big institutions. But you should know, we are in all the offices of not only the large institutions but the community practices as well and we continue to have a strong presence covering over 90% of the prescriptions of physicians prescribing for melanoma.","In terms duration, it's just too early. In this market the data is hard to find, so it's very difficult for us to tell you how long people in the marketplace that are starting a product have continued in taking the product. So it's just very early for us to have that type of data. The data in oncology is a little bit harder to get than in primary care.","Seamus C. Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay.","Roger M. Perlmutter - Executive Vice President & President, Merck Research Laboratories","And just to follow up on that, Seamus. This is Roger. As you know the duration of therapy in our clinical trials is two years because there is no marker that we can follow in responding patients that would tell us that it is essential to maintain the drug in order to keep the response, and that's one of the questions that is continuing to be explored in additional studies across the entire program.","And then with respect to anacetrapib, the protocol revision that has been proposed by the steering committee, assuming that it is accepted by governing bodies, will delay by a few months the first interim analysis but it's not going to affect the conduct of the study at all, which is proceeding exactly as planned and is, of course, end-point driven.","Seamus C. Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, Seamus. And, Darla, I think we have time for one more call.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Colin Bristow with Bank of America.","Colin N. Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. On hep C, could you talk about your level of confidence in developing a shorter regimen with one of the triplet combinations? And when will we first see data from that C-CREST trial?","And also on hep C, can you talk about how you see the pricing environment evolving in 2016 given the market's going to become increasingly crowded?","And then just a quick one on odanacatib, can you provide us an update on this program? Thanks.","Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations","Okay. Roger, do you want to talk a bit about this?","Roger M. Perlmutter - Executive Vice President & President, Merck Research Laboratories","Yeah, so for the hep C program, the question is, of course, can we \u2013 we have a terrific set of data that we presented with respect to doublet, and we've talked previously about developing a triplet therapy which would be pan-genotypic, shorter duration and could be used irrespective of comorbidity. So we continue to work on that.","Our triplet with 3682 is under study in Phase 2. We hope to be able to begin Phase 3 sometime perhaps in the beginning of next year or so. Data from the Phase 2 study should be available sometime around the end of this year. And once those data are available, that will help us to understand what we can do.","Of course, we've already previously published data demonstrating that we can use a shorter regiment by using sofosbuvir as the nucleoside inhibitor in combination with the doublet therapy. So we have some confidence that one could do that, but it needs to be explored, of course, with 3682, and that we'll do.","With respect to odanacatib, the program continues as we indicated before. We are working to adjudicate the set of adverse events that were scored in the study. It's a large study, and the adjudication process is proceeding in an independent and blinded fashion. We worked with the FDA to create that adjudication process. We hope it will be done soon and then we'll be in a position to file the drug.","Adam H. Schechter - Executive VP & President-Global Human Health","And Colin, in regard to the hepatitis C market, first, it's a very large market. There's more than three million patients in the U.S. alone, and there's more than 100 million patients worldwide, so we think that this will be a very big, a very important market over time. We've seen some of the pricing and contracting that's occurred in the market, but we believe that with our product, and that we're developing a highly-effective, well-tolerated ribavirin-free pan-genotypic regimen that has a minimal treatment duration for a broad variety of patients, that we can be successful in this market. And we believe that despite what's happened in the past with some of the pricing that it'll still be a very big important market for us. So we remain very excited about coming back into the hepatitis C market in the United States but also globally.","Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations","Okay. Thank you, Adam. And I'll turn it over to Ken.","Kenneth C. Frazier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Just to close the call, we are seeing steady progress, as you've heard, in our pipeline, and we're also experiencing solid growth in our underlying business. We're pleased with the momentum of the business, and we look forward to speaking with you again.
