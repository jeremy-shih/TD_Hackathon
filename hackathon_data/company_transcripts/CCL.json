I\u2019m Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation & plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning.","Today, I\u2019m joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison; David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Roberts, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking. Therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today\u2019s press release.","We achieved record second quarter adjusted earnings of $0.52 per share, that\u2019s on top of last year\u2019s previous record-setting second quarter and we exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.07. Our second quarter results combined with our strong book position enabled us to again increase the midpoint of our previous full-year guidance range and raise our full-year earnings expectations to a range between $3.60 and $3.70.","Year-over-year for the second quarter despite a $0.12 drag from fuel and currency both moving against us, strong operational improvement contributed $0.13 per share to the bottom line, which when combined with $0.02 of accretion from our share repurchase program enabled us to exceed the prior year\u2019s second quarter and the high-end of our March guidance range.","The efforts of our more than 120,000 employees around the world who deliver exceptional guest experiences every day, combined with the support of our valued travel agent partners propelled our strong financial performance.","Constant currency revenue yield growth this quarter exceeded 5% on top of the 3.6% improvement achieved in the second quarter last year. Our consistently strong revenue improvement continues to be driven by increasing demand in excess of our measured capacity growth through our ongoing guest experience, marketing and public relations efforts. And as previously indicated, we have many efforts underway to keep the momentum going throughout 2017 and beyond.","Our new ship deliveries continue to receive worldwide media attention and create more demand for cruising. We had two major ship deliveries this quarter, the luxurious Majestic Princess, or known by the Mandarin name of Sheng Sh\u00ec Gong Zhu Hao, the first international ship in the premium category tailored for the China market. Majestic features the largest shopping experience at sea, high-end and unrivalled, again, an experience tailored for Chinese preferences and many other distinct pleasures for our Chinese and our international guests.","She began her inaugural season in Europe before embarking on a momentous voyage along the Silk Road sea route in support of the One Belt One Road initiative to her new home port in Shanghai. On July 9, we will inaugurate her first season in China with a celebration that is sure to attract a lot of attention in mainland China.","Creating further awareness for cruising in Asia, we also delivered in Nagasaki AIDAperla to our AIDA brand for Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in a traditional Japanese ceremony. The ship will be in Palma de Mallorca, where she will be christened by German model and presenter, Lena Gercke, next weekend. AIDAperla is the sister ship of the very successful Adiaprima, which recently celebrated her first birthday in a tremendous fireworks display in a brilliant light show in the port of Hamburg witnessed in person by over 1 million people.","AIDAperla and Adiaprima bring many innovations to our industry as the first two cruise ships to be powered in port by liquefied natural gas, as well as many experiences tailored to AIDA\u2019s exclusively German guests, including a microbrewery, a lazy river, climbing wall and an expansive German spa.","During the quarter, progress continued on our fleet enhancement program with the sale of the Pacific Pearl in April. We\u2019re in conversation for additional ship sales and expect to remain on track with our historical pace of removing an average of one to two ships per year from our fleet.","Another great vehicle to drive demand for cruising is new destinations. Following our historic maiden voyage to Cuba by Fathom under the 12 approved forms of travelguideline Carnival Cruise Line will embark its first voyages to Havana in just a few weeks also under the same guidelines. Carnival Paradise sailing from Tampa is receiving attractive premiums for this in demand destination.","Our premium experience Holland America Line also recently received approval to sail to Cuba with Veendam calling at both Havana and Cienfuegos beginning in December this year. Over time, we expect more of our brands to join Carnival and Holland America with sailings to Cuba.","We continue to make progress on destination development to further enhance our guest experiences and are exploring new port developments, such as our recently proposed development on brand Bahama Island. Port development is another way in which we use our industry-leading scales to create meaningfully distinct greater guest experiences.","We have and we\u2019ll continue to create carefully engineered high-quality destination experiences that are uniquely tailored to our guest preferences from our private islands like Princess Cays and Half Moon Key to the planned expansion of our cruise terminal in Barcelona to our most recently completed port destination Amber Cove, in the Dominican Republic.","We\u2019re providing exceptional guest experiences that enable our brands to capture a price premium. We have many more innovations planned in port development that we expect to roll out in the coming years. ","Of course, we have additional efforts underway to drive demand for our existing fleet by elevating our already high guest experience. Our recently announced Ocean Platform featuring Ocean Medallion continues to go on a tremendous media interest with well over 16 billion media impressions year-to-date.","We remain on track to launch our first ship with the Ocean Platform, Regal Princess in November, ushering in a new era in highly personalized travel at scale. ","Focusing on the U.S. market for a moment, our Ocean original media content portfolio is now featuring four proprietary award winning shows and is already aired over 70 hours of programming our major networks including ABC, NBC, A&E and the CW, combined with our original content distribution on many more digital video on demand platforms, including Hulu, XFINITY U-verse, DirecTV, and Armed ForcesNetwork just to name a few. These programs have now reached over 115 million viewers to-date.","Importantly, market research indicates, these shows have notably increased consideration for cruising overall and favorability for our brands. In fact, a recent study on U.S. travel trends indicated visits to cruise websites are now at a historical high of 32% year-over-year and nearly double that of 2014.","In addition, the reputation institute just ranked Princess, Holland America and Seabourn as the top three brands in the cruise industry, with Seabourn leading the entire hospitality sector for brand reputation. At the same time, Carnival Cruise Line was for the third year in a row named the most trusted cruise line in America by Reader\u2019s Digest.","I would also like to acknowledge Carnival Corporations\u2019 recent ranking in the top quartile of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens by Corporate Responsibility Magazine, as well as the recent recognition our sustainability report received being ranked number one globally. Both of these are manifestation of the hard work our teams all around the world have put forth to achieve our sustainability results.","In addition to our relentless efforts to increase demand for cruising, we expect to benefit from structural long-term tailwinds, including growing populations, increasing wealth in developing countries, and importantly, in a number of markets increased spending by consumers on experience versus products all of which are contributing to the 4% annual growth expected in travel globally.","Our well known brands, our phenomenal guest experiences and our great vacation value proposition, all position us well to capitalize on these trends in every market. In fact, a recent study by ASTA indicates that the millennial generation not only spends more on travel than the baby boomer generation, but it\u2019s also more likely to cruise. Recent polls acknowledge both Holland America and Princess as top brands with the millennial generation.","During the quarter, progress continued on our many efforts to leverage our industry leading scale, including our powerful new revenue management system, which has been rolled out across six of our brands to approximately a third of those brands\u2019 inventory. The system development is encouraging collaboration among our 70 plus revenue scientists and experts across our brands as they take advantage of the dynamic and insightful pricing inquiry that the two generates.","While we have already enjoyed some benefit from the sharing of best practices during the design phase of the new tool and are seeing yield uplift in this ramp up period we expect even greater benefit in 2018 and beyond if the system is fully rolled out.","But at the same time work continues on our efforts to contain cost. We remain on track to achieve an additional $75 million this year for a cumulative savings of over $265 million today. We have increased our full year cost guidance slightly to reflect additional investments to be made later this year as our brands have identified further revenue generating opportunities. As we have indicated before, we will continue to invest in opportunities we see that drives revenue and return on invested capital over time.","All told, the success of our various efforts is evidenced by the improved second quarter results, combined with continuous strength in booking trend which has accelerated progress on our path to our double-digit return on invested capital and enabled a step-up in shareholder distributions.","During the last quarter we increased our regular quarterly dividend from $0.35 to $0.40 per share, now distributing nearly $1.2 billion of the recurring dividends annually. At the same time, our Board increased our ongoing share repurchase authorization back to $1 billion having been depleted through our $2.7 billion of cumulative repurchases since October of 2015. We plan to continue to increase returns to shareholders with our cash flow reaching Oracle record levels and growth as we approach the same double-digit return on invested capital.","Again, there are underpenetrated cruise markets all over the world. Our new ships including Majestic Princess and AIDAperla are ongoing innovative guest experience efforts including Ocean Platform. Our aggressive efforts to increase consideration for cruising, including our proprietary ocean original content programming, our new destination opportunities in Cuba and the Bahamas and in China, and our recently launched yield management tools are all multi-year opportunities that are intended to continue the momentum and to build further confidence towards our sustained delivery of double-digit return on invested capital.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to David.","David Bernstein","Thank you Arnold. Before I begin, please note all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I\u2019ll start today with a summary of our 2017 second quarter results, then I\u2019ll provide some insights on booking trends and finish up with an update on our full year 2017 guidance.","Our adjusted EPS for the second quarter was a record $0.52. As Arnold indicated, this was $0.07 above the midpoint of our March guidance. The improvement was revenue driven as increase in net ticket yield benefited from stronger pricing on closing bookings on both sides of the Atlantic, while on-boarding other yields continue to benefit from a variety of our ongoing initiatives.","Now let\u2019s turn to the second quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased almost 4%, the North American brands were up almost 6%, while the European, Australian and Asian brands, also known as our EAA brands, were up slightly. Our total net revenue yields were up 5.1%.","Now let\u2019s break apart the two components of net revenue yield. Net ticket yield were up 5.7%. This increase was driven by our North American brands deployment in the Caribbean, Europe and Alaska, as well as our EAA brands deployment in both Europe and the Caribbean. These increases were partially offset by decreases in our China deployment, as previously indicated. Net onboard and other yields increased 3.5%, with increases on both sides of the Atlantic.","In summary, as Arnold indicated, our record second quarter adjusted EPS was better than last year\u2019s previous record setting second quarter, with strong operational improvements of $0.13 and the $0.02 accretive impact of the stock purchase program, both being partially offset by the impact of higher fuel prices costing $0.11 and the unfavorable impact of currency worth a $0.01.","Now, let\u2019s turn to booking trends. Since the end of February, booking volumes for the next three quarters have been running in line with the prior year at nicely higher prices. At this point in time, cumulative bookings for the next three quarters are ahead of the prior year, again, at nicely higher prices.","Let\u2019s drill down into the cumulative book position. First, for our North American brands. The Caribbean and the seasonal European program are both well ahead of the prior year on both price and occupancy. While for Alaska, occupancy is in line at nicely higher prices.","Secondly, for our EAA brands, our European deployment and the seasonal Caribbean program, occupancy is ahead at nicely higher prices.","Finally, I want to provide you with an update on our full-year 2017 guidance. As Arnold indicated, our second order results combined with our strong book position enabled us to again increase in the midpoint of our guidance and raised our full-year earnings expectations to a range between $3.60 and $3.70 versus $3.45 for 2016.","The improvement was driven by an increase in our net revenue yield guidance to approximately 3.5%, a half point increase, reflecting the impact of stronger pricing on closing bookings during the second quarter and slightly higher onboard and other yields. This was partially offset by a slight increase in our costs.","For example, we planned increased investments in our four proprietary television programs, as well as advertising efforts to continue to optimize booking momentum for 2018 and beyond. As a result, net cruise cost without fuel for ALBD is now expected to be up approximately 1.5% for 2017.","And now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Arnold.","Arnold Donald","Thank you, David. Operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Steve Wieczynski","Hey, good morning, guys. Hope you\u2019re doing well, a great quarter. I want to ask about the embedded fourth quarter yield guidance, which looks like you\u2019re expecting yields to be up, at this point only slightly. I know last year, I think, you had a pretty strong fourth quarter with yields up about 4%, and I think there was about a 100 basis point benefit from that accounting change last year. So, I guess, the question is, can you help us understand your thought process around your key markets for the fourth quarter? I guess, I would have expected a number a little bit higher than that.","Arnold Donald","Hey, good morning, Steve. Thank you for your comments. Look, obviously, as you just say, we had a tougher comparison versus last year in the fourth quarter. But our guidance is always our best projection of future. There we \u2013 nearly always is unexpected challenges and we thought - anticipate that and are able to adjust to the change in circumstances.","But fundamentally, our guidance has remained the same. We added into, as we raised the midpoint of the full-year guidance, we added [the gains] [ph] to-date and let the guidance going forward the same, it\u2019s not anymore complicated than that.","Steve Wieczynski","Okay, gotcha. And then second question, I guess, in your prepared remarks, you didn\u2019t really give a lot of color around the Chinese market. Can you just maybe give us an update there in terms of what you\u2019re seeing, and how the changes with Korea and stuff like that have impacted your ability for \u2013 to take price?","And then maybe also just comment on Majestic Princess, I know that\u2019s a ship that was built specifically for China, but it seems like you\u2019ve decided to remove it for a couple of weeks. And, again, I know that\u2019s their slower winter months. But is there anything else that drove your decision to move that already?","Arnold Donald","Overall, again, thanks again for your question. So China, overall, as you know, is a relatively small percent of our current capacity. As we said in the past, it\u2019s an embryonic market, it\u2019s the B2B business. So the fact that the Chinese are not currently traveling to Korea we believe aggravated a situation there in terms of yield and bookings and what have you.","But honestly, at this point, because it is the B2B market, there are still always negotiations between the trade and the cruise companies like ourselves. So we believe it had an impact, indications would suggest that. But at this point, we can\u2019t concretely say Korea produced any effect, but we suspect it did.","In terms of overall, look, China is still going to be probably the largest cruise market in the world over time. It\u2019s an embryonic market, is very small today. Concerning your question about Majestic Princess, we\u2019re very excited about Majestic Princess. She is the first purpose built ship for China. We\u2019re excited about the naming ceremony coming up in Shanghai in July, where we\u2019re looking forward to that.","And in terms of her itinerary planning, we always optimize deployments, and we see the opportunity for Majestic Princess to not only be home ported in China, but also to take travelers from China on fly cruise to other destinations, as we do with national [lead delegated] [ph] ships in many of our other brands. And so we just see that as a way to optimize the first year deployment and opportunity to build the appetite for cruising in China, both fly cruise as well as home porting and local destination embarkation. So, I hope I answered to your question, you can pull if I missed a point.","Micky Arison","Yes, the only thing I will add that is, we talked about the challenges in China. But the recent sailings have been at very high occupancy levels, and so we were very pleased with that.","Steve Wieczynski","Okay. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. Good quarter.","Arnold Donald","Thank you. Appreciate it, Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead.","Robin Farley","Great, thanks. I wanted to focus a little bit on the comment about volumes during the second quarter that they were in line with last year prices well ahead, because I know that investors are always aware of that, would that be due to demand not being higher than last year, or maybe you can clarify, is that just because you\u2019d rather get higher price and then you don\u2019t want to be any further booked ahead than you were at this time last year? In other words, can you comment on how we should be interpreting that like, is that a function of your yield management strategy that that\u2019s actually what you were striving for, or are you just sort of saying [Multiple Speakers]","Arnold Donald","I\u2019m sorry, go ahead, Robin, continue please? Yes.","Robin Farley","I think also just with a couple of security incidents in Europe that investor concern might be like if that\u2019s impacting demand. So maybe you can clarify if it\u2019s that, or if it\u2019s, in fact, that you\u2019d rather get the higher price and didn\u2019t want to be further ahead in volume?","Arnold Donald","Got it. So first of all, yes, absolutely, we haven\u2019t been able to measure any kind of impact from the various geopolitical issues and events in Europe and that sort of thing. So we haven\u2019t seen any lost momentum. We see strong momentum in the business all the way through, it\u2019s very early to be talking about first-half of next year. But through the first-half of next year, we\u2019re up on occupancy, up on pricing, against a very tough comparison, because obviously a strong year this year, strong year last year, so lot\u2019s of momentum in the business for certain.","Your comment about optimization of the booking curve looking at price versus volume at different points in time and booking curve is absolutely true. We have a new revenue management tool for a number of other brands and we are constantly always optimizing across \u2013 brands across multiple source markets and itineraries. And so that is a fair comment. But with regards momentum in the business, now the momentum is very strong.","Robin Farley","Okay, now that\u2019s great. Thanks. And then just to clarify a little further on your \u2013 so your guidance for Q3 is higher than what Street expectations were and I think there were concerns about Europe. So the Q3 guidance is great. And I know you tend to be conservative here looking at Q4 and you said that\u2019s kind of your best guess as of now. But just trying to think about, I mean, you guys have nicely beat your guidance every quarter lately. And so when we look at your guidance for Q4, I\u2019m getting something like 1% to 1.5% yield range. I\u2019m just trying to think what we should think about that as you\u2019re conservative to your guidance and we should look at it through the same lens that we\u2019ve looked at your guidance the last couple of quarters, which has \u2013 you\u2019ve managed to come in better than. I\u2019m wondering is there anything, in particular, dry-docks or something in the comp that is more concrete that that would make the number in that range?","Arnold Donald","Look I think, the reality is that we have beat the number of quarters in a row, one quarter that won\u2019t happen. And hopefully, it\u2019s not any quarter soon, but it\u2019s bound to happen eventually. We always give our best guesstimate. There are always things that happen in the market, as you know. I mean, we\u2019ve gone through a lot of stuff, fuel, currency \u2013 fuel and currency moving together at the same time. We have all kinds of other issues with, you can\u2019t go to Istanbul, you can\u2019t go here, typhoons, hurricane, cyclones all that stuff.","So we always give our best estimate, but we don\u2019t think, we\u2019re being ultraconservative. But obviously, we do factor in that things can go wrong. And we want to still perform and we will deliver towards the double-digit return of invested capital which is our commitment. We\u2019re marching hard and fast towards that, and we do have tougher comparisons as Steve pointed out in his question in the fourth quarter as well than we had in these other quarters where we\u2019ve done about a 4%, et cetera, versus prior year.","Robin Farley","Okay, great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Jaime Katz","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I\u2019m curious, you guys had mentioned some additional investments you\u2019re going to be making in the fourth quarter, if you would be willing to elaborate on any of them and how you might think they might add to the economics of the business longer-term?","Arnold Donald","Absolutely. So the brands are all reviewing their forward plans. They want to maintain the momentum, they\u2019re enjoying and we\u2019re getting smarter and smarter about how to invest dollars. So while there is a plan to increase spend versus where we were previously planning, because they have recognized opportunities in media and some socials, but also some of our proprietary TV programs that David mentioned.","Those are some areas we\u2019ve looked at. There are other areas too as well and we\u2019re ramping up an investment with some onboard efforts on the number of ships and so on. So that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s driving it, but they\u2019re all revenue related, they\u2019re all double-digit return on invested capital related. We\u2019re seeing almost smart investments and that\u2019s why we\u2019re taking a look at increasing.","Jaime Katz","Okay. And then can you talk about the cruising to Cuba? How you guys are thinking about investing in infrastructure over the long-term now that it seems like, at least, over the near-term the cruise industry won\u2019t be disrupted by any government policies that are coming about?","Arnold Donald","It would be disruptive. It is disruptive in terms of making investments in ports and what not. I\u2019m not sure we have the freedom to do that under the current regulations. But as you look at it long-term, of course, we \u2013 as things evolve, when we are able to invest, we would look forward to co-investment.","With Cuba or investing directly, if they allow that to develop ports. Cuba is going to really refresh the Caribbean. Obviously, today is a teeny tiny portion of our capacity. You won\u2019t be able to even find the numbers in our overall reporting. But we\u2019re excited about Carnival with Paradise sailing out of Tampa starting soon and this month still we are in June yet. And Holland America starting up in November, December.","So we\u2019re very excited about those two brands going falling on top of the historic year we have with Fathom and Adonia, and obviously, we were applying for the other brands to go. But it will be a while before we can actually financially invest in developing port infrastructure, that doesn\u2019t mean that Cubans won\u2019t do it themselves though.","Jaime Katz","Okay. And then lastly, can you just comment on capital allocation? I know you noted that there was a new share buyback or an increase to the repurchase authorization, but with prices at really high levels, at least, for share prices how they run up. How do you think about balancing dividend increases versus share repurchases? Thanks.","Arnold Donald","Yes, you bet. First of all, the share price are at historical highs, but obviously, we don\u2019t think they\u2019re high enough. But having said that, we\u2019re always opportunistically looking at the repurchase and we\u2019ll continue to buyback shares. The balance is the Board decision. But I\u2019d say, our pattern historically has been established with the dollar amounts that we\u2019ve done of over $2.7 billion, I guess, since 2015 in buybacks. Obviously, we were up to about $1.2 billion in dividend distributions on an annual basis now. So when you look at that, I would say, until the Board says otherwise that\u2019s been our historical pattern.","David Bernstein","Yes. And the only thing I\u2019ll add to that is, we have traditionally said that, we\u2019re targeting a dividend payout ratio of 40% to 50%. And as Arnold indicated, we recently increased the quarterly dividend in April, well, the Board did.","Jaime Katz","Thank you so much.","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Beckel with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","David Beckel","Thank you so much. Based on our estimates, it looks as if your China capacity will be declining in 2018 somewhere in the high single-digit range, some of your peers are also in a similar situation. Kind of following on one of the first questions asked, under the assumption you\u2019re optimizing yield and fly cruise makes sense and all that. But what is it about the China market that you feel needs to change in order for meaningful amounts of capacity to be redeployed into that market?","Arnold Donald","Hey, thank you. First of all, my expectation is that there will be additional capacity deployed in the coming years. In any given year for any specific balance of ships and brands for us, our decisions are very specific to our brands and the balancing of itineraries around the world and the balancing of optimizing yield.","So we will be down next year in China a little bit on capacity. And again, that\u2019s not only about China, it\u2019s much about opportunities around the world, because our philosophy is, we always want to optimize and what we generate from our ships. So \u2013 but I don\u2019t \u2013 China long-term it\u2019s going to be a huge market. We\u2019re extremely excited about our partnership with CSFC that has moved along very nicely.","We still have lots of work to do with the trade there in China with distribution system. But again, just please keep in mind, the industry is tiny there. I mean, we\u2019re very, very, very small, and these little moves hopefully. Hopefully the fact that there is less capacity next year. We\u2019ll create the opportunity for yield improvement in China hopefully. But you can\u2019t evenguarantee that, because there\u2019s still a B2B business. This isn\u2019t actually selling to consumers where consumers are saying, oh, if you drop the price, I would cruise more. It\u2019s really a business to business transaction still at this stage.","David Beckel","Got it. It\u2019s very helpful, thanks.","Arnold Donald","And just on the revenue management system, is there any color you can give us as to how much, I know, this is probably a rough math, but how much yields have improved thus far because of specific actions you\u2019ve implemented on the revenue management side?","Arnold Donald","To be honest with you, we obviously have internal estimates and stuff on that, which we wouldn\u2019t disclose. But the reality \u2013 the fact of the reality is, there are so many variables moving at once. What we do know is that the roll out is progressing very nicely. As we shared with you before about a third of the inventory of the brands, the six brands that happen to use in the tool, that\u2019s \u2013 there the inventory is impacted and going to be close on a percentage of those brands.","In 2018, the brands are tremendously excited about it, is definitely contributing to positive results, there\u2019s no question about that. And we will continue to contribute positive results for the rest of this year and beyond across multiple brands with it. But I won\u2019t segment how much is yield or versus how much is other dynamics in the business demand creation and so on is the cumulative effect of all of it. But I have lots of anecdotal things I can share with you on specific itineraries, where yield would mean a difference, but the cumulative effect is definitely positive.","David Beckel","Would it \u2013 if I could ask about one specific anecdote, to maybe highlight your point?","Arnold Donald","Absolutely, so our UK team was working on a particular itinerary and the two suggested certain pricing, the team thought that didn\u2019t make any trends. They went back and to take a hard look at the two itself to see what was wrong with it, why was it suggesting this. They couldn\u2019t find anything wrong with it, so they decided to travel on that particular itinerary and they ended up generating consumer more yield because they ended up instead of dropping price, you know taking the place up and when they further analyzed that the two gives you a lot more granularity, when they further analyzed it, they could see by meta, what was going on and why the two recommended an increase in certain metas and leaving the meta where they were being challenged flat as opposed to reducing the price.","And so in the end, it produced significantly more yield in that particular itinerary than what have been achieved otherwise. So there\u2019s lots of those kinds of examples. But overall, it\u2019s allowing our people to \u2013 on a much more granular level, look at itineraries at different points in time. The two provides great inquiry and in the end it requires yield management by our yield experts and revenue scientists, but it allows just much, much more granular inquiry and execution in terms of smaller and more frequent price moves.","Beth Roberts","Meta is a Cabin category.","Arnold Donald","Yes, meta is a Cabin category, just wanted to make sure you understood what that was, yes, okay.","David Beckel","Very well, thanks so much.","Arnold Donald","Thank you, all right.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.","Harry Curtis","Hey good morning everybody.","Arnold Donald","Good morning.","Harry Curtis","Just a follow-up \u2013 good morning, on your comments about the fourth quarter, sorry to beat the dead horse, but can you \u2013 are there any specifics that you are really worried about any, because the tone of the business in your key markets changed in the fourth quarter to lead you to have a bit more conservative outlook?","Arnold Donald","There is nothing in terms of the business that we are particularly concerned about, just the normal stuff that happens every year. But as I mentioned before, you know part of the yield difference is the fact of a tougher comparison, you know fourth quarter last year with fourth quarter this year versus the other quarters to the previous quarter. But other than that one specific dynamic that would drive something that looks differently, there is nothing in particular that we\u2019re concerned about, looking ahead, that\u2019s different than we would be every year at this time of the year.","Harry Curtis","Okay. And then a quick question on supply growth. It looks to me like your supply growth in 2018 should be up just under 2% and I\u2019m curious how you see just the overall supply growth shaping up in 2018 for your core markets in Europe and the Caribbean?","David Bernstein","Sure, you know we can give you that detail. You know\u2026","Beth Roberts","Caribbean for 2018 versus 2017 for us is up 4% to 5%, and Europe market is up 3% globally, Alaska is up 7% to 8%, in total we\u2019re up 2.5%, so we are seeing capacity reductions in Australia and certainly in China.","Arnold Donald","And for the industry?","David Bernstein","The industry capacity which is up 5 \u2013 in 2018, it\u2019s 5.9%.","Arnold Donald","Yes, 5% or so, almost 6% at this point.","Harry Curtis","Okay and last question, could you mentioned\u2026","Arnold Donald","And \u2013 go ahead, go ahead.","Harry Curtis","Well, I just wanted to shift gears, you had commented that you had an outlook including the next three quarters and David if you could talk about what percentage you\u2019re roughly booked for the first quarter of next years, typically it should be around 35% to 40% at this point? And kind of how is tone looking at least at the early part of next year in terms of occupancy and pricing?","David Bernstein","Okay, yes, you know I can give you, so Harry, you know we have traditionally said that like for the next few quarters, for the current quarter we are 80% to 90% booked, is the historical range. For the next quarter out, which would be fourth quarter 50% to 70%, is the historical range. First quarter would be 30% to 50% and second quarter would be 15% to 25%. And we are approaching the high-end of all of the historical ranges as with the current booking curve.","Harry Curtis","And at prices that are nicely ahead or well ahead or blowing the doors off ahead?","David Bernstein","As we said for \u2013 as Arnold said for next year, when the prizes are ahead, I\u2019d rather not give some particular additive to describe them at this point only because it\u2019s early and we are not ready to give guidance for next year.","Harry Curtis","Okay, very good thanks","Arnold Donald","Hey, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Tim Conder","Thank you. Circling back to Arnold to the demand creation comments in the fourth quarter to drive teen, is that \u2013 would you say skewed to any one region in particular, more so than the other, I mean it looks like Europe and North America are performing the best, whether they skewed anyway to Australia, New Zealand and Asia or is that fairly well balanced across regions?","Arnold Donald","You know I would say most of the \u2013 that\u2019s where increases are in the core markets, it\u2019s in U.S. and Europe, very strong markets where people see opportunities to have to lead stronger and that\u2019s where the requests are today and what we\u2019ve factored into the guidance.","Tim Conder","Okay and if you would, David or Beth, just maybe repeat your commentary on Australia and China as far as your capacity in those markets? And then, to follow-on to that question, you said the industry is going to be up 5.9%, any color on the industry level by those regions that you gave for Carnival Corp?","David Bernstein","Yes, we want \u2013 we\u2019ll \u2013 Tim, we\u2019ll have the industry data at the third quarter call, today we\u2019ve got our data in total for 2018.","Arnold Donald","You know just another comment on that. Obviously we had some significant capacity increase for example in the Caribbean this year and I remember a number of the analysts were expressing consternation last year about that, and obviously we\u2019ve done very, very well. I think the reality is that as long as we\u2019re creating the demand to observe the capacity, then the industry can continue to do very well, we certainly plan to do well because we are going to create the demand, we are going to do magic capacity growth for our brands. And we are doing the things necessary through enhanced revenue management techniques using yield in our existing platforms that we already have or Carnival and Costa.","David Bernstein","And as for as China and Australia concerned, we are talking about mid-single digit capacity declines in each of those deployment markets.","Tim Conder","Okay...","Arnold Donald","And then just to pile on a little bit, because we\u2019re getting a lot of questions on the fourth quarter, I just want to emphasize you all that fourth quarter is ahead of a record fourth quarter last year and there is absolutely no loss of momentum.","Tim Conder","One last question. As you rightly said that before Arnold, you know in China you get SARS, one year typhoons, you get South Korea whatever, I mean there is always something going on. So the normal, I guess that is a normal, but have you seen just in general over the last 12 months for yourself, the industry, however you want to comment on this, has the cost structures, profitability structures changed in any way material either up or down over the last 12 months?","Arnold Donald","Over the last 12 months, not so much. I would say the biggest change over the last 12 months, if you look at our earnings call today and compare it to earnings last year, is the double whammy of fuel and currency. Historically, it never moved together and for the past year or so. They have been moving together and often in a negative way. And so that\u2019s a big thing to overcome \u2013 we overcome it operationally with performance. But that would be the one fundamental thing that I would say changed.","Tim Conder","Okay.","Arnold Donald","And despite all the stuff going on we have had four quarters of 4% yield improvement.","Tim Conder","Okay. Thank you.","Arnold Donald","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Jared Shojaian","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick clarification, the 5.9% global industry supply growth that you referenced, is that net or gross? And then can you give us the comparable number in 2017?","Micky Arison","Sure, it is a gross number. The only thing we do is anything that we know of, we would take out. But obviously, at this point, there could very well be some unplanned retirements.","Beth Roberts","And 2017 was 5.3%.","Jared Shojaian","Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. And then you talked about some tougher comparisons in fourth quarter. But you\u2019re also going to have tougher comparisons once we get into 2018. So how should we think about that 1% implied yield in the fourth quarter in relation to 2018? I guess, what I\u2019m asking is a 1% exit rate going into 2018 would imply that demand has to get better in order for you to do better than a 1% yield in 2018? Is that the right way to think about it, or is there anything else I\u2019m missing, I know there\u2019s geographical differences in the fourth quarter versus 2Q. and 3Q next year. But can you help me think about that a little bit better?","Arnold Donald","Yes, we\u2019re not ready obviously to give guidance for 2018 yet. We were just given you guys early preliminary tone, which you shouldn\u2019t read too much into, because it\u2019s such a small percent of the business at this point that we have line of sight on. So we\u2019re not ready to give any guidance, but all the things that you just mentioned are true, there\u2019s a mix difference. We have to see what we actually do. We\u2019re giving you a guidance for the fourth quarter. We have to see what we actually perform before we can begin to have line of sight on how we\u2019re going to perform before we give some. But it is ahead at higher prices and that\u2019s what we can see, but we\u2019re not ready to give guidance in terms of percent.","Beth Roberts","And the booking currency are at the high end of historical range, and we\u2019ve got good booking momentum and we feel very good about the business.","Jared Shojaian","That\u2019s great. Thank you. And then just one last one, you called out some incremental costs for this here. Are those 50 basis points of incremental cost unique to this year, or will you expect them to be recurring again in 2018?","Arnold Donald","We\u2019ve been able to maintain the momentum that I had shared with you guys previously of targeting $75 million a year in cost savings. And as I\u2019ve told you, some of that will go to bottom line and some we might reinvest to drive yield. And so right now, the brands have put forth some pretty convincing argument of additional revenue improvement by making investments, so we\u2019re doing it. But we\u2019ll be revealing that as we go. I wouldn\u2019t consider it a pattern or projection for what we\u2019re going to always do anything like that. But in this particular case with a specific proposals they presented with the evidence they put with it, it seems like a smart investment to make.","Beth Roberts","And keep in mind, we do round everything to the nearest half a point. So it\u2019s not necessarily a full 50 basis points.","Jared Shojaian","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Brian Egger with Bloomberg Intelligence. Please go ahead.","Brian Egger","Yes. Just a follow up question regarding the proceeding cost question, I think you kind of covered this. But to understand it to the extent that you\u2019ve seen increases in investments in proprietary TV program here, advertising costs, is the change albeit small in cost, unit cost guidance for the full-year a function of the timing of things like marketing advertising or the absolute level, or if any color you can add there would be helpful?","Arnold Donald","No, it would be absolute level. We were actually looking at investing more than we would have at the beginning of the year.","Brian Egger","Okay.","Arnold Donald","So we see the opportunity and we\u2019re taking advantage of it.","Brian Egger","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Peter McMillan with Tiger Management. Please go ahead.","Peter McMillan","Good morning.","Arnold Donald","Good morning.","Peter McMillan","Several of us were impressed with the\u2026","Beth Roberts","Peter?","Micky Arison","Peter, can you hear us?","Arnold Donald","Are you guys there? Hello? I can hear somebody.","Operator","Mr. McMillan, your line is still open. Please go ahead.","Peter McMillan","Can you hear me?","Arnold Donald","Now, we can hear you Peter. Okay, go ahead.","Operator","Oh, he just disconnected.","Arnold Donald","Okay. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your question.","Dan McKenzie","Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys.","Arnold Donald","Good morning, Dan.","Dan McKenzie","Arnold, following up on your commentary about under-penetrated cruise markets all over the world, I believe there are a number of ports in China that are developed, but not yet home ports for the industry. And wondering what the plans are today to expand the number of points there? And at what point would that make sense?","Arnold Donald","As you mentioned, there are several new cruise being added in China, where being constructed in Berlin, Shanghai, Sanya, Hainan Island. There are several others moving forward toward construction on the approval process. So there are quite a few ports being developed, which again reinforces the point we\u2019ve been taking that over time, we expect China to be the largest cruise market in the world. We\u2019ll obviously take advantage of those. We have to build the distribution. But as you know, China often builds in anticipation of demand coming. But we are obviously in discussion with all those ports about existing tonnage that we have in the country and possible new tonnage that we will bring in future years.","Dan McKenzie","Understood. And then just a second question here, just given that kind of the revenue management system. I\u2019m wondering what the opportunity is just to source elsewhere in the region for the China cruises, so in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, even Malaysia, I\u2019m wondering what you\u2019re doing today, if anything? And is there revenue opportunity from optimizing these various sourcing markets?","Arnold Donald","I think that\u2019s a great point. There\u2019s considerable opportunity not only in China, but throughout Southeast Asia, both as a source markets and clearly obviously, as destinations now that Chinese travelers are already traveling to and could choose to take advantage of a cruise option in those travels. So both from a sourcing standpoint, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, but clearly, as destination opportunities for Chinese travelers.","And so we have an overall strategic footprint in place and have strategic plans in place to take advantage of both, the fly cruise opportunity as well as sourcing more from those regions.","Dan McKenzie","Thanks so much. I appreciate it.","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","Operator","We have a follow-up question from the line of Peter McMullen with Peter McMullen Consulting. Please go ahead.","Peter McMullen","Again, just some of us were wowed by the potential of the Medallion. And I\u2019m just wondering if you could review what benefits you see for the company long-term?","Arnold Donald","As you know, we\u2019re excited about it. It\u2019s going to launch in November. The first ship experience for the public will be then. Progress has been very exciting with it. Our \u2013 one of fun things for me to see is how excited our crew is because the technology for us, as you know, Peter, is about enhancing the hospitality experience and it\u2019s about enhancing our crew\u2019s ability to deliver to the guest what they want, when they want, how they want it and exactly when they want it. And so, we\u2019re very excited about that.","In terms of the impact for us, we\u2019ll have to see. We think there\u2019s all kinds of opportunities, onboard revenue opportunities, ticket pricing opportunities. There is lot of excitement. But it\u2019s brand-new, it\u2019s brand-new technology and systems and we have to leave it out, but we\u2019re very excited.","Peter McMullen","In the early days, it will be a competitive advantage to Carnival?","Arnold Donald","Well, the reality is, as you know, we consider our competition land-based vacations, and not the other cruise coming back because we think we\u2019re so much better than them or anything. It\u2019s just because if you add up all the cruise companies to get all the cabins, it\u2019s less than 2% of the hotel rooms, and that\u2019s why we feel, we\u2019re underpenetrated at every market in the world. And so there\u2019s great opportunity for cruise for ourselves as well as the other cruise.","So land-based vacation is really the challenge. We think we already have a great value and experience offering compared to land-based vacations and we think Ocean will just take that up on a whole another level, but we\u2019ll see.","Peter McMullen","Thank you.","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","Operator","We have no further questions in the phone line.","Arnold Donald","Excellent. Thank you all very much. We greatly appreciate your interest. We look forward to meeting with you on the earnings call in the next time and seeing you in between. So everybody, be safe and good luck on draft day. Hopefully, your team will get the player you want. Have fun. Take care.","Micky Arison","Bye-bye, everybody.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s call. We thank you for your participation and ask you to please disconnect your lines."],"4381":["Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) Q3 2018 Earnings Conference Call September 27, 2018 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Arnold Donald - CEO, President","Micky Arison - Chairman","David Bernstein - CFO & CAO","Beth Roberts - SVP, IR","Analysts","Steve Wieczynski - Stifel","David Beckel - Bernstein Research","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research","Jaime Katz - Morningstar Research","Robin Farley - UBS","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo Securities","Assia Georgieva - Infinity Research","Jamie Rollo - Morgan Stanley","Arnold Donald","Good morning, everyone. And welcome to our Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation & Plc. Today, I'm joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison; as well as David Bernstein, Chief Financial Officer, and Beth Roberts, our Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking. Therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today\u2019s press release.","We delivered a record third-quarter earning $1.7 billion on revenues of 5.8 billion, the highest quarterly performance in the history of our company. Adjusted earnings of $2.36 per share were higher than last year's record breaking result of $2.29 and $0.09 above the midpoint of June guidance. Once again, our operating performance overcame fueling currency moving against us this time by a further $0.02 per share compared to our June guidance, bringing the total drag to $0.08 for the quarter compared to the prior year.","Strong execution will deliver a further $0.09 of improvement to the bottom-line this year compared to our June guidance, more than overcoming a further $0.06 drag from fueling currency, enabling us to increase our full-year guidance by $0.03 from a range of $4.15 to $4.25 to $4.21 to $4.25. Again, these results are testament to the effort of my fellow very passionate team members across our company globally who go above and beyond every day and of course also a testament to the tens of thousands of travel professionals who so enthusiastically support our brands.","On another note, since we released our sustainability report this quarter, it is appropriate to point out the combined efforts of our 120,000 plus team members also furthers our strong commitment to sustainability, helping to achieve a 26% unit reduction in carbon emissions since establishing the goal, surpassing our 2020 target three years ahead of schedule and leaving us on track to achieve nine additional sustainability goals as discussed in our recently published annual report, sustainability from ship to shore.","We also closed the quarter on another positive note, celebrating the naming of our AIDAnova at a spectacular open air concert and light show by Grammy-winning DJ and producer David Guetta at the Meyer Werft shipyard in Papenburg Germany. The sold-out event was attended by more than 25,000 people and viewed online by thousands and thousands more, another example of how we create demand for our world leading cruise line brands.","This next generation ship was designed exclusively for our German guests and reinforces our leading industry presence in Germany twice that of our closest cruise peer. AIDAnova is also significantly more efficient. In fact, she is over 20% more unit cost efficient and over 35% more fuel efficient than the AIDA fleet average, which bodes well for returns in the future. AIDAnova makes history as the world's first cruise ship ever to be powered in port and at sea by liquefied natural gas, which is yet another of our many efforts to further environmental stewardship.","During the quarter, we completed contracts for two more next generation ships powered by LNG both for our Princess brands to be delivered in 2023 and 2025, bringing the total number of ships on order fully powered by LNG to 11. All ongoing efforts by our brands to create demand this past quarter included Carnival Cruise Lines launching Homeport Advantage campaign highlighted by a customized airship. The blimp visited a number of critical port cities to raise awareness for Carnival Cruise Lines' industry-leading 18 U.S. embarkation options.","In the process, Carnival showcased four of its fleet ships. In fact, just last week, the Choose Fun airship came to Miami to welcome Carnival Horizon to its new year around homeport. It was done with a well publicized events hosted by Carnival's Chief Fun Officer, Shaquille O'Neal and players from Miami Heat. This month-long campaign has garnered nearly 200 million media impressions. Holland America announced a partnership with Rolling Stone to create Rolling Stone Rock Room, bringing a live classic rock experience to its innovative Music Walk complementing Lincoln Center Stage, Billboard Onboard and B.B. King's Blues Club.","Holland America Line also partnered with O Magazine for a new girls getaway cruise to be offered onboard their next ship Nieuw Statendam, Oprah Winfrey, the ship's godmother will personally join this very special sale. Princess topped 1 billion media impressions on the back of its Summer of Shark campaign, building on a strong partnership with Discovery Channel and the 30th anniversary of Shark Week. Also luxury brand Seabourn received approval to begin sailing to Cuba, featuring five ports of call in Cuba. Seabourn is our third brand also departures to Cuba joining contemporary Carnival brand and premium Holland America. In total, we have 7 ships and 80 calls in Cuba next year, 50% more than this year.","In the UK, P&O Cruises revealed the name of its newest ship Iona in a social media event featuring UK TV personality Stephen Mulhern.","Iona opened to strong demand with its first day of sales achieving double, the record volumes Britannia had four years ago. For Cunard, new global deployments have been driving strong demand. They just completed the third Transatlantic Fashion Week a very successful program. Next summer, Cunard will return to Alaska for the first time in 20 years, which has also been booking very strong. In Italy, Costa celebrated its 70th anniversary with a highly publicized festival in hometown Genoa, joined 120,000 plus attendees and millions of media mentions. We also made meaningful progress on our innovation efforts this past quarter, again putting our industry-leading scale to work.","As you know, this quarter, we completed the rollout of YODA, our state-of-the-art revenue management tool to six of our brands, which will continue to drive incremental revenue particularly in the second half of 2019 and beyond. We achieved a major milestone this quarter in our measured ramp-up of our Ocean platform, having our first full ship Caribbean Princess with all guest onboard experiencing Ocean Medallion class cruising. Guest satisfaction scores onboard Caribbean Princess for the period are up substantially and are among the highest in the fleet. We continue to make refinements and add more features while pacing ourselves toward expanding deployment across the Princess fleet.","We are closing in on fiscal 2018 and remained on track to deliver record full-year results and more importantly achieve double-digit return on invested capital based on the strategy we put in place five years ago. We are also very excited to usher in 2019 as we continue in our journey to sustain double-digit returns of invested capital with continued growth in both earnings and returns overtime. Next year, four new more efficient ships will enter service beginning with Holland America's new Nieuw Statendam, Guy Princess, Costa Esmeralda, purpose-built for our European guests and Costa Benicia, Costa's first ship to be purpose-built for China. As you can see our new capacity is vastly deployed across different brands as well as different source markets and destinations.","At the same time, we have sold into the secondary markets, a higher number of ships than past years. We recently announced four ships will leave the fleet next year. We will continue on our path of measured capacity growth, adding more efficient ships, replacing less efficient ships over time. Also, we are expecting net capacity growth to be 4.7% next year, and below 5% compounded annually through 2022. And with 20 ships on order which are scale free economies, we expect this more efficient capacity to drive greater earnings growth going forward. And we have been consistent with our execution around measured capacity growth, we are spreading that growth over a number of brands and increasing number of geographic regions, and we are careful when and where we add capacity.","As always, there will be temporary overconcentration of capacity in individual markets, there are every year, and as we have demonstrated, we can and will continue to manage that because overall we operate in an industry that is both underpenetrated and capacity constrained, and we are working aggressively to grow demand for our brands, which will allow us to continue to fill our ships at increasingly attractive rates while still providing a better value relative to the equivalent land-based alternatives. We look to continue to drive earnings and return on invested capital as we shift towards higher capacity increases and cost-containment, driving proportionally more about growth in earnings, leaving us less reliant on the same levels of revenue yield improvement to continue to achieve higher earnings and returns.","At the same time, our strong cash flow and balance sheet enabled us to accelerate our share repurchase program. Optimistically, acquiring nearly $750 million of Carnival shares this June, and investing over $1.2 billion in share repurchases so far this year, bringing the total to $4.4 billion cumulatively since resuming the share repurchase program just three years ago. In fact, we replenished the share repurchase program back up to $1 billion twice this year, first in April and again this past quarter. The share repurchases of course is in addition to our recurring dividend distributions. As you may recall, we also increased our quality dividend in April, bringing dividend distributions to $1.4 billion annually. Our strong cash flow and balance sheet leave us well positioned to continue to opportunistically return cash to our shareholders.","We remain unwaveringly committed to growing earnings and growing return on invested capital overtime, through a combination of creating demand in excess of measured capacity growth, while containing cost and leveraging our industry-leading scale. Our team has continued to deliver and that execution when combined with the strong fundamentals that characterize our industry along with continued successful efforts to create demand as demonstrated by the many achievements already realized to sustain the momentum, we confidently remain on track to deliver double-digit return on invested capital in 2018 and beyond.","With that, I'll turn the call to David.","David Bernstein","Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency, unless otherwise stated. I'll start today with a summary of our 2018 third quarter results then I'll provide an update on our full year 2018 guidance and finish up with some insights on booking trends and a few other items to consider for 2019.","As Arnold indicated, our record adjusted EPS for the third quarter was $2.36. This was $0.09 above the midpoint of our June guidance. The improvement was primarily driven by two things, $0.06 from increased net ticket yields, which benefited from stronger pricing on closing bookings on both sides of the Atlantic and $0.03 from lower net cruise cost excluding fuel due to the timing of costs between the quarters.","Now let's look at our third quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 1.7%. Our North America and Australia segments were commonly known as our NAA brands were up approximately 3%, while our Europe and Asia segment, more commonly known as our EA brands were down about 1%, driven by two ship sales earlier in the year. Our total net revenue yields were up 2.9%.","Now let's break apart the two components of net revenue yield. Net ticket yields were up 2.2%. This was driven by a number of factors. First an increase in our NAA brands in Alaska on like for like itineraries which had higher yields than last year's record levels. Second, increases in yields for our NAA itineraries in Europe. And third, increases in yields for our EA brands in Europe and China. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in our NAA brands itineraries in the Caribbean as included in our previous guidance due to last fall's weather impact.","Net onboard and other yields increased 5.1% with increases on both sides of the Atlantic. In summary, our third-quarter adjusted EPS was $0.07 higher than last year with solid 2.9% revenue yield improvement worth $0.18 and the $0.06 accretive impact of the stock repurchase program both being partially offset by higher net cruise cost excluding fuel which cost $0.08 as well as the unfavorable impact from changes in fuel price and FX rates costing another $0.08.","Next I want to provide you with an update on our full year 2018 guidance. As Arnold said, our full-year September guidance is now in the range of $4.21 to $4.25. We continue to have strong operational performance. The $0.03 improvement in the midpoint of our September guidance was essentially driven by three things.","First, we flow through each sense of operational benefit from higher revenues, $0.06 occurred in the third quarter with an additional $0.02 from further improvements we are now forecasting for the fourth quarter. Second, we benefit from $0.02 accretion relating to the shares repurchased since the start of the third quarter. And third, higher fuel prices, net of fuel derivatives and the stronger dollar is expected to unfavorably impact the year by $0.06 in total for $0.03 each.","While our guidance for net cruise costs without fuel per ALBD did increase from 1% to 1.5%. This was offset by favorability and depreciation and amortization. Most of the variances in both of these line items relate to the accounting treatment for ship sales during the quarter.","Turning to 2019 booking trends. Since June, booking volumes for the first half of 2019 have been running significantly ahead of last year's pace, at prices that are lower than the prior year. Pricing was up in all of the major programs, but more than offset by lower prices in the Caribbean, which represents almost 40% of our capacity for the period as we are comping to pre-2017 weather impact.","If we isolate the first half of September which was impacted by the weather last year, booking volumes for the first half of 2019 have been running significantly ahead of last year's pace well into the double-digit at prices that are higher than the prior year. At this point in time, cumulative advance bookings for the first half of 2019 are ahead of the prior year at prices that are in line.","Now let's drill down into the cumulative booked positions for the first half of 2019. First, for our NAA brand, the Caribbean program is ahead of the prior year on occupancy at lower prices. For all other deployments, occupancy is ahead of the prior year at higher prices. Second, for our EA brand, the Caribbean program is ahead of the prior year on occupancy at lower prices, while the European itineraries occupancy is ahead at prices that are in line.","And finally, a few other items to consider for 2019, we are forecasting the capacity increase of 4.7%. For those of you who are modeling 2019 using September guidance fuel price and FX rates, the impact of higher fuel prices and the stronger dollar will unfavorably impact 2019 by about $0.27 per share. Higher fuel prices net of fuel derivatives would cost $0.15, while currency is an unfavorable $0.12.","Given the timing of the calculation substantially all of the unfavorable fuel price and FX impact is evenly split between the first and second quarter, while it is early, with many decisions yet to be made, our expectation for 2019 is that net cruise costs without fuel per ALBD will increase slightly in constant currency. However, we do expect that the net cruise cost increase in the first and second quarter will be higher than the full year increase. We currently expect depreciation to be about 2.24 billion for 2019 versus 2.02 billion for 2018.","Booking trends for next year have been strong and are strengthening, driven by yield management decisions which we believe will optimize net revenue yield growth. Based on current booking trends, we expect solid net revenue yield growth in 2019 with the first half expected to be up somewhat less than the net revenue yield guidance for the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily due to very strong prior year comparison. For the full year, we believe we are well positioned for continued earnings growth in 2019 weighted to the second half of the year, due to the fuel and currency impact in the first half.","And now, I'll turn the call back over to Arnold.","Arnold Donald","Thank you, David. Operator, please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will get to our first question on the line from the line of Steve Wieczynski from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Steve Wieczynski","A couple of questions here with you. So, I guess somewhat confusing part of your commentary is around the booking since the first half of September, which you mentioned are both upon on pricing load versus what you have seen since June, and I know you talked about that mostly related to the Caribbean and the easy comparisons there because of the hurricane activity. So I guess the question is, when you look at 2019 and I think David helped us here a little bit, but was there any way to get a -- give us a little bit better picture of what maybe the rest of the world kind of looks like and maybe a little more detail versus what David said, kind of excluding the Caribbean? What I'm getting here is trying to get a clear picture of like-for-like markets, if that makes sense?","Arnold Donald","Yes, I'll do that and I think I'll just take the opportunity now to do a broader comment on bookings and yield. We do achieve a premium on new ships, but you guys have to remember we have nine brands serving differentiated markets. And there is a range of yields across the brands which also influence overall yields, especially in booking periods. So while you get a yield benefit within a brand that doesn't necessarily translate into a mix benefit to overall yields. So to give you an example for brand that is below the corporate averaging yield brings on a new ship and that new ship has a premium, but the premium is still below the corporate fleet average.","The brand does better on yield, but overall corporate yields are negatively impacted. While we're making more earnings because essentially even if average yields are held back by mix, we still are growing earnings. Now of course, and we create demand to drive yield across every ship and all the brands and we are receiving an earnings benefit as new ships are more efficient. So, we focus more on returns and earnings than yield. And when looking at booking trends, there is a plethora of things you have to consider, when you look at yield, especially year-to-year comparisons.","So demand, other than demand including relative capacity changes among the brands like I just talked about. Itinerary changes both destination and duration, management of the booking curve, each brand optimizing its own booking curve, timing of charters, mix of value packages which impact on board ticket price which is in bookings -- ticket prices of bookings versus onboard yield, which comes later when guests are onboard. And just to give you a little flavor I'll let David comment on the rest of world, because I know people are concerned for some reason around capacity, but Western Caribbean has the highest capacity increase in the Caribbean for us, but collectively across our brands is up.","Carnival is the only brand maybe in the industry that is year round in the Caribbean with capacity year round. And Carnival has increase in capacity next year and is up on occupancy and on yields in the Caribbean. And so when you look at a yield for us, it\u2019s a composite of a lot of different moving parts, and in the end, we are focused obviously on driving earnings ultimately and the fact is, with capacity, we are less reliant on absolute yield movement. But obviously, we are still going to focus on growing yields.","So with that, David, go ahead and talk a little bit about the rest of the world.","David Bernstein","I did in my prepared remarks I mean I was very clear in terms of all the major programs were up in terms of pricing for the quarter in terms of booking trends, except the Caribbean. Now, one is the things that I want to make sure everybody understands is the booking period we\u2019re talking about is the first, bookings for the first half of 2019. So during that period, we're almost 40% in the Caribbean. And if you go back to what we were talking about in June, we said bookings volumes prices were in line and now yes, we did say booking volumes prices were down.","But back in June, we were talking about the back half of 2018, we had the Caribbean only represented like 26% or 27% of the total in the back half of '18; and as the Caribbean represents a bigger percentage, you just see the weighted-average. Now, we have now lapped the booking issues in the Caribbean, the weather impact, and we talked about having September the booking prices on the booking volumes were higher. And so, the comparisons are different last year was weather impacted. And so we're in a much better position as we move forward.","When you look at the full year 2019, there's a lot of positive there, I mean you look at the European program for the full year. And we booked ahead of the prior year on occupancy at higher prices and the same thing is true for Alaska, and these are markets where, when you look at the capacity increase our 4% capacity increase or 4.7% next year, we do have quite a bit of capacity increase in both Europe and Alaska, and we're seeing great booking trends, we're ahead at higher prices. So, we're very confident and that's what gave us the conclusion, as I said in my notes that we expect solid revenue yield improvement in 2019.","Steve Wieczynski","Okay got you, that\u2019s a lot of good color thanks guys. And one more quick question, I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re going to answer it but, David you talked about, I think in your commentary you talked about how when you look at kind of the full year next year for '19. I can't remember the exact adjective you used, but some are long of healthy yield growth, and you talk about the first half being a little bit weaker relative to last year back half of the year being very strong. So I guess when we sit back and 12 months from now, is it still possible that you can -- you'll be able to grow the full year of yields in a similar position to what you could do or what you're going to do this year?","Arnold Donald","We\u2019re certainly going to work very hard to do just that and every brand is focused on that. And that\u2019s clearly what we\u2019re working on. At this point, we\u2019re not giving guidance for next year or anything but we know you guys have just trying to give you some directional insight. David.","David Bernstein","So, one of the things that we're talking about for the first half of next year is, the fact that we had very, very strong comparisons from prior year comparisons. You know in the first quarter of 2018, we achieved net revenue yield growth of nearly 4%. The Caribbean was nearly half of our deployment in the first quarter, and since it was so well booked last year in the fall when, it had very minimal impact from the weather disruptions. So we did have nicely higher yields and that's a headwind in the comparison in the first quarter of 2019. So, we are expecting sequential yield improvement in the Caribbean in the fourth quarter and again in the first quarter, and that's with significant capacity increases in both quarters in the Caribbean.","And when you look at the second quarter, we achieved net revenue yields that were nearly up 5% and that was with a challenging Caribbean and that was more than offset by yield growth of 8% in all other programs. So the first half of 2018 was a great yield improvement for us and with those challenging comparisons and not lapping the Caribbean booking impact until the second quarter, we gave you our best guess for the first half of the year. But as I said, we do expect solid GAAP net revenue yield improvements in 2019 and will give you more color on that in December.","Operator","Thank you very much. We'll get to our next question on the line from the line of David Beckel with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.","David Beckel","So, it sounds like much of the concern around pricing is focused on the Caribbean still, but would it be fair to say since the last quarter that the conditions in the Caribbean in terms of demand and pricing are at least as good or better than they were last quarter? In other words, are things improving?","David Bernstein","Yes, I think we keep saying that overall the yields we're achieving each quarter are improving, we see a sequential improving trend in yields and we see a sequential improving trends in the bookings it's just that, given the timing of the event and the way we will book from a booking perspective, we don't lap last year's comparisons as I said until September and from an actual yield perspective we're not going to see a lapping until the second quarter.","Arnold Donald","And then as I mentioned a lot of other variables involved in terms of mix of brands et cetera, when you talk about a region like the Caribbean, and so we see lots of evidence of strength and we don\u2019t typically give brand by brand guidance or anything or even information. But I've already mentioned for example the Carnival brand which is the largest brand we have in the Caribbean has higher capacity for next season, is up in occupancy and up in yield already.","And in the Western Caribbean, it is high capacity increase but up in yields. So, the Caribbean is strong and we've had record years there Carnival continues to outperform. We have a lot of other dynamics that are going they are making average yield number look a certain way as I tried to articulate earlier, but overall the Caribbean is strong. We do have some difficult comparisons, but we're growing our earnings there and we will continue to grow.","David Beckel","And as a quick follow-up to that you did make a great point about mix and non-comparable factors. If you were to strip some of the most obvious mix and brand and itinerary factors out, how would the position of the Caribbean look for first half? You've already commented on Carnival obviously.","Beth Roberts","I would just say in the last three months, we are booking more Caribbean because it's a bigger part of the base in the first half, and we are expecting sequential improvement in yield in the Caribbean at the end of the day. So, what you are seeing in that last three months is a greater concentration of Caribbean business booked.","Operator","And we will proceed to our next question on the line from the line of Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Jared Shojaian","So I want to go back to that first half '19 yield guidance. Your book position right now, you are ahead at prices that are in line, I mean I would think that should get better as time goes on if the guidance is implying about 2% or less than 2% you are planning for the fourth quarter. So can you just help me understand sort of the puts and takes there versus -- are you sort of guiding to what you have on the books right now and not really assuming that you get any sort of benefit from pricing starting to improve just with easier comparisons? Or how are you really thinking about that?","David Bernstein","So basically, when you look at the first half of the year, given the historical ranges of where we are at -- and for the first quarter at this point we have always said 50% to 70% is booked and for the second quarter 30% to 50%. So what's on the books we said, it was the higher end of those ranges. So we are over half booked for the first half of the year, and that half is essentially as we said is with prices in line.","So what we are looking at is, as we move forward to get to the yield improvement that we are guiding is the expectation that the bookings that will be coming in will be better than the prior year and we will get to a point that where, like we said something less than the fourth quarter revenue yield. There is also the onboard that\u2019s part of the factor and remember, we manage the business not for one line item but manage the business to optimize the total net revenue yield between both passengers and onboard. And so, that\u2019s part of the factor as that goes into the whole guidance.","Jared Shojaian","Can you just talk about some of the differences you're seeing right now with your bookings and pricing for North American sourcing versus foreign sourcing? I mean it seems like the U.S. consumer is really strong right now. Are you seeing better trends from North American sourcing versus foreign sourcing right now? Or is it fairly similar?","David Bernstein","We are seeing good strong bookings on both side of the Atlantic in terms of sourcing. I gave the comment in terms of the various markets in terms of where we book today. On both sides we see similar trends in the Caribbean but good solid strength in all of the other itineraries around the globe for around for all of our brands in both segments.","Jared Shojaian","One last just quick clarification for me, it sounds like you guys are expecting second half '19 yields to be better on a year-over-year basis than the first half. Is that correct?","David Bernstein","Yes, we did not say that. We just said solid net revenue yield growth for the year and we will give you more detail on the full year in December. We're very little booked at this point.","Operator","And we will go to our next question on the line from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar Research. Go ahead.","Jaime Katz","I'm curious if you have any commentary on China, there was a little spoken too and given than one of your competitors is exiting the market. I'm curious, if there are any trend changes that you have seen in recent periods?","Arnold Donald","I would say that first of all just keep in mind China is a small percent of the total. So, we always start with that. Clearly with less capacity in China going forward it creates an easier environment to operate in. We are going to have as I mentioned Costa Benicia, which is going to be Costa's first purpose built ship for China. So as we look ahead to next year, we have less capacity in the first half of the year, more capacity in the second half of the year. But China continues to be accretive for us. We continue with the same policy we had all along that as long as overall is accretive, we will have ships there if they are not accretive we move them out and right now is still relatively small part of our total. But it\u2019s doing well because it is accretive.","David Bernstein","And I think it\u2019s fair to say in the last both in my prepared remarks this quarter and last quarter, I noted that part of the net ticket yield increase was due to increase in China. So, we have seen some favorable trends in the last two quarters, and as a result of all the things, we've been doing with the travel distributors and all the changes we've been making in China. So, we feel very good about the market and its direction.","Jaime Katz","And then, can you elaborate a little bit about some fleet changes that you guys are making, you're obviously moving back into Long Beach next year with your Carnival ship and Galveston you\u2019re revisiting with a ship that was not there. Is there still, do you guys still feel like there is a significant opportunity set to penetrate more U.S. markets that have maybe been underserved to support the demand for the oncoming capacity increases?","Arnold Donald","Clearly, one of the strengths of the Carnival brand and in our, the other U.S. based brands is being able to access more the market as a drive market. And so that\u2019s been an ongoing approach for the brand that is proven successful, believe we're up to almost 18 different U.S. points for Carnival where they see all up in U.S. And so we continue to look for effective itineraries that guests want to go on but giving them easier access to get to the ships and it's an ongoing part about what strategy for Carnival and to some extent for our North American brands.","David Bernstein","And it's not unusual to see us move larger ships into market as the market develops and to also give people an opportunity to go on a different ship, so it\u2019s a normal part of the overall strategy that we've engaged in over time.","Jaime Katz","And then the housekeeping note the 4.7% capacity growth next year is with the four ships coming out, correct?","David Bernstein","Correct.","Operator","And we will get to our next question on the line from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Go ahead.","Robin Farley","Just going back to your yield guidance for next year, and I think you guys have very consistently delivered yield growth like 100 to 150 basis points ahead of what your initial guidance is this year and sort of in the last two or three years. So fully appreciating the conservatism and all of that, just when we think about the comments, it sounds like September not surprisingly right things booked since then showing higher price and higher volume given the comp, and I know you are not giving guidance for the second half of next year, but maybe you can tell us how much of Q2 would typically, in other words from September forward, how much of Q2, would typically be booked?","In other words if Q1 is mostly booked before the September less opportunity for the kind of what would be your yield growth in kind of the post hurricane with the benefit of the comps in it, not in Q1, but in Q2 will most of that be booked from September forward? And then the other thing I think that Arnold did say something like full-year growth would be weighted to the second half of the year, and just based on what you've said, isn't it reasonable to think that your second half year growth would be higher than the 2.5% rate that you are kind of seeing might be the top of your initial guidance, at least, simply because both you have less credit exposure again in the second half and then just also because most of that would be booked in this sort of easier comps that started two weeks ago?","Arnold Donald","Robin, good morning to you, first of all my comments were on earnings much more so than yields in terms of the second half next year that's because a lot of the fuel and currency impact that we are currently seeing, is occurring in the first half of the year, that's part of it also because we tend from a spending standpoint to spend money in advance of the season of doing wave et cetera. And so, our cost would be more weighted in the first half of the year than the back half. So, it was that comment.","But real quick before David comments, just a couple of quick things, the Caribbean has been very good and is strengthening further, and I hear feel the tone that people think there is a big challenge or yield risk in the Caribbean et cetera. And the reality is, we have had multiple periods where we've been ahead on occupancy and lower on pricing, and I remember couple of years ago when people were concerned about that, and we turned out just fine, because a lot of this is also managing the booking curve is yield management. So, it's when you time and some of the other things I've mentioned, when you have charters, what your mix is of guests in terms of people who have a higher propensity to stay on board and you attract the most people on.","All those things impact as well as for us our mix if we have a lot of ships coming in from brands that are lower yield overall than say Carnival brand for example our fleet average that will give us a weighted yield picture even though we are growing earnings. And over time that's what tends to wash out and correct itself you get on board revenues will contribute to yield et cetera. So, we don\u2019t want to create any image that there is a struggle in the Caribbean because there isn't, but we have record growth we're building on strength there is details in comparisons. But then they were really focused on growing our earnings even with our yield management things that we do, and we've been delivering and we intend to deliver. So go ahead, David.","David Bernstein","So I think I alluded to before in terms of the bookings, the first quarter historically at this time 50% to 70%, and the second quarter 30% to 50%. And we've said before, we're at the high end of the historical range, so we just use the exact number for illustrating purposes there is still 30% left to go on the first quarter and 50% left to go on the second quarter. So, clearly, while they are both in line for the first half is more opportunity in the second, but as we have always said before Robin, we give you our best guess on what we think will happen. The ticket is three quarters at the total and there is also onboard, and there really isn't advanced bookings on that. So, we are giving you our best guess for the first half of the year at this point.","Robin Farley","And my turn by the way that I wasn\u2019t suggesting a concern about the Caribbean and I was more suggesting that you have been really conservative. But it's certainly\u2026","Arnold Donald","I actually wasn\u2019t speaking about you Robin, thank you.","Robin Farley","So just bottom line is the majority of second half bookings will take place in this period of where this post September volume up double digits and pricing higher\u2026","Arnold Donald","Yes.","David Bernstein","Absolutely.","Arnold Donald","Yes, absolutely.","Robin Farley","So, it seems reasonable to think that second half growth which you are not saying that I'm just throwing out there. Okay, thank you.","Arnold Donald","Thank you, Robin.","Operator","And we will go to our next question on the line from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Felicia Hendrix","You guys have given us a lot of color which I think is very helpful and particularly emphasizing the point that there is nothing wrong in the Caribbean, so thank you for that. David just to reiterate this, when you gave market and segment color earlier in the call and you talked about in the first half the NAA brand, the Caribbean ahead on occupancy at lower prices and the same for the EA, that\u2019s simply a function of kind of what you have already been talking about in the release right, but since June booking volumes for the first half have been running significantly. I mean that\u2019s not really reflective of the improvement that you have been seeing in September, correct?","David Bernstein","Yes, correct, it's reflective of the fact that the prior year comparison was not weather impacted and so that reflects in the comparison.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay great, super clear, and then Arnold when you talked about the Western Caribbean and how you are seeing an increase in occupancy and yield despite the significant increase in capacity. Was that just -- could you clarify was that for the full year? Or was that for just the first half?","Arnold Donald","It's probably for both. This for both Felicia","Beth Roberts","Business we have on the books for the full year is the first half.","Arnold Donald","Yes, exactly.","Felicia Hendrix","But to your point was just that look people are concerned about increases in capacity in the Caribbean and particularly in the Western Caribbean and which is not seeing there?","Arnold Donald","Yes, we have near double digit increase in capacity in the Western Caribbean and we're up on occupancy and overall yields.","Felicia Hendrix","And then just final, the language in the release talking about yields for the first half of '19 and how they are going to be lower than fourth quarter guidance. You guys have provided a range of 1.5% to 2.5%. I think the investment community tends to hone into the midpoint of ranges when company has given. So, is that a fair bogey like were you thinking about the midpoint when you gave that comment or the high end or the low end just to give us some parameters?","David Bernstein","It's fair to say that all three numbers -- if I was giving guidance so I had to pick this specific guidance whether it would be a range or a midpoint that the guidance I would give today would be less than the guidance in the fourth quarter. We are not giving an exact guidance because it\u2019s early. We just trying to directionally and to answer your question it would less than 2% midpoint would be the midpoint of the guidance we would give. But it\u2019s too early to give an exact number at this point.","Arnold Donald","Felicia, again, I just want to emphasize that, a lot of things are driving and including capacity relative proportions of capacity from different brands. So while the yield is whatever it is we are constantly focused on growing earnings and so there are brands that are below the average for the fleet that have significant capacity increase and are achieving an improvement in yield for that brand, but because it's weighted and especially gets a destination market like the Caribbean it can pull down the overall average. But we\u2019re still actually earning more dollars, so that\u2019s one of many variables.","Felicia Hendrix","Yes, and well appreciated and just all of us, who've been looking at cruise for a 1 million years or even not, we\u2019re all unfortunately focused on yield so.","Arnold Donald","Right.","Felicia Hendrix","But yes, no mix, I think everybody kind get the mix issues especially since one of your competitors has spelled that out pretty clearly over the past year or so. Okay and then so, not to get cute David, but when you say lower than the fourth quarter guidance, are we talking about significantly lower or just kind of lower?","David Bernstein","We will give you more color on that in December, it's about to verify, and we still have a lot of work to do. And that's our best guess.","Operator","Thank you very much. I will get to our next question on the line from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Tim Conder","Thank you. Couple of questions on the June to August, the booking commentary. How much of that was maybe impacted by base loading as you look into the early part of next year? And then obviously for the Caribbean and that potentially impacted the overall booking curve, now you\u2019re saying the booking curve continues to expand. If we didn't have the Caribbean issue or we tended a maximum point of the booking curve to whereby see this further expanded obviously always a trade-off of pricing and expanding the booking curve. Do you view yourself and maybe the industry finally at that point where, \"Hey, we're going to restrain this back because we feel we\u2019re certainly give up too much in pricing upside\"?","Arnold Donald","We\u2019re always in pursuit of that optimized booking curve that maximizes, obviously, the earnings and it varies by destination, by brand, by source market I mean like there's a zillion variables there. And so, we're not in absolute kind of singularly focused pursuit of moving the booking curve further out that's not how we think about it all with Yoda and the collaboration of our yield price management experts. We are really just trying to optimize each one and frankly each itinerary for each ship and it comes out the way it comes out based on all the variables there.","David Bernstein","And you characterize the base loading, I really characterize more the way Arnold is describing it is we're making good decisions to optimize the revenue when the ship sail and we try to capture bookings and pricing along the way to optimize the end game. And so that's really the goal and the goal isn't anything other than maximum revenue yield.","Tim Conder","I guess [John] another way maybe to ask again we've seen the booking curve for the industry and everyone sort of linked now to last few years. If you have to fall down on one side of the fence is that would you expect that the further length and let\u2019s take it to an industry perspective or would you think the industry is more in the point of potentially trying to harvest some more price?","Arnold Donald","I think that the more we create demand the more likely it is for the booking curve to inch further out and just get even better yields along the booking curves than you would have before, so I think that's more the answer the better we are at creating demand the more likely you would see it kind of inch out a bit. There is obviously some theoretical limits to that and there is somewhat our job is so that we're approaching that now, but we are really just trying to optimize along the booking curve to maximize earnings.","David Bernstein","And then you know there are also one-off things that occur overtime like the Iona, the P&O Cruise's new ship it just started booking and it's been booking like crazy and it doesn\u2019t get delivered until 2020, and that's included, so all of this it's just there's a lot of variables and we're trying to make good decisions to optimize the revenue yield overtime. And we got different itinerary lengths and everything which are affecting all of this, and we are just trying to give you the big picture as it rolls up. But we make decisions at a very micro-level, cruise-by-cruise, cabin category by cabin category to maximize the yield. This isn't an overriding goal one way or the other if the decisions are made in a micro level.","Tim Conder","Okay, and lastly gentlemen thank you I appreciate that. Australia and asking that from the perspective of that market has been great for the industry for a while and then China is improving, yet we see the industry maybe shifting some seasonal capacity to Australia in the last year plus here how is your China sourcing as a percentage of global sourcing relative to your capacity in China and I guess again folding that in with the Australia piece how that's looking?","Arnold Donald","Well, on the China portion, in terms of if you leave the domestic sailing volume, you mean like fly\/cruise sourcing to China. It is growing, but it's still a relatively small percent obviously of the total number of almost to 13 plus million guests, we have a year so relatively small number, but it's definitely growing and over time given the size of the market and the fact it is the largest outbound travel country in the world that we expect that to increase overtime, and we have seen it increase. You mentioned Australia, obviously, we've seen the increase in Chinese guests going to Australia and getting on ships, but we've also seen in Alaska and other places too.","So that will be that comment, Australia overall continues to be a very strong market for the industry and certainly for us and we have good performance there with our P&O brand, but also our other brands that are there we made a commitment up in Brisbane which we announced in terms of cruise terminal expansion, again kind of reflecting the growth potential in Australia in a way to sustain that. So it's been a good market and we expect it to continue to be.","But overtime China fly\/cruise is going to be significant middle delta but also the domestic market is going to be significant over time. And we are still very proud of our relationship with CSSC as we move towards ultimately putting our joint venture into the market and sailing ships and as we look at taking all capacity that we've already announced on the 2023 and beyond through that joint venture to help China build within their five year plan, which is a sustainable long-term cruise market that ultimately could be as large as the global market is today.","David Bernstein","And you know for Australia, last year, we talked about the strategic realignment of P&O Australia, and we have sold some ships, so the capacity will be going down in '19 for us in Australia, but we have announced the addition of ships in 2020 and 2021 to the P&O Australia brand. It is a great market for us and we are seeing a lot of fly\/cruise business for many of our brands out of Australia all over the globe to Alaska to Europe and other places as well. It\u2019s a great fly\/cruise market for us.","Operator","And we will go to our next question on the line from the line of Assia Georgieva with Infinity Research. Please go ahead.","Assia Georgieva","I wanted to -- I don\u2019t think anyone mentioned that but I was very happy with the numbers. Could I just go back again to the Q1, Q2 question, so in Q1 last year we still haven\u2019t really felt the impact of new bookings affected post the hurricanes. So Q2 will be more of a beneficiary from those easing comps. In addition in Q1, we seem to have quite a bit of capacity last year. So, is it fair to say that there is still lot of room for improvement especially for Q2? We are not going to see down or flat yields in Q1. And again possibly see with sequential strength as you mentioned strong in the strengthening upside to your current Q1 expectations still?","David Bernstein","So, I don\u2019t want to repeat what I already said, I mean we gave you our best guess for the first half and we gave you directional guidance and we work very hard to do our best and to optimize and there is as I said before a lot of bookings yet to come on the first and second quarter, and we will do our best to optimize that and produce some great results for the Company.","Assia Georgieva","David, I have to try. And a quick housekeeping question, could we get the capacity figures for Q1 and Q2 given that we have Carnival Horizon coming in and Seabourn Ovation, et cetera?","Beth Roberts","The capacity in Q1 is up 4.7 and the capacity in Q2 is up 4.7, Q3 is 5.8, Q4 is 3.7, which gets you back to 4.7 for the year.","Arnold Donald","And operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Certainly, we will proceed with our final question for the day with the line from Jamie Rollo with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Jamie Rollo","Great, thanks for taking my question. I think you said sequential yields getting better in the comp, helpful if you could give us some numbers or some direction about that sort of by quarter this year so we continue to see the cadence. And if I can just add on to that, I think Arnold you said, you're talking about driving earnings growth less through yield growth and from your recent orders have been much bigger for Carnival and Princess, and you\u2019re selling perhaps more ships than usual. So can you that sort of earnings versus yield trade off and whether that means which is sort of expect to sort of level pace of yield growth going forward?","Arnold Donald","I will take the second part first, earnings versus yield, and so, again I will repeat a little bit. The bottom line is we\u2019re absolutely focused on earnings and to get there you have to have yield, for sure. But because we have nine brands and we have a mix, we can improve a brand as I mentioned in yield but bring down the corporate average in the process if that brand evolves below the fleet average and doing so we\u2019re still growing earnings. And so we\u2019re clearly focused on earnings and obviously.","And I know you guys strategically have to follow yield because you can\u2019t follow the rest, but even with the yield is a huge mix for us and so that\u2019s part of it. We\u2019re looking at bookings in particular then you have all those other variables I mentioned because of mix between ticket versus onboard and our onboard won't show up until people actually sail, you know they have charters you have all these different things that that can affect what our yields look like during a booking period along with the mix.","And you have the actual, yield management strategy itself for pricing considerations. So all of that comes into play but overall, we are absolutely focused on earnings, we have been strong and yield and are strengthening in terms of our yield management booking trends for next year have been strong and are strengthening and those would be the summary thing to say and we weren't trying to give guidance for the first half. We were just again just giving you guys some directional input with the color around why things might look the way they do. Go ahead, David.","David Bernstein","And on the Caribbean we don't give detail percentages ever by brand by market for competitive reasons, but we have said that the second and third quarter Caribbean yields were down and for the fourth quarter, we don't expect them be down as much and we said that we expect sequential improvement in the first quarter. So we are seeing an improving trend overall on a year-over-year basis is as we move through the weather impact from the prior year.","Jamie Rollo","So it's fair to say that the Caribbean price, simply looking at it by months is above where it was two years ago looking at that way?","David Bernstein","I have, I actually don\u2019t have all that detail. I have to actually look at the two years ago to answer that question, but you can get back to Paul.","Arnold Donald","Bu it's certainly looking better than same period last year.","Arnold Donald","Hey, everyone, thank you so much. We really appreciate it. And we look forward to continue to deliver and we look forward to our next call. Thank you."],"4229":["Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) F1Q2014 Results Earnings Conference Call March 25, 2014 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Arnold Donald - Chief Executive Officer","Micky Arison - Chairman","David Bernstein - Chief Financial Officer","Beth Roberts - Vice President, Investor Relations","Analysts","Robin Farley - UBS","Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays","James Hardiman - Longbow Research","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo","Ian Rennardson - Jefferies","Jamie Rollo - Morgan Stanley","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust","Brian Dobson - Nomura","Wyn Ellis - Numis","Edward Stanford - Lazarus Partnership","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Carnival Corporation\u2019s First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, March 25, 2014. I now have the pleasure to turn the conference over to Arnold Donald. Please go ahead.","Arnold Donald","Hi. Good morning, everyone. This is Arnold, and with me today is Micky Arison, our Chairman; David Bernstein, our CFO; and Beth Roberts, our Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you all for joining us. I\u2019ll have a brief prepared statement to share and then, David, will follow me with some comments and then, I\u2019ll be back on to start question-and-answer session.","So, first of all, I\u2019m very pleased to be able to share the better than expected performance in the first quarter and I find it affirming and consistent with the guidance that we have given for a year.","We have demonstrated progress in areas of challenge for our Carnival and our Costa brands and is very gratifying to see the initiatives that the Carnival brand has implemented begun to payoff.","In fact, brand perception is most of the way back, consideration among brand loyalist have previously recovered and now the new to cruise is back, and we are working to complete perception recovery among switchers.","Interest is up dramatically and our Carnival brand is evidence by strong web activity and of course, by previously announced record booking volumes in the quarter at Carnival Cruise Lines.","Going forward, we are cautiously optimistic, we will see pricing continue to firm and improve. We are confident in our Carnival brand team and have been impressed with the measures taken in marketing and distribution in overall innovation. Our product continues to get even better and what is truly, the best vacation value at sea for that targeted guest segment is now even better.","Costa also continues on this role to financial improvement. Costa achieved strong booking volumes during wave season and in fact, we were almost up 50% year-over-year. We have seen a continued improvement in perception within almost doubling of trust and confidence in the core Italian market.","We are very pleased with the recovery and yields achieved in Costa\u2019s core European deployment in the first quarter, as well as improved profitability through collaboration across the Continental European brands.","Across the Corporation, attractive pricing for our guests during wave season has driven the desired result. Our North American brands have caught up on occupancy compared to prior year, while European brands have pushed out the booking curve tracking ahead on occupancy. These trends build confidence that we are tracking to turn the corner beginning in the second half of 2014.","We remain focused on increasing demand on all fronts, increasing advocacy by delivering an even better customer experience, stepping up our public relations effort by raising our profile and relationship building with the media, taking advantage of social media where much of the conversation takes place today and cultivating guests into proactive advocates.","We have increased our investment in advertising and expect to spend over $600 million in 2014, that\u2019s a 20% increase over 2012, and we have launched new marketing campaigns in multiple regions.","For example, in North America, the Carnival brand was the national cruise line for Sochi Winter Olympics with a new creative targeting the family segment, while Princess lines launched its first television campaign in 10 years.","In addition, both Costa in Europe and P&O in the U.K. launched new advertising campaigns. This increased investment and broad-based media buys supporting our efforts to attract the new to cruise, where we have the greatest opportunity to create additional demand.","We remain committed to leveraging our scale and we are making meaningful progress toward that end. We held a leadership forum among our top 70 employees globally and in earnest are beginning to align around common objectives to accelerate us down the path of continuous financial improvement. Our global team is truly energized to achieve that success.","We have identified opportunity areas to leverage our scale both from a cost efficiency standpoint as well as a revenue generating standpoint. Among our $6 billion of non-fuel, non-people costs, we are prioritizing areas where we believe we will find opportunity.","Crew travel and ports are two examples of large areas where we are conducting deeper dives. We are still at early stage in sizing the opportunities in these and other categories, and as we look across further brand collaboration, across brand collaboration on travel costs, for example, primarily for our 90,000 global crew members, as well as port costs for our more than 10 million guests and 100 plus ships.","We are encouraged with the progress we're making, but we obviously still have a lot of work to do. We are very excited about the road ahead. We are away from realizing our full true potential, but I'm very confident that we will get there over time.","And now, I would like to turn it over to David Bernstein for a few comments. David?","David Bernstein","Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this conference call will be forward-looking. I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release. Also, all of my references to revenue and cost metrics will be in local currency as this is a much more meaningful measure of our business trends.","I will start today with a summary of our first quarter results and then get into some more detail on the overall positive booking trends during the current wave season, as well as the booking patterns by deployment for each of our two segments, the North American brands and the European, Australia, and Asia brands, known as our EAA brands. I will finish up with an update on our full-year 2014 March guidance.","Our non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $2 million. I\u2019m pleased to report that our first quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.09 above the midpoint of our December guidance and this was driven by better than expected net revenue yields at Carnival Cruise Lines and our Continental European brands worth $0.05, as well as lower than expected net cruise costs without fuel worth $0.04.","Now turning to our first quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 1.7%. Our total net revenue yields declined just over 2%.","Let's look at the two components of total net revenue yields, net ticket yields and net onboard and other. First, net ticket yields, which declined 3%, with decreases on both sides of the Atlantic.","Our North American brands were down 3.5% and that was driven by promotional pricing at Carnival Cruise Lines, although I'm very glad to say that the pricing environment for last minute first quarter bookings was clearly better than we had expected.","Our EAA brands were down 2.5% with increases at Costa resulting from the continuing brand recovery, which were more than offset by declines in our other major European brands.","Net onboard and other yields increased 1%. Our EAA brand performed very well and were up over 4%, but this was tempered by slightly down yields at our North American brands, driven in part by lower occupancy at Carnival Cruise Lines.","Net cruise costs per available lower berth day excluding fuel was up 3.5% and that was driven by higher advertising spend as we invested to accelerate the recovery in ticket yields. The increase was less than we had expected in our December guidance and that was due to the timing of advertising and certain other expenses between the quarters ","In summary, the first quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.08 lower than the prior year, and that was driven by lower net revenue yields, higher net cruise costs without fuel, which was partially offset by improved fuel consumption and slightly lower fuel prices.","Turning to our recent booking trends and yield expectations for the remainder of 2014. As we indicated in the press release, fleet-wide booking volumes during this year's wave season have been running almost 20% ahead of the prior year, significantly outpacing capacity albeit at lower prices.","This pattern is the same for both our North American and EAA brand in all three quarters. It's nice to see that some of the largest booking volume increases were at Carnival Cruise Lines and Costa, as these brands continued their recovery.","As Arnold indicated, cumulative booking -- fleetwide bookings are ahead and they are at lower prices. This is the first time in a number of years we have indicated that cumulative bookings for the next three quarters were ahead of the prior year as our overall booking curve has started to lengthen. While we are pleased with the new direction and we expect it to continue, we\u2019re currently still towards the lower end of our historical booking curve.","Despite these booking trends, we continue to expect yields for the second quarter of 2014 to be down 3% to 4%. While our EAA brands are forecasted term positive, our North American brands are impacted by the more challenging comps in the second quarter of 2013 as the majority of those bookings were taken prior to the voyage disruptions that occurred in February of last year.","For the second half of 2014, with better cumulative booking status and ramped-up marketing efforts in the first half of the year which should benefit us in the second half, we are expecting positive yields for both our North American brands and our EAA brands.","For the full year, we are expecting net revenue yields to be down slightly, which is the same as our December guidance. While we exceeded our first quarter yield guidance mainly due to better-than-expected last minute Caribbean bookings at Carnival Cruise Lines, our expectations for the Caribbean for the balance of the year remains unchanged.","We are being prudent with our full-year expectation given the large cruise industry capacity increase in the Caribbean, as well as the slower than expected demand growth in Japan. As you know, Princess successfully ended the Japan homeporting market in 2013 with one ship for three months.","For 2014, Princess increased its capacity in Japan to two ships for about six months each. While demand in Japan has grown considerably, it has been somewhat less than anticipated. While we are experiencing some growing pains in Japan, we are still very bullish on the long-term prospects for this market. Today, Princess\u2019 Japan homeporting represents only about 1% of our annual capacity.","Looking at booking patterns by deployment for each of our two segments, first for our North American brands. I will walk you through the Caribbean, Alaska, and their seasonal European program. The Caribbean is behind on both price and occupancy and represents almost 50% of the remainder of the year for the North American brands. Recent booking volumes have been excellent and we are catching up on occupancy albeit at promotional rate.","Alaska is behind on price but well ahead on occupancy, which bodes very well for pricing on the remaining inventory. The seasonal European program for our North American brands is strong. We are well ahead on both price and occupancy.","For our EAA brands, the year-round European program, which represents 70% of the EAA brands capacity for the remainder of the year is behind on price but well ahead on occupancy. Recent booking volumes have been substantially ahead of last year which again bodes well for pricing on the remaining inventory.","Switching to costs, our full-year cost guidance also remains unchanged from December as we continue to expect net cruise costs excluding fuel, to be up only slightly. Putting all these factors together, our 2014 non-GAAP EPS guidance is $1.50 to a $1.70 per share with the midpoint that is the same as our December guidance.","Given our higher confidence level, we have simply narrowed the range reflecting our solid booking patterns with softness in Japan offsetting our better-than-expected first-quarter performance.","At this point, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Arnold.","Arnold Donald","Thank you, David. Kim, I think we're now ready to open it for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead.","Robin Farley - UBS","Thanks. I guess, I was going to ask you about your guidance coming $0.10 off the top and the bottom, and given the better close in Q1, I guess, it sounds like Japan is the reason why that and maybe a little bit of fuel off of the top? I guess, I\u2019ll ask when you look at your bookings for the remainder of the year being higher volume at lower prices, is that mostly due to Q2 because I\u2019m curious that comparisons get easier in Q3 as we get closer we would see higher prices and so you\u2019d hold back on some booking at lower prices year-over-year. I guess, if you could give us a sense as to that sort of higher volume, lower price, how that changes from Q2 into the second half?","David Bernstein","Sure.","Arnold Donald","Yeah. David, go ahead?","David Bernstein","Essentially for all three quarters, we are essentially at higher volumes and slightly lower prices, albeit there are different levels of increases and different amounts of lower prices between the quarters, but that's the overall trend at the moment. Keep in mind that while the booking volumes have been very good, we did expect to see booking volumes, good booking volumes in the first quarter.","When we -- in December on the conference call, we talked about being behind and we knew we had to catch up, and in order to catch up, you need good booking volumes. So this is pretty much in line with our expectations.","Robin Farley - UBS","Okay. And then just the other question is, can you quantify a little bit the lower occupancy in the Carnival brand, just a degree?","David Bernstein","As we\u2019ve been saying all along on a number of voyages, they are willing to give up a couple of points of occupancy to hold price. So we are seeing some, a couple of points down in the first quarter on Carnival Cruise Lines.","Robin Farley - UBS","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs","Hi. Good morning. Arnold, could you just discuss your cost saves, just talk about them more broadly and will you set a target either in dollars or percentage, and if you don't do that, why wouldn\u2019t you do that? And then David, I think you mentioned that the booking curves have extended and you mentioned something about that, but they were still at the lower end of where you'd like them to be. What is the lower end and what is higher end on the booking curves?","Arnold Donald","Okay. I\u2019ll start with your cost question first. Obviously, our greatest opportunity is on the revenue side. But the reality is we do spend as I mentioned over $6 billion, not counting fuel and not counting personnel, and not counting payroll. And largely that spend today is uncoordinated. There are portions of it that are to some degree across a few brands, one or two areas that are more broadly, but the majority of it is not coordinated, and that just is a natural result of having run the brands very independently and very successfully, very independently.","So any corporation can always be more efficient. And when you have that level of spend that historically has not been aggressively coordinated, by definition there is opportunity there. And so, I just mentioned the one area of airline and hotel for crew where we spend between that and ports, over $1.3 billion a year, and we haven\u2019t set an arbitrary target. We\u2019re doing it from the ground up and we\u2019re doing the work to see where the opportunities lie. But from a reasonableness test, which is a 1%, as reasonable savings, almost certainly right.","5% of $6 billion will be $300 million, 10% will be $600 million, exactly what the number turns out to be across that $6 billion base. We\u2019ll see as we go to these individual areas of opportunity and quantify them more rigorously and look at where the opportunities are. So that work has begun.","Once we've done that, we\u2019ll prioritize which ones we attack first. And overtime, we\u2019ll realize the latent opportunity that\u2019s there through collaboration, coordination, and communication across our 10 brands. Hope that answers your question, Steve. Go ahead, David.","David Bernstein","Yeah. Steve, historically, we had given some ranges out. For instance, we said in the current quarter we might be like 80% to 90% booked, one quarter out 50% to 70%, two quarters out 30% to 50%. And so I think, previously in the latter part of last year, I said we were at the lower end or slightly below the historical booking ranges. So now, we are a little bit better than we had previously been but still towards the lower end of the booking ranges.","Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thanks","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays","Hi. Good morning. I\u2019m wondering if you could just give us some color on the Carnival brand net yields, what they were in the first quarter and when do you think they get positive, and then similarly, Costa\u2019s net yields in the quarter?","Arnold Donald","Go ahead, Dave.","David Bernstein","","Sure. Overall, we had indicated that we expected to see Carnival down in the back half of last year and in the first half of this year in the mid-to-high single digits, and then we had talked about them turning positive in the back half of 2014 after we lapped the shipped incidents, the voyage disruptions. So in the first quarter, Carnival turned out to be a little bit better than we expected, which helped exceed the guidance, but we are still, I guess, are forecasting our guidance for the remaining quarters remains unchanged.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays","Okay. And on Costa?","Micky Arison","For Costa? Yeah, Costa was up a couple of points in the first quarter and part of that was due to occupancy. But they did get some pricing as Arnold indicated, particularly in their core European markets. Keep in mind that one of the things for the first quarter, Costa has less ships in South America, which while it's a very high-yielding market, it's not nearly as profitable. So we gave up something on the yield for Costa to improve the profitability overall because of the high cost of doing business in South America.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays","That makes sense. And then just on Carnival, I probably understand that the strategy that you have and trying to get the bookings levels up given the levels that you are in? But I\u2019m just wondering as you kind of look forward, do you only look for the consumer gets used to certain pricing or promotions on the brand? And specifically when you look past this year, do you envision the Carnival brand having more pricing power?","Arnold Donald","I think as we look down through the year, obviously the comparisons are going to get easier right off the bat because the second half of last year was post the voyage disruptions that occurred. And in terms of just the building momentum, the Caribbean had a lot of capacity expansion, 10% for Carnival and even more than over 19% for the industry. So there will probably be some continued pressure from that, but overall we do see significant strengthening in the Carnival.","David Bernstein","Yeah. But I don't worry about the consumer getting used to the lower prices. I mean, this has happened before we saw lower prices in 2009 and the prices came back up in \u201810 and \u201811. So as the economy improves and as the demand is there, we should be able to get the pricing back without any problem. This has happened a number of times in our history.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Maybe just little piggyback on Felicia\u2019s question, you talked about you saw a price dip in \u201909 and that came back in \u201911. Maybe you could talk a little bit about relative pricing compared to the competitive set -- Caribbean line I\u2019m talking about specifically here. It seems like last year, there was a bigger gap versus a lot of your competition. I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s worked its way back now, but how should I think about that going forward and have we gotten back to the historical gap versus the ships that Carnival would ultimate compete with?","David Bernstein","Are you talking specifically about Carnival Cruise Lines?","Arnold Donald","Cruise Lines.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research","Yeah, exactly.","David Bernstein","Yeah. It\u2019s very hard for us. There is no direct competitors. It\u2019s very hard for us -- the competitors like Royal Caribbean, its multiple brands in multiple markets. So whereas Carnival Cruise Lines focuses primarily on the Caribbean, so very hard to do a direct comparison the way you're describing.","Arnold Donald","It really is difficult. The brands are different. They cater to different psychographic segments. They have different comparisons for what ships were where in the previous year, et cetera and so you are often comparing apples and oranges. And so we tend to not look at it that way but we do look at how we are doing relative to how we\u2019ve done in the past and how we anticipate we should be doing given our deployments and what equipment we have where.","David Bernstein","I can give you a little color on us in total versus our competition that might be helpful, because if you go back, we lost about 10% to yield in 2009 and we got back in \u201810 and \u201811 about half of that. And we had hope to regain the second half in the following years \u201812 and \u201913. But unfortunately with the ship incidents today, we are about 11% behind 2008 yields.","In comparison, our competition with their 2014 guidance should be close to their 2008 yields. And hopefully as our brands recover, both Carnival Cruise Lines and Costa, we can recoup getting back to the 2008 yields as well. Hotel RevPARs are also back to those levels. We have every reason to believe we can get back there as well.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research","That\u2019s really helpful actually. And maybe, Arnold you talked about at the beginning of the call sort of those three major segments of cruisers, the Loyalist, the new to cruise, the Switchers, maybe expand on that a little bit? Is that brand consideration independent of the cheaper price that those people are receiving and ultimately is that sustainable as prices inevitably come up, maybe talk a little bit more about that?","Arnold Donald","Yeah. I think first of all, understanding the guest psychographics increasingly is clearly an immediate task that we have across the 10 brands. So, we continue to do deep dives and that is an area where we are collaborating across the brands and as opposed to doing 10 different segmentation studies. We will be able to do a much more rigorous market research effort at probably less cost frankly than doing 10 independent ones and get much better insight.","But generally speaking, sure, each segment has his own price elasticity curve. A Loyalist, now they make, take an extra cruise or two if pricing is lower. The Switchers might be more compelled to switch to a brand with a better price offerings and so on. And the new to cruise, that's where all the heavy-duty action has been across all the brands, ours and other cruise company brands is to get to new to cruise onboard. And that's always been more of a price sensitive market for the majority of psychographic targets, not so much to ultra-luxury but short of that has been somewhat prices.","So measuring that and that changes with time. Geopolitical influences it. Economy influences it. Just general mood influences it. So these are all conceptual things, but we are going from concept to rigor and modeling in our price models and our psychology of pricing through the work we have underway.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research","But basically it sounds like it\u2019s the Switchers that are the last of the three to sort of get back to where we were pre-last year?","David Bernstein","Yeah. And the comments I made was around brand perceptions. And so a Switcher by definition is probably going to be last because they have a brand they are with and you are trying to get them to switch. And so you need to have perhaps more cause, more rationale for them to switch from a brand they are all in to go to another brand. And so any kind of negative noise makes them more difficult obviously.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research","Very helpful.","Beth Roberts","Very small population.","Arnold Donald","And it is the smaller segment of the population. Beth just pointed out. That is in most cruisers or either new to cruise or they would fall into the category of Loyalist.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research","Good stuff. Thanks, guys.","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo","Thank you, and good morning. And two things. If you can just maybe give us a little bit of an update. On the last call, you mentioned that Carnival was a little bit of ahead of your period of recovery for the brand, and it sounds like the brand perception has continued along that vein. But if you frame that from the perspective of pricing, has much changed from your statement on the prior call that the Carnival brand is tracking a little quicker than what you expected and Costa still lagging, just an update there?","And then the second question would be related, looking at over the next couple years here, Arnold you continued to outline that there is a lot of cost savings opportunities, but you also in your preamble talked about elevated spending on advertising and marketing. How do you see those two netting out over the next several years for net cruise costs ex-fuel?","Arnold Donald","Yes. First of all, let\u2019s go to your pricing question, we feel and brand recover, we are very enthused by what we see in the Carnival brand in terms of the pace of recovery and in terms of how we shot up. Obviously, we had a better than expected first quarter with Carnival, and that\u2019s extremely encouraging and affirming to us. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, I\u2019m very proud of the Carnival brand team through their innovations and hard work they put in place to accelerate that brand recovery. So we are very encouraged on the Carnival brand. That will be the first comment.","In terms of more broadly looking down the road, we will continue to invest to build demand because that\u2019s what the industry needs and that\u2019s what we need. Our ships sail pretty much full, if not full, so do the competitor. And the issue is not about that, the issue is at what price. And so the greater demand, obviously the more we\u2019re able to capture the great value that we offer to guests and we do believe this is the greatest vacation value there is. And so obviously, we want to drive demand, and we will do that through promotion period. So that\u2019s advertising through social media, or whatever, and we will continue to invest in that.","Having said that, do I think those -- that investment in the future will offset any potential savings that we have across the large base of spend we have? No, I don\u2019t expect that. Will we reallocate some of those savings to additional promotional investment, if we see a return on those investments? Absolutely, yes. But the reality here is, I think there is more opportunity collectively over time to show improved overall cost performance, even given continued investment and promotional spend.","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo","Okay. So just to clarify, you\u2019re saying that the Carnival brand continues to track ahead of that expected recovery in the Costa brand, is it still -- is it picked up a little bit of that pace? I just want to make sure I am clear on the Costa side of the equation.","Arnold Donald","Yes. Costa has picked up as well. Costa had the double whammy of disruption and then obviously the European economy. And the European economy is still choppy, but it\u2019s obviously strengthened. And we do see accelerated progress in the Costa brand. And I\u2019ve given huge plaudits to our Carnival brand team, but our Costa team deserves huge plaudits well. And they have done a great job in managing the brand and all the dynamics around the brand recovery. So they obviously had a very different level incident than Carnival brand did. So they had a much more serious incident. They were in a much tougher economic environment. And so those -- both of those things weighing heavily to affect the pace of recovery, but they are doing well. Now, we\u2019re very confident and excited looking ahead for Costa as well.","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo","And I apologize, on the cost side just to clarify, are you saying that cost should be flat, down, or slightly up over the long term netting the savings on the incremental spending?","Arnold Donald","We haven\u2019t quantified the cost savings opportunities yet preciously, and I want to hold on that until I\u2019ve given the teams the opportunity to really drill down. We like giving you guys numbers that we have high degree of confidence in, and so we\u2019re going to do that the right way. Some of that will be revealed by the time we get to talk to you again. Some of it may be somewhat obvious. And as appropriate, we will lay out targets if we feel it\u2019s of any real value to all. But the bottom line is, we are still working all of that. Directionally, I certainly see overall opportunities for efficiencies on the cost side.","But again I want to point out, our opportunity is scale. We have 78 million passenger cruise days a year. We have 10 million guests a year. And on the revenue side, small moves on the revenue side produce substantial cash flow and operating earnings opportunity for us. And so we are going to do both, we are going to walk and chew gum, but the big opportunity is clearly on the revenue side.","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ian Rennardson with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ian Rennardson - Jefferies","Thank you. Good morning. A couple of questions. Slightly if you could help us a little bit with your yield guidance for Q2, because if I look last year\u2019s yield, it was down 1.9% in constant dollars in Q2 followed by minus 3.8% in Q3. Now you\u2019re looking for minus 3% to minus 4% in Q2, but then a relatively big positive in Q3. How big can that be in Q3, please?","And then the second question would be yields in Q1 ex-Costa, so if we strip Costa, big improvement in Costa, what was the yield for the rest of the company? Thank you.","Arnold Donald","David?","David Bernstein","Yes. Well, first of all, the guidance for the second quarter, part of that is impacted by the 19% capacity increase in the Caribbean that we\u2019re expecting and the promotional rates that are out in the market as a result of that. Each quarter has its unique set of circumstances. The third quarter, we had indicated or I should say the back half, I had indicated that yields would be positive in the back half. And of course, the third quarter will be impacted to some degree by Japan and so that taking into account. But all we said was positive in the third quarter and slightly down for the full year.","Ian Rennardson - Jefferies","Okay. Thank you. And the other one was\u2026","David Bernstein","And as far as Costa is concerned, I mean, I had indicated earlier in the call, Costa was up a couple of points in the first quarter. So Costa, remember, is 15% of our overall capacity and the yields in the first quarter were down 2.1%. So it probably would have been down slightly more than that without Costa, but you can do the math.","Ian Rennardson - Jefferies","Yes. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Rollo with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Jamie Rollo - Morgan Stanley","Yes, hi. Thanks. The balance sheet customer deposits at the end of the quarter would not much change year-on-year, despite you say a very significant booking volume increase in the wave period. And I am wondering, it could suggest your pricing on those volumes is very weak, but it may also suggest you\u2019re selling more through agents. I\u2019m just wondering as a mix direct, indirect or if we should be perhaps more worried on pricing given that year-on-year change? Thank you.","David Bernstein","Yeah. Well, there were so many factors, Jamie, that go into customer deposits on year-over-year basis. I mean, this pro-rated voyages they show excursions, there is charter deposits and a whole bunch of other things, including currency movements on a year-over-year basis. So it is very difficult for you to read in.","The other thing to keep in mind is that ticket prices are down on a year-over-year basis, so that does also affect the customer deposit and Carnival Cruise Lines, I think, also had a program with a lower deposit for a number of voyages which generated a lot of volume.","Now, typically, we don\u2019t see any difference in the overall cancellation experience with those lower deposits. So that was something that stimulates a lot of bookings as well. So there are a lot of factors that make it difficult for you to read into the trends in bookings versus customer deposits.","Jamie Rollo - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then, thanks, the other question was on the cost guidance. So for the second quarter, the guidance is quite high, given Q2 last year and [NCC\u2019s] (ph) were up 8% given all the Triumph cost. So, I think, if we strip out the litigation proceeds from the quarter the year before that\u2019s still about 6% Q2 last year and then, small, but that seems to be the timing you mentioned from the first quarter? And given your sort of your full year guidance for cost, you are expecting the second half looks to be roughly flat? And I'm just wondering whether -- what's causing that significant improvement and whether any of the savings you've mentioned to be built into your guidance? Thank you.","David Bernstein","","Yeah. I think the most significant thing that you have to think about is fourth quarter we do expect costs to be down and the reason is, if you remember last year in the fourth quarter, we had talked about Carnival Cruise Lines new advertising campaign and how we had increased advertising. So, there is a difference seasonalization of the advertising this year and therefore, we would expect cost to be down in the fourth quarter and that's probably the missing piece that puts it together for you.","Jamie Rollo - Morgan Stanley","So that's adjusted into Q1, Q2 this year, actually cutting your advertising, aren\u2019t you?","David Bernstein","","Well, we increased the whole overall advertising, but the big increase in Q1 and Q2 was on the advertising side, yes. There were other increases in insurance and crew travel and few other things, but the thing that drove the majority of the increase was advertising.","Jamie Rollo - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust","Hi. Good morning. I have two questions for you. You briefly talked about expectations for the third quarter revenue yields and sort of indicated just back half will be up. What would you expect to be a stronger quarter, the third or the fourth as far as that revenue yield growth?","David Bernstein","","Yeah. We will give you that guidance when we get to next quarter, I mean, at this point, it built into our full year, there is a lot of bookings left to go for the third quarter, we are probably about halfway there and the fourth quarter is probably a third of the way there. So, there is a lot left to go. Typically, of course, the third quarter is the strongest summer season for us. So that bodes well for the yields in that particular timeframe. But it\u2019s a little early for us to give detail guidance.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust","Okay. We'll catch-up on that in the future. And then, gentleman, second question here, you've talk today a bit about getting back to prior pricing levels and mentioned that hotels have gotten there? Certainly, one difference between the cruise industry and the hotel industry is the difference supply characteristics? That been said, what -- for next year, what would you -- what do you see capacity in the Caribbean shaping up and that's really maybe very important because its this year has been high and held impacted prices. So what are your expectations for next year for the Caribbean both for yourselves and the industry?","David Bernstein","","Yeah. Well, the -- we don\u2019t have all the detailed itineraries for our competitors and everybody. But I took a look at the first quarter and for our North American brands for the first quarter, we are expecting a small decrease in the capacity in the Caribbean, primarily driven by the fact that Carnival Legend was announced is moving down to Australia, which will reduce our capacity in the Caribbean. So, that should be helpful, I have seen other announcements, but we will be putting all that data together on a consolidated basis and hope to have that before the next call.","Micky Arison","","Historically, when there has been a big change in capacity in the destination market and then there has been some pricing impact from that, ships tend to move out. So, I guess, I won\u2019t say, ships are moving out, but it\u2019s highly unlikely we'll see the level of capacity increase next year that we see in this year.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust","Okay. Got it. I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Micky Arison","","Thank you.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Dobson with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Brian Dobson - Nomura","Oh! Hey, guys. Two quick questions for you. So you talked a lot about strong cost in bookings? I suppose how much of the 2Q and 3Q are left to sale at this point? You mentioned that, you are just shy about a normalized forward booking curve, but I guess where are you more particularly?","David Bernstein","","Yeah. Well, what I had said on the previous and answering the previous question is that for the current quarter we're in 80% to 90% and then the next question we are out 50% to 70%, and I've said we were towards the lower end of those rang. So, it gives you a good indication of where we are for Q2 and 3.","Brian Dobson - Nomura","Right. And then, I guess, thinking about your recent ship renovations? Can you give any color on the type of premium pricing that you are seeing or the returns on those Fun Ship 2.0 renovation?","Arnold Donald","","Yeah. I think on Fun Ship 2.0 is certainly one of the reasons why we've seen accelerated recovery in the brand. I don\u2019t think there is any doubt about that. And so even though we've got tough comparisons given all the moving parts and all the various variables, there is no question in our minds that Fun Ship 2.0 has lifted our yields relative to where they would have been and probably lifted our occupancy as well.","So we are absolutely declaring success on that one. And we continue to innovate as you know we have the 60 concerts that are planned for the Carnival brand this year. We're seeing some lift across the number of those as well both in terms of booking trends and pricing.","David Bernstein","You know on the Carnival Sunshine which was a major refurbishments, we had plan that out with extra revenue on the additional cabin that we put in, extra onboard revenue relating as Arnold indicated to all the Fun Ship 2.0 improvement. So one thing that turned out to be very favorable that we hadn\u2019t anticipated or we didn\u2019t put into our forecast, I should say, was the extra ticket pricing in the premium we were getting there as a result of the refurbishments.","So we were very pleased with that. And it\u2019s virtually like a new build. We renamed the ship and add a lot of great features with the water park and the ropes course and all. So we were -- we're pleased with that. We are seeing that the refurbishments have a positive halo effect across the fleet.","We bring out the new features on the new ships and then we try to retrofit them across the fleet to maintain a consistent brand standard. And that's very powerful and very helpful and we've been doing that for while and we\u2019ll continue to do that as we move forward.","Brian Dobson - Nomura","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Wyn Ellis with Numis. Please go ahead.","Wyn Ellis - Numis","Hi. Good morning. Just got three questions, if I can please. First of all on Japan, you said it\u2019s only 1% of your capacity for this year. Could you clarify for us, what it will cost you, you think in EPS terms? And then secondly on they Ukraine, have you seen any impact of the unrest there and the political maneuvers? And have you built that into your guidance for this year, any additional caution? And then finally, just a question on advertising, I think Arnold in your opening remarks, you said it would be up about 14% this year. Is that something you\u2019d expect to continue in following years?","Arnold Donald","","Okay, so first of all with regards to the Ukraine, the geopolitical issues have been periodically almost every year somewhere. And it\u2019s clearly the Ukraine has impacted some itineraries in terms of demand and attitude and orientation for guests to seek a particular itinerary. It's had a bit of a halo effect for a period of time on the European bookings period.","On the other hand, European bookings continue to be strong and we're seeing a good yield and good occupancy trends there. So yes, it's had an impact, but there is a lot of variables and it all comes out in the wash, so to say. So it only represents about 0.7% of our capacity. So there is some halo effect going across. Go ahead, David, you wanted to make \u2026","David Bernstein","Yeah. I think as far as the overall forecast is concerned, what we did is we assumed that things remained the same, that things didn't get deteriorate, and we built support cast on that premise. We have -- Costa has announced some changes in their itinerary because they had some ships going to the Ukraine in May. They're replacing the Ukraine with Bulgaria, and in overnight in Istanbul, that's been announced. There are some other Costa and AIDA, and if I remember correctly, Seabourn go there in the third quarter. And we're monitoring that carefully and I would expect that those itineraries would change as well.","As far as Japan is concerned, I guess it's safe to say that like many new markets when you enter, you do have to invest a little bit. I've used that term before. It's a nice way of saying we're losing some money in the market, but we are very bullish on the overall prospects for Japan. And we believe it's worth the investment as we continue to develop the market. As far as advertising\u2026","Arnold Donald","Yes, the advertising, the increase, as I referenced was over 2012. We were back a couple of years because of the increases that we did put in place in 2013 year at the end. But directionally, we'll make an ongoing judgment. I'm always looking to see impact for dollars invested. We had not advertised, for example, in the Princess Line for almost 10 years, that's for ad campaign.","And so we'll examine it. I'm a personal believer and pulsing that you advertise for a period of time, then you take a little break and you advertise. We have 10 brands. We can manage that over but we\u2019ll see how it works out and I don't have any preconceived notions. I want to hear from the brands in terms of what they think is having the greatest impact and evidence they can provide to that.","Fundamentally, we're going to promote our brands. And from an overall direction, I don't have a big prediction for you. But I don't see us do anything dramatically in terms of dramatic increases absent a clear return prospect.","David Bernstein","Yeah. Of the 20% that Arnold mentioned versus 12%, a little bit more than half of that was last year and the rest of it was in 2014. I had indicated in December, part of the increase was due to higher advertising.","Wyn Ellis - Numis","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Edward Stanford with Lazarus Partnership. Please go ahead.","Edward Stanford - Lazarus Partnership","Good morning. Just one question if I may. Could you give us an update on where you are with fitting the scrubber technology to your vessels, and to extent to which is the percentage of the fleet will be embodied by the end of the year, please?","David Bernstein","Sure.","Arnold Donald","Go ahead, David here on the percentage.","David Bernstein","Yes. Today, we had put it previously on the Queen Victoria. I think we had said that on previous calls that we were testing it and it was working well. We were completely pleased with the results. We\u2019ve put it on six additional ships. Probably have 20 plus ships with scrubbers before the end of the year. Between that and the exemptions that we got for 2015, we had indicated in the 10-K that we didn't expect to see the ECA have a significant impact on our cost structure for 2015. The numbers previously in prior 10-Ks were a few hundred million dollar impact as a result of the low-sulfur fuel. We're progressing, we're pleased with the progress we're making, and we will continue to roll the scrubbers out over time both in \u201815 and \u201816.","Edward Stanford - Lazarus Partnership","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs","Just a quick question on the impact of the Galveston oil spill, should we be thinking about that as having any EPS impact in the next quarter and what\u2019s your current thoughts on that and where those ships stand?","David Bernstein","Okay. Well, there are three ships that are currently in port, two Carnival ships and one Princess ship. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t know exactly when the channel will open up. I guess, at the moment if the channel opened up this week and the future cruises were to occur as normal, it might cost us a penny in the second quarter.","But this is a fluid situation and I do hope they can get it cleaned up and the channel opened this week. And yeah, we do it -- by the way, under the current law we do expect recovery of the lost revenue in the incremental costs under the OPA regulations and insurance. So we would expect to see a recovery at some point later this year, the additional costs.","Arnold Donald","Yeah, for the full year, though unless something really prolongs this, we don\u2019t see a material impact on our guidance.","Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead.","Robin Farley - UBS","Thanks. I wonder if you could give a little bit of color on, you mentioned the other European brands excluding Costa being down in Q1, just sort of a little bit of color on those factors?","David Bernstein","Sure. At AIDA, unfortunately because of the loss of the Red Sea program and the very popular Egypt itineraries, we had to make some changes. Those didn't occur this year. And as a result, the yields were down just a little bit in the first quarter. In the U.K., the U.K. has done some changes to their pricing programs in their commission structures. So, while their first quarter was impacted, we do expect an improving trend in the U.K. overall. So, hopefully that gives you a look a little bit more color on what\u2019s going on.","Arnold Donald ","And I will say in general, in Europe, we do as I mentioned earlier on the call, with the booking curves being moved out we see strength in Europe. And again, it\u2019s reflected in our guidance, but we actually see a strong performance collectively in Europe this year.","Robin Farley - UBS","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we have one last question from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo","That\u2019s fine. My previous question was just answered. Thank you.","Arnold Donald","Thank you very much","Operator","And there is no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to you Mr. Donald.","Arnold Donald","Hey. Thank you all very much. We look forward to visiting with you next quarter and in between. And I thank you for your time.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Thank you all for joining us for our Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call.","Today, I\u2019m joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison; by David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer and by Beth Roberts, our Vice President of Investor Relations.","Before I begin, please note that some of the remarks on this call will be forward-looking, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release. Our team has continued to make strong progress so far this year as we march toward our goal of double-digit return on invested capital in the next three to four years.","In the first half of 2015, albeit from a low base, our earnings are up five-fold year-over-year and we are well on our way to our second consecutive year of 25% annual earnings improvement. This was another strong quarter for our company more than doubling the earnings from the prior year and significantly exceeding guidance by $0.12 per share, of which only $0.02 resulted from further improvement and a combination of fuel and currency.","All of our North American brands had a strong performance led by the Carnival Brand, which achieved a double-digit improvement in ticket revenue yield, a testament to the strength of the Carnival cruise line product and the brand team's incredible execution in delivering a vacation experience that truly resonates with our guests.","The Fun Ship 2.0 features including Guy's Burger Joint, The Punchliner Comedy Show and Seuss at Sea, to name just a few examples are continuing to elevate the guest experience.","The series of investments in product innovation, travel, agent engagement, and marketing have delivered, and the brand continues to outperform. The power of our diversified portfolio overcame the Continental European brand challenges for macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties.","During the quarter, we made progress on multiple initiatives designed to further out journey to our consistent yield improvement by creating demand in excess of supply. Our award-winning public relations effort is providing ongoing opportunity to address new cruisers by creating more conversations around cruising.","A good example of our ongoing public relations effort was demonstrated by Cunard creating nearly one billion media impressions around its 175th anniversary celebrations as the three Queens took center stage and what may have been the largest attendance at a single day maritime event anywhere in the world.","To witness and to feel the deep sense of pride and awe emanating from its estimated 1.3 million people packed on both banks of the Murphy stretching the 22 miles from Liverpool to the mouth of the River as the three Queens; Elizabeth, Victoria and the iconic Queen Mary II did their own version of a river dance had a phenomenal display of engineering and maritime technical excellence and execution. It was an incredibly uplifting and moving experience.","For several hours, the million plus onlookers were totally captivated by our ship and Cunard, and I\u2019m always moved by the deep connection of our brands, our history, and what we do collectively without just our guests with the broader communities they represent around the world.","It was a job exceedingly well done by our Cunard and Carnival UK Shipboard and short-side team members, whose execution was a marvel on to itself.","The event drove a tremendous amount of public interest as I had mentioned and followed on the heels of the incredible launch of Britannia christened by Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth the IInd, an event itself, which drew significant international attention and showcased cruising on a global scale.","While training demand through events such as these, we continue to manage capacity growth in our core source markets in North America and Europe by redeploying capacity towards emerging markets attracting increasing numbers of new to cruise. With additional capacity, redeployed to China in 2016, we will offer an industry-leading approximately four million passenger cruise days dedicated to the burgeoning China cruise market, that\u2019s substantially more than our closest competitor.","Moreover, in 2017, our Princess Brand wants the first ship to be purpose built for Chinese consumers, that's an industry first. While today China represents just 5% of our global guests, its growth will continue to have significant ancillary benefits by constraining capacity in our core markets in both North America and Europe.","So growth prospects in China contribute to enhance relative scarcity elsewhere in which we market the remaining 95% of our capacity.","Over time, we are confident that China will become among the largest source markets for cruise given the increasingly favorable demographic trend and high satisfaction scores we are commanding.","Chinese outbound travel is expected to double by 2020, and we are certainly well positioned to capitalize on the explosive pent-up demand for international travel following the recent easing of travel restrictions coupled with the booming upper middle class.","Beyond the growth opportunity in China, we're accessing a new segment of the global market with the launch of our test brand in the Carnival Corporation of family [indiscernible] .","The purpose is to do good, and in doing so we do expect the assets to perform financially as well. We believe U.S., UK, Australia, and Northern Europe over index with travelers in this segment. Fathom will offer travelers authentic, meaningful experiences to target destinations to work alongside locals for transformational community impact.","At the same time, Fathom creates a holistic sustained impact through a market-driven business model. Now this is a new travel category for us. Importantly, from a pure business perspective, Fathom generates a totally different conversation around cruising, stimulating greater demand for cruising in general.","To date, Fathom has already garnered over 3.5 billion media impressions and growing. Beginning in April 2016, Fathom will embark on seven day voyages from the Port of Miami to its first impact destination, Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic.","This is also where our new $85 million Amber Cove port development is set to open this October and ready to receive several of our other world\u2019s leading cruise-line brands.","Fathom is headed by our new global impact leader, Tara Russell, a proven social entrepreneur with a track record of developing self sustaining impact entities.","Now you can view the launch and find out more about and about Tara and about Fathom at Fathom.org. Including Tara, talent development continues to be an important focus and we have effected change by complementing a solid core with additional new talent further strengthening our management team.","In addition to seven new brand presidents, we\u2019ve added talent in the areas of maritime, strategy, revenue management, communications, procurement, and innovation.","Our team is totally engaged in communicating, collaborating, and cooperating to capture the full benefit of the latent opportunity inherent in our industry-leading scale, both in driving revenues and in containing costs.","We continue to make progress on our roadmap to advance revenue science and systems including investing in dynamic pricing expert brand teams to improve our decision making capability, establishing price boundaries for relative price position across our portfolio, and piloting regional price coordination in Alaska and Australia, for example through increased booking visibility across the brands and through joint decision making.","Now we\u2019ve also made progress in our initiative to drive onboard revenue as evidenced by the 6% onboard revenue growth, and that's in constant dollars, achieved this quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter of mid-single digit growth in onboard revenue.","The outsized growth in casino, bar and communication realized this quarter was again partly driven by best practice sharing. This is set to rollout of our casino engagement program, beverage packages and additional bandwidth are just a handful of examples of initiatives that drove our onboard revenue strength in the past few quarters and will continue to pay dividends over time.","Now all of these initiatives are building block for capturing multiyear yield growth needed to deliver double-digit return on invested capital in the next three to four years.","We remain focused on our initiatives to contain costs by leveraging our scale and we remain on track for savings of $70 million to $80 million in 2015 and continuing over multiyear period and we continue to look for opportunities to invest and generate return including our stepped up marketing investment of second half of this year to build a strong base of business heading into 2016.","Progress continued on our fleet enhancement program, as we finalized the contract with Meyer to build four, state-of-the-art ships designed to provide an exceptional vacation experience tailored to our guest's preferences.","This was part of our largest strategic partnership announced in March with Meyer in both Germany and Finland and with Fincantieri area in Italy to build nine ships over four year period from 2019 to 2022 and keeping with our measured capacity growth strategy.","These next generation ships will be the most efficient ever build with a total guest capacity of 6,600 through an innovative design pairing incredible cabins with even more innovative use of the ship public spaces.","Adding price per berth, in line with our existing order book, these ships will significantly enhance the return profile of our fleet. Moreover these next generation ships will pioneer a new era in the use of sustainable fuels through our green cruising designs, representing the first cruise ships to be powered FC by LNG.","This was yet another strong quarter, once again exceeding guidance. Now while we remain confidence in delivering 25% earnings growth again this year, we caution you given ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical risk not again ahead of expectations for the year simply based on our consistency and exceeding our quarterly guidance.","We do however remain on a clear path to achieving double-digit return on investment capital. We're focused on measured capacity growth by delivering innovative and significantly more efficient ships, while at the same time removing from service less efficient capacity.\\","We're committed to driving relative scarcity by creating even more demand for our brands that outpace this capacity. We remain focused on driving yield growth in the low to mid single digit range through higher ticket and onboard revenues while containing cost increases through our initiatives to leverage our scale and we look forward to enhancing total shareholder returns including further opportunity to return capital to shareholders as we drive for our double digit return on invested capital and our ready strong cash flow continues to build.","I\u2019d now like to turn it over to David. David?","David Bernstein","Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note all of my references to revenue and cost metrics will be in constant dollars unless otherwise stated.","I\u2019ll start today with a summary of our guidance topping second quarter results. Then I\u2019ll provide some insight into our current book position and finish up with some color on our 2015 June guidance.","Our a non-GAAP EPS for the second quarter was $0.25. I\u2019m excited to report that this was $0.12 above the midpoint of our March guidance. The improvement was driven by three things.","First $0.06 from net revenue yields, mainly due to better than guided onboard and other yields. Second $0.03 essentially from lower operating cost due to the timing of expenses between the quarters and third, $0.02 from the impact of fuel price and currencies.","Now let\u2019s turn to our second quarter operating results first in the prior year. Our capacity increased 2%. The North American brands were essentially flat while the European, Australia and Asia brands also known as our EAA Brands were up over 6%. Our total net revenue yields in the second quarter were up over 4%.","Breaking apart the two components of net revenue yields; net ticket yields were up 3.5%. Both sides of the Atlantic were up but the improvement was driven by larger increases at our North American brands, particularly Carnival Cruise Lines as Arnold indicated.","If you remove the unfavorable transactional currency impact, the net ticket yields were up almost 5% of what we referred to as constant currency. The increase in net ticket yield was across the Board with improvements in Caribbean, Med and North European itineraries.","As Arnold indicated onboard and other yields increased almost 6% again both sides of the Atlantic were up, but the improvement was also driven by the larger increases at our North American brands.","Net cruise cost per ALBD excluding fuel was up about 6%. This was driven by the previously discussed increase in dry-dock days for the year, which disproportionally impacted the second quarter. During the second quarter we did benefit from the net impact of fuel and currency by $0.10.","In summary, second quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.16 higher than the prior year, driven by improved net revenue yields worth $0.20 and the favorable net impact of fuel and currency worth $0.10. both of which were partially offset by higher net cruise cost excluding fuel costing $0.15.","During the second quarter, we had a $7 million restructuring expense in our U.S. gap results but excluded from our non-GAAP result as you\u2019ll see in the reconciliation table in our earnings release.","For the full year 2015, we anticipate a total of $27 million of restructuring expenses as we further leverage our scale, which will benefit us in 2016 and beyond.","Let\u2019s turn to booking trends. Bookings for the next three quarters taken during the last 13 weeks have been strong. Volumes are well ahead by the slightly lower prices driven by unfavorable transactional currency impacts.","At this point in time cumulative fleet wise bookings for the next three quarters are well ahead at slightly lower prices, but again driven by the unfavorable transactional currency impact.","Our increased pace of booking puts us in a strong position as we finish our 2015 and begin 2016. Drilling down into the cumulative booking position; first for our North American brand.","Caribbean itineraries are significantly ahead on occupancy at slightly lower prices, which bodes well for pricing on future bookings and pricing in the last six weeks has been higher. Alaskan itineraries are nicely ahead on both price and occupancy.","While other North American brand deployments combined, which includes the seasonal European programs are nicely ahead on occupancy, but at lower prices, which are being unfavorably impacted by transactional currencies.","For our EAA brands, all itineraries combined are nicely ahead on price with occupancies that are in line with the prior year. The solid booking trends are consistent with our guidance.","Now looking at our full year 2015 guidance, we expect net revenue yields to be up 2% to 3% versus the prior year, which is slightly better than our March guidance. Net revenue yields on a constant currency basis after moving the transactional currency impacts are expected to be up 3% to 4% versus the prior year. This is consistent with our March guidance.","The additional strength we've seen in Caribbean and Alaskan ticket yield as well as onboard yields has been offset by geopolitical risk in the Med and macroeconomic uncertainties in Continental Europe.","Now turning to cost. For the full year 2015, net cruise costs without fuel for ALBD are now expected to be up 2.5% to 3.5%. This is a slight increase from our March guidance driven by decision to increase spending on advertising and certain strategic projects in the back half of 2015 both of which should benefit us in 2016 and beyond.","For 2015, we're forecasting to benefit from the net impact of fuel and currency by $0.16. Taking all these factors into consideration, our non-GAAP EPS guidance for the full year 2015 is now $2.35 to $2.50 versus a $1.93 for 2014.","On a final note, I wanted to share with you, our current rules of the thumb about the impact that currency and fuel prices can have on our results.","To start with a 10% change in all of the relevant currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would impact our P&L by approximately $0.25 to the full year and $0.18 for the remainder of 2015. This includes both translational and transactional currency impact.","The fuel price changes, a 10% change in the current price represents a $0.10 impact for the remainder of 2015. The third rule of thumb relates to a fuel derivative portfolio. A 10% change in brand would result in a $0.04 change in the realized losses on fuel derivatives for the remainder of 2015.","And now operator we're ready to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead. Robin Farley, your line is open. You may proceed with your question.","Robin Farley","Great, thanks. Two questions. One is, I wondered if you could give a little bit of color around the cost of brand. You mentioned Continental Europe and the economic issues there. So I -- maybe cost won\u2019t be seeing positive yields this year, I wondered if you could put color on that?","And then the other question I had is you've talked about increasing advertising expense and I guess I was curious if your volumes sound like it's up nicely, and so if the issue is on the currency side, it seems like advertising is something that would -- you would use to drive volume, but if your volumes are up already, why would advertising be the solution to the kind of the FX related pricing? Thanks.","Arnold Donald","Good morning Robin and good to hear your voice. First of all, I will talk about the advertising. We\u2019re always looking for opportunities to invest to create additional demand, because ultimately the key for us of course is relative scarcity creating demand in all the markets around the world, excess of supply and excess of capacity.","And so when we recognize some opportunities to drive additional demand, the brand teams or all brands come up with innovative concepts that we think can generate more conversation around cruising and attract new to cruise, then we're willing to invest in it.","And so, that's the basis [indiscernible] an ongoing investment to continuously generate additional demand. With regards to Costa, I'll let David make a few comments and then I'll weigh in.","David Bernstein","Sure. As we had said before in the notes, there is a lot of macroeconomic difficulties in Europe. The economy seems to be bouncing along at the bottom.","Our Costa brand is doing very well, but as a result of the geopolitical risk and other things, they have had some challenges on the yield side this year. And so as a result, overall our EAA brands as I said in my notes are up. They're all doing very well but the Costa does face its challenge.","Robin Farley","Okay, great. Congratulations on a great quarter.","Arnold Donald","Okay, thank you, Robin.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi good morning. I've two questions. The first one is we've been hearing from travel agents that all the cruise lines in the Caribbean are exercising discipline regarding near-term discounting as one of your peers made a very clear splash about that.","Just wondering what your stance is on that? And then also I just wanted to confirm that the increase in advertising that you talked about is not inclusive of any promotional spending?","Arnold Donald","Okay. So concerning the situation and pricing, obviously we all independently make our pricing decisions. We said over two years ago almost that we were looking at changing the psychology of pricing concerning our brands in the Caribbean in terms of waiting to the end -- I guess waiting to the end and seeking discounts.","And so, we trialed a number of things and rest of little occupancy at times for that and generated some success with that, and we continue to try to put pricing integrity in and discipline in for our brands independently of what anyone else does.","So for us, we have seen some positive trends there, and we will continue on that course. When you asked the question about advertising and promotion, I think obviously we're looking at promotional activity as well. When you say promotion, I don\u2019t know if you're referring specifically to travel agent promotion effort or if you so could you clarify your question for me.","Felicia Hendrix","Yes I think the concern that we've heard from some investors this morning is it gets to the more of a discounting part of it. So just your advertising is what you maybe talked about in the last question and just \u2026","Arnold Donald","No, it's absolutely not discounting ticket pricing or anything of that -- not that kind of investment. This is to create demand and awareness and conversation around cruise. Thank you.","Felicia Hendrix","Great. David, can you help bridge something, you beat the quarter by $0.12 on a current dollar basis, which flows through your earnings. Your net yields were improved by 1.5 at the mid-point.","Your net cruise cost ex-fuel improved by 1.5 [ph] at the mid-point. Your fuel price per metric ton improved since your last guidance. You said your fuel hedges benefit by your FX and fuel benefit by $0.16 for the full year.","When I add that all up, that comes out to a lot more than at the mid-point $0.02 increase to your full year earnings, So how much is that advertising -- increased advertising spend and can you just help bridge your earnings guidance versus what looks like to be pass-through of a lot more than that?","David Bernstein","Sure. No problem. When you look at fuel and currency for the full year, it's actually pretty flat versus our March guidance. So what\u2019s coming through is we do have a little bit increase in the revenue yield as well as the cost side.","And trying to understand what\u2019s going on versus the second quarter, yes we did beat by $0.12, but remember $0.03 of that was simply timing of expenses between the quarters.","So on a full year basis, it's really $0.09 and we also had about a $0.05 increase in overall costs flowing through which was the mainly advertising but as I indicated, some strategic projects that we decided to invest in, and so net there was a $0.04, $0.05 of improvement, which gave us the confidence to increase the bottom end of the range by a nickel.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, Not really because net revenues I can take this offline, but if you go line by line, you get more than so you said net $0.04 to $0.05 improvement, but you\u2019re increasing at the midpoint your full year by $0.02.","David Bernstein","Okay. I think one of the things that you\u2019re coding the constant dollar numbers and Beth can take it offline with you, but when you\u2026","Felicia Hendrix","No, I\u2019m actually coating the current dollar numbers.","David Bernstein","No, the current dollar, but that\u2019s all impacted by currency. So if you go to\u2026","Felicia Hendrix","No, I know but that would be in your earnings number right?","David Bernstein","Correct, but if you go at a constant currency, okay basically our guidance per revenue yields in constant currency did not change. We also just increased the cost a little bit and still overall, what you\u2019re seeing happening as I said to the full year currency and fuel basically netted out.","So we did see a bit of an improvement in the bottom end of our guidance range. So hopefully does that clarify it for you?","Felicia Hendrix","Yeah, it does. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Harry Curtis","Hi, good morning\u2026","Micky Arison","Harry, you're breaking up.","Harry Curtis","Harry, now you\u2019re still. Hang on one second while I'll try to fix the line all right.","David Bernstein","Thank you.","Arnold Donald","We can take another question while Harry is trying to\u2026No, Harry its little bit -- we'll try to hear your question; give it a shot if we can hear, we'll try to answer it. Go ahead.","Harry Curtis","Okay. So my question is related to 2016 when you think that 2016 bookings were looking and explain to increased less the annual marketing expenses in 2015?","Beth Roberts","The question is related to 2106 bookings picture is that how is that looking? Is that driving the advertising investment, is that correct Harry?","Harry Curtis","That's correct.","Arnold Donald","Let me answer the second part first. Again we\u2019re focused overall on delivering double-digit return on invested capital in the next three to four years. And to do that, we have to have sustained revenue growth in terms of ticket and onboard revenues.","And to do that, we know we have to continue to create relative scarcity with demand and excess of supply.","So our decisions are not strictly for any reaction or anything to a period. They are ongoing considered investment to create over time, what we need to create. And so overall, we\u2019re looking at 3.7% capacity increase for 2016 and for the first quarter we're ahead on occupancy, which bodes well for pricing on the remainder of the year.","And we're only in June. So we have very little visibility into next year outside of the first quarter, but we\u2019re cautiously optimistic about 2015.","Harry Curtis","Thank you. And I'll try to sneak one other question if you can hear me and it relates to churn. With the incremental in the industry, I was curious about giving for the\u2026","Arnold Donald","Okay. I didn't get it all but with complex you're asking about with the capacity going into China, what give us confidence that we can continue to show positive results there.","If that\u2019s the question, the reality in China is we already have the relative scarcity I\u2019ve been talking about in terms of trying to create additional relative scarcity in the more developed markets and already has there.","The biggest outbound tourist industry in the world and is growing at a rapid rate, in fact is expected to double by 2020 in terms of outbound tourism.","And so given that, we actually have relatively scarcity and we\u2019ve seen continued strong yield performance with the capacity additions we\u2019ve put in to-date and we expect to see it going forward.","Harry Curtis","Okay. I get back. Thanks.","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Steve Wieczynski","Hey, good morning guys. David I don't know if you've said this now but I know you said $0.06 in terms of the bead in the second quarter was based off better revenue yields, did you break that down in terms of how much was ticket versus onboard?","David Bernstein","I didn\u2019t but I did say it was, essentially driven by onboard and other yields.","Steve Wieczynski","Okay. And then could you guys Arnold, could you may be have us and give us an idea of where you guys are at this point in terms of your book-to-load position for the third quarter and the fourth quarter versus historically and maybe versus last year as well.","Arnold Donald","The reality is we're ahead on booking and so we've less inventory to fill for the balance of the year and that gives us added confidence that we will deliver on the guidance and so bookings are strong at this point and in terms of yields and while we\u2019re in tracking with the guidance of 3% to 4%.","Steve Wieczynski","But is it, can I follow-up on that, is it significantly better than where you\u2019ve historically been?","David Bernstein","Well, I would say over the last couple of years, it is well ahead and we're feeling very good about our book position.","Steve Wieczynski","Okay. And then one more quick question, the new ships that you guys put on order that will be powered by the LNG, can you give us an idea of how much more fuel efficient those ships will be versus the ship that was build two, three, four years ago.","Arnold Donald","First of all those ships obviously will be -- to be both LNG powered as well as conventional fuel powered, but we anticipate over time that LNG is going to be a fuel of choice and based on that we're preparing for the future.","But having said that overall those ships versus the existing are going to be dramatically more efficient and in fact overall, not just fuel based but overall, we\u2019re talking as much as north of 40% more efficient.","Steve Wieczynski","Okay. Great. Thanks guys.","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Jaime Katz","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you guys comment, I know you\u2019ve talked in the past on air and travel transportation initiatives and the savings that you\u2019ve made in that space and it looks like you have had those expenses decline in the last couple quarters.","So can you talk about maybe any strides you've made there and what we should expect in that going forward?","Arnold Donald","We continue through all the initiative to space the ability to offset inflation which we peg about $70 million to $80 million a year. We're definitely on track through the initiatives to achieve that this year.","We have fair line of sight for achieving that in number of years to come. We\u2019ve added some skill set in brining Julia Brown in who is our Chief Procurement Officer for the Corporation. She is working already very closely with the brands. Have lots of anecdotes that, I can share a little one with you.","We had all the mattresses, we buy a lot of mattresses a year. And we put all the mattresses in one place for all the brands and then everybody sell everybody else's mattress look at quality and what not and we\u2019re going to see probably a 20% to 25% improvement and cost improvement in that.","While increasing overall the quality standard for that mattress and then we have the scores of those examples and there is plenty of opportunities for us to do that and so we\u2019re on that path and see a clear line of sight on the $70 million to $80 million for several years to come.","Jaime Katz","Okay. And then I am curious -- go ahead.","Arnold Donald","No, no go ahead.","Jaime Katz","I am curious on a separate topic. I think one of your peers had commented on onboard spend for European consumers and it sounds like onboard has been really strong for you guys, but I\u2019m curious if there has been a bifurcation across consumers geographically that you\u2019ve seen and if you have any color on that?","Arnold Donald","I'll make a comment first and then, overall, again for us a lot of it is best practice sharing, taking innovation in each of the brands and sharing that across the rest of the brands. So we\u2019ve seen very strong on Board revenue trends in our businesses as evidenced by the results and continue to expect to see that, David.","David Bernstein","Yes as I said in my notes, the on board and other yields if the increase was driven much more so by the North American brands than our EAA brands. So there is some we are seeing some better improvements in North America and over in Europe and I\u2019m assuming this macroeconomic overall.","Jaime Katz","Okay, thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Tim Conder","Thank you. To circle back to China, again Arnold you described the penetration opportunity there and the demand opportunity.","In the near term though, we\u2019ve heard a little bit from some industry sources that there has been a little bit of pricing activity going on and if you could refresh for us the ships are largely sold on a contract basis and then the end resellers keeps it different, so that they\u2019re able to sell it for.","So any comment that you can talk about, any recourse you would have if that is ongoing in anyway in the near term and if it is, is it MERS related predominantly.","So any color there and then David housekeeping item, the restructuring just if you could just refresh how much you talked about there for the full year and is that included or excluded from your annual EPS guidance, thank you.","David Bernstein","Okay, sure. So first of all I guess MERS, we\u2019re watching that situation very closely but frankly we have not seen a significant impact so far. People obviously always would pay attention to health issues but the reality is that MERS is very hard to contract and hopefully people will get educated on the very low probability of contracting MERS.","We have -- rare it is from China that touch Korea and we have modified some itineraries at the request of our shift charters but one of the strategic advantages that we have as an industry versus land based destination is our ability to mitigate when appropriate and adjust itineraries to maintain guest confidence satisfaction as opposed to being locked in to surroundings no matter what the circumstances are.","Technically we do have a measure of protection by having charters but we don\u2019t expect the situation to become a material issue for us or our distribution parts. And overall we continue to see strength in China in the yields and our charters or all the feedback we are getting is they are pleased now financially at this point.","Arnold Donald","And the restructuring charges, Tim it was $27 million restructuring expenses that we expected for the full year and in this second quarter we have excluded the restructuring expenses from our non-GAAP results and remember we give guidance on a non-GAAP basis. So it\u2019s not included in the overall 235 to 250 guidance we gave.","Tim Conder","Okay. That\u2019s what we thought, thank you.","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Steven Kent","Hi good morning. Just a couple of questions for you, Arnold you mentioned a couple of times, you want to achieve double-digit return on invested capital.","I\u2019m not sure that you gave a specific timeframe when you wanted to achieve that, also can you just discuss, you also mentioned the couple of times that you want to have demand greater than supply and I certainly understand that, what is the basis for laying out so many ships for such an extended period going out into the 2020 period or so.","I\u2019m just trying to figure out what the drivers are that gives you the confidence that that would happen and then just one final thing on China, I know people are talking a lot about it.","Could you give us an update on the two memorandum of understanding you had with your Chinese partners, any progress coming to agreement on port development or ship building with the Chinese partners. Thank you.","Arnold Donald","Very good. I\u2019ll start from the bottom up. On the memorandum of understanding, Steve, you know Alan Buckelew, our Chief Operations Officer for the Corporation resides now in Shanghai in China and we\u2019ve made very meaningful progress with both CSFC and the China Merchant Group and hopefully we\u2019ll have something more specific to say Chinese specific joint ventures in the coming months here we are very excited about the progress we are making in that particular arena and the continued support overall from the Chinese government to the cruise industry.","So we\u2019re very, very positive on that front and hopefully will have more to tell you. Concerning to ship order, as we are articulated at the time, the overall the large order nine ship order between Fincantieri and Meyer that was done for number of reasons.","Number one is prototypes that we want to get plenty of lead time for those yards to engage the subcontractors that need to be engaged and for those subcontractors to know that both entities Meyer and Fincantieri would be building ships and it wasn\u2019t a single order that they were competing for.","And so hopefully that will lead to efficiency and ultimately lower cost of acquisition for us. From a practical matter, we have to plan way ahead to secure the slots and to give the yards plenty of time to work with us to perfect and effective designs.","And so that is the reason for that, the reason to build the ships in the first place is that by the time the ships come in, we should have achieved our double-digit return on invested capital that is certainly our plan and our focus and what we have clarified right now, three to four years is what we\u2019re saying we say at a year ago three to five years and so that is three to four years we should be delivering on double-digit return on invested capital.","And then those ships individually each return well above the baseline double-digit return on invested capital 10% well above that and so they allow us to enhance and sustain the double-digit performance out into the future. Hope that answered your questions.","Steven Kent","Yes, thank you.","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Milota with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Kevin Milota","Hi good morning. Had the question on the advertising spend, I was hoping to get some color on what you\u2019ve seen from a first time cruise based on what you spend in kind of the first half of the year kind of late last year and is that really the reason for taking up spend now.","I guess secondly what are you seeing from a competitive perspective as it relates to marketing and advertising as well, is that an additional reason to spend now?","Arnold Donald","First of all for us our business is pretty straightforward and so we consider our competition to be land based vacation. We have very differentiated product offerings versus the other cruise companies.","We do all competes on new to cruise because often the new to cruise there is no concept what cruise would best with them and that is what we come on travel professional partners especially as well as our own people to make certain we get the right people on the right ships but real competition cruise is land based and so we focus on that.","So what we need to do as an industry as well as a company is create considerable interest improving just getting the conversation how people think about cruising and we\u2019ve done at a number of ways whether it was the Super Bowl initiative we had.","We did it most recently with the launch of Fathom, we did it with what I have references in terms of celebration of Cunard\u2019s 175 Princess\u2019s 50 anniversary and all of those things are interesting stories and create opportunities for us to really talk about cruising and get it in the conversation.","And that is so how we look at it, we don\u2019t look at it as advertising to how to advertise, we want the competition advertising promote.","One of every two people cruise in the world, cruise with us and anything that generates interest in cruising automatically helps us and frankly it helps the other companies as well. So that is the focus of it and we think we\u2019re seeing some success, there are some variables in any given year in any given market at any given time.","But clearly our results have been strong and we don\u2019t doubt for a second, that is in part because we have had some success through the individual brands and then collectively been generating more interest in cruising.","David Bernstein","Let\u2019s keep in mind that as a company, we spend we have said before over $600 million a year in advertising expense and all we are talking about is a few percent change here, as the year progresses we continue to tweak things and make adjustments to be as optimal as we can be throughout the year. So it\u2019s just really change in a big number.","Arnold Donald","And frankly mark is more interested in the specific idea in the execution how it is going to generate additional interest than we are in the dollars.","We don\u2019t have rule of the thumb of how we need to spend different amount of dollars and anything like that, we will look at individual initiatives projects and things that would show me how we\u2019re generate number of impressions generate conversations with the specific execution. Thanks.","Kevin Milota","Okay. Thank you.","David Bernstein","You can ask follow-up.","Kevin Milota","I was just wondering from based on what you spend, I mean have you seen a meaningful increase in the percent of first time cruisers if you look at specific basis?","David Bernstein","You know I would say overall first time cruisers are up dramatically, now there is a number of things that contribute to that beyond this year, I guess last year we were 3.4 million first time cruisers whereas the year prior we were like something like 2.7 or 2.8 or something.","But there are number of things that drive that, number one we have got lot of first time cruisers elsewhere in China, so that is part of it, another part of it is in the Caribbean there was so much capacity last year in the Caribbean.","The only way to fill those ships with other lots of new first time cruisers and so that drove first time cruise and added yield that we were happy with but it drove additional base load of first time cruisers and then of course all the initiatives we had to create demand and others and industry have, we think all of that collectively contribute to what you saw in terms of the increase in first time cruisers last year versus previous year.","Kevin Milota","Okay. Very good, thank you.","David Bernstein","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Sharon Zackfia","Hi good morning. Just a question on the ship orders that you\u2019ve announced recently, I guess the new ships are going to have the capacity as 6,600 guests.","I know you alluded to in the press release about how you will have more efficient use of the ship spaces in order to accommodate the guests.","I was hoping you could maybe elaborate on that and also within the design of the cabins, are you going to doing a single cabins or anything kind of outside of the box what you have done historically.","David Bernstein","\\First of all the current space per guest in terms of space per guest, it is similar to the ships we have on order now for those ships.","So really was innovative design and Micky Arison and then Michael Thamm, who runs our Costa group were very ingenious in the original conceptualization for these ships and then the new build teams in house and at the yards, we are able to follow during execution of that.","So we actually feel an incredible guest experience, great cabins absolutely great cabins and really phenomenal public space and are able on that platform to have as I mentioned space per guests comparable to the ships we currently have on order. So it really is the efficient interior design and then very creative design.","Sharon Zackfia","Just to be clear, the 6600 is total passenger capacity based on two passenger per cabin is just north of 5000 per ship or passengers. Okay, thanks.","David Bernstein","And some of the things absolutely, the ships are being finished, some of the conceptualizations there are some single cabin concept.","Sharon Zackfia","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of [Edward Stanford with Ross] [ph]. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning everybody. Just intrigued by your new Fathom brand, could you take us through why you decided to do this, how big is the potential market do you see it is an interesting growth area, was it a requirement with the Dominican Republic as part of your investment in that country perhaps you could elaborate on that please.","David Bernstein","So first of all the reason behind Fathom, Fathom the purpose is to do good, the unique aspect of it is holistic market driven approach to doing this, so have to be a win, win, win.","So we have to do financially well with it, that gives us freedom to do it and make it sustainable. So the shareholders win. It has to resonate with the guests, the people have to want to travel on it and if they don\u2019t they won\u2019t.","So it makes it a win for them and then obviously the ultimate reason the starting point is to do good and so we have the real genuine impact with it otherwise was the point.","So the concept of win, win, win while it does resonate in index with what we usually call Millennial, it appeals to a broad spectrum of people who basically want to grow themselves so it is not just a matter of going someplace to do some good help out is an enrichment and emerging experience for the travelers themselves and very unique and different approach and one that brings scale that previously just doesn\u2019t exist and never existed.","So it is new. So we picked up -- and Puerto Plata recently in the Dominican Republic, we checked out a number of different countries to start and we landed there primarily because there are entities on the ground there that have demonstrated long-term history of genuine impact in the areas of economic impact as well as environmental and educational impact.","So there are Dominican organizations on the ground that are currently delivering impact, so the guest get to work alongside those proven Dominican impact providers and scale up the impact they can have.","So we will end up with thousands of volunteer days a week spread across the region in a holistic fashion not doing any one thing but doing a combination of things that collectively can transform a community over time and ideal go with -- few years and no long we need it and we will move on somewhere else.","How big it is ultimately, what the advertisers, we have done a lot of research, we paired our team with the McKenzie Group and ton of announcements over the last couple of years leading us to where we are.","But obviously all have to be proven out, we have every confidence, we will be successful with the initial foray and then if it is successful, it is scalable and replicable and as long as they are on the ground entities that are already delivering real impact that we can help scale up what they are doing and accelerate that impact it has. That is the concept we feel big appetite for it.","We it is financial model for us, it will have to financially perform that gives to continue with it and we are very optimistic but it has to be proved.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks very much.","David Bernstein ","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stuart Gordon with Berenberg. Please go ahead.","Stuart Gordon","Yes good afternoon gentlemen, couple of questions please. I think previous calls you have said on both spend assumptions within guidance around about 2% mark I was just wanting to check that that was still the case looking forward I am assuming so given the comments you have made already and the second one is just whether you have seen any impact in China from the thinking that happened a couple of weeks ago.","I appreciate it obviously it is river cruising, it was local operator but clearly could impact first time cruisers in that market and what you will be doing to so to educate them on the differences between sort of the river cruisers and your ocean cruisers, thanks very much.","David Bernstein","Thank you. I think we are in the early stage of growth in China that there are a lot of things that happened that it was a more mature market, you might see some kind of impact or response from.","But again the relative scarcity exist there today and so that buffered a lot of things and so frankly no we have not seen any impact from the incident that occurred.","And as more and more people cruise obviously we're continually educating our distribution partners there and then as well as the general public about cruising and the differences, but we have not seen any effect there.","I'll let David answer the first part of your question.","David Bernstein","So we did assume a 2% in the back half of this year. Keep in mind that as you begin to analyze that, that the back half of last year and onboard and other was up mid single digits and it was significantly better than the first half of 2014. So we do have more challenging comps in the back half so take that into account as you analyze the numbers.","Stuart Gordon","Yeah absolutely. And just on the onboard, it sounds from the comments that you may just -- seeing pretty pick up from sort of your not just the consumer confidence coming back but also from your sort of your self help, things that you\u2019re doing onboard, is that something that is now fleet wide or is it still rolling out?","Arnold Donald","There are still a number of things that we're rolling out. So we expect -- continue to see benefits in the future from some of the initiatives in communications, casino and beverage.","A great example there was a press release Idida put out yesterday on their internet service and how they had headed on a couple of shifts and they were expanding it to the rest of that fleet. So we do expect to see additional onboard revenue from those initiatives.","Stuart Gordon","Okay. Thank you very much.","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Rollo with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Jamie Rollo","Thank you. First question is just on the yield growth guidance in the third quarter. I\u2019m just wondering given the momentum you're seeing and the sort of a positive outlook statement.","I\u2019m wondering why that yield growth is weakening year-over-year in Q3 than Q2? Are you just being conservative or is there more of that European geopolitical sort of issue in the mix in the quarter?","And then other question just on costs, as we look into next year you talked before about quite a lot of this year\u2019s dry dock reversing and it seems like marketing costs are somewhat elevated, would you expect cost growth to continue in the low single digits even with your savings or should we expect a sort of this year\u2019s cost step up? Thank you.","Beth Roberts","I guess I\u2019ll start with on a constant dollar basis the guidance for the third quarter is the same as the guidance we gave for the second quarter.","Jamie Rollo","Yeah, in terms of what you actually delivered in the second quarter. So are you saying it's -- well somewhat you\u2019re saying is sounds like you're just being quite conservative there?","David Bernstein","Keep in mind I had already indicated that we included in that guidance was only a 2% increase in onboard and other and that compares to the 6% in the second quarter.","And as far as the ticket side, as always we give you our best guess as to what we believe the net ticket yield will be and we included that in the guidance as well.","So overall we got some pretty good increases in the third quarter on a constant currency basis. We're expecting it to be, like 3% to 4% included in the third quarter. So we\u2019re very pleased with those yields and hopefully we can do better.","Beth Roberts","But then also the base comparison for the third quarter is a little more challenging than the second.","David Bernstein","And on the cost side, I think we had indicated back in December, there was a big increase in dry dock this year. It was driving two of the three percentage point increase in cost. We did expect to see dry dock days decline in 2016 and so about half of that increase would go away. So that will be a benefit for 2016.","It\u2019s a little early to give guidance on cost for 2016 overall. We are hopefully, as Arnold indicated with all of the leveraging our scale to perhaps be able to offset inflation, but we still have got to go through the whole planning process and make some decisions on investments and we'll do that over the next couple of months.","Arnold Donald","As to double digit return on invested capital and in the next three to four years and the way we\u2019re going to do that ultimately is through yield and so to the extent we need to invest to do that we will, but we don\u2019t see that need to invest or those opportunities to invest to think is well out of range or anything on cost going forward.","Jamie Rollo","Okay. Thank you.","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","James Hardiman","Hi, good morning. Thanks for fitting me in here. Just wanted to make sure I understand what\u2019s changed over the last three months or not changed I guess in terms of the guidance.","I guess more specifically help me understand why the constant currency guidance is unchanged despite the meaningful beat in the second quarter? Is any of that timing related? I know the costs are timing related, but the yield is timing related it sounds like there is a healthy dose of conservatism.","And I guess if the entirety of it is just weaker Europe in Med, can you maybe drill down and help us understand which itineraries in particular are trending what would almost need to be meaningfully beneath expectations for the back half of the year?","Arnold Donald","I\u2019ll start with a general comment. The general comment is that while results are tempered by Europe for 2015 we are going to see growth in yield in Europe and both in the brands and in the regions.\\","And also we continue to see strong booking patterns there where the booking curve is being pushed further out and that bodes well because you have less inventory to sell and then that\u2019s also obviously good for yields.","So despite a lot of the challenges and cost in particular have been facing challenges since 2008 with macroeconomic Malaise and other issues and just a trading environment.","But despite that, not only Costa but the entire European team, Carnival U.K., Idida as well have been doing a great job in managing the brand over this period. So I'll let David comment on some of the specifics, but overall things are positive.","David Bernstein","Yeah, we\u2019re very positive on the year. Some of these numbers as I had talked, we said we would beat the second quarter by $0.06.","So overall when you put together our guidance for the year, keep in mind that to move our yield guidance takes $0.17, one percentage point is $130 million or $0.17.","So as we look at all the numbers, the $0.06 movement causes a few decimal point movement in the mid -- in the guidance, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily change the whole overall range for the year.","So we\u2019re trying to just give you ranges and averages, but we're flowing through the benefit as I had indicated before of the second quarter and it was partially offset by cost and we still increased the midpoint and the bottom end of the range.","James Hardiman","Okay. And then just maybe longer term and I understand it\u2019s always a difficult challenge to properly allocate capacity on a global basis, but as we think about the outperformance of the Caribbean this year versus Europe and the Med, it was the reverse last year and it was also the reverse capacity situation.","So I guess the question is how do we know that the, I don't know that the underperformance of Europe is a function of macro rather than just may be getting too much capacity versus what we saw last year? And I guess longer term, how do we think about the right amount of capacity growth in Europe versus the Caribbean?","Arnold Donald","So first of all I think capacity in Europe is going to be about 6%, but that's nowhere near with the capacity increase was in the Caribbean last year was up more than double digit was dramatic increase in capacity in the Caribbean last year.","And so that\u2019s two very different scenarios and when you talk about Europe, you\u2019ve got the Mediterranean and Northern Europe whereas in Caribbean, you got the Caribbean as Eastern and Western, but it's still just Caribbean.","So there are two very different situations. So the issues in Continental Europe we don\u2019t believe our capacity driven, there are different issues, the reality is that the macroeconomic situation there and then the geopolitical issues that have popped up have certainly tempered the results there. still strong but it tempered the results.","And coming into next year well, we're going to be down in capacity ourselves in the Caribbean a couple of points. Overall the industry will be up in the Caribbean actually but nowhere near where it was last year in terms of increase and obviously we have a much stronger base of guests now to fill those ships than we did a year ago, when that we had a huge capacity influx for the Caribbean and we will see what happens in Europe but probably a little bit of easing of capacity.","I think the big issue there is just letting the time go by and continue to create demand in Europe and manage through some of these geopolitical tensions and get through and there are always going to be issues somewhere in the world, that's the beauty of our business.","We can move our capacity and we do have a broad portfolio especially for us as a company to buffer a lot of these things. But I don\u2019t want to understate the performance of Europe given the dynamics, but the dynamics are not comparable to what they were in the Caribbean last year.","David Bernstein","If you think about the longer term I think we talked about this either on the last call or December, I can\u2019t remember, our capacity growth on a compounded annual basis from 14 to 18 is only 2.9%.","And if you take into account all the announcements we've made to date and there will be more announcements of ships going to China, the compounded annual growth rate for that four-year periods for North America would be 1% and Europe would be 2%.","And so the growth rate as I think Arnold has indicated before are very measured particularly in the established markets and so China is growing and for all the reasons Arnold talked about before we believe it's going to be a fabulous market for us over time with measured capacity growth in the existing markets. And that bode well. Thank you.","James Hardiman","Got it. Thanks guys.","David Bernstein","And I think at this point, operator we will take one more question.","Operator","Perfect. Our final question comes from the line of Edward Friedman with McLean & Partners. Please go ahead.","Edward Friedman","Hello thank you taking my question. You guys talked about increasing capacity in the next couple of years, I was wondering you guys also talked about relative scarcity and I was wondering how does that jive together like if you increasing your ALBDs through the more shifts, how does that create the scarcity that you talked about?","Arnold Donald","Yes I think first of all overall the capacity growth for the industry is in the 4% to 5% range and our capacity growth along with vessels that we take out of service is going to be less than that. So we are totally focused on measured capacity growth.","And we feel that with China in particular but even without China and the existing markets that that level of growth as long as we're creating demand because we're still relatively low penetrated as an industry as cruise industry in the overall vacation market that there is ample opportunity to create the relative scarcity to get yields off over time and to have them be up and still the greatest vacation value there is while providing the greatest vacation experience there.","So we are quite confident for ourselves and for the industry that we can create a relative scarcity that will bode well for the future.","Edward Friedman","Have you seen that the industry is also doing the same thing?","Arnold Donald","I overall would say yes. It's being demonstrated today. As you can see the results we are achieving we're out 25%, '14 over '13 our guidance to be up 25% in this year and that's not from 25% added capacity obviously.","And so we are in a process of demonstrating it. We certainly have plans in place and for making the investment to continue to do so.","You'd have to talk to the other companies how they see it, but our perception we're one of every two people who cruise in the world. So we're relatively reasonable Bellwether for the overall industry and we see it as a strong industry for years to come.","Edward Friedman","Thank you.","Arnold Donald","Thank you very much for your questions everyone and for being online. We had a strong quarter. We are confident in our guidance going forward. And we look forward to delivering results and ultimately delivering the double-digit return on invested capital the next three to four years. Thank you."],"4382":["Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) Q1 2019 Earnings Conference Call March 26, 2019 10:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Arnold Donald - CEO","David Bernstein - CFO","Conference Call Participants","Robin Farley - UBS","Steve Wieczynski - Stifel","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays","Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet","David Beckel - Bernstein Research","James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo Securities","Brandt Montour - JPMorgan","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research","Assia Georgieva - Infinity Research","Arnold Donald","Good morning, everyone and welcome to our first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. I'm Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation and PLC. Today, I'm joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison, as well as David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer, and Beth Roberts, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you all for joining us this morning. ","Before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking. Therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statements in today's press release.","We delivered first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.49. That's higher than the midpoint of December guidance by $0.07 per share and $0.03 per share lower than last year, which includes the $0.03 drag from fuel and currency. For the full year, we're updating our adjusted earnings guidance range previously $4.50 to $4.80, now $4.35 to $4.55 to reflect the significant drag from fueling currency moving against us, impacting our full year by $155 million or $0.22 per share since the time of our December guidance. ","Our guidance reflects continued improvement in operating performance. And we are maintaining the operational guidance we gave for the year with an update for changes in fuel prices and currency. Included in the midpoint of our guidance is $0.25 per share earnings growth from operations over the prior year, which is a reflection of our 120,000 plus employees who go above and beyond every day, as well as hundreds of thousands of travel professionals who support our world leading cruise brands. ","It is their combined efforts that are helping us to once again withstand multiple headwinds, including cyclones in Australia, Brexit uncertainty in the UK, heightened political uncertainty in Germany and France as well as ongoing economic believes in much of Europe, including Italy. Despite those headwinds, wave season was consistent with the strength of demand we experienced going into the year, building further confidence in our full year revenue expectations. ","For our North America and Australia brands, NAA, our book position is ahead of the prior year at higher prices, while our EA brands are well ahead of the prior year at lower prices. Our brands are strong and growing, including Continental Europe, where we continue to expect revenue growth driven by double digit capacity increases. We remain confident, we are on a path that includes delivering over time, double digit earnings growth and elevated sustained double digit return on invested capital through a consistent strategy of creating demand in excess of measured capacity growth, while leveraging our industry leading scale. ","While our strategy is consistent, over time, the relative contribution from the components of our earnings models, as we updated previously, may change a bit. Going forward, our earnings growth will include a higher contribution from capacity growth. That increase in capacity will lend itself to more predictable revenue growth and enable us to better contain costs, in essence, enhancing the reliability of future earnings growth. There are multiple factors that we put in place over the years to ensure sustained earnings growth and improvement in return on invested capital. ","For example, reducing our fuel exposure. This year, our unit fuel consumption will be down nearly 4%, bringing the cumulative unit fuel reduction to 33% compared to our 2007 baseline. Our ongoing efforts to leverage our scale through global sourcing has taken over $350 million of non-fuel costs out of the business so far. A higher weighting of fixed rate debt, historically low rates reduces interest rate exposure. ","Our consistently strong balance sheet and credit ratings ensures through our access to $11 billion of committed export credit facilities that we will be able to comfortably meet future capital needs, while further heightening our relentless focus on driving continuous improvements in health, environment, safety and security. Of course, our ongoing new build program is integral to the growth in earnings and return on invested capital over time. Not only are our new builds on average roughly 15% to 25% more cost efficient and approximately 25% to 30% more fuel efficient, they also help to create further demand for cruising. ","And we're introducing several exciting new ships this year, we just took delivery of cost of Costa Venezia, purposely designed to offer our Chinese guests the best of Italy. The ship introduces Italian culture and lifestyle with interiors inspired by the City of Venice, including authentic envelopes, retail shop featuring iconic Italian brands and of course battalion cuisine, while at the same time offering mini conference at home like Chinese style karaoke and food options that are popular in China. This ship is currently on its maiden voyage along the Silk Route before beginning services in Shanghai from mid May onward. Half of Venezia is just another step in the growth of a strong and sustainable cruise industry in china.","Late this year, we will welcome three more investments to our portfolio of leading brands. Throughout the year, we're ramping up ahead of these deliveries and expect to reap the benefits in 2020. In October, Sky Princess, the first new build activated with MedallionClass, lending many processed hallmarks with new guest experience features like Sky Suites, the largest Balconies SC as well as the brand new jazz experience. Sky Princess is nearly sold out for this fall fault and booked 40 percentage points ahead for the one at Caribbean in 2020, all at consistently higher rates. ","Costa Esmeralda also expected to enter service late this year was designed to celebrate the Sardinian culture, serving Continental Europe, including Italy, France and Spain. Booking trends for Costa Esmeralda are also reflecting strong demand and capturing a double digit price premium. And last but not least, in December, Carnival Cruise Line will launch its new flagship, Carnival Panorama, their first new ship home port on the West Coast. Bookings are ahead, more than double digits in both rate and occupancy in 2020 compared to the same itinerary in 2019. Our marketing efforts on the West Coast and including the Carnival AirShip and the Rose Parade have generated over 1 billion media impressions and are attracting a broad audience, particularly those new to cruise.","Bookings for Mardi Gras to be delivered in August 2020 in the first and the new generation of ships of the Carnival brand were opened this past quarter. Mardi Gras generated record looking for new ship launch by the Carnival brand, with almost 10 times the number of bookings as the very strong Carnival Vista launched back in 2016. And with more than 65,000 guests pre-registering in advance of the inventory event opening, overall, Carnival continues to outperform in the Caribbean with bookings ahead in both occupancy and rate across all future quarters.","In April, we will welcome the totally transformed Carnival Sunrise, after undergoing nearly a $200 million dry dock, adding all the culinary and entertainment experiences, Fun Ship 2.0 is non-core, such as [indiscernible] barbecue smokehouse and outdoor fun with SportSquare, Water Works and serenity adult only retreat. All of these new features are resonating well with the brand's guests, with bookings for Carnival Sunrise up double digits in both occupancy and price.","Roll out continues on OceanMedallion. The Medallion class experience is now a full ship active on two vessels with a third ready to go, but it's still early. There are many features available through Ocean that guests have not yet become familiar with to take full advantage. While we continue to garner innovation accolades, including IoT wearables, innovation of the year and finalists for the prestigious Edison awards, clearly, the most important impact is on our guests and on our bottom line.","And while still early to determine the impact on earnings, guest satisfaction scores for Medallion class are consistently among the highest in the Princess fleet. Since the announcement of full activation on the two Princess ships late last year, we believe medallion class has garnered increased demand, which we expect will drive yield. Additional ships are expected to come online later this year as medallion class expands across the Princess fleet. ","So while early, indicators are very, very positive. But there were many marketing and public relations efforts that kicked off during wave season that generate demand and excess measured capacity growth and continue our momentum. In the US, Holland America captured over 4 billion media impressions around get away cruise and the naming ceremony for new [indiscernible]. For Carnival Cruise Lines, the new roller coaster experience of Mardi Gras alone generate over 1 billion media impressions.","Our award winning proprietary television programs have now reached more than 525 million views cumulatively. One of the programs, Ocean Treks with Jeff Corwin, has just been nominated for the two MEs. In Europe, Costa launched a new marketing program with Penelope Cruz, which has been well received and is outperforming all previous brand campaigns. All told, our brands captured 75% of the positive coverage for our industry so far this year, five times that of our closest peer.","We also made meaningful progress this past quarter, putting on industry leading scale to work. As you know, yielded our revenue management to deploy on six of our brands, we believe we will continue to drive incremental revenue, particularly in the second half of 2019 and beyond. On the cost side, we remain committed to deliver nearly a point of cost savings this year, helping to mitigate inflation and contributing to our cost guidance above just 50 basis points for the year. ","Our fleet replenishment efforts are purposely designed to achieve greater economies. We will welcome 17 larger, more efficient ships and continue to divest our less efficient ships, representing net capacity growth of approximately 5% compounded annually through 2022. We've been consistent with our execution around measured capacity growth. Overall, we operate an industry that is both under penetrated and capacity constrained, which bodes well for creating new demand in excess of capacity increases. That should allow us to continue to fill our ship at increasingly attractive rates while still providing a better value relative to the equivalent land based alternatives.","During the quarter, we also completed additional share repurchases of $266 million, bringing the cumulative total to nearly $5 billion since 2015. This share repurchase of course is in addition to our recurring dividend distributions. We remain on track to deliver our full year guidance as we continue with sustained double digit return on invested capital and continued growth in both earnings and returns over time.","And we actually don't need things to be very different in order to deliver sustained double digit earnings growth. Even with minimal yield increases, the capacity we have coming online and the inherent efficiencies and scale advantages we gained from that capacity will help to contain costs and enable us to achieve double digit earnings growth and elevated return on invested capital.","Having said that, of course, we will continue to work to create excess demand, over our measured capacity growth to produce even stronger results. ","With that, I'd like to turn the call to David.","David Bernstein","Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I'll start today with a summary of our 2019 first quarter results. Then I'll provide an update on current booking trends for the remaining three quarters of 2019 and finish up with some additional color on our 2019 March guidance. As Arnold indicated, our adjusted EPS for the first quarter was $0.49. This was $0.07 above the midpoint of our December guidance. The improvement was driven by two things, $0.02 of favorability in net cruise revenue, and $0.06 of favorability in net cruise costs without fuel and other expense items, mainly due to timing between the quarters. Both favorable items were partially offset by a $0.01 unfavorable net impact from fuel pricing currency.","Now, let's look at our first quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 4.1%. Our North America and Australia segment or commonly known as our NAA brands was up 5%, while our Europe and Asia segment more commonly known as our EA brand was up 2.5%. Our total net revenue yields were up 0.5%.","Now, let's break apart the two components of net revenue yield. Net ticket yields were down 0.4%. Our NAA brands were flat, while our EA brands were down 0.7%. Both segments had tough prior year comparison. However, I did want to note that Caribbean yields turned positive in the first quarter on an 8% capacity increase, also against tough prior year comparisons. Net on board and other yields increased 3.1% with similar increases on both sides of the Atlantic.","In summary, our first quarter adjusted EPS was $0.03 lower than last year, as a result of the net impact of fuel pricing currency costing $0.03, with small operational pluses and minuses offsetting each other.","Turning to 2019 booking trends, as Arnold indicated, wave season was consistent with the strength in demand we experienced going into the year. Booking volumes for the remaining three quarters of 2019 have been running ahead of the prior year at prices that are in line with last year. Let's not forget that this wave season activity is on top of two consecutive years of record wave season.","While prices on overall bookings during wave season are in line with the prior year, prices for our NAA brands were higher, but were offset by our EA brands, driven by their sourcing in Continental Europe. At this point in time, cumulative advanced bookings for the remaining three quarters of 2019 are ahead of the prior year at prices that are in line with last year. ","Now, let's drill down into the cumulative book position for 2019. Cumulative advanced bookings for our NAA brands are ahead of the prior year on both occupancy and price, driven by nicely higher prices in the Caribbean and the seasonal European program, while prices in Alaska are lower than last year's record levels. Cumulative advanced bookings for our EA brands are well ahead of the prior year at lower prices, again, driven by our EA brand sourcing in Continental Europe. ","During the last year, we have made revenue management decisions, which we believe will optimize our net revenue yield growth for 2019. In fact, even with an overall 4.6% capacity increase, we have less inventory remaining for sale than we had at this time last year. ","Finally, I want to provide you with some additional color on 2019. Our adjusted EPS guidance for 2019 is $4.35 to $4.55 versus $4.26 for 2018. The midpoint of our March guidance is $0.20 less than the midpoint of our December guidance, driven by the net impact of fuel pricing currency costing $0.22. We expect higher fuel prices will cost us an additional $0.28, while we are forecasting to benefit from currency movement by $0.06. ","In addition, we flow through the $0.02 revenue beat from the first quarter. All other operational changes were small and netted out. One final note for those of you who are trying to forecast the remaining quarters of 2019, we expect most of the 2019 adjusted EPS improvement versus 2018 to occur in the third quarter, which has the easiest prior year yield comparison. ","And now, I'll turn the call back over to Arnold.","Arnold Donald","Thank you, David. Operator, please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin Farley","Great, thank you. And just had a question on the guidance. I think you had previously said that you expected Q2 yield growth would have been higher than Q1 yield growth. And I know Q1 came in higher than flat, but Q2 guidance seems to not be ahead of the prior guidance, either for Q1? I wondered if you could talk a little bit about, because it sounded like the trends in wave season have been like consistent and how you expected, but maybe it sounds like Q2 wasn't as strong as what you had thought three months ago.","Arnold Donald","Hey, good morning, Robin. It\u2019s good to see you in front of the queue again.","David Bernstein","So, Robin, when we put together our December guidance, the numbers were relatively close, some of it was driven by the -- in the first quarter, but the improvement that we saw, 3.1% increase in on-boarding other revenue, those numbers are very difficult to pinpoint each quarter. So overall, we are -- we started out the year with about flat, first half of the year, we beat the first quarter and we didn't see anything changing significantly in the second quarter. So we just maintain the flat yield guidance for the second quarter. The difference between the quarters at all and we're just not that good for a half a point between the first quarter and the second quarter.","Robin Farley","So, was the upside though in Q1 mostly came from the onboard and obviously you don't have the advanced visibility on that. Is there anything about the itinerary differences or anything that or trends that -- are you just saying, just assuming that the onboard upside won't happen in Q2 until you actually see it? Maybe that -- is that how to think about?","David Bernstein","Yeah. So, you know that, overall for the year, I think I said in December, we guide to approximately 2% in onboard overall. The number isn\u2019t exactly 2% by quarter, but the overall is approximately 2%. And as I said before, it's very difficult to say exactly what comes in, the itineraries in the markets are very different. There are lots of other programs we can roll out. And we continue to see a strong trend in onboard revenue, and we hope we can do better -- continue to do better in future quarters as well.","Arnold Donald","I think Robin, just the overall guidance for the year just reinforces what we've seen so far. It just gives us confidence on the guidance we've given for the year and we certainly don't see any weakening or anything like that in terms of yield.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Wieczynski with Stifel.","Steve Wieczynski","So I guess the first question would be around Europe and maybe if you could help us think that market today versus where you were back in December and I guess, what I'm getting at is the things over there gotten better, have they stayed the same or have certain markets weakened and maybe also if you could talk about the promotional environment over there as well.","Arnold Donald","First of all, as you know, we've got double digit capacity increase in Europe in kind of uneven economic environment. But the reality is, the bookings are strong and we're doing some proactive management. Our yield management teams have decided to be way ahead on occupancy relative, given the capacity increases. And so hopefully we'll have an opportunity to deliver flattish yields or whatever for the course of the year, but the most important thing is to grow earnings. And we are anticipating earnings growth in Europe with the combination of what's going on, but right now we feel solid in where we are. We feel confident and strong again with the guidance and with the fact we're going to grow earnings.","David Bernstein","I don't think anything materially changed from our viewpoint in December if anything, it\u2019s probably a tad better in Europe. We did split the world that I talked about the NAA brands being at higher prices and the EA brands, their book position being at lower prices. So, if you look at our overall yield guidance for the year, it really is a tale of two different worlds. The NAA brands are probably looking at guidance for the year that\u2019s probably double our overall corporate guidance, whereas for our EA brands, you're looking at sort of flattish overall yields built in, and that's how you get to the combined 1%. But nothing has materially changed since December, like I said, probably a tad better than we anticipated.","Steve Wieczynski","And that kind of goes into my second question, David, I guess, I guess one of the questions we've gotten a lot is, so then why would your yield guidance for the year kind of be unchanged, given the 50 basis point beat you had in the first quarter, it seems like the feedback we've gotten from your competitors and the trade relating to wave has been extremely, extremely strong. So what's kind of holding you back from pushing that yield guidance a little bit higher right now?","David Bernstein","So the higher yield guidance in the first quarter was worth $0.02. You're just talking about $0.02 in EPS overall. And so there's still a lot left to go and the uncertainty in onboard and other, and so at this point in time, we're maintaining our guidance for the year operationally overall. There's a lot of other unknown factors, hurricane seasons and lots of other things out there. So we always provide for that and hopefully we have a good hurricane season. But we're in a good well booked position as we had indicated, we\u2019re ahead of the prior year on increased -- 4.6% increase capacity and we feel very good about our overall situation.","Arnold Donald","We have less volume to go now than we had this time last year, even with the overall capacity increase. So that's, again, reinforcing what you just said, a very strong indicator of successful demand creation, but we're really focused on earnings and I understand people look at yields and it's really difficult to do these comparisons because you had a basketball, orange and a ping pong ball in terms of theirs. And, the comparisons aren't that meaningful because we have such a different mix. We have nine brands with, some are below the fleet average, some are above and so on and so forth. So those are difficult things as we focus on the earnings, growing earnings are growing return on invested capital. But, again, you're right. Things have been strong. And what we have a ways to go when that all the way through yet and we're just as always allowing for things to happen, because there have been headwinds, and there will probably be few shares at once.","Operator","Our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix","So David, when we look out to the rest of the year, and we think through the second half, just by doing the math, the net yields need to be up a couple hundred basis points, to get to your full year, but at the same time, we're seeing kind of a mix of Europe go up. I know, some of it is your kind of NAA type of seasonal Europe, but we're also seeing your European centric capacity also mixed up. So I'm just wondering if you can kind of help us think through the second half, given the deployment and where Europe falls in that.","David Bernstein","So, for the second half of the year, obviously, given the first quarter yield, and the second quarter guidance, the second quarter clearly is going to be up over 1% in order to get to the first half, sorry, second half over 1%, in order to get to the average for the year of 1%. That is a combination of onboard as well as ticket in the back half of the year. And, we are, when we look at the overall booking trends, particularly in our NAA brands, which I said we're ahead at higher prices, we are seeing that being reflected in the numbers and we feel confident that we can achieve that. The EA brands are off setting some of that, as we had talked about over the last couple of quarters.","Felicia Hendrix","And then can you just talk about Alaska, because it seems like there's -- it's been a bit of a change in what you're seeing there since the last quarter. I think last, on the last call, you said pricing was flat and now you're saying that pricing is down in Alaska. So can you just walk us through what's unfolding there?","David Bernstein","Yeah, I mean, we are seeing -- we do have 17 ships in Alaska. We've got an 8% capacity increase. There are, overall, when you put it all together, the book position, we did say was down versus pricing in line, but keep in mind in December, it was very, very early for Alaska. As you get into wave season, you see a much more substantial portion of Alaska being booked. And -- but remember that 2018 was record pricing in Alaska. And so overall, we feel very good about our pricing it, for the various brands we have up there.","Felicia Hendrix","And just last thing on just the base loading strategy that you're employing in the","EA region. And then also, you didn't really comment on the UK. So I was wondering, because your competitors have talked about seeing some volatility there. So hoping you could talk about the UK also, but in the base loading that you're seeing there, have you been able to kind of see any kind of increase in pricing as you get closer to the cruises, in other words, to the actual specific -- in other words, has your base building strategy kind of been successful? And then if you could just comment on UK?","David Bernstein","Sure. So the revenue management strategy we feel has been very successful that we're optimizing the yield for 2019 in total. As I said in my prepared remarks, we did make some revenue management decisions over the last year. We were ahead, in some cases, we were considerably ahead and we have been seeing good improvement close in and overtime.","And as far as the UK is concerned, we had said, as Arnold said, there is uncertainty relating to Brexit. The UK is doing okay. But clearly had it not been for the uncertainty, we probably would have done perhaps a little bit better in the UK. It's really hard to \u2013 you will never know for sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Harry Curtis with Nomura Instinet.","Harry Curtis","I wish I could diversify the line of questioning here. My apologies. I'm wondering about any -- do you have any evidence of improved pricing sequentially, as we look ahead into Europe and Alaska this summer for the balance of the -- for the inventory that you haven't sold, are you seeing some beginning trends in rising sequential pricing for any given week or any given itinerary?","Arnold Donald","I would say it\u2019s a couple of things. First of all, when you think about the comparisons to prior year, we had tougher comparisons early. So the second half comparisons are not as difficult. So when we start talking and comparing yields first half, second half, you've got a plus from that. In terms of pure pricing, our revenue yield sciences and deploying yield and all the tools we\u2019re using, they're constantly chasing what's going to create the optimal outcome. And that varies by brand, by itinerary and is built up itinerary by itinerary. So the simple answer to your question is, of course, we're seeing pricing strengthening, as you get close in. Of course, you are. And so we also are saying we're going to have second half yield much strong than the first half yield. ","But what we're really saying is we're going to drive earnings and earnings are going to grow this year and in the future, they're going to grow double digit on average, earnings are going to grow this year at single digits, we're working hard to make sure we do even better. And we're going to elevate return on invested capital. So that's the real message but the yield story for us is relatively complex. We've got luxury brands, premium brands, we have nine brands, , different world markets, et cetera. And even when within a brand, there can be yield improvement, it can weigh down the average to our corporation if that brand is below the fleet average. So, it's a complex thing. But overall, the simple answer to your question is, of course, we see strengthening as we close in, we've got less the book.","Harry Curtis","So, I guess it's the sort of the same question repackaged. I'm wondering what level of confidence do you have, particularly in the EA brands that, as we get closer to the third quarter, and that there's a low risk of you having to do some incremental promotion and pricing coming down?","Arnold Donald","We have less to sell. So I think we're in good shape now. And Europe, it had been all along, it\u2019s just, again, we are along our original guidance there. We -- nothing has weakened or worsened or anything like that.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Beckel with Bernstein Research.","David Beckel","I'm hearing a lot of emphasis on earnings growth for the long term, and sort of how the revenue management system plays into that. But if my math is correct, it looks like even ex-fuel and 4x, you're looking at sort of 6-ish percent EPS growth this year. So I guess in light of what you've done with your revenue management strategy this year, which is to emphasize, I guess, stability and confidence, how should we, as investors, expect EPS growth to improve going forward? Is it really just European structural weaknesses here or is this lower for longer something that we should expect going forward?","Arnold Donald","Okay, so let's just focus on earnings, because that's a good part. So if you look at the 5%, 6%, that\u2019s directionally accurate with what you calculated. We obviously, this year, we have some shifts coming in late in the year. We've got anticipated increased levels of capacity coming for the next several years. So we've obviously, from a cost standpoint, spent more this year in advance of actually having the capacity, what it will take for us to do double digit, I think 1% of yield is equal to something like 25% of earnings per share increase and 1% of cost. It's like 3%. So some combination of one more percent in yield or less and 1% better cost performance was, we are directionally capable of doing or even better, and you're at a double digit earnings growth with the capacity we have. ","And so, that's why we have the confidence we have, we understand what's happened with the business, but there's not like structural weakness, when you use those kinds of words, the fact is we've got double digit capacity increase in Europe and the ships are being filled and they're actually ahead on the booking, we've got significant capacity increase in other markets without going in and we don't give guidance by market stuff. But historically, what's happened so far and what we're anticipating, Caribbean is super strong, NAA brands are strong. So there's no real structural weakness, it\u2019s just dynamics and artifacts of when you bring in capacity, how you spend in advance, prepare all of that. Meanwhile, we're still growing earnings now.","David Beckel","So just a side question attached to that then, if, say, Europe is sort of stabilized for the rest of the year, the expectation I think from your point would be the yield up as you go along. How much sort of upside could we expect from the sort of base loading strategy as that, if that were to materialize throughout the year?","Arnold Donald","I think, again, the guidance we\u2019re giving you for the year reflects what we think at this point in time our best guess for the results would be. And so we fact it all things in to our guidance, including knowing there's going to be some headwinds that we haven't seen yet or whatever has happened every year and it's already happened this past quarter. And so we\u2019ll work hard to beat the guidance, like we always do, but I think the guidance is reflective of what we anticipate Europe, North American and globally.","David Beckel","And just one quick follow on, there's some concern about the Costa brand and MSC\u2019s introduction of new capacity this year and then going forward. Are you seeing a fairly competitive dynamic from MSC, particularly in Europe as it affects Costa?","Arnold Donald","While, we typically feel that the brands are pretty independent of each other and other cruise companies, we need them to fill their ships and fill them early because there is something that relates in the marketplace, with just the psychology of pricing and that can be a cap on what you can achieve, based on what other companies are charging in the marketplace or whatever. ","So, having said that, if there is a brand that has a competitive set because of the source market and the proximity, I would say MSC and Costa would probably be the closest to having some significant overlap in competitiveness versus say most of the other brands compared to any of the other brands. But having said that, we feel confident at Costa. We see opportunity from an operational standpoint to grow earnings this year. We have some capacity increase in Costa that is not new build this year and past European part of the business. But next year, we've got Costa Smeralda coming in, she's booked great. So for, I mean, very strong, double digit kind of improvement opportunity there. And so we see Costa being strong and looking forward to the brand, continuing to perform well and perform even better going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Hardiman with Wedbush Securities.","James Hardiman","I wanted to ask a little bit about some of the practical implications of Brexit. We're hearing from various consumers that currency and sort of passport issues are sort of their primary travel related concerns, can you maybe speak to those things and correct me if I'm wrong, but if I'm a British passenger, I don't need to worry about fluctuating currencies, if I'm taking one of your ships from the UK.","And then secondly, with passports, I know there's a lot of confusion and I know that the British government is trying to get out in front of that. Are there any practical passport issues associated with the various potential outcomes of Brexit as we move forward?","Arnold Donald","Okay, so more broadly, even though there's been uncertainty around Brexit and so on and so forth, the UK brands are doing well and have withstood the headwind, we will have to keep monitoring to see what kind of long term effect specific to you two questions on currency and passport, on the currency side, without PNO brand is British based, a 10 pound sterling, et cetera. So, obviously, no impact there and it's 98%, British guest sailing on PNO on the UK for us. So there that one is fine. Cunard is a British based brand, but it is a global international brand, it has a number of British guests on it, but it has -- every sailing has guests from all around the world. And it's not pound sterling based, so there's some currency potential impacts there depending on fluctuations either way.","On the passport issue, I'm not familiar with the details there, but I don't see -- I haven't heard anything from anyone to indicate any extra complications or major problems or where would be a discouragement to cruise or anything like that. So, I don't know the details, but I have heard nothing that would suggest it\u2019s a problem at all for us.","James Hardiman","I guess what I was just getting at there, it seems like maybe cruises is a more favorable way to travel, given what's going on than sort of going on your own with?","Arnold Donald","Cruise is our more favorite way to travel on the surface.","David Bernstein","Certainly, I think your point that you're trying to make is if you compare it to a land based vacation, particularly in the UK, they're paying in British pounds, and it's British pounds on board. So there is less uncertainty, relative to the currency movement and -- versus taking a land based alternative. ","James Hardiman","That's exactly what I was getting at. And then sort of the second question here, you've talked about the significant capacity increases in Europe as one of the reasons why you're booking ahead but at lower prices. I guess if we peel that back a little bit between the new capacity coming online in Europe versus some of the older ships, anecdotally, when you talk about the new ships, it seems like the pricing there is really good. So, what's happening there, is it that the new ships are sort of cannibalizing and oh, that's a bad word, the older ships in Europe from a pricing perspective or are they both maybe feeling the impacts of higher capacity and maybe economy concerns?","Arnold Donald","In this particular year, there are no new builds. And what would I look? So either we have significant new builds there, but it's not cannibalizing or anything, but in terms of Costa, the new build is not coming until almost the end of this fiscal year. So and IUDO, we have a number of new ships and IUDI is a strong performer overall and we don't have any new ships in this year and PNO.","David Bernstein","Arnold said in his prepared remarks, I mean, the ongoing economic malaise in Continental Europe and all of the heightened political uncertainty in Germany and France is clearly affecting our overall market in Continental Europe.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities.","Tim Conder","Thank you and thank you for the color on Europe overall. So I mean, just to summarize that, it sounds like the UK, little lumpiness with Brexit, but doing okay, so far. Germany continues to do well, and then the Southern European economy is still ongoing, being the most relevant drag. Is that a pretty fair characterization?","David Bernstein","It's reasonably fair directionally.","Tim Conder","Okay.","Arnold Donald","The reason is, we don't give guidance by brands or markets and stuff. So, that\u2019s the only reason why you\u2019re hearing the directional comments, but go ahead please.","Tim Conder","Okay. Shifting further EU, just it\u2019s not a large market, but important long term and thrown in with your commentary was Asia. Just any additional color on China in particular, given the ongoing trade issues and just what you're saying year-over-year, over the last 90 days, have that trended better or worse, about the same. And then on Medallion, the success that you're having on the ships that it's on, is there a way that you can accelerate that either via Medallion or other methods to further gain those benefits, so the customer experience and higher onboard spending? Any additional color you could provide there?","Arnold Donald","Okay, thank you. So first of all, in China, it's still a very small part of our business, we're excited about the Costa Venezia going over to join the Costa fleet in China. Overall, things are strengthening there. There's less capacity expansion than it's been in previous years. And we've expanded our distribution approach and we\u2019ve had success with that. And so, things are strengthening. Our philosophy there remains the same, that we see it as accretive overall as long as it\u2019s accretive, a ship will be there. If it's not accretive, we would move it and so, generally speaking, China in particular is definitely strengthening from yield standpoint, et cetera, all that. But we think this could be choppy for a while and so we always prepare to do whatever we need to do right now. We think Venezia in particular is going to strengthen the Cruise in China, period, and definitely be an enhancement to our fleet. And right now, things are going well.","With regards to OceanMedallion class, we\u2019re very pleased with where we are, we have the Caribbean Princess, Regal Princess and Royal princess are all now up and running. Caribbean Princess is probably the most fully activated with many other features capable and ocean being available to the guests. Regal is not quite as far along and Royal, which is on the West Coast right now is just beginning to ramp up. So we see great results, as I mentioned, in terms of guest experience and attitude. We have several more ships that will be brought up to speed and those others will get more of the features the rest of the year. ","But, it is new and we want to experience it and we want to make certain that in the end, it is driving not just kind of nice conversation, but also driving the improvements from both a revenue generating standpoint and cost standpoint and a crew experience standpoint. And it looks very, very positive, but it's new and we think we need to win out in a race. We don't have to -- Princess is doing fine, as the other brands, all the other brands have innovations on the way as well that are different. But we're excited about it, but we'll take our time and once we fully activate it, see where we are and one thing we are expanding is the fastest Internet FC, which is Medallion that, which is part of the overall ocean platform, but it's not dependent on the ocean platform. And that's been a huge hit with guests and crew. And so that's something we are more rapidly expanding in the fleet.","Tim Conder","Okay. And then one final if I may, Australia, I think David, you alluded to that, given the recent hurricanes, a little bit of disruption, anything that was material, I guess, quantifiable there from that?","David Bernstein","Yeah, we're just talking about a couple of million dollars. It was probably six cruises that were impacted, but nothing material, just your normal. Brisbane was impacted by the hurricane and some ships came in late in your normal occurrence.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brandt Montour with JPMorgan.","Brandt Montour","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. On the back of that question about China, I was just curious on the Venezia, which historically it's been difficult to get Chinese consumers to spend onboard at least the same level as we do here in the West, but realizing it's just in its main voyage now, what have you done differently with that hardware, with that in mind, and\/or is it more of kind of an evolution for you in China to mostly change the distribution side of things?","Arnold Donald","Well, a lot of things have to be developed in China, because it's an embryonic market, but in terms of the ship itself, we have some fabulous features on this ship. We've got some really customized gaming venues, which we think it will keep, we have fabulous karaoke area, which we think is going to be a very nice revenue generator for the ship. We have a module area on the ship, which again, could be another good revenue generator. So there are a number of things. In addition, some of the specialty restaurants, we have a hot top restaurant on board for the comfort food that they were like, and so there's quite a number of revenue generating features on the ship that we think will help drive onboard. ","David Bernstein","And there's also significantly more retail space and chops on board, which is a significant contributor to onboard revenue in that market, high end chops in particular.","Brandt Montour","And then apologies, one more Europe question, if I may. David, you mentioned Europe obviously sort of unchanged, perhaps a tad better, would it be possible to just break out that last part into ticket versus onboard in what you're seeing?","David Bernstein","Oh, when I said tad better, I was just referring to the overall booking situation of what I expected in Europe versus, in December versus what we've actually seen happen over the last three months. It's small movements and clearly it's been, like I said, it's had positive, but nothing that is significantly to our guidance at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research.","Jared Shojaian","Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. As we look forward to next year, you're selling two lower yielding cost of ships and you have a lot of capacity coming on, particularly with higher yielding Princess ships. So are you expecting hardware to be mix positive to yield in 2020? Is that your assumption?","David Bernstein","So for 2020, we haven't given out any particular guidance, but I think we\u2019ve said overall in the past, that given the size of our company, any mix overall on a yield perspective for the overall corporation tends to be rather small in our overall numbers. So, but we will analyze that as we go forward into 2020 and we prepare guidance, and we'll let you know if anything changes.","Jared Shojaian","Okay. And I know you're talking about longer term double digit earnings growth, and I know you're not giving any guidance beyond 2019. But was there any reason why we shouldn't be thinking in terms of 2020 being double digit earnings growth, and I think just to make the math work in order to get there, you're going to have to see better yields and better cost performance than what you're seeing this year. So, maybe you can just talk to that a little bit? Is that your expectation? And I guess, really, how should we think about that? ","Arnold Donald","Well, as I mentioned, we've had some pre-spend to prepare for the capacity coming not just in 2020, but beyond. And that won't be repeating itself going forward. So, there's clearly some opportunity with cost plus the fact that as you bring the new ships on, they\u2019re inherently more efficient, et cetera. So -- and with the scale, you're leveraging, you\u2019re amortizing across more scale. So all of that bodes well for the cost picture. That's number one. ","Number two, we're still focused on creating demand. And again, we're not giving guidance to a 2020 or anything, but as you look at things like the brands that are bringing the ships in and the relative pricing and itineraries and so on and so forth, along with the demand creation, things we're doing, we see opportunity. ","But the really important thing here is, we don't need a lot to be very different to generate, we are engineering and purposely intentionally on a path to double digit earnings growth on average year in and year out and elevated sustained double digit return on invested capital. And so we don't need a lot to be very different. We don't need to dramatically change anything. If we just execute where we're headed, that's what we'll see. And whether it is or isn't in a given year, on average, it will be, but can be influenced by fuel and currency and other things, but operationally, we definitely are on a path to deliver.","Jared Shojaian","And one more, a follow up to that if I may. Are you expecting to get a fuel expense benefit in 2020, just from lower IFO fuel prices from IMO 2020? And then there's been some recent news just on closed loop versus open loop scrubbers and sort of how that debate is going to play out with just some of the regulatory pressure. Would love to get your take on that and just sort of understand how you could be potentially negatively affected by that closed loop versus open loop debate?","Arnold Donald","Yeah, I think I'll do the open loop close loop first. For us, we have now third party data, including the Government of Japan did their own studies and everything. So, we have plenty of information to provide to courts around the world and authorities around the world that show that open loop is a very effective way to have advanced air quality, systems operate and so we're confident with that. We know there have been some isolated ports that made decisions I think with the information we have and we can provide, we're optimistic. We\u2019re prepared either way to be honest, not so much we can go closed loop versus open loop, but in terms of number of ports now, have court ironing, and we plug in any way and so on. So, there's so many dynamics there, we fact all possibilities into our remodeling and we're confident going forward.","In terms of fuel prices, the oil companies can\u2019t say where the fuel prices are going to be. So I'll let David, he might be able to, I don't know, David, go ahead.","David Bernstein","No, I won't try to predict the price of HFO or bunker or MGL for 2020. But, we have said that in 2019, about 80% of our consumption is bunker and 20% is MGL. We've also indicated that as we move into 2020, we do expect to see about a third of our consumption be MGL. So, it's really hard to tell. Most people are expecting a increase in MGL and a reduction in HFO price as we move into 2020 for the demand. It depends on the direction of each movement and the balance. It's a close call at this point, whether it will be up or down. We do get the benefit on two-thirds if bunker goes down. And we do have, at the end of this year, we expect to have 88 ships equipped with advanced air quality systems, we will continue to implement more across our fleet. So that third, the consumption being MGL, that will decrease overtime back to 20 and even below 20% as we move forward.","So operator, we will take one more question.","Operator","The next question comes from Assia Georgieva with Infinity Research.","Assia Georgieva","Couple of questions. I do a lot of pricing work and it seems over the years that for European sourced passengers, the timeframe is sort of around May is key in terms of their bookings for European based voyages. Is that something that you have seen and is there possibly a little bit of caution at this point for the European source business? Because we haven't gone through that mini European wave season?","David Bernstein","We have had solid bookings for our European itineraries, both for our North American brands as well as our EA brands. And so I haven't noticed anything in particular in May, over the last few years. But I will ask around and see if I can get any more information on that. ","Assia Georgieva","And the second question, with the extent of dry dock for the Sunrise, which takes place during this Q2, does that have an impact on yield either way?","David Bernstein","No, because you're taking this ship out of service and there's no ALBDs. It actually has a impact on cost, because you do still continue to have some cost per crew and other things during the dry dock period. But there are no ALBDs associated with it.","Arnold Donald","But when she comes out, she will almost certainly command a yield premium. And so that will be helpful. ","Assia Georgieva","Well, we certainly hope for that and expect that. Thank you so much for taking my question.","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","Arnold Donald","All right, everyone. Thank you so much. We appreciate it. We're totally focused on delivering for the year and then beyond the double digit earnings growth on average and the increased return on invested capital. So look forward. Thank you guys for your interest and talk to you next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line. Have a great day, everyone."],"4368":["Carnival Corporation & plc (NYSE:CCL) Q1 2015 Results Earnings Conference Call March 27, 2015 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Arnold Donald - CEO","David Bernstein - CFO","Beth Roberts - VP, IR","Micky Arison - Chairman","Analysts","Steve Wieczynski - Stifel","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays","James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities","Greg Badishkanian - Citigroup","Harry Curtis - Nomura","Jaime Katz - Morningstar","Ian Rennardson - Jefferies","Steve Kent - Goldman Sachs","Assia Georgieva - Infinity Research","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair","Stuart Gordon - Berenberg","Dan McKenzie - Buckingham Research","Arnold Donald","This is Arnold Donald, CEO of Carnival Corporation and Plc. Thank you all for joining us for our first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Today I am joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison; David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Roberts, our Vice President of Investor Relations. Before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking. I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release.","We are off to a strong start with our significantly improved first quarter earnings exceeding both prior year and December guidance. It is extremely gratifying to see the hard work of our team members pay off. It is the power of their efforts which have allowed us to overcome much of the impact of the dramatic currency movements that have plagued all global companies.","Consistent with the strengthening of our business, our travel partners are helping to drive and are benefiting from our improved performance and we specially thank them for their support. Now despite the nearly $0.30 drag from currency movements, we continue to expect roughly 25% earnings growth over 2014 based on our improved operating performance. Looking ahead, we are working hard to accelerate that growth as we continue to execute along the path to a double digit return on invested capital through our two-pronged strategy. To drive demand in excess of measured capacity growth and to capture the inherent value of our industry leading scale.","The 8% onboard revenue growth achieved this quarter is an affirmation of the inherent power of harnessing our collective effort as we embrace the fundamental behavioral change of communicating, collaborating and coordinating across our nine world-leading brands. The outsize growth in casino, bar and communication realized this quarter in part resulted from best practice sharing. This also marks the second consecutive quarter the Carnival brand outperformed. Despite a competitive Caribbean environment in the first quarter Carnival Cruise Line enjoyed a mid-single digit yield improvement. The brand remains on track for a strong year and beyond, the latter bolstered by a tremendous response by media, travel professionals and future guests to the unique unveiling of the Carnival Vista.","During a three-day event in New York City, Carnival Cruise Line brought to life the enhanced guest experiences of that brands most innovative ship ever. Making its debut in 2016, this ship will feature a host of groundbreaking innovation including the first IMAX Theatre at Sea, an onboard brewery and SkyRide, the first pedal powered aerial attraction featuring some of the best views ever offered at sea. The Carnival brand continues to benefit from the rollout of Fun Ship 2.0 and its measurable lift in guest satisfaction, further driving greater guest retention. Additionally, the experiences create stronger customer advocacy, which is far and away the most powerful marketing tool for attracting first time cruise guests.","Concerning demand creation overall, we are pleased with the constructive conversation around cruising ignited by our multifaceted campaign well timed during the part of wave season and built around the Super Bowl. That effort generated over 10 billion media impressions, nearly all of which were positive. Our ongoing public relations effort was furthered by the delivery of Britannia, the largest ship ever built specifically for British guests. The ship design was informed by extensive research among previous and potential guests and is iconic for many things trending positive in modern Britain. We were honored that the flagship of the P&O fleet was named by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, drawing a worldwide audience and providing a ringing endorsement of cruising.","The event generated a record for P&O of 1 million web visits that week including over 100,000 people viewing the naming online. In addition, the delivery and naming garnered over 1000 broadcasts on radio and television reaching even beyond the U.K. and anchoring us for future growth in what is today the second largest cruise market in Europe. Additional public relations impact was created early in the year when Princess Cruises sponsored a stunning award-winning float in the Rose Bowl Parade, which served to launch the brand's 50th anniversary celebrations.","The original cast of the of The Love Boat TV series featured on the float helped generated over 400 million media impressions from the days prior and that follow. Those and other initiatives to drive demand have resulted in an ongoing improvement in our underlying fundamentals. We are enjoying a strong wave season and we are particularly pleased with demand for the Caribbean for the remainder of the year. Overall, our booking trends build confidence in our increased yield guidance as much of the year is already booked at higher prices.","Moreover, we have less inventory remaining for sale, leaving us well positioned to strengthen pricing on the remaining inventory. Excluding the impact of currency, we expect a 3% to 4% underlying year-over-year improvement in revenue yield and we are working aggressively to continue that momentum. We have completed segmentation studies in three of our major markets including the U.S., the U.K. and Australia with significant learnings. The work allowed us to size the addressable market and validate the significant growth potential remaining in these markets.","For instance, in North America half of the addressable market has not cruised yet and roughly 75% of the addressable market will plan to cruise in the next five years. We also identified unique preferences reflected in the typographic segments and we are using the output to further focus onboard offerings and acquisition marketing to what's guests most want in a vacation. Each brand is refining its core offering based on potential to capture more demand and preference and the ability to command higher yield. All of the brands have collaborated to improve and align on how we measure guest satisfaction. Now we have adopted a Net Promoter Score metric as a tool to help drive greater value.","Enhanced Internet connectivity is another area of focus with the goal to further improve the guest and crew experience significantly. In 2014 we introduced our hybrid model Wi-Fi at Sea as a means to offload traffic via land-based tower to enhance the guest experience with faster connectivity. We piloted this model in the Caribbean and now we are introducing this technology to the Alaska market for the coming season. Our pilot program achieved a 40% lift in guest satisfaction as well as a 30% increase in revenue. This concept is now being piloted more broadly by the incremental bandwidth as well as adjusting price and plan.","We have also made great strides in our global market planning and deployment. For the first time, brands shares unpublished itineraries to identify conflicts and maximize long term profits. We are opening new destinations and we are really excited about Amber Cove and the Puerto Plata region of Dominican Republic this year. Now following the review of our revenue management process by a team of dynamic pricing experts, we have created a roadmap to implement recommendations. We have already enjoyed some benefit as reflected in our positive yield results.","There is much opportunity ahead to continue to share best practices and the science and psychology of pricing as well as price management systems. We continue to make strides on initiatives to leverage our scale and remain on track to achieve our previously announced $70 million to $80 million in cost savings this fiscal year. These savings are attributable to our recently completed air travel initiative which captures the benefit of consolidating our global air travel purchases as well as procurement savings and other major spin areas includes technical, food, beverage and shore excursions.","Going forward, we have additional opportunity to leverage our scale allowing us to continue to offset inflation in future years. Now to further this step, we recently hired a Chief Procurement Officer, Julia Brown. She brings 25 years of large cap strategic sourcing and supply chain management. Of course, China presents the next great frontier for cruising and we are making great progress on this front. Our current four ships across two brands diversify our product offerings by targeting two different guest experiences, contemporary and premium.","We are enjoying continuing growth and strong operating performance from both our Costa and Princess brand. Along with the two MoUs recently signed with CSSC and the China Merchants Group to explore joint venture opportunity, we are well positioned for future growth. China expects to surpass 1 million cruise passengers in 2015 and nearly 50% of those will travel on a Carnival Corporation ship. It's just a matter of time before China becomes the largest cruise market in the world.","Importantly, we made continued progress towards enhancing our fleet while maintaining our commitment to measured capacity growth. This week we entered into a strategic partnership for nine ships expected to enter service in 2019 through 2022. That averages out to be roughly two to three ships per year which combined with likely ship exits, reflects our commitment to measured capacity growth. Included in this commitment is a new class of ship expected to be the most efficient ship we have ever built and which will add excitement to our industry and even further inspire first time cruisers.","We believe we are continuing to execute along a clear path to a double digit return on invested capital. Now as we you know, we improved return on invested capital by nearly one point in 2014 and we still expect another point of improvement in 2015 despite the negative impact of currency. We are committed to driving relative scarcity by creating even more demand for our brands that outpaces capacity. We are focused on measured capacity growth by delivering innovative and significantly more efficient ships while at the same time removing from service less efficient capacity.","We remain focused on driving yield growth in the low to mid-single digit range through higher ticket an onboard revenue while containing cost increases through our initiatives to lever scale. There are and will be challenges in our business every year, whether it's currency, fuel or geopolitical issues. Regardless, our path is to harness the inherent capability we have to deliver double-digit return on invested capital. We feel we are demonstrating that we begun to harness that capability and are firmly on the path to achieving double digit return on invested capital in the next three to four years.","Thank you. Now I would like to turn it over to David.","David Bernstein","Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note all of my references to revenue and cost metrics will be in constant dollars unless otherwise stated as this is a much more meaningful measure of our business trend. I will start today with a summary of our guidance topping first quarter results, then I will provide some insight into our current bookings and finish up with some color on our 2015 March guidance.","Our non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter was $0.20. I am excited to report that this was $0.11 above the midpoint of our December guidance. The improvement was essentially driven by two things, $0.06, from net revenue yields, the majority of which was due to better than expected onboard and other yields as the improvement we saw in the back half of 2014 was repeated again in the first quarter. And $0.05 essentially from lower operating cost due to the timing of expenses between the quarters.","Now let's look at our first quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased almost 2%. The North American brands were up 3%, while the European, Australia and Asian brands also known as our EAA brands, were flat. Our total net revenue yields in the first quarter were up 2%.","Turning to the two components of net revenue yields. Net ticket yields were flat in total and on both sides of the Atlantic on a constant dollar basis. However, I am pleased to say that when you remove the transactional currency impacts, net ticket yield on a constant currency basis was up 1%. The increase in net ticket yields was driven by improvements in European itineraries and Asia itineraries. This was partially offset by lower yields in the Caribbean which we expected. However, I would like to point out that we do expect the revenue yields to be up for the remaining three quarters of the year.","Net onboard and other yields increased almost 8%, with similar increases on both sides of the Atlantic. This increase was considerably more positive than our December guidance. It was the third great quarter in a row for onboard revenue.","Net cruise cost per ALBD, excluding fuel, was up 2%, which was less than we expected in our December guidance driven by the timing of expenses between the quarters. Fuel prices this quarter were down 38% versus the prior year which saved us $0.17 per share net of realized losses on fuel derivatives. The year-over-year impact from the strengthening dollar cost us $0.06 including both translational and transactional currency impact. In summary, the first quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.20 higher than the prior year driven by improved net revenue yields worth $0.11 and lower fuel prices worth $0.17, both of which were partially offset by currency and higher net cruise cost excluding fuel.","Now let's turn to bookings. Bookings during this year's wave season was strong, prices were up nicely and volumes were consistent with the historically high levels achieved last year. At this point in time, for the remaining three quarters of 2015, cumulative fleet wide bookings are nicely ahead at slightly higher prices despite the unfavorable transactional currency impact at our North American brand. Drilling down into the bookings patterns. First for our North America brand.","The Caribbean and Alaska are nicely ahead on both price and occupancy which bodes well for pricing on future bookings. Booking volumes during wave season have been strong. They were on pace with last year's historical levels even though we started the wave period nicely ahead on occupancy. Prices on these bookings are also nicely higher. All other North American brand deployments combined which includes the seasonal European program are ahead on occupancy but at lower prices due to the transactional impact of currency.","Booking volumes during the wave season again have been strong on pace with last year's historical results but at lower prices driven by transactional currency impact. Secondly for our EAA brands. European itineraries are nicely ahead on price and occupancy. Booking volumes for these itineraries during wave season were in line with forecast but down from prior year because we started ahead, it did not need as much volumes to fill. I am happy to report that the prices on these bookings were higher than the prior year.","Looking forward to 2015. Based on the strength of bookings during wave season, we have increased our yield guidance for the full year. We now expect revenue yields to be up 3% to 4% versus the prior year on a constant currency basis which excludes both the translational and transactional impact of currency. The midpoint of the range is one full percentage point better than our December guidance. On a constant dollar basis, which does not exclude the unfavorable transactional currency impact, we still expect the yields to be up approximately 2% versus the prior year which is the same as our December guidance.","In the constant dollar case, the underlying improvement in the business that we are forecasting from higher prices is offset by the unfavorable transactional currency impact. Now turning to cost. For the full year 2015, net cruise cost without fuel per ALBD are now expected to be up approximately 2% to 3%. This is a slight improvement from our December guidance because of the favorable impact of transactional currency. On a constant currency basis, we are in line with our December guidance.","For 2015, we are forecasting the benefit from the lower price of fuel net of realized losses on fuel derivatives by $0.63, partially offsetting this benefit is the impact from both translational and transactional currency which costs us $0.51. Putting all these factors together, our non-GAAP EPS guidance for the full year 2015 is $2.30 to $2.50 versus $1.93 for 2014. Currency clearly remains a headwind. Since our December guidance, currency net of fuel price and fuel derivatives has impacted the full year by $0.26.","However, we are encouraged by the underlying strength of the business which improved by $0.21 and largely offset the currency headwinds as the midpoint of our guidance only moved by $0.05. I did want to make one comment on our second quarter guidance to ensure that everyone fully understand the 6.5% to 7.5% increase in net cruise cost excluding fuel for the quarter. This is driven by the previously discussed increase in dry-dock days for the year which were disproportionately impacting the second quarter.","On a final note. If you read the footnote in the press release at the bottom of the income statement, you will see that we revised the accounting for the marine and technical spare parts for one of our brands. Without the revision, we could have had a material impact on our future financial statements. The impact of the revision is $0.11 per share but that\u2019s primarily spread out over the five year period from 2010 to 2014. The revision to the full year 2014 resulted in a $0.03 lower EPS of which a penny was in the first quarter. We expect to file an 8-K next month with all the prior periods revised for reference purposes.","And now, operator, we are ready to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Robin Farley from UBS. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","This is [indiscernible] for Robin. Could you perhaps talk a little bit about what drove upside in Q1? Primarily if you could breakdown perhaps some of the upside you saw in the Carnival brand as well as some commentary if you could on the Caribbean environment post Q1 would be helpful. Thank you.","Arnold Donald","Good morning, Robin. I will let David comment first. Go ahead, David.","David Bernstein","Yes. If we talk about what drove the yields up in Q1, essentially as I had indicated, the onboard and other yields were up 8% and in constant currency, the net ticket yields were up 1%. So collectively together, the onboard had a disproportional impact overall. You know the Caribbean environment in the first quarter as I indicated in my notes, the pricing was lower, but we are looking at the Caribbean environment being positive for the rest of the year. It's been very strong in terms of bookings and Carnival is doing very well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Steve Wieczynski from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Steve Wieczynski ","So, Arnold, you talked about this a little bit just briefly in your opening commentary. But can you talk a little bit about your booked load position today relative to maybe where it's been in the past in terms of historical levels?","Arnold Donald","Both in North America and in Europe, we are ahead on bookings. The bookings are definitely stronger and they are at high yields. So we've definitely seen an improvement both from the hard work of our people within all the brands and with the additional PR and other demand creation activities, we've seen an improvement in the booking pace.","David Bernstein","And relative to historical levels, I mean, Steve, I think a year ago I indicated we were at the lower end of historical levels and we continue to make progress and move up, but we're still towards the lower end but we made progress and it's very positive trends.","Steve Wieczynski ","Okay. Thanks. And then I guess with the announcement yesterday in terms of the ship order, the pretty large ship order. I guess, can you go into a little bit more detail about maybe what went into that in terms of why putting in such a big order at this point? Was it something to do with currency? Was it trying to lock up the yards where the yards give you some pretty good prices? Can you just give us a little bit more detail there?","Arnold Donald","Yes. Definitely nothing to do with currency. We at times just require more forward planning to our advantage to communicate with the yards and have a longer term plan because they have to work a lot of subcontractors. And it gives them the opportunity to plan further out and to be more effective in lining up those subcontractors. We also included in the non-ship orders, a new ship design and that requires additional forward planning as a prototype. And so that\u2019s why we did it. We don\u2019t have all the details yet. We have not signed contracts with each of the yards for each of the ships. We will be happy to share those details once we do that. But it was important for us to get out in front from a planning standpoint to empower the yards and to get in front of our new design.","Steve Wieczynski ","Okay. Got you. And can I ask one real quick question to David. For David, for this accounting change that you just called out, I guess the question is, are different brands using different accounting practices? I'm just trying to understand what the difference is here.","David Bernstein","Yes. It's very simple. I mean we had one brand who is using -- we had two acceptable accounting methods which our auditors agreed with. But there was one brand that was using a different method and so what we decided to do was make the brands consistent just in case as we go forward in the future the difference became material. And so we decided to revise the accounting as I indicated in my notes. Overall, it was just $0.11 over a five plus year period. So it's a couple of pennies a year.","Operator","Our next question is from Felicia Hendrix from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Felicia Hendrix ","David, this is for you. This commentary about transaction and translation has left a lot of investors and us very confused this morning. So I'm hoping that you can walk us through a few things. First is, can you just walk us through where this transactional impact is coming from? You haven't really broken it out before like this. And then the second point is, if your new net yield guidance is up 3.4% as ex translation and transaction, I'm just trying to figure out what the apples-to-apples is for your prior guidance for net yields for the year which was up 2% at the midpoint. If you ex out translation and transaction, what would that number have been?","David Bernstein","Okay. I think that\u2019s three or four questions in there but I will try to answer them one at a time. The way to think of the constant currency that we are talking about is to think of it in terms of the prices that the consumer pays. And so we are talking of that in the local currency. So were talking about a 3% to 4% increase in yields in constant currency, then that\u2019s a 3% to 4% increase in price in the local currency that the consumer pays. And that\u2019s probably the most important underlying metric for us to look at in terms of the strength of the business.","When you compare that 3% to 4% that we gave back to December, if you remember back in my notes in December, I did say that in constant currency the yields were up 0.5% more. So the two -- the comparison is back to 2.5%. And so it was approximately 2 in constant dollars and 2.5 in constant currency. And that\u2019s why I indicated in my notes that we went from that approximately 2.5 up a percentage point to a mid-point 3.5. The difference between the two, I think everybody understands the translational impact when you have a brand like Costa in euros and you translate it back into U.S. dollars. That\u2019s the translational impact as a result of the change in FX rates that we capture in the constant dollar measure.","But the transactional impact, the best example of that is like Princess. Princess has a couple of ships sailing in Australia and they sell in the local currency in Australia. And when the Australian dollar moves compared to the U.S. dollar, transacting that back into U.S. dollars is at a different rate and that is what we call the transactional currency impact.","Probably 80% of the [plus] [ph] of the currency impact that we have within the company is translational. And so when currency would move by small amounts on a regular basis, the constant dollar substantially accounted for all of the movement. But with the big moves in currency recently, if you look at our press release, you will notice that the difference between the current dollar yields and the current currency yields are 7.5%. Of that 1.5% is the transactional impact. So because currency has moved so much, the transactional impact has become more meaningful and therefore we wanted to disclose it to everybody and make sure people were aware of what was going on.","Felicia Hendrix ","Okay. So that's very helpful. So as you said in your release, based on the current booking strength you're going to 3.4% and that's one point higher than your December guidance and it looks like you beat the quarter by, at the midpoint about 1 point on yield. So what I'm trying to figure out is, are you just passing through that upside or is your 3% to 4% inclusive of strength that you're seeing -- new strength that you're seeing in the rest of the year versus what you were seeing before?","David Bernstein","It's considerably more new strength that we are seeing and we did raise the raise the rest of the year. I guess the best way to kind of couch that is, I indicated that the net revenue yield was worth about $0.06 in the first quarter and we raised the whole year by 1%. So that\u2019s worth, as we have always told you, about $0.17. So you can see not only did we flow through the first quarter but we raised the rest of the yield as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of James Hardiman from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","James Hardiman ","Thanks for taking my call and just to sort of follow-up on that last, response to the last question. So you raised or you flowed through the $0.06 yield beat to the rest of the year. How should I think about that remaining $0.11? Is it more weighted towards 2Q or are we thinking evenly weighted to the rest of the year in terms of the yield increase on the guide for the remaining three quarters?","David Bernstein","From a guidance perspective we took up the remaining three quarters but I would like to point out that what we took up in the remaining three quarters was the [tick up] [ph] on the net ticket yield. We left from our December guidance for the remaining three quarters, we left the on board and other yield the same.","James Hardiman ","And the reason there being, obviously you have a lot more visibility about ticket yields going forward than you do about onboard spend which obviously doesn't happen until it happens.","Arnold Donald","Yes. More visibility, James, and the other reason is we also have tougher comparisons going for us because we have had several quarters, beginning since late last year, with increased rates of improvement in onboard spent. So the comparisons are being a little tougher going forward too.","James Hardiman ","Got it. And then, just a question on currency from a demand perspective. Are you seeing any impact in terms of bookings that you think represent the big appreciation of the American dollar? Whether it's more Americans interested in traveling overseas given the strength of that dollar on cruises or the relative value of a land-based hotel and some overseas destination. Do you think there's anything that's changed excluding the translational and transactional impact of currency just on the demand side?","Arnold Donald","On the margin there it could be a little bit of activity but we haven't really measured any significant impact of people responding to the currencies. And a lot of it is just how we price things, too, you know local currencies for the European brands, dollar for us. And so we haven't seen any big lift in anything. Alaska is super strong but, again, I am not sure that's a currency driven thing.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Steven Kent from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Mr. Kent your line is open. We will take the next question. The next question being from Greg Badishkanian from Citigroup.","Greg Badishkanian ","I'm here. So my question is, obviously you raised the yield guidance which is good to hear. And if you kind of think about the different regions, where do you feel stronger about for the current year? Where do you have more confidence? And just kind of breaking out, the 3% to 4%, is it going to be a little bit stronger in Europe than the Caribbean? How would you characterize that?","Arnold Donald","Well, I think clearly, we are expecting relative uptick in the Caribbean. Caribbean was really crowded last year and going forward we see strength in the Caribbean and there's going to be a different capacity level in the Caribbean. So that'll bode well as well and it's easier comparisons on the Caribbean relative. So Caribbean's going to be relatively stronger. We've seen strength in Alaska but overall we are seeing yield opportunities everywhere in the world. But on a relative basis, if you are looking for it, I would have to say relative basis the Caribbean will look even stronger than some of the others.","Greg Badishkanian ","Yes. Good. And from what we can see, it looks like the Caribbean, especially Carnival brand, seems to be picking up throughout the year. So would you expect the Caribbean net yields that you're receiving to maybe accelerate throughout the year? Or is it a one-time step up function in the second quarter and won't be consistent?","David Bernstein","Yes. It's early to tell. But we are seeing a continued improvement in the overall environment, particularly in the third quarter where the industry capacity is down double-digits. So we are expecting to see a continued improvement, at least through the third quarter and it's very rarely for the fourth. But we are forecasting good strong yields there as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Harry Curtis from Nomura. Please go ahead.","Harry Curtis ","Going back to your CapEx. As you layer in the progress payments for your new ship orders, to what degree will it impact your ability and desire to return cash to shareholders over the coming three years?","Arnold Donald","Well, first of all we are clearly focused on delivering double-digit return on invested capital. And as we move towards that and are successful in that, obviously we're going to generate a lot of cash. And the excess cash that's not being reinvested back into the business, as in the past, will be distributed to shareholders either through dividends and\/or share buyback. So we do see an opportunity to deliver more to shareholders in that timeframe going forward based on our expected continued progress on the path of double-digit return on invested capital. While at the same time, having the capital required to invest in the business, to be able to sustain that performance and build on it.","Harry Curtis ","Is it more likely that you take it -- go ahead.","David Bernstein","No, the only thing...","Harry Curtis ","I am just wondering...","David Bernstein","Go ahead, Harry.","Harry Curtis ","Bobbing and weaving. Okay. So I'm just wondering if it's more likely to see, first a lift in the base dividend versus more aggressive share repurchases.","Arnold Donald","That's a Board decision and we will make the decision at the time. Historically, it's kind of certain pattern but we will make that decision along the way.","Harry Curtis ","Okay. And then...","Arnold Donald","It is nine ships and all that but the reality is it's still just two to three ships a year. And that\u2019s not dramatically different than what we have done in the recent past here. Still measured capacity growth. Still managing capital. We have to -- the only way we are going to get double digit return on invested capital is through yield and revenue. But we have to be disciplined in cost containment and we have to be wise in our choice of capital deployment and ensure that any capital we deploy does give us double digit return on invested capital. So we have clear line of site on managing and expect to be able to return to shareholders.","Harry Curtis ","That leads to my other question. Which is, how much net growth do you see in the fleet over the next several years and even beyond, as you layer in these new ship orders? And particularly, do you see much net growth in the key markets, being Europe and North America?","David Bernstein","On the contracted ships that we have through 2018, the compounded annual growth rate in capacity from '14 to '18 is only 3%. And that's with a calculation that was done with the currently announced ship exits. So the numbers may actually be slightly lower than that as we continue to remove ships from our fleet. I mean, we're removing four from the fleet in 2015 and we do expect that we will remove more in '16, '17 and '18. When you start balancing that between the markets and you just look at what is announced relative to the North America, European and Asian markets, within that 3% you're seeing a 1% to 2% increase in North America and Europe, the more established market, and like a 20% increase in Asia. So overall as we make more announcements, I think those numbers will continue to move probably lower in North America, Europe and higher in Asia.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jaime Katz from Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Jaime Katz ","Thank you. I guess my question is more surrounding this new chief procurement officer role and where you guys see the best opportunity to leverage or maybe use the entire business to reduce expenses and any insight you have to that. And then, if you have any added commentary on what brands you might prefer to add the new ships to that you announced yesterday, where those best opportunities are. Thanks.","Arnold Donald","You bet. I'll start with the new ship comment. The only color that I'll give that, I can't remember whether we sent a press release or not, is that some of those ships will be purpose built for China and so China is definitely a market that will be receiving some of those new ships. But in terms of the specifics on the brands, we're still working that through the brands and the yards and once we have concluded that, we will be happy to share it with you. And then the first part of your question concerning the procurement officer. Julia Brown is well known in the procurement field. She has had a highly successful track record at Kraft and now Mondelez and just a real star in procurement. And given the scale of what we have, we already have a line of sight on offsetting inflation as we've mentioned, $70 million-$80 million this year and we see that going on for several years. But it's in our best interest to have a top level procurement person overseeing that effort in collaboration with the brands to ensure that we not only deliver on it but have the opportunity to beat it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ian Rennardson from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","Ian Rennardson","I have two questions for you. The first one is, it looks to me as if you've excluded the negative transactional effects in your yield guidance but left in the positive effect in the cost guidance. If that's so, what is the effect? What would be the like-for-like comparison on costs? And secondly, not being a currency expert, can you give me another example of what a transactional negative effect on yield would be, because it sounds to me like moving Aussie dollars into U.S. dollars sounds like a translational effect. I might be missing something there, though. Thanks.","David Bernstein","Okay. On the revenue and cost, basically because of the movement in currency we did get a transactional positive impact in costs and we lowered our cost guidance in constant dollars. So we did not increase our spending to offset that. We just allowed the transactional cost benefit to flow through. However on the revenue side, we had a negative transactional impact of revenue but we increased our expectations for pricing which offset the transactional impact on revenue. So in the end, the revenue guidance in constant dollars stayed the same but on the cost it went down.","So hopefully that explains, it's clear. Now, you asked about the Aussie dollar and you said that it was a translational impact. It depends on the circumstance. So the situation that I gave was Princess cruises which is a U.S. dollar functional currency and when it's billed in Aussie dollars and it brings it back to U.S., that's transactional. Now, that is different than P&O cruises Australia which has an Aussie dollar functional currency and when you translate that back into U.S. dollars that is translational. So they have different basis and as a result it's two different types of transactions.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question is from the line of Steve Kent from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Steve Kent","Okay. So can you just talk about the way you're handling costs? The timing keeps on getting pushed back. It seems like your guidance is consistently -- it's a little too conservative but then you say in your press release that the costs moved or you didn't use as much or what the issues are. It seems to me like that cost variable seems to be moving around and keeps on being pushed forward. And then the other thing is, near-term demand has been pretty strong the last few quarters leading to some of the earnings beat. Is that a change in the way the consumer is acting? I just wanted to understand that whether there's been [indiscernible] change and we're just seeing closer in bookings versus let's say five years ago or three years ago, or ten years ago.","Arnold Donald","Yes. I will answer the second part first. In terms of near end bookings, that has been a trend in the business in recent years that bookings were occurring closer and closer to time of sale. So that has been a trend. We are enjoining some improved booking curves now in terms of booking occurring further out, both in Europe and in the U.S. So that\u2019s encouraging. It's not back to where it was, as David mentioned earlier on the call, in the past. But we are strengthening in the booking curves and that\u2019s really encouraging. So, yes, the consumers have changed behaviors to an extent but we also see through the recent results that we can further improve our booking curves and ultimately our pricing. Go ahead, David.","David Bernstein","Yes. And as far as costs are concerned, Steve, I mean this has been -- we have talked about this a lot over the years. We have basically indicated that you should try to judge us on our cost for the full year as opposed to the quarter. I mean our cost base is almost $8 billion in total. So that\u2019s $2 billion a quarter and we have to try to lay out exactly when we are going to spend every single dollar. And it's very hard within a three-month period to get it perfect. I mean things vary whether it's advertising expense or crew travel or some other hotel cost. It's very hard to pin down every single dollar in $2 billion for each quarter. But we do have plans for the year, people know what they are. They are flexible, they do change. But for the year we have a pretty solid guidance and we stick to those plans. But we don\u2019t force people to spend it specifically in a particular month or particular quarter. We allow people to make decisions and change timing to optimize the business and that\u2019s what you would want us to do over time. So hopefully that\u2019s helpful and it shifts a little bit of a seasonalization between the quarters.","Steve Kent","Okay. And then just one other quick what on this. You say that currency was a headwind but better operational metrics closed the impact to only $0.05 headwind. How much did the lower fuel price help this though? Because your fuel price per metric ton guidance for the full year now has decreased by $30. I'm trying to get a balance of those two issues.","David Bernstein","Okay. I'll give you a couple of numbers so that you fully understand. On a full-year basis versus the December guidance, the currency impact was $0.28 and the net fuel positive was only $0.02. So that is net $0.26 headwind that we were facing. We improved our overall guidance by $0.21 and therefore the decline in the midpoint of $0.05. And most of that $0.21, as I indicated before, was the 1% increase in the revenue yield which is worth approximately $0.17. So that's how the math works. Your point about the fuel, yes, the fuel price did move. But one of the things the fuel collars or the fuel derivatives offset a big chunk of the fuel price movement. And the reason that that happened was while the brent fell, our fuel price did not fall by as much as brent because when we did our December guidance, the [crack] [ph] spread was 75%, roughly speaking and at this point in time it's 81%. So brent fell by far more, 6% or so more, than the price of the fuel that we purchase and so that's why it wasn't a perfect 50% offset there. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Assia Georgieva from Infinity Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Assia Georgieva ","Congratulations on the excellent numbers. I had one quick question on the transactional issue. If we assume that the Princess Ship sales in Europe for a week long itinerary and prices at \u20ac1,000 per person, and we have a Costa ship sailing that those same dates for \u20ac1,000. Wouldn't we translate both of those at the same exchange rate? And David, are you just breaking down the Princess piece into transactional and the Costa piece into translational?","David Bernstein","Okay. All we are doing, basically in terms of the exchange rate, the rate of which would actually go back into U.S. dollars is the rate on the day that it was paid. So if theoretically both cruises were paid for on the same date, you use the rate that\u2019s the cruise was -- the booking was paid on. And all we are doing is separating it between translational and transactional because a Costa would be translational because it's euro based, and the Princess would be transactional because it's U.S. dollar functional currency. So it's same magnitude if it was paid the same day but it's two different types of impacts.","Arnold Donald","And the reason why there is transactional -- the reason why I said it's transactional wasn\u2019t as important in the past is because it represents a much smaller percent of our business.","Assia Georgieva ","In terms of sourcing?","Arnold Donald","Yes. In terms of sourcing. So the movements and currency didn't affect the transactional to any great extent and why we what always have had translational and that's why in the past constant dollars were fine but now with the big movement in currency we have to look at local constant currency. As well as the...","Assia Georgieva ","Great. This was very helpful. I appreciate it. And my second question relates more to the European-sourced passengers. They seem to be booking much closer for European sailings because they're closer to the actual port of departure and there seems to be a mentality of, I guess, closer bookings in general. After the unfortunate events, have you seen any change or is it still too early? Are people holding off?","Arnold Donald","Two comments. One is, in Europe we actually are seeing versus prior year and in previous few years, that the booking curves are further out. So we are seeing that both continental Europe and in the U.K. The events that you reference in Tunisia, that was just tragic incident and obviously we offer our sympathies to those directly affected and to the people of Tunisia. So that was a terrible tragedy. At the same time it represents 2% of our port calls, so from that standpoint, not overly significant. But beyond that the impact in terms of psychology of travel, whenever there are incidents like this, it affects the psychology of travel. And in difference source markets around the world, it affects it more or less. For example in North America some people are just nervous about going to all of Europe. They cannot think about specific locations. But at the same time, we will just have to monitor and see what the long-term effects are but there has been a history of the market response to these things and historically it dissipates and we feel confidence in the guidance that we have put forward to you based on what we can read at this time.","Assia Georgieva ","Okay. Arnold, thank you so much for that color and David, thank you for running me through the example.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Please go ahead.","Sharon Zackfia","Hi. Good morning. So most of my questions were answered. I won't ask about translation versus transaction again. I wanted to talk about the ad campaign. So obviously with the Super Bowl, you got so many impressions and you did kind of more of a consolidated multi-brand campaign, I think for the first time. How are you measuring the effectiveness of that? Does that change kind of your media strategy going forward? Just any thoughts on that would be helpful.","Arnold Donald","Yes. We have an internal joke here that almost anything that happens we blame it on the Super Bowl ad. So if the food is specially good in the cafeteria, we say the Super Bowl ad did it. But the reality is that following advertising's direct impact is always a difficult challenge. What we can measure is the level of communication. Web site hits, impressions, conversations around the brand. That we can measure. And so we know we had a lot more conversations generated about cruising. There is no question about that. We would hope that over time that translates to greater demand and ultimately bookings and higher yield. So we have confidence that that combined with all the work that brands already do, combined with the public relations that we have in general. Things like the naming of the Britannia, things like the Rose Parade, as I mentioned, with Princess, in the opening comments. All of those things create positive noise and consideration for cruising.","And we do try to measure of course and we do track. And we try to measure uptake and bookings and so on to just make certain that we are getting the best result from the dollar and getting the return on investment. It's a difficult thing to do because we are also doing product enhancements on board and we know those. We can track that directly in terms of onboard revenue responses and in terms of guest satisfaction scores and what have you. So we feel it accomplished what we set out to do. We will be evaluating it through the course of the year to figure out what to do next, but we have four ships, three ships and a baby ship, that we want to introduce to the market in next year, in 2016. That\u2019s going to provide us with tremendous opportunity for PR events to build awareness and conversation and we are going to factor it into our planning as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Stuart Gordon from Berenberg. Please go ahead.","Stuart Gordon","Just a quick question on the onboard spend. I was just wondering whether there's any way you could give us some color on disaggregating what I think you've commonly referred to as some changes in consumer behavior onboard ships and their spending? And what would be consumer recovery to get a flavor for where that boost in onboard spend is coming from, please?","Arnold Donald","Well, we always feel that the better the economy, the better off we are. But the reality is our onboard spend increase is across the board. So it's clearly not only tied to consumer response from economic improvements because it's everywhere. And so we know that it has been in part due to the stimulation of the brands working together, sharing ideas, building on each other's idea, sharing best practices. For example, the one example I gave, the Wi-Fi at Sea is a comprehensive conversation about how do we enhance connectivity on board the ship for both our guests and our crew. And coming out of that, a number of things were done collectively and some individually by brands based on the collective sharing and discussion. And ultimately it's led to a nice uptick in both guest satisfaction scores with connectivity and actually also in terms of onboard revenue. So we would see far more of the benefit coming from focused actions and efforts on the part of our outstanding employees that have revenue management responsibilities, onboard revenue management responsibilities, and they are working together and sharing best practices.","Stuart Gordon","Okay. And just to follow up. I mean obviously that's alluding to the fact that it's partly what you're doing to encourage changing consumer behavior. I mean, although the comps will get harder, does it give you some confidence that the acceleration in onboard spend and not forsaken to suggest it stays at 7.7% going forward, but it will stay better than perhaps GDP based thinking?","Arnold Donald","Well, obviously, we want to drive it as much as we can. And it's not so much change in consumer behavior as much as us listening to our guests and giving them more of what they want. And if you give them what they want, they will buy it. So, yes, we feel that we are going to work it and continue to work it. We think there is additional growth prospects but at this point in time, we think the prudent thing to do is the guidance that we guidance that we gave.","Operator","Our last question then will come from the line of Dan McKenzie from Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Dan McKenzie","Thanks, guys, for squeezing me in here. My question is on the revenue management practices. I guess, first, I'm just wondering how material that benefit is and then separately, just timing, is the benefit really limited to 2015 or is there an annualization effect that is going to continue to be a tailwind in next year as well as 2017?","Arnold Donald","Well, in terms of revenue management and dynamic pricing and all of that, that is an ongoing effort. It should yield results for some years to come. We want to accelerate the learnings we have and accelerate the adoption of those across the brands. It's very significant for us. We are at roughly 80 million passenger cruise days a year, so $1 a day across our fleet is $80 million and $10 a day is $800 million. So revenue management is absolutely a prime area of focus. It's the biggest driver we have and small tweaks add up to real dollars. So whether it's the actual tools that we use, the management systems that allow us to do more inquiry and change prices at smaller increments faster and so on and so forth, or whether it's actual presentation and psychology and packaging on pricing, all of that. All of those are areas that we continue to mine. We have got a clear line of sight from the study on about 21 different areas to explore. We are doing that. Luckily we are nine brands, we can do a lot of that simultaneously. Two in this brand, to in that brand. Get the learning and share it more rapidly. We have a guru in place, a coach, that\u2019s there to monitor process and encourage the brands and make certain that the communication takes place across the brands. And it's going very well. So we have an expectation that, no pun intended, they will yield results for several years to come.","Operator","Thank you.","Arnold Donald","Thank you. All very much. I really appreciate your interest and we were happy to deliver the quarter and we are looking forward to building on that momentum. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you all for your participation and we ask that you please disconnect your line.

Welcome to the Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, September 25, 2012. I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Frank, Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer with Carnival Corporation. Please go ahead.","Howard S. Frank","Thank you, Andre, and good morning, everyone. Let me just sort of comment that Micky Arison and Beth Roberts are in London at the moment so they are joining the call from London. David Bernstein and I are here in Miami. I'm going to turn it over to David and let him start with some of the color on the third quarter and talk a little bit about the costs going forward.","David Bernstein","Thank you, Howard. Before I begin, please note that as some of our remarks in this conference call will be forward-looking. I will refer you to the cautionary statements in today's press release. Also all of my references to revenue and cost metrics will be in local currency unless otherwise noted as this is the most useful measure of our business trends.","Our non-GAAP EPS for the third quarter was $1.53. The third quarter came in $0.09 above the midpoint of our June guidance. The improvement was driven by better-than-expected pricing on close-in bookings worth $0.07, and lower net cruise costs excluding fuel worth $0.05, both of which were partially offset by changes in fueling currency, costing a combined $0.03.","Now let's look at our third quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased almost 3% and North American brands were up 3.4%, while the Europe, Australia and Asian brands, or as we call them our EAA brands, were up 2.1%. Our total net revenue yields decreased 5% in the third quarter, of which 3 percentage points were driven by Costa. Excluding Costa, total net revenue yields decreased only 2%, driven by a 4% decline in net ticket revenue yield, offset by a 5% increase in net onboard and other revenue yields.","With respect to the net ticket yields, the North American brands were down 4.8%, driven by declines in Europe and Alaska, while the Caribbean yields held up very well during the quarter. Excluding Costa, our EAA brand net ticket yields were down only 1.8%.","For net onboards and other yield, again, excluding Costa, the increase was 5%. For net onboard yields alone, the increase was over 3% on both sides of the Atlantic. The rest of the increase was driven by other revenue yields, which resulted from a small change in accounting for our Alaskan tour business.","On the cost side, net cruise cost per available lower berth day excluding fuel were down 3% versus the prior year. This decline in net cruise costs per ALBD, was greater than we expected in our June guidance. However, part of the lower net cruise costs in the third quarter relate to the timing of expenses between the third and fourth quarter and not a reduction in expenses for the year.","As I said in the past, it is very difficult to estimate the timing for many of our expenses by quarter, and therefore, the best measure of net cruise cost performance is on an annual basis.","As a result of our ongoing efforts to reduce fuel consumption, our consumption per ALBD declined 5.7% this quarter, thus continuing a multiple-year savings trend. Fuel prices in the quarter were down almost 4% versus the prior year, which saved us $0.03. However, this was partially offset by realized losses on fuel derivatives in June and July, which cost us $0.02 per share.","Currency rates this quarter versus the prior year cost us $0.09 per share as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar. In summary, the third quarter non-GAAP EPS was down $0.16 versus $1.69 per share last year, driven by the lower earnings at Costa. Excluding Costa, our non-GAAP net income would have been up slightly.","Excluded from our non-GAAP EPS but included in our GAAP EPS were unrealized gains on fuel derivatives of $136 million or $0.17 per share, resulting from marking to market our portfolio of fuel derivative. These gains almost completely offset the unrealized losses we recorded in the second quarter. As a result, at the end of the third quarter, the mark-to-market balance sheet position on our fuel derivatives was an unrealized gain of $13 million.","As we first discussed on last December's call, we believe it is more meaningful to evaluate our earnings performance by excluding the impact of unrealized gains and losses on fuel derivatives until the gains and losses are realized. This appropriately lines up the economic impact of the fuel derivatives with the underlying fuel price risk that is intended to mitigate.","In June, we entered into additional 0 cost collars for 2014, 2015 and 2016. We now have 0 cost collars in place that cover approximately 38% of 2013's consumption, 29% of 2014's consumption, 24% of 2015's consumption and 15% of 2016's consumption. As I mentioned on the June call, we are comfortable with the level of protection we have through the end of 2013, but we will look to opportunistically increase the other percentages over time.","Before turning to our 2012 outlook, I wanted to update you on our stock repurchase program. On the last call, I indicated we had restarted the repurchase program. Through the third quarter, we repurchased 2 million shares for $67 million. Currently, there's $265 million remaining under the repurchase authorization.","Now turning to our 2012 outlook. I will skip the net revenue yield outlook as Howard will discuss that shortly. On the cost side, the full-year net cruise cost excluding fuel per ALBD are forecasted to be down 1% versus the prior year, which is consistent with our June cost guidance.","On a final note, I wanted to give you a preliminary view of cost for 2013. As you know, we have had an excellent record of cost control. In fact, over the last 4 years, from 2008 through 2012, despite inflation, we have managed to reduce our net cruise cost excluding fuel on a unit basis by about 2.5%. Looking forward, our operating companies will continue to do an excellent job finding ways to reduce costs for 2013.","However, there are a few unique factors in 2013 that will be difficult to totally overcome which will push our unit cost higher. To begin with, we are expecting that Costa will fill their ships in 2013, which will lead to higher food and other unit costs associated with this higher occupancy. This will simply be a reversal of the occupancy-driven unit cost reduction in 2012.","In addition, as I have previously indicated, our insurance costs will be higher in 2013. Furthermore, we are anticipating charges relating to a closed multi-employer pension plan for certain British officers and crew. The multi-employer pension plan accounting rules require us to expense our contributions to fund planned deficits when the invoices are received.","Finally, our increasing emerging market deployment for Japan by Princess, for China by Costa and for Australia by Carnival Cruise Lines will also increase our costs. These unique factors alone will drive our unit costs up 1.5% to 2%. Therefore, I am expecting overall unit costs excluding fuel to be higher in 2013 compared to 2012.","Over the next few weeks, we will be visiting each of our operating companies to review their 2013 annual plan. We'll have a much clearer picture on costs for 2013 after those meetings, and it will provide detailed guidance on the December call.","At this point, I will turn the call over to Howard.","Howard S. Frank","Thank you, David. And again, good morning, everyone. I'm going to cover fourth quarter of 2012, and give you some highlights of how 2013 is shaping up, at least for the first half of the year, from a revenue yield standpoint.","As we indicated in the press release, on a fleet-wide basis, excluding Costa, at the present time, advance bookings over the next 3 quarters are behind last year at slightly lower prices. However, booking patterns have recently strengthened and the occupancy gap has closed considerably, still not fully closed but it's closing.","My comments this morning will focus on booking and pricing patterns for the next 3 quarters through the first half of 2013. Unless otherwise indicated, my comments on 2013 bookings and pricing will be inclusive of Costa.","Not surprisingly, 2 different pictures are emerging for our North America and EAA markets over the next 3 quarters. For North American brands, advanced bookings for the next 3 quarters are about at the same level as last year at slightly lower ticket prices. I will focus my comments on bookings on first half of 2013, and provide separate color on fourth quarter of 2012 advanced bookings later in my comments.","First half of 2013, North American brand pricing is slightly lower than a year ago. However, pricing for the 2012 first half at this time was significantly higher over the prior years, so pricing comparisons are a bit tougher. What is encouraging for North American brands is that in the last 6 weeks, bookings and pricing for the first half of 2013 are running higher year-over-year, so during the last 6 weeks, we are catching up on bookings at higher price points, a very positive sign.","Turning to EAA. As you might expect, the picture for EAA brands on a combined basis is quite different. At this time, advance bookings for the next 3 quarters excluding Costa are at lower levels versus last year, and at slightly lower local currency ticket pricing. All my comments about EAA pricing are on a local currency basis. I will also focus my comments on bookings for the first half of 2013, and provide separate color on the fourth quarter advance bookings for EAA later in my comments.","For the first half of 2013, the lower year-over-year EAA occupancies are more significant for the continental European brands, Costa, AIDA and Ibero, which were more affected by the events of this past January. However, when we fully cycle through January of 2013, we expect to see occupancy comparisons improve. Having said that, we are forecasting that EAA pricing for the first half of 2013 will continue to experience a gradual decline as we build occupancies.","Of course, EAA booking patterns are also feeling the effects of the sluggish European economies and we expect that to continue in 2013. A very positive sign is that during the last 6 weeks, EAA bookings have been running significantly higher for the fourth quarter of 2012. So we are seeing strength in EAA bookings with bookings trending to closer end dates.","On a fleet-wide basis, for the first half of 2013, we are forecasting lower revenue yields in the first quarter and higher yields in the second quarter. We anticipated increase in second quarter yields results from an increase in ticket yields for both our North American and European brands against the easier comparisons to last year's second quarter. As a reminder, until we cycle through January of 2013, the revenue yield picture will be challenging.","I should also mention that extrapolating the current booking trends, especially for the European brands, is far more challenging this year given the very different booking pattern we are experiencing versus last year. So take these forecasts as our best estimates for the revenue yield picture for the first half of 2013.","Let me make a few separate comments about Costa. While our business planning for 2013 is still a work in progress, we are expecting that Costa Cruises will swing back to solid profitability in 2013, after a very challenging 2012. Based on consumer research, the brand perception in each of Costa's major markets is gradually improving so we are greatly encouraged by the resiliency of the brand.","Beginning in the second quarter of 2013, we expect Costa's revenue yields to nicely increase year-over-year against easier comparisons for last year's second quarter. We are very pleased with the progress that Costa has made, and our expectation is that Costa's financial performance will continue to improve as we move into 2013.","In 2013, we have 2 ships scheduled for delivery, the AIDA Stella or our AIDA brand in Germany will be delivered in March of 2013. The very successful AIDA brand is one of our best performing cruise brands in the company. And we congratulate Michael Thamm and Michael Ungerer for the great job they have done in building this very successful franchise in Germany.","In late May, we take the Liberty of the Loyal Princess, the first new ship for the Princess brand since the Ruby Princess was delivered in late 2008. The new generation Royal Princess has 3,600-plus lower berths, with a potential capacity of 4,100-plus passengers. The ship has many innovative new features including a dramatic overwater sea walk, private poolside cabanas and balconies on all of its outside state rooms.","Bookings for the Royal Princess, which begins sailing next summer, have been very strong. Fleet-wide capacity for 2013 is expected to increase by 3.4%, 4.1% in Q1, 3.2% in the second quarter, 3.8% in Q3, and 2.4% in the fourth quarter. North American brands will be up 3.3%, and Europe brands are up 2.8%.","The Europe brands growth is in the German market, with the addition of the AIDA Stella. Capacity for other brands in continental Europe and the U.K. is actually down slightly in 2012. Australia and Asia capacity is up 8.5% as we continue to drive capacity growth toward emerging cruise markets with the addition of the Costa Atlantica to Costa's Asian fleet in the spring of 2013. And Princess' opening of a new beachhead in the Japanese market with the Sun Princess later in 2013.","Apart from AIDA, which is our strongest performing brand in Europe, we have slowed our capacity increases for our North American and European brands. Of the 7 ships on our current order book, 3 are for AIDA, 2 for Princess, one for Costa and one for P&O. The strategy adopted by the company several years ago was to limit capacity growth to 2 to 3 ships per year to our fleet, with the addition of new ships to our brand being done on a more selective basis going forward. As a result, the Royal Princess delivered in 2013 will be the first ship added to the Princess fleet in 5 years, and the new P&O ship in the U.K. to be delivered in 2015 is 5 years after P&O's Azura was delivered in 2010.","The strategy is to build ships for those brands with stronger ROIs and which have been successful in taking on additional capacity in their markets without compromising pricing with the existing ships in their fleet.","Turning to earnings guidance for 2012. Our guidance for the full year EPS is unchanged under the midpoint of $1.85, and a range of $1.83 to $1.87. Stronger-than-expected revenue yields together with lower cost and expenses is expected to be offset by an increase in fuel costs in the fourth quarter, which is higher than we previously forecasted.","Now let me turn to the fourth quarter. Fleet-wide capacity in the fourth quarter is expected to be 3.2% higher than last year, 3.9% for North America brands, 1.3% for EAA brands. Fleet-wide pricing, and this excludes Costa, is lower than a year ago on slightly lower occupancies. There is very little inventory left to sell in the fourth quarter.","North American brands are 43% in the Caribbean, slightly higher than a year ago, 14% in Europe, same as last year with the balance in a variety of other itineraries. North American brand pricing is lower than last year with similar year-over-year occupancies. Caribbean pricing is flat versus a year ago, and Europe itinerary pricing is lower versus last year. Pricing for all other itineraries taken together is slightly ahead of a year ago.","EAA pricing in the fourth quarter is lower versus last year at slightly lower occupancies. This excludes Costa. Pricing for Europe cruises, which represents 61% of EAA itineraries, is lower, and for all other itineraries taken together, pricing is flat. Costa's occupancies across all itineraries have caught up with last year but at lower prices. We do expect, however, that Costa's year-over-year revenue yield performance in the fourth quarter to improve from the third quarter.","Fourth quarter 2012 earnings guidance is forecasted to come in between $0.07 and $0.11 a share for a midpoint of $0.09 -- $0.19 per share swing from the $0.28 per share on the fourth quarter of 2011 is comprised of lower pricing of $0.22 a share, and negative changes in fuel and currency costing $0.08 a share and that $0.30 a share is offset by lower cost than we previously forecasted to get to the $0.19 downswing.","Now turning to the first quarter of 2013, for the first and second quarter of 2013, my comments include Costa's data for both years. Fleet-wide capacity for the fourth quarter of 2013 is expected to be higher by 4.1%, 3.5% in North America, and 5.1% in EAA. At the present time, fleet-wide occupancies are lower than a year ago, with pricing slightly lower versus last year.","In the first quarter for North American brands are 65% in the Caribbean, but same as last year 13.5% in Asia Pacific, up about 2.5 points from last year, and the balance is in various other itineraries. North American brands taken together, occupancies and pricing are slightly lower year-over-year. As reported in our last call, pricing is higher for all but one of the North American brands but slightly lower in total, partly due to itinerary changes and mix for that one brand.","As previously mentioned, revenue yield comparisons for first quarter 2013 versus first quarter 2012 will be tougher, given our strong first quarter North American yield performance in 2012. Caribbean pricing is slightly higher than a year ago, Asia Pacific pricing is lower, pricing for all other itineraries taken together is lower.","As to EAA brands in the first quarter, EAA is 24% in Europe itineraries versus 19% in the prior year, 18% in the Caribbean, down from 22% in the prior year, 24% in Asia Pacific versus 21% in the prior year, and 18% in South America, which is about the same as last year. On a fleet-wide basis, EAA brand occupancies are behind last year with slightly higher pricing excluding Costa and slightly lower pricing when Costa is included. Although pricing and occupancy for Costa's bookings in Q1 are lower on a year-over-year basis, the year-over-year price differences from the third and fourth quarters of 2012 are narrowing.","Caribbean and South America pricing is slightly higher than a year ago, and Europe and Asia Pacific pricing is lower. On a fleet-wide basis, we are currently expecting that by the time the first quarter closes, revenue yields will come in lower than the strong first quarter of 2012, primarily as the results of the lower EAA brand pricing.","Turning to the second quarter of 2013, fleet-wide capacity for the second quarter is up 3.2%, 2.3% for North America, 4.5% for EAA brands. At the present time, on a fleet-wide basis, local currency pricing is slightly lower than a year ago, with occupancies running behind last year. Similar to the first quarter, the second quarter comparisons are against the prior year which, at this time, had stronger pricing.","Because of the falloff in bookings beginning last January, we expect second quarter occupancies and pricing to show gradual year-over-year improvement as we fully cycle through January of 2012 -- I'm sorry, January 2013. However, I should also caution that it's still early in the booking cycle and you should not read too much into the second quarter booking picture at this time.","For North American brands there are 53% in the Caribbean versus 56% last year; 13% in Asia Pacific versus 10% last year; with the balance in various other itineraries. For North American brands taken together, occupancies and pricing are slightly lower, Caribbean pricing is slightly higher than a year ago, Asia Pacific pricing is lower than a year ago, prices for all other brand and itineraries taken together are lower than a year ago.","EAA brands are 59% in Europe, up from 53% last year, with the balance in various other trades. EAA brand pricing for Europe cruises is lower than last year, and pricing for all other EAA brand itineraries taken together is flat versus a year ago at lower occupancies.","Although occupancies and pricing for the second quarter are lower than a year ago, we do expect to see a catch-up when we fully cycle last January's incident. And while it's still early in the second quarter booking cycle, as I mentioned earlier, because of easier comparisons, we do expect to see an improvement in revenue yields beginning in the second quarter for both North America and EAA brands by the time the second quarter closes.","So that's how we see the first half of 2013 shaping up from a revenue standpoint, as well as from a cost standpoint as David pointed out.","With that, we will turn it back to you, Andre, for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","First question is, Howard, I wonder if you could just touch on, for a moment, the promotional environment. We know it's been heavy throughout this year but as you're looking towards the first half of '13, just wondering if you could tell us what that looks like? Are you seeing a declining need to stimulate demand through promotions?","Howard S. Frank","Well, Felicia, it's a question that covers a number of different brands. But broadly speaking, I think it's fair to say that in order to keep demand going, we have been and will continue to have a fairly heavy spend in promotions and sales. That seems to be driving the business. And if we do it smart and we do it selectively, I think that's fine for us, I think. And that's been -- but that's been going on for quite some time. It really hasn't changed it. Now look, that will vary by brand. Some brands experiencing more demand right now, other brands, a little bit slack demand depending on the markets that they're in. But they're pretty smart guys and as they see -- if they see any kind of revenue fall off or booking fall offs, they're out there with their promotions in order to stimulate the market. I can't answer the question any better than that.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","No, that's actually helpful and gets to the crux of it. And then just in terms of visibility, obviously, you said second -- we all know when you look out that far, but has your visibility improved at all -- I guess what I'm really asking is what is the booking curve look like? Is the nature of the business still very close in, and again, not so concerned about the rest of this year but as we look to early '13, is it still very close in or is that getting -- is the booking curve getting extended a little bit?","Howard S. Frank","For certain brands, it's still pretty -- it's still close in. It's -- you're starting to see some evidence of it pushing out more recently because of the recent increase in bookings over the last quarter, but it's still closer in than it has been historically, so we're starting -- and that's been the pattern. It's more so the pattern in the European brands. We're seeing it more in the European brands but we're also seeing a little bit of it but not quite as much in the American brands.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I wanted to clarify one thing you said, Howard, and then I have a question. Just looking at kind of the incremental rather than the cumulative booking, when you meant -- you made a comment about the last 6 weeks that the first half of 2013 was higher. Was that in volume or in price or was that both? I don't know if I completely caught the specifics of that.","Howard S. Frank","Yes, let me go back and check, but I think -- certainly it was in volume and I think it will depend on the market. David, what's...","David Bernstein","Yes, we did comment in the press release. It was up 9% for the last 6 weeks excluding Costa, and prices were in line with last year's level. And over the same period for Costa, we said the 9% increase is at lower prices.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just looking at Costa and what's happened this year, obviously, it looks like your fleet or yield guidance didn't change that much for Costa, right? And sort of the non-Costa brands that\u2019s gotten a little better and Costa yields maybe still being down, that 15% to 20% for the year. Can you quantify how much of that you expect to be occupancy decline for the Costa brand this year versus price? Because just thinking about recovery in 2013, that the occupancy is easier to see that coming back without having to even think about raising prices, just kind of thinking about that part of the recovery.","Howard S. Frank","Yes, I think, and David looking up the occupancy, the declines year-over-year but when we look at and when we go beyond into the second quarter and third quarters and fourth quarters, a good piece -- I think we're looking for both price and occupancy increases. Clearly, we expect occupancies to get back to more normal levels for the Costa brand. But I think we're also expecting increase in pricing because of the easier comparisons. But a good chunk of what we lost was in 2012. A good part of what we lost was occupancy because we stopped -- we lost all the bookings during wave season when it started for Costa and they didn't really get back into the market any significant until later on in the spring and then still not in a very significant way. So it was a tough year for marketing for Costa. It has been a struggle. But we're starting to see the turnaround but we won't start to really see the numbers until the second quarter of 2013.","David Bernstein","Howard, the occupancy drop was 5% for the year but it was over 11% and almost 6% for the second and third quarters. So there was very significant occupancy hits in the second and third quarters, and third quarter obviously be most important.","Howard S. Frank","Yes. And as I mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we actually -- we're back with the same occupancy year-over-year as you can see that, that's the biggest hit was in that second and third quarter.","David Bernstein","Yes, we're virtually flat in the fourth quarter with occupancy.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Quick follow-up question on Costa. Of the $3 billion to $3.1 billion in EBITDA that Carnival will generate this year, how much of a drag, EBITDA drag was Costa? And then by the same token of the $3.7 billion, $3.8 billion of EBITDA last year, how much did Costa contribute?","Howard S. Frank","Why don't we focus on operating earnings, Harry. Will that work?","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","All right, that's fine. Yes, that's fine.","David Bernstein","Yes, Harry we had said back, I think it was on the March call, that we had expected a decline in about 500 million [indiscernible] to lose...","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Can you start again please? I'm sorry, David. We were interrupted.","David Bernstein","No, that's okay. Back on the March call, we had indicated that we're reducing our earnings as a result of Costa by about $500 million, and that Costa would lose about $100 million this year. So that was what we gave back in March. It turned out to be a little bit better than that but not significantly different.","Howard S. Frank","The swing was $500 million negative.","David Bernstein","The swing was $500 million negative from the December guidance, but the absolute was negative $100 million.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then the second question I had relates to just changes in deployment. If you move a ship from the European or Mediterranean market to Asia, should that generate higher or lower pricing at this point? And what impact does that have on your EBITDA?","Howard S. Frank","Well, let me just mention to you that the Costa ship in Asia this year, which is a single ship of -- the first time we've had a 2,000-passenger vessel, had enjoyed -- actually, because it was very positive revenues and actually stronger revenues than we had for the rest of the Costa brand, but of course, the Costa brand was affected by the events from last January. We're also -- and the reason for moving a second ship to Asia is Costa was the first company to really to start deployments in Asia for the Asian market in China. And for many, many years, we made an investment in terms of taking up some losses. We had, first, a smaller ship, then 2 smaller ships and then we moved to the Costa Victoria, which is a larger ship. We had the Classica there for a while as well. So now, it's going to show a small profit on the one ship in Asia, and that's -- at good prices so we're going to move a second ship over. It's not just China, it's all the other Asian markets as well for Costa, so we expect it to be profitable.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And what sort of pricing -- incremental pricing are you -- do you expect to see over the course of the next 6 to 12 months in Asia?","Howard S. Frank","Well, I don't have that in front of me, and to be honest with you, I haven't -- we're just in the process of starting to review operating plans, and I haven't even looked at the Costa operating plans. We'll start that next week and one of the reasons Micky and Beth are already over in London is we're flying over, David and I are flying over on Thursday and we start our planning and budgeting reviews of each of the brands in Europe next week, later on this week.","David Bernstein","Although, Harry, I can tell you, if you look back, the ship in Asia did better than the average of the Costa fleet in -- or expected to do in 2012, albeit keep in mind that those are depressed yields for Costa in 2012.","Micky M. Arison","You also have to keep in mind, you're talking about one ship on 100-ship fleet, so increased profitability are not on the margin is small compared to the 100-ship fleet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski with Stifel Nicolaus.","Steven M. Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","First of all, I guess the onboard spend was a lot stronger, well, not a lot stronger but a good bit stronger than what we were looking for. Can you just kind of comment, was that across-the-board? And maybe what you're seeing in terms of the European brands and how onboard it's kind of trended over the last couple of months?","David Bernstein","Yes. Onboards have been strong all year. First of all, if you break out just onboards from onboard and other, because the other was impacted, to some degree, as I mentioned, by the accounting change we had for the Alaskan tour operations. But onboard was up a little bit over 3%. It -- excluding Costa, on both sides of the Atlantic in the third quarter, it was up in the neighborhood of 2% to 3% in the first 2 quarters, and we're expecting -- we're forecasting about 2% in the third quarter on a normalized basis. I say on a normalized basis because we had a couple of credits last year from guaranteed payments in the fourth quarter of last year, so if you actually look at the as-reported numbers included in our forecast, onboards would look more flattish to down. But we've had steady increases all year long, and we've been very pleased with that, and it's essentially across all of the major categories. We've seen increases in bar, we've seen casino, shore ex and shops and those 4 categories make up about 80% of our onboard. So we're very pleased.","Steven M. Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then second question, I guess you guys just made a recent change in terms of your commission structure for just the Carnival braid. Is this -- is that something you'll essentially try to push out to the rest of the brands? And then your kind of second question of that is -- has there been much pushback from your agent community?","Micky M. Arison","Yes, we didn't make any change in the commission structure. All we did -- all Carnival Cruise Lines did was play some catch-up on override targets. Virtually all our other brands and most of our competitor brands adjust their override targets based on capacity increases and do it either every year, every other year but do it on a relatively regular basis. Carnival Cruise Lines hadn't done it in 10 years. And so basically, that was a catch-up of capacity increases, which over those 10 years, was 50% and adjusting and also simplifying the override goals. That's all it was.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Could you just talk a little bit more about the capital allocation plans? You did return some cash to shareholders through the $67 million stock buyback this quarter, but you have capacity for much more. Could you just talk about how you're thinking about that, especially versus dividend? And also, David in the past has talked about essentially a variable dividend where you would true up some kind of dividend payout based on your earnings or your cash flow. How is the Board starting to think about these issues over the next 6 to 12 months?","David Bernstein","Steve, you got to keep in mind that our excess free cash flow for this year based off of our September guidance is almost about $400 million. So we have returned in total, I think it's $69 million through the share buyback program this year. So there's not a huge amount of excess free cash flow for 2012, but we will continue to opportunistically buy back shares. As I mentioned, we still have $265 million remaining under the repurchase authorization. Hopefully, that excess free cash flow will continue to increase. And then as it increases, we've got to talk to the Board about the variety of alternatives we have that we've gone through in the past, including a formulaic annual dividend as one option. But at the moment, these are things we're thinking about for the future when the excess free cash flow grows.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And the idea, we're seeing some other companies start to talk about a special dividend, especially this year. Should we assume that's off the table?","Howard S. Frank","Well, look, we have -- Steve, I think it's fair to say we have an October Board meeting, we discuss -- when discussions of dividends, purchases of stock, treasury stock and so on come up, so if there's anything to be said after the Board meeting, we'll make an announcement. But I don't want to suggest that we are going to do anything.","Micky M. Arison","Yes. Special dividend has not been high on our consideration list for this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Two questions. First one, as you look across the different big European markets over the last 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, has any one market either gotten a lot better or a lot worse?","Micky M. Arison","I would say that U.K. and Germany has held up better than we expected in the last 2 conference calls, I would say, a little bit. While Italy, France and Spain struggled -- well, I'd say France did okay. Italy and Spain continue, especially Spain, to be very difficult. And actually surprisingly, Costa, despite having a difficult time pricing-wise, maintained its market share in these markets. They either maintained or even increased market share in these markets. So I thought that was an interesting stat.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Good, that's helpful. And also just with the volatility in the Middle East, has there been any impact to what you're seeing from your either North American or European-sourced business over the last week or so? I know the last 6 weeks had been pretty good, but the last week, have you seen some volatility around kind of the recent events?","Micky M. Arison","We've had some itinerary port cancellations, but we only have -- I think it's -- if you look at '13, about less than 10% of our capacity calling in those kinds of ports. And most of it is behind us for '12. The peak of it is generally in the third quarter. So it hasn't been much of an issue to date. We do have one ship that Costa has a small ship operating next year at the beginning of the year in the Red Sea, and that could be an issue if this continues much longer. But other than that, it's just one small ship really.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Assia Georgieva with Infinity Research.","Assia Georgieva","My first question is with regards to your expectations about wave season 2013. We had a very strong start to wave 2012, and so one would think that unless we have exogenous events, we should probably expect a pretty decent wave 2013. Has the changes in the European economies made you think that it may be less robust than what we saw a year ago or early this year rather?","Howard S. Frank","I think, at this point, each, it's difficult to say. I think that Europe has been soft for a while throughout this year, even last -- throughout '12, even '11, and we're seeing a continuation of it. So the comparisons may not be all that difficult for us in Europe insofar as wave season's concerned. We lost a lot of the wave last year after January. So all the brands were impacted last year's wave. So relatively speaking, we came on strong but then it weakened considerably in 2012. This year, we suspect that it will be a more sustainable wave but we'll have a better picture of it later on in the year when we can see because we haven't really -- a lot of the more marketing starts later in the fourth quarter so we'll have a better sense of it from a demand standpoint. Later in the fourth quarter, we'll see how things go but I think we're feeling pretty positive about the situation. But Europe is challenging but we're there for the long term. It is a strategy that we think will work. We like the European demographics, we like the market. We think we're still -- the market is still considerably under-penetrated relative to other developed markets so we like our investments in Europe from a long-term standpoint and we'll get -- and once we get through this quite -- this difficult economic challenges that we're experiencing, especially in southern Europe, as Micky indicated, I think we'll start to see some stabilization and some very positive results for the company longer term.","Assia Georgieva","Okay. And my second question relates to Costa. I understood that occupancy is flat at present year-on-year. Am I correct in that or did I miss something?","David Bernstein","What we said, it was in the fourth quarter that our expectation was for occupancy to be essentially flat year-over-year.","Howard S. Frank","Right now, the existing occupancy at this point, fourth quarter, they caught up so they're flat year-over-year, relatively.","Assia Georgieva","Okay. And based on that, should we expect that in 2013, instead of a loss -- of the loss of $100 million in operating income that we saw this year, we may see profitability in the $200 million range? Is that in the range?","David Bernstein","We're not at a position, at this point, to give specific guidance on Costa for 2013, but we do expect Costa to do better next year and it will continue to improve. We'll see more improvement obviously in 2014 as well. And so we'll give you more color on that in December.","Howard S. Frank","What I did say in my comments is that we are expecting solid profitability for Costa in 2013. So yes, we will get back to profitability.","Micky M. Arison","You have to remember also that Costa will operate next year with 3 less ships than they had this time last year because we sold the Marina and Allegra and we know what happened to the Concordia. So even if they do very well, they're not going to have the revenue from those 3 potential ships.","Assia Georgieva","But they may get pricing because they have less capacity to sell hopefully?","Howard S. Frank","Hopefully.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lena Thakkar with HSBC.","Lena Thakkar - HSBC, Research Division","Just firstly on Q4 yields. I'm just trying to first square the circle on your guidance of minus 5% to minus 6%, which is similar to where Q3 actually came in. But then in Q3, you said part of 3 percentage points of the 5% were down to Costa, and in Q4, the occupancy goes back to flat versus I think it was minus 6% in Q3. So I'm just trying to understand where the weakness, the incremental weakness comes from. Is that Costa pricing or pricing on brands outside of Costa in Q4 that you're expecting?","David Bernstein","I think one of the things you've got to keep in mind is when you look at the fourth quarter, the onboard and other yields are down considerably from the third quarter because of all of the fourth quarter items that we had last year that I mentioned before in onboard and other. The net passenger revenue is more flattish with the third quarter when you compare the -- when you look at the total company.","Howard S. Frank","But I think what we've said is that Costa's -- on a year-over-year basis, their pricing will come down from the third quarter because fourth quarter is typically a challenging quarter notwithstanding because it's out of season, the demand factors are lower. So we are seeing a narrowing on a year-over-year basis, meaning an improvement in Costa's pricing when you look at it, and we expect that to continue into Q1 as well. So it is getting better. But right now, as we sell, we caught up on occupancies, we're selling at lower prices to do that. That's what I said. I'm not sure if I answered your question but...","Lena Thakkar - HSBC, Research Division","Yes, it was slightly convoluted question, but that's helpful. And then...","Beth Roberts","The fourth quarter for Costa yields were slightly better but it was more pricing than occupancy. And for the rest of the company outside of Costa, we are expecting yields to not show the same level of close-in demand that we enjoyed in the summer season because it's seasonally a little bit weaker in the fourth quarter than you normally would see at for close-in demand during the summer.","Lena Thakkar - HSBC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just a quick one on fuel consumption. Obviously, the reduction there of 5.7% recently is significant. I'm just wondering how we should think about that going into 2013. And what your sort of ambitions are on reducing fuel consumption in the midterm?","Micky M. Arison","We have this question every year now for 3 years. We're working very hard to reduce consumption and we believe that we can continue to do that at significant levels. And I think next year, we'll do it again is my perception.","Howard S. Frank","I don't know that we'll continue to achieve the 6% improvement but...","Micky M. Arison","We're looking 3% for the year, right? We're looking at 3% for the year.","David Bernstein","3% for the year [indiscernible]","Lena Thakkar - HSBC, Research Division","So are there any special measures that you've taken to get it to that 6% level?","David Bernstein","There isn't any one, it's an accumulation of hundreds of little things that we've done over time to get to the 6%.","Howard S. Frank","But there's a lot -- as we go through the next -- this past few years and the next several years going forward, there's a lot of retrofitting of equipment onto the ships to reduce consumption, power consumption, just more sophisticated controls, fan systems and so on. And also, where the opportunity comes up, we can change around itineraries a little bit to get some reduction in fuel costs. So there's a variety of things that we're doing. Also I should mention that from a metric standpoint, as we add ships to the fleet, the newer ships so far are designed for lower fuel consumption, so we're seeing some marginal benefits in those numbers from that as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","There was something in the press release that said due to the timing of certain expenses. Can you refresh our memories on what those expenses might be and if that's a permanent change going forward?","David Bernstein","No, that was just a timing between the third and fourth quarter, and that was part of the reason why our costs were better than we had guided for the third quarter versus the June guidance. The largest item was an adjustment to one of our insurance reserves. We expected the actuary to deliver the report in September, and they delivered it last week in August, so we wound up making a journal entry. There were some other changes in advertising, professional fees, hotel maintenance, et cetera, and it's really just a timing difference between the third and fourth quarter and not a permanent difference for the year or on an ongoing basis.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then has any of the delivery of the ships in the future changed where capacity growth maybe has changed a little bit for the forward years or does that remain the same?","Howard S. Frank","That's the same thing. We haven't changed any delivery dates for the existing order book, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rick Lyall with John W. Bristol.","Richard Ellis Lyall - John W. Bristol & Co., Inc.","Two questions. A follow-up on the fuel conservation question. The 6% number is maybe twice what you guys have realized previously in any quarter. Can you talk about how much was itinerary and how much was onboard efficiency?","David Bernstein","Rick, we don't have the detail between the technology versus itineraries. A tremendous amount of detail we'd have to grow through to try to split that out. We did actually forecast about a 4.5% increase in the third quarter. We did better than we had expected. I mean, I think I've said this in the past. Typically, our maritime guys are a bit conservative. Hopefully, they've been conservative for the fourth quarter as well, and we'll do better than what we're expecting there. But I don't have the detail to break that out.","Richard Ellis Lyall - John W. Bristol & Co., Inc.","Okay. Follow-up question. Just kind of looking at the numbers you cited on Costa. If we think about a $500 million swing and perhaps a $100 million being removed due to capacity adjustments, should we think about your normalized level of profitability for Costa is $300 million?","Howard S. Frank","You mean to get back to the where we were at the prior year?","Richard Ellis Lyall - John W. Bristol & Co., Inc.","Yes.","Howard S. Frank","Yes, I mean, well, as a broad number, you could say that. I mean -- but a lot of the ships that went out -- the capacity that left were the 2 smaller ships in addition to Concordia, so -- they were never very profitable ships to begin with. So there's a devil in details here so I'd rather not to commit to anything like that. But then certainly, they're going to try to get back to as much profitability as they can. But to climb back to where they were before will probably take another 1 year or 2 years beyond 2013.","Richard Ellis Lyall - John W. Bristol & Co., Inc.","Okay. That was my follow-up question, if you'll get there by 3 years would be kind of like a return cliff or return ramp.","Howard S. Frank","We would hope. We would hope that's\u2026","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I apologize. My phone's been going in and out during this call so David, if you already talked about this, my apologies. But you mentioned a few items that would pressure net cruise cost next year. I was hoping you could give us some sort of order of magnitude on those buckets?","David Bernstein","Sure. The largest is the deployment change. They're all fairly similar in size but the deployment change is the largest. The MNOPF or the multi-employer pension plan is worth about $25 million next year. And the Costa occupancy is slightly smaller than that on a unit cost basis, and those are -- that's the relative magnitude of those items.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And of those 3 items, is the multi-employer pension plan kind of true up? Is that a one-time only issue for next year or is it ongoing?","David Bernstein","Well, I'd love to believe that it's one-time only. But we've had this one-time only issue every 3 years now for a number of cycles. Apparently, the way it works is they do an estimate every 3 years and then they bill us. This remember, it's a closed plan so we've got no new members going in or anything like that but we do have to fund the existing commitments. So if, it was a deficit, depending on what the stock market, what happens in the stock market in all their investments over the next 3 years. There could be a deficit or surplus in 2016. If there was a deficit, we would have to fund it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ian Rennardson with Jefferies Capital.","Ian Rennardson - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions for you. First one is the language you used to describe the outlook in the Q3 statement. It's almost the same as you used in the Q2. So I'm just slightly puzzled as to what you think has changed materially for the better in that period? And sort of leading on from that, what would you view as a good result for 2013 net revenue yield increase, what would you be happy with as a management team?","Beth Roberts","I'll answer the first part. The language in the press release is similar with regard to booking volume. Booking volumes were strong both in the period leading up to June and the period leading up to September. In this current outlook, pricing has improved, so we're generating the same level of booking volumes with less price action.","Howard S. Frank","And Ian, on the question of yield expectations for 2013, I think we'll be in a much better position. It's still early for us. After we get through the planning process which starts this week, we'll have a better [indiscernible] We don't have it. We don't have it right now.","Ian Rennardson - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just as a quick follow-up would be, I think either you had or David said that the booking curve was a little bit closer and then historically was the norm. Does that mean that you're outside of those numbers you've given us in the past about 55% to 75% mix quarter out booked or is it sort of still at the bottom end of that?","David Bernstein","We're at the bottom end of the numbers that we've historically given you.","Howard S. Frank","I think what was said was that the North American market is basically in the norm booking pattern-wise, but it's really the European market that's gotten a little bit closer in.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nick Thomas with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Nicholas Thomas - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I realized this will be quite a difficult question to be precise about, but I wonder whether within your full year net yield guidance, excluding the Costa brand, whether you could provide any sort of interim estimate of the extent to which that is negatively impacted as a result of what happened with the Costa Concordia in terms of the disruption to bookings curve at that stage of the year?","Howard S. Frank","Nick, you're right on your introductory comment to that question. It would just be -- it would be a guessing game to know. There are so many -- there was so much noise that we've had in the markets this year apart from the event last January, including deteriorating economies, problems in Greece. I mean, there's just so many factors here, higher airfares this year for North America and flying to Europe and the impact from that. I don't -- I couldn't even begin to guess.","Nicholas Thomas - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Well, is there any validity, I guess, thinking back to the guidance that you gave in December, on a group-wide basis. The guidance excluding Costa now is probably sort of a couple of points worse than that guidance. Does that provide a decent steer? Or is there just too many other things that have occurred subsequently?","Micky M. Arison","Clearly, when the time we gave the December guidance, we were comfortable with that guidance. You can do the math. But a lot of things other than the events of January, as Howard said, has happened. But I think, clearly, and right up until January 13, we were very, very comfortable with that guidance was good or even conservative.","Howard S. Frank","I mean, if you look at our guidance back last December, which was a midpoint of $2.70 a share, if you take out fuel and currency changes which affected us by about $0.30 a share, and just the Costa swing in profit is about $0.64 a share, that more than makes up for the -- for where our mid -- our guidance is of $1.85 today at $0.90, $0.95. So in all other respects, I think we've performed as expected and we gave up a little bit in yield on the outside of Costa with the other brands but we've also saved quite a bit on the cost side. And in fact, I think those 2 elements, if you take them together, probably would've taken us down even further than $1.85. So we've been improved from the operating line if you take fuel and currency and Costa out. And I'm talking about now all the other brands. Just kind of give you a global picture. And then also -- it's also how we see it too. So even though [indiscernible] okay, the other brands did just fine actually, if you take out the fuel part.","Nicholas Thomas - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sure, sure. And then a completely different question if I can. Just in relation to the fact that you have recommenced some share repurchases recently. Is it whilst you're not going to be true on sort of how you will return funds to shareholders. Is it logical given that you did some share repurchasing last year and you did a little bit more recently, that we should be looking at your sort of overall leverage structure maybe on a debt-to-EBITDA basis this year end and then at last year's end, and thinking about that as a level with which the management team is comfortable with, and therefore, going forward, to the extent that you've got excess free cash flow one way or another, whether there\u2019s dividends, special dividends, share buybacks, you'd look to keep that kind of leverage structure in place. Is that a logical way to think about how you think about that issue?","Micky M. Arison","Well, that is -- the answer is yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a follow-up on one of the previous questions with Costa getting back to roughly a $300 million normalized run rate. Would it be reasonable, again, just to clarify a previous answer, you're seeing 2014 or 2015, you'd feel more comfortable in that area without obviously really knowing?","Micky M. Arison","Yes, I mean, they get the capacity back at the end of 2014, so that would give them the opportunity really of getting back fully in 2015. But it's going to take some steps, as Howard said. It's going to take 2 or 3 years but we're going to make a very positive step. We're going to make -- we believe we're going to make a very positive step in the first year.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I apologize if I missed this but just any color on dealing with the increased emissions requirements going forward and some of the things that have been coming out regarding credits and so forth? And I apologize if you made any commentary on that earlier in the call.","Howard S. Frank","No, we didn't comment on the call. We continue to work with EPA to try to come up with an arrangement, at least for the next several years to see if we can do something called averaging, weighted averaging. We haven't been successful but we've got that also from a legislative agenda standpoint in Washington. We're also pushing for a legislative fix to allow us a period of time to demonstrate what we can do on a weighted averaging basis. But I would also say that when it comes to this issue, that there's a number of new technologies that are going on in the R&D area, in research area, that we're very hopeful on that could help us in this respect as well. So we continue to work so that by the time 2015 comes around and these anchors gets spread across the globe, we can mitigate the increased fuel cost. But there's a lot between now and then -- a lot of time between now and then we're hopeful we can get it done yet in one form or another.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And again, also the $180 million guidance that you've given previously on that, that was on a static fleet at that point in time of guidance, and clearly, you've made additional progress since then so even more opportunity beyond now, correct?","David Bernstein","Yes, we'll take a look and update those numbers in our 10-K.","Howard S. Frank","About 2015.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Rollo with Morgan Stanley.","Jamie Rollo - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just two quick ones on cost please. Has your underlying cost guidance changed? I see the one-offs you mentioned but are you still looking for net unit cost of flat to half inflation or are you finding sort of more pressures as your capacity growth slows?","David Bernstein","I think what I was trying to indicate is we have these unique items that are going to affect our cost next year, which would be probably on top of flat to half of inflation is a good way of thinking about it.","Jamie Rollo - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So sort of 1.5% to 2% excludes that cost\u2026","David Bernstein","Excludes the flat to half of inflation, but I'll throw in one other point to think about is that this year, we did have some unique items relating to ship incidences which will go away, which will benefit us to the tune of about 0.5 point. So net, you're probably looking at 1 to 1.5 points on top of flat to half of inflation.","Jamie Rollo - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then the other one is just on your Fun key [ph] guidance for Q4, 739. It's about 20% above the guidance a quarter ago, but wholesale prices up about half that or less? Is there anything else in that number? It looks very high to me.","David Bernstein","Well, you've got to keep in mind that there's also some additional eco requirements in the fourth quarter that weren't in the third because on August 1 is when the eco requirements started, and so that will affect the comparisons that you're looking at.","Jamie Rollo - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","What's the impact for 2013 then on that basis, for the remaining 9 quarters?","David Bernstein","Let's see. On an annualized basis, you're probably looking at an eco impact of let's just say $50 million to $55 million, and probably 1\/3 or 40% of that was in this year so you probably got an incremental $30-odd-million next year.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just quickly, Beth, if you could just give us your second, third and fourth quarter deployment in the Med. And I think Micky said that you have about 10% in eastern Med, just wanted to confirm that?","Beth Roberts","Yes. For the second, third and fourth, you're asking for 2013? I'm just trying to figure out.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, 2013.","Beth Roberts","So 2013, in the Med, we have 6% in first quarter, 17% in the second quarter, 25% in the third quarter, 28% in the fourth quarter and 19% of the full year. And that's both East and West. So of the 19%, roughly half of it is the eastern portion.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And how much was eastern this year in 2012?","Beth Roberts","It was about the same. It was less than 10%.","Operator","Our next question is another follow-up question from the line of Rick Lyall with John W. Bristol.","Richard Ellis Lyall - John W. Bristol & Co., Inc.","Just one last question, guys. What were the unreimbursed or uninsured expenses that ran through your P&L for the Concordia incident?","David Bernstein","It was about $30 million -- well, through the 9 months, about $30 million and that's pretty much it for the year, then maybe another $1 million or something. Not much.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.","Howard S. Frank","Okay. Well, thank you, all very much for your questions and if there's any follow on, I guess people would get in touch with Beth. But everybody have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.","Micky M.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, December 19, 2013.","I will now like to turn the conference over to Arnold Donald, President and CEO. Please go ahead, sir.","Arnold W. Donald","Thank you, Kelly. And good morning, thank you for joining us today, and a sincere happy holidays to everyone.","With me today is our Chairman, Micky Arison; our Chief Financial Officer, David Bernstein; our Vice President of Investor Relations, Beth Roberts. And as Kelly pointed out, I am Arnold Donald, President and Chief Executive Officer of Carnival Corporation & plc. We'll begin with David Bernstein for a review of our financial performance and outlook, and then I will share some prepared remarks before we open it up for the Q&A session.","David?","David Bernstein","Thank you, Arnold.","Before I begin, please note that I must -- that some of our comments on this call will be forward looking. I must refer you to the cautionary statements in today's press release. Also, all of my references to revenue and cost metrics will be in local currency, as this is a much more meaningful measure of business trends.","What I'm going to do is start by walking you through the third quarter of 2013. I'll then recap the full year 2013, give you some insight on the current booking trends and then talk about the guidance for 2014. As part of the guidance, I will give you some explanation on how we reviewed the 2014 cost increase from what we said on the previous conference call.","For the fourth quarter, our non-GAAP EPS was $0.04. The fourth quarter came in $0.04 above the midpoint of our September guidance. This was driven by better-than-expected revenue yields for both net ticket and net onboard. This occurred mainly at Carnival Cruise Lines and was worth $0.05 a share. We also had lower fuel prices and favorable FX rates, which was worth $0.02 a share. All of this favorability was partially offset by the 3% -- or the $0.03 of higher cost.","Now let's look at the fourth quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 3%. Our total net revenue yields in the fourth quarter declined 2%. I will break apart for you the 2 components of total net revenue yields: net ticket yields, and net onboard and other.","First, net ticket yields. Our net ticket yields declined 3%, and this was driven by the North American brands that were down 6% due to promotional pricing at Carnival Cruise Lines and lower yields at the premium brands. Our EAA brands were up almost 2%, driven by increases at Costa that were partially offset by declines in our other European brands.","Net onboard and other yields increased just over 1%. Our EAA brands experienced an almost 2% increase that was tempered by flat yields at our North American brands. However, our North American brands did show a nice improvement from the third quarter.","On the cost side, net cruise costs per available lower berth day, excluding fuel, were up 6.5% versus the prior year, and this was driven by vessel enhancements and higher advertising expense as we invested to accelerate our recovery. This increase was a bit more than we expected in our September guidance, but that was mostly due to the timing of certain expenses between the fourth quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014.","In summary, the fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.10 lower than last year. It was driven by lower net ticket yields and higher net cruise costs, without fuel, partially offset by improved fuel consumption and lower fuel prices.","Recapping the full year 2013. This past year was impacted by voyage disruptions at Carnival Cruise Lines, and as a result, the earnings for 2013 were down. Our non-GAAP EPS was $1.58 versus $1.94 for the prior year. The decrease was driven by a number of things: lower net revenue yields costing $0.42; and higher net cruise costs, without fuel, which cost us $0.40. However, both of these were partially offset by lower fuel consumption per ALBD of 5.3%, which was worth $0.17; lower fuel prices worth $0.14; and everything else together was about $0.15.","For 2013, our total net revenue yields were down 2.6%. The North American brands were down 3%, and again, this was driven by promotional pricing at Carnival Cruise Lines. However, I will say we were very pleased that the surveys show a significant recovery in the brand perception at Carnival Cruise Lines since the voyage disruptions. We benefited from this in the fourth quarter and we expect to benefit from it going forward. In addition, at Costa, the surveys were also very encouraging. They showed an improvement in brand perception, and that led to a 4% yield increase from the prior year. Although Costa had a nice yield recovery, it was more than offset by our other European brands, and that resulted in about a 2% decline in yields for our EAA brands.","On the cost side, a 4.6% increase in net cruise costs, excluding fuel, was driven by a number of factors: voyage disruptions and related repair costs; higher advertising spend; our investments in new market development initiatives in Japan, China and Australia; the vessel enhancement expenses; higher insurance premiums; and lastly, a charge from a closed pension plan for certain British officers.","Turning to our cash flows for 2013. The cash provided by operations was $2.8 billion. And our CapEx, net of asset sales, were $2.1 billion, which left us almost $800 million of free cash flow that was returned to shareholders via the regular quarterly dividend.","Looking forward to 2014. Given our expectations for lower yields in the first half of 2013, which includes the down 3% to 4% for the first quarter, and despite an improving trend, positive yields in the back half of 2014 and improving brand perceptions for both Carnival Cruise Lines and Costa, we are expecting yields for the year to be down slightly. However, keep in mind that it is early. Wave season is still a few weeks away. There is a large capacity increase in the Caribbean starting in the second quarter. And also, we still face ongoing challenging economic environments in Southern Europe.","Turning to recent booking trends. For the first half of 2014, fleetwide volumes during the last 13 weeks have been running well ahead of the prior year, outpacing capacity at prices that are lower. Despite the recent high volumes, the cumulative bookings for the first half on a fleetwide basis are still behind, at lower prices. As a result of the booking trends, we are expecting lower yields in the first half.","Our North American brands are impacted by challenging comps from the first half of last year, as they will book prior to the voyage disruptions that occurred in February. Our EAA brands face ongoing economic environment challenges in Southern Europe, the loss of the attractive Red Sea program and a close-in booking curve that is impacting their first half.","For the third quarter, which by the way is still in the early stages of development, the cumulative fleetwide booking status is that occupancies are similar to last year, while pricing is flat. While our expectations for this quarter are tempered by the large capacity increase in the Caribbean, with a solid cumulative booking status, better booking patterns and the first half ramped-up advertising efforts, we are expecting positive yields in the third quarter. That's why we are forecasting an improving trend as we move from the first to the second quarter and then to the back half of the year.","Looking at our booking patterns by program for each of our 2 segments. For our North American brands, I'll walk you through the Caribbean, Alaska and the seasonal European program.","The Caribbean is behind on both price and occupancy, and this represents 60% of the first half and over 40% of the third quarter capacity for the North American brands. Alaska is behind on price but well ahead on occupancy. Recent booking volumes have been solid, which bodes well for pricing on the remaining inventory. The seasonal European program for our North American brands is showing signs of strength, particularly in the peak summer season, which falls into our third quarter, where we are up nicely in both price and occupancy.","For our EAA brands, the year-round European program, which represents over 60% of the EAA brands' capacity, we are seeing a sequential improvement in year-over-year pricing in each quarter from the first to the third quarter for this program. Booking volumes for these European programs for the last 13 weeks have been nicely higher as well.","Now let me switch to costs and give you some color on net cruise costs, excluding fuel, for 2014. We now expect cost per ALBD to be up only slightly for 2014 even as we continue to invest in the future. This is a much better than the indication that we gave on the September call. At that time, I did say that the numbers were preliminary and that we would be visiting each of our operating companies to review their 2014 plans.","A number of factors came together to reduce the increase. As I previously mentioned, our year-over-year comparison did benefit from the timing of certain expenses between the fourth quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014, and that resulted in about a 0.5 point year-over-year impact. In addition, we found ways to do some of the vessel enhancements in service, thereby reducing dry dock days in 2014. Furthermore, through increased collaboration and cooperation amongst our operating companies, we do expect to see cost reductions in a number of areas. For 2014, we are also benefiting from favorable exchange rates and lower fuel prices, as well as some investments we made in fuel consumption, and we do expect an additional 4% improvement in fuel consumption for the year.","So putting all these factors together, for 2014, our non-GAAP EPS guidance is $1.40 to $1.80 per share, with a midpoint that is similar to 2013's non-GAAP EPS.","At this point, I will turn the call back over to Arnold.","Arnold W. Donald","Okay, thank you, David.","Although 2013 was clearly a challenging year for our company, we nevertheless enjoyed several significant accomplishments. So for example, we made real progress in our Asia growth strategy, doubling our cruise presence in China and successfully launching an inaugural home port in Japan. We opened 5 China offices; a second office in Japan; as well as offices in South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore, all of which will support our 2014 Asian sourcing, which is again expected to double. We are moving quickly to ensure that we are well positioned to capitalize in this important growth region.","Also in 2013, through our 2 innovative new ships AIDAstella and Royal Princess, through ship retirements and through new technology, we have enhanced our fleet and improved efficiency. AIDAstella and Royal Princess are both among the most efficient ships at sea today from both a unit cost and fuel efficiency standpoint, which allows them to produce returns significantly higher than our fleet average. We are also -- retired a smaller, less-profitable Costa vessel. Of course, the upgrading of our fleet is a continuous process. We also announced a more efficient Seabourn ship to replace the 3 smaller original ships in 2016.","And in 2013, we announced many exciting new product features to our guest experience, taking our guest experience to new heights, including several new dining concepts, American TABLE, American FEAST, as well as the continued rollout of the extremely popular Guy\u2019s Burger Joint developed with Food Network personality Guy Fieri.","We intend -- we introduced new bar concepts as well, including the industry's first shipboard brewery that brews beer from purified seawater on our AIDA line, the Latin-infused Havana bar; as well as the continued rollout of the cocktail-pharmacy-themed Alchemy Bar, the E&A -- EA SPORTS Bar and the very popular RedFrog Pub, all on our Carnival brand.","We introduced new entertainment concepts, including a Vegas-like water-and-lights show on deck on Princess; Dancing with the Stars: At Sea, our partnership with the hit ABC show in the U.S, on our Holland America Line; and on our P&O U.K. line, Strictly Come Dancing, partnering with BBC in the U.K.; as well as the continued rollout of the popular B.B. King's Blues Club on Holland America and the Hasbro game show and the Punchliner Comedy Club presented by George Lopez on the Carnival line.","For families, we unveiled Carnival Seuss at Sea, an exclusive partnership with Dr. Seuss Enterprises; additional WaterWorks aqua parks; a new ropes course; and an interactive laser game on the Costa line.","Our product offering for guests across our fleet has never been better, and there will be more exciting announcements after the New Year.","This year, we also embarked upon a number of travel agent outreach programs domestically and abroad. We are gaining traction with our newly introduced Agent Matters program in the U.K.; and here in the U.S., our Carnival Conversations launched in June. That's truly resonated with our travel partners as we implemented a number of initiatives based on agent feedback, making it even easier to sell a Carnival Cruise. And as you know, Carnival Cruise Lines also launched a creative new national advertising campaign featuring the vacation moment testimonials from some of our millions of fulfilled guests. We also unveiled the Great Vacation Guarantee, an unprecedented money back guarantee. These efforts have already borne fruit as we have realized a significant improvement in brand perception and consideration for the Carnival line, already restoring 75% of the drop in perception it experienced earlier this calendar year.","We have so far experienced a faster recovery for the Carnival brand than originally anticipated, and our team is working very hard to keep that momentum going. However, we do recognize the limited visibility we have at this point to the peak summer season, where we generate most of our annual profits, and we are very cognizant of the particularly high-capacity growth for the core Caribbean product beginning in the second quarter. So we maintain a level of caution in our focus on identifying additional signs that the pace of recovery we're experiencing is, in fact, sustainable.","We have taken a hard look at costs and attacked our challenges head on. I'm very proud of the creativity in our team to execute successfully at lower costs than originally anticipated and, very importantly, without compromising, without compromising on critical investments we need to make to provide the foundation for the growth we expect in return on invested capital, earnings and free cash flow over time.","In my first 6 months, I have affirmed what I knew at a visceral level as a board member: the inherent strength of this organization clearly lies in our people. They are passionate and they are dedicated worldwide. Our core product is clearly the best vacation value there is, and of course, our scale gives us tremendous opportunity for improved performance. We have more than 100 ships and 10 million guests each year, twice that of the next largest player the industry. With 78 million passenger cruise days, we have a tremendous opportunity to accelerate earnings growth by leveraging our scale.","Operating our brands independently has been successful and it has led to our industry-leading position. The brands will remain independent, especially at the guest interface level, as they become increasingly distinct in the psychographics of the guests they source and they service.","Going forward, we do plan to change the focus of our efforts in how we work together across the brands to enable us to leverage our scale. And we want to leverage it far more than we have historically, through greater communication, through collaboration and through cooperation across the 10 brands. We will more fully capitalize on the inherent opportunity that our scale affords us. We have already announced a realignment of our leadership team and have begun to change our work processes and our incentive structure to facilitate these efforts. Our reconfigured leadership team has identified a plethora of opportunities to work together, both on the revenue side and the cost side. On the revenue side, we are collaborating on onboard revenue initiatives and revenue management practices, including consolidating our efforts toward optimizing our pricing models. On the cost side, we are increasing cooperation on procurement, inventory management and port planning. We have begun to mine our opportunities by sizing and prioritizing these and many other initiatives.","Our leadership team is driven around the principle that we have the greatest vacation value there is. It is difficult, given the diversity of incredible vacation moments we offer, it is difficult, if not impossible, for guests to achieve the same fulfillment with a land vacation at anywhere near the cost or ease that characterizes our cruise vacations. The inherent value is so great, we simply need to consistently exceed guest expectations, make certain that each guest experiences the brand that's right for them and ensure that they are just wowed when they leave, and that wowed is W-O-W-E-D, wowed. A thrilled guest will advocate for our brands, word of mouth is the most influential method to stimulate new demand. As we increase advocacy for our product, that demand will drive ticket prices higher.","Over time, we expect to benefit from the combined efforts of our leadership team and our 120,000-plus global employees. We will continue to invest in prudent ways to accelerate the recoveries in Costa and Carnival that are already underway. And we are ardently focused on delivering a customer experience that surpasses even the high levels we achieve today, driving greater advocacy in each of our brands. We will capitalize on our tremendous product attributes and our industry-leading scale, and through our combined efforts, I have great confidence in our ability to execute and deliver on the expectations that we have set for ourselves, realizing our company's true earnings power and driving significant free cash flow and, importantly, delivering against our objective of returning our company to double-digit returns on invested capital.","Kelly, we'd now like to open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Robin Farley from UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I have 2 questions. First is, I wonder if you could comment on kind of occupancy on the Carnival brand. In particular, you have talked about holding occupancy length. Price dropped a little bit in Q4. I'm just wondering to what degree you did that in Q4 and how you will approach that going forward. And then secondly, your comments about the EAA brands being up 2%, but with others -- Costa up and others down, is that suggesting that Costa's pricing was up maybe 5% or something? I just would love to hear a little more color on that because that would be very encouraging.","David Bernstein","Sure. As far as the occupancy is concerned, we did see Carnival sail with some empty cabins in the back half of the year. That was just a couple of points of occupancy down from their historic numbers. The EAA brands, keep in mind that there are 6 brands in total. The Costa yields were actually up double digits in the fourth quarter and the other brands were down and offset that, which is how we wound up with the overall 2%.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And so is it reasonable to think that, the Costa brand, if this is the first quarter of pricing recovery, that rate of recovery would continue in the next couple of quarters for Costa as well?","David Bernstein","We did see pricing recovery, but it is early, given the booking trends where it is early. And when -- we don't normally give specific guidance by brand as we move forward. But keep in mind, for Costa, the deployment has changed quite a bit and particularly in the winter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix from Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","David, thanks for the color on how the cost guidance changed. I know a lot of people were worrying -- wondering about that this morning. You mentioned that -- in addition to some of the color you gave us, you mentioned that the company is going to see cost reductions in a number of areas, which is a bit of a generic way to describe that. So just wondering if you could give us some specific examples of how that -- how you are seeing cost reductions there. And as we think about the various cost line items that drive your overall net cruise costs, x fuel, wondering about how we should think about each of these for '14, in other words, how to think about payroll and food and SG&A, that sort of thing.","David Bernstein","Robin -- I'm sorry, Felicia, sorry. I don't want to go into all the detailed line items in terms of cost on a year-over-year basis because there's a lot of changes. There's product initiatives that we're investing in. There's a number of areas we found cost savings. But I think I can provide a little additional color. I mean, Arnold had mentioned the cooperation and collaboration in areas like ports and procurement and inventory management. The way these things translate, I'll give you an example: In North America, we looked at all the commercial printing. There were over 70 vendors that we were using on -- for different types of printing. We rationalized those vendors. We got better contracts for all the brands collectively. We now only have a handful of vendors, each doing different things. And we're saving millions of dollars. This is particularly important when you think about the fact that Carnival Cruise Lines is committed to now printing brochures again, which will -- they can do in a much more efficient manner and save us some additional money. So it's things like that, that will bode well for 2014. And there's lots of little examples that add up to many millions of dollars around the corporation.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the revenue side, the pricing survey work that we do implies that the company -- or just the -- some of the brands are doing some significant base loading in the second quarter. I was just wondering if you could talk about the traction you're getting as you're trying to implement that strategy. And when you look out that far, are you seeing a more normalized booking curve?","David Bernstein","As I think I had indicated, I mean, the booking volumes for the first half are up, but they are up at lower prices. Clearly, as we've said a number of times over the last year, where we are, we are at the lower end of -- or slightly below our historical booking curve. So we are trying to catch up. We are encouraged by the volumes. And so it's hard to relate to the scraping that you do because the scrapings, in many cases, only relate to prices on a few cabins and not to the overall yield trend for us. So hopefully, that provides you some additional color.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Kent from Goldman Sachs.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sure, a couple of questions. First, are you -- on close-in bookings, are you seeing any improvement as you get closer to departure? And then more broadly, on the Costa and Carnival brands, any sense on when those brands recover to pre-incident levels?","Arnold W. Donald","On the recovery -- this is Arnold. On the recovery of Costa and Carnival, we said in previous calls that, traditionally, other industries, other incidents, 2 to 3 years for recovery. The Costa recovery has been impeded somewhat by the weak European economy and just the weakness in a lot of the markets where Costa sources their passengers. But we are seeing lifting in yields and occupancy in Costa, but the recovery may take longer than the 2- to 3-year norm that","[Audio Gap]","Operator","Our next question comes from Harry Curtis from Nomura Securities.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just to follow-up on a couple of prior questions. Can you give us a sense of -- your cumulative bookings for the first half of the year, you said they're still behind. Can you put a number behind that in terms of your occupancy today, looking into the first quarter versus where it was a year ago? Or I'm just wondering to what extent you're behind.","[Technical Difficulty]","Arnold W. Donald","Sorry, everyone, it seemed to have dropped. We have no idea what happened, but we apologize. I'm not sure exactly where we dropped and where we were in the comments. So I'll just repeat the answer to the question to make sure we covered it.","Concerning the Costa and Carnival, as I was saying, the Costa recovery has been somewhat impaired by the weak situation in the European markets where a number of the passengers are sourced. So we are seeing some delay. However, the Costa yields are trending up, as is occupancy. With regards to Carnival, we've experienced some accelerated recovery in Carnival, experiencing that and especially here in the fourth quarter, the fourth quarter that just closed, but we are cautious looking forward to make certain we have a clear view after the wave season given the added capacity that's going into the Caribbean. But at this point, certainly, the Carnival recovery is a little bit ahead of that 2- to 3-year time frame that is conventional kind of thinking concerning recovery of brands that have suffered incidents.","David Bernstein","And as far as the question about the last-minute bookings, for the fourth quarter, clearly, the last-minute bookings were strong and better than we expected, particularly at Carnival Cruise Lines, which is why we exceeded the guidance. We have anticipated within our guidance for 2014 good bookings throughout the year, particularly the last minute, which is all baked into our best estimate of guidance where yields are down slightly for the year.","Arnold W. Donald","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jaime Katz from the Morningstar.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Can you guys talk a little bit more about some of the advertising and marketing spend you guys are doing in 2014, and how you expect the cadence of that to occur? And then just any changes to your CapEx spending in the years ahead, would be helpful.","Arnold W. Donald","Yes, I'll comment on the advertising spend, to an extent, and then I'll have David comment additionally on the CapEx. Concerning advertising, in the fourth quarter, we clearly invested heavily in Carnival, but we also invested across a number of other brands to generate demand. And that is continuing into the first quarter of next year. For the full year, we'll be substantially ahead in 2014 in total advertising spend versus what we spent, say, in 2012. And we'll also have an increase over what we've spent cumulatively in 2013 as well. So we are investing more heavily broadly in advertising and promotion to stimulate demand. David?","David Bernstein","Sure. Yes, the expected CapEx for 2014 is $2.9 billion. For '15, it's $2.8 billion; and for '16, it's $2.9 billion.","Operator","And we have a follow-up question from Harry Curtis.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So the question I was coming back to was just your cumulative bookings. You mentioned we're still behind for the first half of 2014, and I was wondering if you could put a little more color behind that.","David Bernstein","Yes, Harry, we don't get into a lot of detail. I mean, we are a couple of -- a number of percentage points behind. A lot of this has to do with what happened throughout 2013. But in some cases, some of our brands felt that they would rather be patient. We could have moved the booking curve closer in by lowering price, but in many cases, you're better off being patient waiting, holding your price, knowing very well that the bookings will come at a higher price. So we are trying to manage that, as we always do, and hopefully, we will maximize the yields for 2014.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So at this point, you're just not -- they're close enough to last year that you're not panicking, in other words.","David Bernstein","Oh, no, no, no. It -- believe me, if -- we never let the bookings get too far behind. The -- we're always carefully managing that on a voyage-by-voyage, cabin-by-cabin category basis.","Beth Roberts","And I think it's fair to say we...","Arnold W. Donald","Beth has a comment. Go ahead.","Beth Roberts","It's fair to say we've gone up a few...","David Bernstein","Percentage points over the last 13 weeks, that's correct.","Arnold W. Donald","[indiscernible] bookings went up [ph]?","David Bernstein","Yes. Yes, the booking volumes [indiscernible] 13 weeks have been significantly better and we did catch up a few points.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And then moving to my second question. Regarding Asia, can you just remind us how much capacity that you have there now and what your plans are to expand, and expectation for pricing, and kind of returns per berth versus what your other opportunities in Europe and in the Caribbean?","David Bernstein","Yes. Overall, Asia is probably about 5% of our capacity for 2014. The yields in Asia are a little bit below the overall corporate average. We have talked a lot about a continued expansion into Asia. So you'll hear more about that in the future. And as far as the returns, keep in mind that it is early and we are continuing to invest, particularly in the advertising and promotion, throughout the region. So it is fair to say that the returns in Asia at the moment aren't where we'd like them to be, but we do expect over time for them to increase and we do expect it to be a solid part of our business in the future.","Micky M. Arison","Expect to double the number [indiscernible].","Arnold W. Donald","Yes, we've sourced 0.25 million passengers and we'll be doubling that to over 0.5 million in 2014.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Wieczynski from Stifel.","Steven M. Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So without actual quantitative yield guidance out there for 2014, you're just, at this point, saying down slightly. What are maybe the 2 or 3 swing factors that could be -- that could be a brand, that could be a specific market, that would drive those yields either to positive territory, say, 1% or 2%, or down 1% or 2%?","David Bernstein","That's a -- it's a tough question. I think the whole concept here is, as I said before, it's early, there's a lot of uncertainty. The brands are recovering. So it...","Arnold W. Donald","Pre-wave.","David Bernstein","It's pre-wave. So we're not giving a specific number, but clearly, we will have a much better indication during the wave season. And so by the time we get to March, I think we will be in a much better position because, as we've said before, that during the wave season, a big chunk of the third quarter, which as Arnold said is a lot of our profitability is booked, so we'll have a much better feel for where we are for the year when we get to March.","Steven M. Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then on the fuel consumption side, you're forecasting that to be down again in 2014, which is pretty impressive given that, that would be 3 years in a row. So can you help us think about what's driving that consumption down, and how much more of that is to come in the future?","David Bernstein","Yes. Well, I guess, in terms of the future, we've been consistently saying that there are so many things we're working on, on the horizon. And by the way, we do have 101 ships, so not every ship have we implemented every single fuel consumption savings yet. So as the ships go into dry dock, we continue to roll out new things. And we do expect, as we've said, in the long term, 2% to 3% fuel consumption reduction each year for about as far out as we can see. We're talking 4% for next year. We did a little bit better. And these things come both in tweaking the itineraries and also in new technology that we put on board the ship. One of the things that has been a great fuel saver is -- are the air conditioning, the HVAC systems. HVAC probably represents 25% of our fuel consumption. And anybody who owns a house knows that if they install a new air-conditioning compressor versus maybe the 10- or 15-year-old one that they had in their house, they're going to save on their electric bill. Well, the same thing works true on a cruise ship. So we are -- that's part of our CapEx. We are installing those things, as well as lots of other things which create savings for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Assia Georgieva with Infinity Research.","Assia Georgieva","David, maybe you can help me with a couple of quick questions. Occupancy in Q2 versus Q1, do you feel that it is ahead? Or do you -- are you -- are the brands still holding on Q2?","David Bernstein","The whole first half was behind. I didn't give any specific color by quarter, but the whole first half is -- was behind at this moment but catching up. Both quarters are catching up at this point. The bookings for both quarters are good. So that's why, instead of going through the details for each quarter, I just tried to give the whole first half summary. And it's pretty much the same for first versus second, except the first is further booked than the second at this point, which is what you would expect.","Assia Georgieva","Right. And could you quickly give us the capacity increases by quarter? And you don't have to go through North American versus the EAA, if you can just give us the quick number for the corporate total.","David Bernstein","Sure. Hang on one second. Let's see, the first quarter is 1.8%; second quarter, 4.9%; third quarter, 2.2%; third (sic) [fourth] quarter, 2.5%...","Beth Roberts","Fourth quarter.","David Bernstein","Fourth quarter, 2.5%; and the full year is 2.8%.","Assia Georgieva","Great. This is very helpful. And I will try to ask this question. It probably won't get answered. But when you use the same kind of language that Howard likes to use, down slightly, should we be thinking down 1% to 2%, or down 3% for the fiscal 2014 yields?","Micky M. Arison","You were right at the start of the question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ian Rennardson from Jefferies.","Ian Rennardson - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Two or 3 questions, please. Would you consider retiring more ships? And if so, how many in '14 and '15? Secondly, could you give us some idea on your initial thoughts, I know it's a long way away, but on your cost, x fuel, for '15, what sort of plans do you have there in for 2015? I'm also slightly intrigued by the wide range of the earnings forecast at $1.40 to $1.80. Why would you -- you've already said that you're behind on the historic booking curve, so what gives you the -- even the comfort to give such a wide range as that? And then finally, just could you just strip out of those CapEx numbers you gave, David, what is maintenance, what is newbuild, please?","Arnold W. Donald","Okay, concerning the first portion of the question, in terms of lay up or selling off ships, obviously, we evaluate that on an ongoing basis all the time. Clearly, we took out a Costa vessel this year. But if a vessel is not sustaining its contribution over time, obviously, we'll lay it up. And then as some vessels age, when there is a market -- and as you know, there's not a big secondary market for these ships. When there is a market, we'll divest of it. But that's an ongoing evaluation. And we look for sustained indications to make a decision, but we have no problems whatsoever laying up or discontinuing ships that are not contributing. In terms of the costs for 2015, at this point, I'd say that, obviously, we will continue with our focus on costs. We will continue to invest to stimulate demand and innovate our products to drive ticket yields and revenues because that's the bigger engine, but we will continue to focus on cost. And through the collaboration and coordination across the brands, we're expecting to show good cost performance going forward.","David Bernstein","I think, on the cost side, the only thing I'd like to add is we have said a number of times that we expect net cruise costs, excluding fuel, to be flat to half of inflation in the long term. We hope that we can do better than that, and we strive to do better than that, but that's a good starting point for guidance for '15 going forward. As far as the range is concerned, traditionally, we had given a range of, let's say, $0.20 in December. If you look back, that's where most of the years were. Because of the greater degree of uncertainty, we widened the range. And there wasn't any particular magic to the $0.40 range. Keep in mind that every percentage point on yield is $0.15. So what we're talking here is a range that maybe is a little over 2 percentage points on yield. Percentage points of cost is $0.09. So that's got to be factored in as well. But that gives you some indication. And we do feel comfortable with the range, and that's why we put it out there.","Micky M. Arison","I would also say, with the issue of having 2 brand recoveries going on and being behind in booking patterns, of how wave shakes out becomes increasingly important. And so sitting here and having to give guidance before wave is just much more difficult in this situation than it would be in a normal operating environment. So it was just a prudent decision to broaden the range.","David Bernstein","And the last question as far as the CapEx is concerned, for 2014, it's about $1.4 billion of non-newbuild. It's also $1.4 billion for 2015. And for 2016, it's about $1 billion of non-newbuild CapEx.","Ian Rennardson - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","But just to confirm: no current plans to retire any ships in '14 or '15.","Micky M. Arison","Not making any announcements today.","Arnold W. Donald","Right. Yes, no announcements.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Conder from Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of other items here. Can you just reframe for us -- the, I think, Costa yields in 2012 were down 15%, you've stated that before. And then we had some recovery. Can you just remind us the recovery we've seen by year in Costa, and then just how the Carnival brand yields impacted for the full -- were impacted for the full year?","David Bernstein","Sure. Costa, you're right, it was down about 15% in 2012, and the recovery was 4% in 2013. And we do expect to see continued recovery in 2014. The Carnival yields, keep in mind that the first half for -- particularly the first quarter for Carnival Cruise Lines was very strong. So the yields for the year were down, like, in the mid-single digits. The back half of the year was obviously a tad higher than that.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay. And then Arnold, you talked about multiple initiatives here, not only today but prior, and it sounds like there's more detail still coming. If we back up, and as you've had some time now to frame everything, is there any, I guess, guesstimate at this point as to what new normalized cost, x fuel, would be on a go-forward basis and, I guess, relative to where they were in '11, so pre-Concordia?","Arnold W. Donald","Yes, I would say that the comment David made earlier about keeping costs flat to half of inflation is the best guidance we can give at this point. But clearly, we're just beginning the process of building on the base of collaboration that existed across the brands and expanding on that significantly, with incentives, with processes, et cetera, in place to capitalize on it. And as we find those opportunities and execute against them, we'll share it along the way and the picture will reveal itself over time. But at this point, we do not have a new target set or anything of that sort.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, if you could give a little more color on the -- what was going on in the other North American premium brands? You called that out in your preamble, that there were a little bit of pressures there. Just a little more color on that, please.","Arnold W. Donald","Well, there is a combination of factors that have affected both Holland America and Princess. Part of it is a portion of their business is sourced from Europe, where in 2013, the consumer base was a bit weaker than it had been in the past, and significantly weaker. It's also fair to say that there has been a significant supply increase in the premium segment in some areas in recent years. And our brands were coming from an above-industry-level performance in a number of the segments they participate in and continue to be above industry in a number of the segments. So on a year-to-year comparison, I think those are some of the contributors, and there are others. At the same time, the team is working very hard to stimulate demand and improve it. And we're very pleased with the response we're seeing right now in the booking volumes. And particularly in Europe, and we're very high on our premium brands.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick Scholes from SunTrust.","Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","There was pretty negative investigative report out from CNN this week concerning the Triumph. I wonder if you have any type of official response to that report.","Arnold W. Donald","Well, I think the -- first of all, the language quoted on the network that did it is not from our ticket contract. They pulled some information out of context from a motion to dismiss the suit. It's a frivolous suit. We stand behind our product. We stood behind it after the Triumph incident. We immediately refunded passengers their cruise fare, we gave them a future cruise. We arranged for food and lodging and transportation. And we gave each passenger an additional $500 to cover expenses. Our ships our safe, they're sound and they're sea worthy. And we've always stood behind our product and we'll continue to do so. But it's a frivolous suit. I'm disappointed they got any airtime whatsoever. And again, even with that, it was still mischaracterized on air.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Hollins from Investec.","James Hollins - Investec Securities (UK), Research Division","Two questions from me, please. The first one is on the scrubbing technology. I was wondering if the sort of technology you're putting in now would actually erase any issues around the stricter emission control air [ph] compliance coming in, I believe, 2015. I think you've previously guided to that maybe being a $265 million extra cost in '15. I was wondering if that is now sort of lower than that. And the second one's a more generic question which you can choose to answer in any way you like, Arnold. But are the sort of changes you're putting through now -- obviously, you've been there 6 months. Are they -- should we consider them as sort of incremental changes to bring down the cost based? Or are you sort of starting a more fundamental cultural change within the group, which should see quite a few changes in the way the actual business operates?","Arnold W. Donald","Yes, I think I'll answer the latter part first, and then we'll get to your energy question. But with regard to the culture, it is a fundamental change in culture, but is building on things that the leaders in the organization were kind of doing one-off or in pairs occasionally, anyway, and that is collaborating and coordinating, okay? And so that is the culture change, though, because the brands were fiercely independent in the past and even protected information from each other. And so it's absolutely a culture change. Now in terms of the fundamental changes in how we work or the scale of targets and that sort of thing, the reality is we just have scale. So with 78 million passenger cruise days, little tiny changes adds up -- add up to significant dollars, tens and tens of millions of dollars and hundreds of millions of dollars. And so while they're small changes, they yield big impact. And by working together, communicating, collaborating, there are so many arenas that the team has already pre-identified. And as I mentioned, we're in the process of sizing those and prioritizing them from a complexity, investment required, time to realization, all your normal things you would apply to prioritize projects and go after them. So there are significant opportunities. With regards to the energy, and I'll let David make a few comments as well, but first of all, I just want to say that, absolutely, the scrubber technology helps us mitigate a lot of the emission standard costs that were referred to earlier. And in fact, with the scrubber technology, we'll be well above the emission standards without having to burn, in many instances, the higher-grade fuel, which clearly will mitigate those costs. But I think David had a couple of other comments. Go ahead, David.","David Bernstein","Yes. The testing on the scrubbers still is very positive and everything seems to be going very well. We're in the process of updating that calculation that you mentioned, where last year, we disclosed the $265 million impact. At this point, it's fair to say that more than the majority of that $265 million will disappear, so the number will be less than half, but it's a little early for me to give the exact number. It's a complicated calculation that looks at all 101 ships and looks at the itineraries in 2014 that we have out there. And we'll disclose -- some more details in our 10-K. But it's fair to say it's more than the majority will disappear.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just a few questions. I guess, first on fuel costs, if you could talk about what you expect for that fuel cost per metric tonne for the full year, I think that'd be helpful. And then at the event in November, you had talked about a few things, including web traffic improving for the Carnival brand through November. I'm just curious whether that's continued into December, and if there are any corollaries to the marketing message you've been broadcasting for Carnival that are learnings that you could extrapolate to the other brands in terms of the marketing philosophy or methodology?","David Bernstein","Okay, as far as the fuel price per metric tonne, Sharon, it was in the press release. The full year is $650 per metric tonne on 3.2 million metric tonnes. So that's our fuel expense for 2014. As far as the web traffic is concerned, I personally haven't gotten an update on that. I will say that we have seen a uptick in overall web bookings from the prior year, a couple of percent. And as far as the marketing is concerned...","Arnold W. Donald","What was the question?","David Bernstein","Oh, Sharon, can you repeat the marketing question?","Arnold W. Donald","Can you repeat the marketing question, Sharon?","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Yes. So it seems like you've had some success with the Carnival marketing, and I'm just curious whether there are any learnings from what you've done with Carnival that could be extrapolated to the other brands?","Arnold W. Donald","I think, 2 things. One is, a little early to tell, but I would say that I think the marketing, the advertising campaign for Carnival helped all brands, ours and others in the industry as well. Even though it was, for us, Carnival-specific, it gave a general cruise message as well, and I think it helped everyone. Each of the brands have their own particular marketing approach. They are all investing heavily in that, and we expect to see good results across the brands from their individual efforts.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And just as a follow-up, David. Just so you know, I don't think that table was actually included for the full year for fuel prices and so on -- oh, wait, now I see it. Never mind.","David Bernstein","It's okay. No problem.","Arnold W. Donald","Okay, not a problem.","David Bernstein","People make that mistake once in a while.","Operator","And our last question comes from Richard Carter from Deutsche Bank.","Richard A. Carter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple of questions, please. Firstly, on marketing, do you see the step-up in marketing costs this year as recurring? Or do you see the potential for them to step back down in 2015? And then secondly, on onboard spend, is it possible -- I think it was up 4% in Q4. Can you break that down between North America and Europe? And it's obviously been improving now the last couple of quarters, and some of your competitors have seen some very strong onboard spend inflection in the last couple of quarters. So could you just talk a little bit about what's driving that as well, please, and if you can, what your expectation and outlook is on onboard spend going into '14?","Arnold W. Donald","On the marketing spend going into 2015, obviously, we'll look at the results we get in 2014. We'll make an assessment of whether pulse spending is the proper way to go in some of the brands. And so it's too -- it'd be premature now to predict exactly what would occur in 2015, but what I can assure you is that we will invest, we will learn from the investments and we'll continue to invest when we believe we can get a return for it. And so if we invest more heavily in the future, we would anticipate that it would be driving additional profits to the bottom line and, more than likely, yields as well at the ALBD level. So that would be the comment on that. Dave is trying to look up the other...","David Bernstein","On the onboard spend, overall, for 2012, we were just up 0.5%. I mean, the fourth quarter in constant dollars was up 1.2%. And I think I had said previously that the fourth quarter was driven by about a 2% increase in EAA and that was tempered by the North American yields being flat. Flat in the fourth quarter for North America was an improvement, I had indicated over the third quarter. So the trend seems to be in the right direction. Given where we were for 2013, what we built into the 2014 guidance was yields up a little over 1%. We are doing lots of different things on the onboard revenue side to booster that number up. Our operating companies, some of them, are continuing to roll out the all-inclusive drink program; the high-end photography; and other things. So we are looking to see better yields, and I hope we can beat that number.","Arnold W. Donald","I want to thank everyone for your support and interest in our company. And thank you for being on the call. A sincere happy holidays to everybody. Kelly, thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Welcome to the fourth quarter 2012 earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, December 20, 2012.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Frank, the Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Howard S. Frank","Good morning, and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to the Carnival Corporation conference call. With me this morning is Micky Arison, David Bernstein and Beth Roberts, and we are all here in Miami on the call.","Let's start the call. I'm going to turn it over to David, and he can take you through the fourth quarter and the year 2012. David?","David Bernstein","Thank you, Howard. Before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this conference call will be forward-looking. I will refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release. Also, all of my references to revenue and cost metrics will be in local currencies, therefore unless otherwise noted, as this is a more useful measure of our business trends.","Our non-GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.13. The fourth quarter came in $0.04 above the midpoint of our September guidance despite a $0.02 impact from Hurricane Sandy. The improvement was driven by higher net revenue yields worth $0.05, as pricing on close-in bookings was 1% better than expected, a trend similar to last quarter. And lower fuel prices, combined with more favorable currency exchange rates, positively impacted the results by $0.03. Both of these improvements were partially offset by higher-than-expected net cruise costs, excluding fuel, costing $0.04 per share.","Now let's look at our fourth quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 2.7%. The North American brands were up 3.7%, while Europe, Australia and Asia brands -- or as we call them, our EAA brands -- were up 1.2%. Our total net revenue yield decreased 4.5 points in the fourth quarter but showed sequential improvement versus the third quarter. It should be noted that almost half of the decline in the fourth quarter was driven by Costa. Excluding Costa, net revenue yields decreased 2.4%, driven by a 4% decline in net ticket revenue yields, and that was partially offset by a 2% increase in net onboard and other revenue yields.","With respect to our net ticket yields, the North American brands were down 3.7%, driven by declines in late fees in Europe and Alaska, while yields in the Caribbean and all of the remaining itineraries held up relatively well during the quarter. Excluding Costa, our EAA brands' net ticket yields were down slightly less at 3.4%, driven by the European brands, while net ticket yields in Asia were up nicely. For net onboard and other yields, again excluding Costa, the increase was 2%, with increases on both sides of the Atlantic and in all major categories of onboard revenue.","On the cost side, net cruise cost per available lower berth day, excluding fuel, was down 1% versus the prior year. The decline was less than we expected in our September guidance. As I have said in the past, it's very difficult to estimate the timing of many of our expenses by quarter, and therefore, the better measure of net cruise cost performance is on an annual basis.","As a result of our ongoing efforts to reduce fuel usage, our consumption per ALBD declined 4.4% this quarter, thus continuing a multiple-year savings trend. Fuel prices this quarter were up 5% versus the prior year, which cost us $0.04.","In summary, the fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.13. This was lower than 2011 earnings of $0.28 per share, driven primarily by lower operating income at Costa.","Now looking at the full year 2012. As Micky stated in the earnings release, this past year has been the most challenging year in our company's history as a result of the Costa Concordia incident. The ship incident had a profound impact on each and every employee of the company, both shoreside and shipboard, and has driven all of us to reinforce our commitment to the safety of our guests and crew. We have taken numerous steps to identify lessons learned and best practices. In addition, we have and will continue to implement improvements to our procedures and our training programs. Furthermore, we have improved the structure and organization of our health, environmental, safety and security-related audit functions. Over the next few years, we expect to fully recover from this ship incident and continue to build on our leadership position.","For 2012, our non-GAAP EPS was $1.88 versus the prior year's $2.42. The decrease was driven by lower net revenue yields costing $0.41 and higher fuel prices combined with unfavorable currency exchange rates costing an additional $0.39. Both of these were partially offset by slightly lower cruise costs, 4% lower fuel consumption and increased capacity, worth $0.25.","For 2012, our net revenue yields, excluding Costa, were in line with the prior year. Our North American brands were up slightly, but that was offset by our EAA brands, excluding Costa, which were down slightly. Our 2012 net revenue yields, including Costa, declined 2.5%.","Turning to our cash flow. As Micky indicated in the earnings release, our cash from operations was $3 billion, which was more than enough to fund the net capital investments of $1.8 billion, leaving us with free cash flow of $1.2 billion for 2012. By the end of December, we will have returned all of this free cash flow to our shareholders via a $0.25-per-share regular quarterly dividend, our recently announced special dividend of $0.50 per share and by repurchasing 3.5 million of our company's shares.","It should be noted that this is the second year in a row that we returned all of our free cash flow to shareholders. In 2011, the dividends paid and shares repurchased totaled $1.1 billion, which represented all of our 2011 free cash flow.","Now turning to our 2013 outlook. I will skip net revenue yields, as Howard will discuss that shortly. As you know, we have an excellent record of cost control. For 2013, our operating companies have done an excellent job identifying ways to reduce forecasted costs. However, there are a few unique items [ph] in 2013 that will be difficult to totally overcome which will push our unit cost higher.","To begin with, we are expecting that Costa will fill their ships in 2013, which will lead to higher food and other unit costs associated with this higher occupancy. Also, as I have previously indicated, our insurance costs will be higher in 2013. Furthermore, we are anticipating a charge from a closed pension plan for certain British officers. Finally, we are investing in new market development initiatives in Japan, China and Australia, including deployment decisions not yet announced. These unique factors alone in 2013 will drive up unit costs 2%.","To complete the cost picture, as you know, we have also had some ship incident-related costs in 2012, which are not expected to reoccur in 2013, worth about 0.5%. The net effect of these factors is that we are forecasting the full year cost, excluding fuel per ALBD, to be up 1% to 2% versus the prior year. Absent these items, we once again expect to offset inflation and keep unit cost essentially flat in 2013. However, even if you include these unique factors, our 5-year expected cost trend from 2008 through 2013 will be flat net cruise cost, excluding fuel, on a unit basis despite inflation.","Another multiple-year trend worth noting is our fuel consumption. As a result of our operating company's efforts over the years, we expect in 2013 to use 24% less fuel per berth than we did in 2005. This is a substantial energy saving which clearly reduces our environmental footprint.","I want to share with you our current rules of thumb about the impact that fuel price changes and currency changes have on our results. To start with, a 10% change in the current price of fuel, excluding the impact of fuel derivatives, represents a $0.30-per-share impact for the full year. Please note that the impact of a 10% change obviously moves along with the price of fuel. Just to be clear, the price of Brent was just under $110 a barrel when we determined our guidance.","The second rule of thumb relates to our fuel derivative portfolio, where the next 10% increase in the price of Brent for the year will not result in any realized gains, as the price of Brent would still be within the band of our collars. However, the next 10% decrease would result in a $4-million loss. For 2013, our protection begins with the price of Brent -- when the price of Brent goes above $127 per barrel, and we begin to pay on our fuel derivatives when the price of Brent falls below $100 per barrel.","With respect to FX movement, a 10% change in all relevant currencies related to the U.S. dollar would impact our P&L by approximately $158 million or $0.20 a share for the full year.","On a final note, for 2013, at the midpoint of our guidance range, we expect our cash from operations to be $3.3 billion. Our capital investment in 2013 is forecasted to be $2 billion, which leaves us $1.3 billion of free cash flow that we expect to return to shareholders. This would result in a total return to shareholders of over $3.5 billion in a 3-year period from 2011 to 2013.","At this point, I will turn the call over to Howard.","Howard S. Frank","Thank you, David. Before I move to the outlook, let me begin my comments by framing the 2013 year. We have 2 ships scheduled for delivery in 2013. The first is the 2,200-lower-berth AIDAstella, which will be delivered in March to our very successful AIDA brand in the German-speaking market; and the next one will be the new-generation Royal Princess, with 3,600 lower berths, which will be delivered sometime towards the end of May. These 2 ships, together with 3 ships delivered during this past year, 2012, will drive a 3.6% increase in cruise capacity in 2013.","For the full year 2013, our cruise programs will be approximately 33% in the Caribbean, 19% in the Mediterranean, 12% in Europe outside of the Mediterranean, 10% in the Australia-Asia region and with the balance in various other itineraries. The largest increase in our cruise programs in 2013 from a percentage standpoint is in the Australia-Asia region and in Europe outside of the Mediterranean.","Our earnings guidance for 2013 has been established within a range of $2.20 to $2.40 or a midpoint of $2.30 per share, about 20% higher than in 2012. Our earnings guidance for 2013 assumes that the U.S. does not go off the fiscal cliff in January and go into an economic recession during 2013. Hopefully, wisdom will prevail in Washington, and January will be the start of a solid 2013 wave season.","In Europe, where we have a strong market presence, we anticipate continuing struggling economies during 2013, much as we experienced during 2012. With regard to our strategy to grow our European cruise businesses, let me make a few comments. From a longer-term viewpoint, we are committed to maintaining our strong national brands presence in Europe. We believe European economies will improve over time and our strong European brands positioning, together with the significant market penetration throughout Europe and the U.K., provides us with a significant market advantage. Even during this difficult economic period in Europe, our European brands continued to provide us with strong profitability and returns on invested capital. And when Europe economies start to grow again, we will have an even stronger competitive advantage.","In the Asia markets, we are planning a significant increase in our footprint. In April 2013, Princess Cruises will introduce the Sun Princess to the Japanese market, and we have recently established a Carnival Japan sales and reservations office in Tokyo. With the announcement of the Sun Princess Japanese deployment, response from the market in Japan has been very strong and early signs are quite encouraging.","In Southeast Asia, we are adding a second Costa ship this spring, the Costa Atlantica, doubling our capacity in the market. With the Costa Victoria operating in Asia year-round in 2012 this past year, for the first time Costa achieved profitability in China. And the 2013 operating plan forecasts a nice increase in Costa Asia's profitability. We believe Asia represents a significant opportunity to grow our cruise business in the future, and we are currently looking at expanding our business in these new and emerging markets. We recently established a Carnival Asia corporate office in Singapore, headed by Pier Foschi, who has considerable business experience operating in Asia. We'll have further announcements in early 2013 on fleet expansion in Asia beyond 2013.","In Australia, Carnival Cruise Lines successfully introduced the Carnival Spirit to the market at the end of this past year, for the year that we're in, 2012, and the response from the Australian consumer has been very strong. The Carnival Spirit will be a year-round ship in the Australian market.","So to sum it up, we are very encouraged about our business going forward in 2013. And although the struggling economies in Europe are having some impact on our business, we are very confident that the company will achieve solid growth in profitability over the next several years, and at the same time, be able to return significant excess cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases.","Now let me turn to the booking picture for 2013. During the last 13 weeks, fleet-wide bookings and pricing, excluding Costa, for the first 3 quarters of 2013 are at the same levels against the very strong booking volumes we experienced last year. Not surprisingly, Costa's pricing is still running behind last year's pricing, but we expect that to change once we lap January of 2012.","For our North American brands during the 13-week period, bookings are running slightly behind with slightly higher pricing. For EAA brands, bookings, excluding Costa, are running at higher levels than last year at lower pricing. We are encouraged by the recent North American booking pattern, especially given consumer distraction from the elections and postelection consumer nervousness about the pending fiscal cliff. And the recent pattern excludes some negative impact on bookings from the Northeast resulting from Hurricane Sandy. So we are hopeful that once the fiscal cliff issue is resolved and we get into January and the wave season begins, consumers will start to turn their attention to getting on with their lives and booking their cruise vacations.","For the full year, from a revenue yield forecast standpoint, we are forecasting a constant currency increase in yields in the range of 1% to 2%. North American revenue yields are forecasted to come in higher year-over-year. EAA yields are forecasted to be higher when we include Costa, which will have easier comps versus last year. But excluding Costa, EAA yields are forecasted to be lower on a year-over-year basis.","Given the economic challenges in the European markets in which we operate, the positive yield outlook include -- which includes, of course, Costa, demonstrates the resilience of our cruise business in Europe, the underlying strength of the European consumer and the propensity for Europeans to take their vacations even during these difficult times. And while we would have liked to see even stronger rebound in revenue yields in 2013, the less-than-robust U.S. economy and the struggling European economies will make higher pricing increases difficult to achieve.","In terms of our earnings guidance for 2013, broadly speaking, our forecasted earnings improvement is expected to come from top line revenue growth of 5% to 6%, including -- which includes a 3.6% fleet-wide capacity increase and the 1% to 2% yield increase, which I previously referred to. We are also forecasting lower fuel pricing and a 5% improvement in fuel consumption. Net cruise costs other than fuel are expected to increase 1% to 2%, as David mentioned. All of this translates to an earnings per share range of $2.20 to $2.40 or approximately a 20% increase in earnings from -- if you're using the midpoint, from the $1.88 per share in 2012.","Turning to the first quarter, a little bit of color. My comments on bookings in each of these next 3 quarters that I discuss will include Costa's information for both years, unless I otherwise indicate. Fleet-wide capacity for the first quarter of 2013 is expected to be 4.2% higher. 3.6% of that is in North America, 5.1% in EAA. At the present time, fleet-wide occupancy in the first quarter are lower than a year ago, with pricing slightly lower versus last year. There is very little inventory, however, remaining to be sold in the first quarter.","In the first quarter for North American brands, there are 65% in the Caribbean, with the balance in various other itineraries. For North American brands taken together, occupancies and pricing are slightly lower year-over-year. As previously mentioned, revenue yield comparisons for first quarter of 2013 versus first quarter of 2012 are tougher, given our strong first quarter North American revenue yield performance in 2012, which at this point was up 5% at this point in time.","Caribbean pricing is in line with a year ago. Pricing on all other itineraries, taken together, is lower than a year ago.","EAA brands are 24% in Europe; itineraries up from 19% last year; 18% in the Caribbean, down from 22% last year; and 18% in South America, about the same as last year. The balance, of course, is in all other itineraries. On a fleet-wide basis, EAA brand occupancies are behind last year with lower year-over-year prices.","On a fleet-wide basis, as was indicated in the press release, revenue yields for the first quarter are forecasted to be 2% to 3% lower than last year. North American revenue yields are expected to be flat to slightly lower, and EAA yields will be lower.","Turning now to the second quarter fleet-wide capacity, which is up 3.2%: 2.3% for North America and 4.6% for EAA brands. At the present time, on a fleet-wide basis, local currency pricing is slightly lower than a year ago, with occupancies running behind last year, evidencing the continuing close-in booking cycle that we have been experiencing for quite some time. We expect second quarter occupancies and pricing to show gradual year-over-year improvement as we fully cycle through January of 2013.","North American brands are 53% in the Caribbean in the first quarter versus 56% last year, with the balance in a variety of other itineraries. For North American brands taken together, pricing is slightly higher at lower occupancies. Caribbean pricing is higher than a year ago. Prices for all other North American brand itineraries taken together are slightly lower than a year ago.","EAA brands are 59% in Europe, up from 53% last year, with the balance in various other trades. EAA brand pricing is lower than last year at lower occupancies. Although occupancy and pricing for the second quarter are behind last year, we do expect to see a catch-up when we fully cycle through the first quarter. Because of easier comparisons, we do expect to see an improvement in revenue yields for both North America and EAA brands by the time the second quarter closes.","Now turning to the third quarter. Capacity in the third quarter is expected to increase 3.7%: 4.5% in North America, 2.6% in EAA. Third quarter booking patterns are still in the early stages of development, so I caution not to read too much into this information. On a fleet-wide basis, third quarter occupancies and pricing are behind last year.","For North American brands, capacity in the third quarter is 38% in the Caribbean, which is about the same as last year; 24% in Alaska and -- about also the same; and 26% in Europe, which is slightly higher than last year; the balance of the itineraries in various other programs. Overall pricing for North American brands is higher than a year ago at lower occupancies. Pricing for Caribbean and Alaska cruises is higher than last year, while the pricing for European cruises is about at the same levels as last year.","EAA brand capacity is 87% in Europe itineraries, which is slightly lower than last year. EAA pricing is lower than a year ago at lower occupancies. As I commented on earlier, it is still early in the booking pattern, and much of the third quarter revenue picture will depend on the strength of the 2013 wave season.","We are currently forecasting that third quarter revenue yield for North America will be higher. EAA will also be higher year-over-year, with the yield improvement driven by the easier revenue comparisons for Costa in the third quarter. Excluding Costa, we do expect that EAA revenue yields to decline in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis.","And with that, Charlene, I will turn it back to you, and we'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I guess just trying to understand how much it's that you're being conservative in your guidance versus how challenging the outlook is, because you had talked about, this year, that Costa's occupancy -- the Costa brand alone, that occupancy has been down around 6 points. And so it seems like even just recovering that occupancy alone for the Costa brand would get to the company-wide yield increase that you guys are talking about across all the brands. So I guess I wonder if you can just put some perspective on that. And then, I guess, just how much lower are the other EAA brands x Costa? I guess, that's the only thing that would kind of make the company-wide be -- only up as much as Costa's occupancy recovery.","Howard S. Frank","Let me give you a -- kind of the broad strokes on it because there's a lot of details that we probably can't get into on this call. But we're going to have higher yields in North America, as I indicated. We're going to have higher yields in Costa, and we estimate that perhaps 50% of our yield deterioration in Costa last year will be recovered -- in the neighborhood of that will be recovered this year, in -- this coming year in 2013. And the rest of Europe outside of Costa will have lower yields. So that's sort of a composite of the 3 elements that make up the yield picture. And what I've tried to indicate in my comments, Robin, is that in a year in which we do have increased capacity in Europe, especially in Germany where we also had increased capacity in 2012; and given the headwinds in the economies in Europe and the very close-in booking pattern that we're seeing in Europe, in Germany, the U.K. and in Southern Europe, it's very difficult to forecast yields because it depends on how bookings start to come in, in the wave period. Whether we're conservative or we're not conservative, I think it is a forecast based on the best work that our brands can give us right now in these markets. And could we do better? Sure. Could we do worse? Of course. It is early, and let's see how it goes.","Micky M. Arison","Robin, a couple of points to make is one, I think we've been consistent in saying that recovery at Costa is not a 1-year issue. It's going to be multiple years. And we're forecasting a recovery of about half the yield deterioration. That's one item. Two is it's important to understand that we don't cycle through this until the second quarter because the first quarter was done. And the timing of first quarter in this instance versus competitors is very important, because it did happen in the middle of our first quarter when the first quarter was done. So that's impacting it as well. So I think those 2 -- the combination of those 2 things significantly answer your question.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And maybe just one point of clarification, because clearly, no one would have expected full recovery at Costa in 1 year. But it seems like the occupancy would be something that could come back pretty quickly, given that it came back between -- from January until the end of this year, that -- therefore, that 2013 Costa occupancy would be pretty well recovered, even though there would clearly be work to do on the price recovery. Is that occupancy for Costa -- are you not expecting it to be back to recovering those 6 percentage points of occupancy?","David Bernstein","Robin, yes, we are -- the 50 -- included in the 50% that Howard mentioned is a full occupancy recovery. Costa was very close to normal occupancy in the fourth quarter, and we are expecting normal occupancy and full ships for 2013. And that is the full 6% recovery in their occupancy. But as Howard mentioned, given the economy in Europe, they are expecting some price recovery on top of that, but the overall economic situation in Europe is tempering the amount of price recovery that they are expecting to get.","Beth Roberts","Plus, I would like to add if you expect the first quarter being down in pricing for the Costa brand, then their recovery in the back half of the year is a little bit heavier pricing.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So, Howard, this is also for you, just as I'm trying to digest your guidance. And I'm going to kind of preface my comments with knowing that -- with just acknowledging that. And you all have seen, as we've talked about this for many years, that talking to travel agents doesn't necessarily always correlate to what you guys are seeing. But a lot of us do it because it's helpful in our research. And that being said, our travel agents are implying to us that the 2013 yields in North America are more robust than your guidance would imply. So -- and then also on top of that, just lower capacity industry-wide should also help. So kind of if you add those 2 together, what you're seeing is that North America seems more muted than a lot of us were expecting. And I'm just trying to figure out, is this more related to perhaps the fiscal cliff right now, what we're seeing? Maybe people are holding back. Maybe some Sandy. Or are we just totally off?","Howard S. Frank","Well, I'm happy to hear that travel agents are feeling that pricing is going up. I think that's a positive. I mean, I don't know how...","Micky M. Arison","But we've also said that North America pricing is up.","Howard S. Frank","Yes. I don't know how...","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well, they're saying more than what you're -- higher than what you're saying.","Howard S. Frank","I don't know how that translates to our outlook, though, because I think there are many factors that play in our yield outlook that travel agents -- you can't translate from travel agents' comments and\/or their individual data points. And it depends on what they're selling. If they're selling -- Caribbean looks strong now, so Caribbean business is pretty good. But then, there are long cruises. There's Europe. There's a whole variety of things that we look at. And when you ask them a question, I'm not quite sure how it's asked, how the details of it is...","Micky M. Arison","[indiscernible] first quarter is not in their mindset.","Howard S. Frank","Yes, so it's very -- but I guess the bottom line is it's hard to know when we see the reports that you guys write in terms of Europe, canvassing of travel agents, and we kind of scratch our heads -- sometimes, it's right on and sometimes, we kind of scratch our heads and see a little bit differently than they do. So it doesn't always correlate.","David Bernstein","One thing that you've got to keep in mind is that if you look at it on a quarter-by-quarter basis, we gave guidance for the first quarter down 2% to 3%, because as Micky said, when the incident happened last year, we were almost done -- we were halfway through the quarter and the booking was essentially done. And last year, our yields were up quite a bit in the first quarter, so we're going to be down 2% to 3%. Howard had indicated we do expect the second quarter to be up. But when you look at the full year guidance of 1% to 2%, that does imply, let's say, 2% to 3% yield increase in the back half of the year. So it's possible that what you're getting in the discussion with the travel agents is more relating to those types of prices than it is the first quarter, where we're down 2% to 3% from a very strong prior year.","Micky M. Arison","Yes. Last year, in North America, we were up 5 points in the first quarter. And I don't think the travel agents are focused on when you cycle through a quarter. They're just focusing on the general business.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, that's helpful. And then, Howard, something that you said actually gets to the next point of my question, which is, can you just kind of give us some color how things -- you said that the Caribbean is strong now, but maybe some longer cruises aren't doing as well. Can you just give us some color so we can understand the consumer mentality in terms of what things are selling well and what things have more challenges?","Howard S. Frank","Can I just say that our booking pattern in the fall has been strong? When you consider last year, it was extremely strong. But again, until we cycle the event and get into wave season, it just makes it very, very difficult.","Micky M. Arison","Yes. And on top of that, we had the elections this year, which always presents a challenge in terms of consumer distraction. And then right after the election, when things start to normalize, we had the issue with the fiscal cliff, which continues to nag us. So it -- and as well as Sandy. But I think -- yes, I mean I think we're doing okay. I think bookings -- I think if we're seeing challenges from a North America standpoint, it's more on volume in terms of we're running behind. Although pricing is okay for Europe and Alaska going forward, we're running behind on occupancy. So the question is, is that going to resolve itself during wave season? We start to -- and then there is also the challenge of the higher air costs that we're all dealing with on the longer cruises, so -- but we're trying to hold price and we think -- everybody thinks they're going to get there. But it's a long time between now and late spring and summer when these cruises start to occur.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So it sounds like your guidance is not trying to anticipate what things might look like once we get past hopefully this fiscal cliff issue and other things; it's what you're kind of seeing now.","Howard S. Frank","The guidance is based on what our operating companies are telling me. And then we kind of take a look at it and if we think that -- we may make some minor tweaks to it, but only minor tweaks to it.","Micky M. Arison","We have a couple of things that makes forecasting always challenging at this time of year. One is the booking curve has clearly moved in, which makes forecasting tougher. And the fact that we have to do this prior to wave also makes it tougher.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","You could change your fiscal year.","Micky M. Arison","Yes, we could. We've talked about that.","Howard S. Frank","I think the best thing is to resolve the fiscal cliff, and we'll all be happy. Even if we have to pay more taxes, let it happen already. It's painful.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My question is, if you go back to when you had your last earnings call, have things changed meaningfully? Like if you were to have given guidance then versus now, would you say it's about -- would have been about the same?","Howard S. Frank","When you say would I have changed guidance, I don't think I know what guidance would've been back 3 months ago for 2013.","Micky M. Arison","I would say one thing. We have been saying that Northern Europe and the U.K. have been strong. And in fact, in '12, we had a good year in both Germany and the U.K. We're starting to have -- to see some effect of a weaker economy both in the U.K. and Germany, which we really didn't see a whole lot in '12. So if there's anything different, I'd say we're a little bit more concerned. Although those brands are performing well, we are a little bit concerned going forward as the booking curve has tightened in those countries.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, I guess I was just trying to get at, have things gotten a little bit incrementally better or worse since then? And that's helpful. And as you kind of look out to Europe, I know you typically talk about some of the markets that are weaker and stronger. Has anything changed over the last month or 2 in any of the markets to make you a little bit more optimistic or pessimistic? Just maybe point out a market or 2 that you think has maybe changed.","Micky M. Arison","I think I just did. It's really Germany and the U.K. where we had a very good '12, looks a little bit weaker and the booking curve has moved in.","Howard S. Frank","On the other hand, I should say, in Germany, we have -- just in the German market, we have a lot of additional capacity coming in on top of capacity last year. So there's a big capacity increase and we've got a closer-in booking curve. Germany, you may recall the German market, I think, was more profoundly affected than -- like Italy as a result of last year's -- last January's event. So I think that's been a little bit slower to come back, although all the data and consumer research we've recently seen suggests that the German market will come back and that things -- and people are feeling much more positive about taking cruises. So we think that's still a good market.","Micky M. Arison","The other thing that I haven't seen a lot of focus on is some of our competitors have talked about reducing capacity in Europe. But in reality, our 2 largest competitors together have increased their Northern Europe capacity by over 20% next year. So the Northern Europe itineraries have tended to be the highest yielding itineraries in the European market, and that capacity increase -- it will be interesting to see how that all plays out.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura group.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Quick question. This 1% to 2% is not a particularly satisfying number, and could you give us your perspective after 2 years of Arab Spring and Costa? Is it disappointing to you? And do you think that some of it is perhaps related to the amount of capacity that has moved into Europe? Does it maybe argue for moving some of the capacity out of Europe? And then the last add-on question is, from the point of view of profitability per berth, how close are you in Asia to maybe shifting some capacity to Asia and lifting your yields and EBITDA per berth?","Howard S. Frank","So you made 3 comments, Harry. This is Howard. Is the 1% to 2% not -- are we not satisfied with it? I think -- directionally, I think we're satisfied with it. Sometimes, it's difficult -- consensus for yields in the investment community don't always match reality or what we see as reality in our particular markets, or even what our competitors are doing. We do have a lot more increase in capacity, I think, in 2013 than our competitors have. One of those increases will be in the German market. Perhaps that -- and on top of capacity increases we had last year. So when you look at Europe and Germany, we like the business there. We think it's a great -- it's an under-penetrated market. It's got great demographics. And even in these very challenging times, we get very good profitability from these brands, even if yield's down 1% to 2%, and excellent returns. So we see the strategy as staying in Europe as the right strategy for us. And to continue to penetrate those markets, it only strengthens us from a competitive standpoint in the future. So -- which is my comments -- my earlier comments. I don't think moving ships around because we start to see some weakness in a particular market. By the time you move them around and get them to the new markets, then the old markets come back. So to us, that's a very short-term solution to what we think is a poor long-term strategy.","Micky M. Arison","A couple of things. One is I think you got to look at the yield improvement after the first quarter, which is higher than the number you stated. Secondly, satisfied -- I wouldn't be satisfied if it was 5 or 6. I mean we always want more, obviously, and we always push for more. The reality though is that our focus is profitably, our focus is profit per berth day. We get overly focused on yield sometimes. And a great example of this is the fact that we're forecasting fuel consumption to be down 5% next year. And to do that, we had to make some itinerary adjustments that risk yield. And so we'll trade yields for lower cost. And then it -- the yield number looks lower. The example I've used in the past was when we went from 6 to 8 transatlantic on Queen Mary to 7, we would be perfectly happy to have gotten 6.5 days of yield versus 7 because the reduction in the fuel cost made up for more than the 1-day yield. So it's -- yield is just part of the equation. The real key is doing everything we can to increase our profit per berth day.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And then just a quick -- I'm sorry, go ahead.","David Bernstein","I was going to say, your last -- you mentioned Asia there at the end, and I think both Howard and I alluded to Asia and the fact that there will be more announcements relative to Asia going forward.","Micky M. Arison","Yes. As you know, we've opened a Singapore corporate office that Pier Foschi will be heading up for us. And by the end of the first quarter, we should have more deployment announcement in that region.","Howard S. Frank","And also, Mario Draghi said earlier in the week that the European economy is coming back in the second half of the year. So we're waiting for that to happen.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And God bless us if his crystal ball is accurate. Just one follow-up on Asia. Separating yield growth from cost, how does Asia compare to Europe and North America from both your ability to price up? And also is it just more expensive to operate in Asia?","Micky M. Arison","It is more expensive to operate. And brand by -- the question you asked is very difficult when you take a mix of all our brands. But if you look at the Carnival Cruise Line deployment in Australia, yes, their yields are up. If you look at the Princess deployment, it's also positive. So clearly, again, we're going to make deployment decisions, hopefully long term, to increase our profit per berth day.","Howard S. Frank","But the costs that we're looking at today with a very limited fleet, especially in Asia, it's not necessarily representative. If we had built a fleet there, we have more ships over there, we'll get some -- certainly some shoreside benefits from it. And as infrastructure is created over there to handle the ships, there will be some benefits to cost. So it will take some time, but costs essentially are higher, but the yields are good. So we're okay. And we'll just have to be a little bit patient. But we think it's a great market to develop and a great new market for us.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I'm kind of intrigued by the comments you made about the U.K. and Germany getting somewhat softer. And I think it would probably be helpful to know just roundly kind of what the yields were like for your U.K. brands and how [ph] you did this year, and what the differential might be going into 2013 and how much that's weighing on your overall yield guidance.","Howard S. Frank","Yes, look, I think we said yields will be down. We're not going to get into that. We don't really, Sharon, discuss yields for individual companies in the group. We never -- we just don't think that's a smart thing to do from a competitive standpoint. But from a directional standpoint, they're going to be down. And we have gotten more into the yield issues in Costa because of the unique circumstances last year, but we're not going to go beyond that.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I guess, are you seeing stabilization yet in either of the countries? Or is it a kind of moving target right now?","Howard S. Frank","What we're seeing is a close-in booking pattern both in Germany and the U.K. And we haven't seen actually that much deterioration in pricing. But the question is, if you don't start to see the business coming in strongly in wave season, you may have to move some pricing down. So some of this yield guidance we're giving you is really a future, to look at the crystal ball and say, \"Well, what possibly can happen in the third and fourth quarters here?\" And it's difficult -- it's more difficult to estimate it today because of the closer-in booking pattern.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Can you remind us what the -- sorry, go ahead.","Micky M. Arison","Clearly, the German economy weakened in the second half of the year, and all of our capacity increase in Europe next year is in Germany. So it's not surprising that there'd be some pressure on yields in Germany. On the other hand, the brand -- the primary brand in Germany is a stellar performer for us and will be next year as well at slightly lower yields.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I seem to recall the U.K. has a long booking window. I don't know if that's the same for Germany. Can you remind us how those booking windows kind of compare to the overall average?","Micky M. Arison","The U.K. had our longest booking window.","Howard S. Frank","But they also sell long cruises. They have -- especially in the winter time, they'll -- they do have a few around-the-world cruises and long cruises...","Micky M. Arison","5 ships. 5 ships going around the world.","Howard S. Frank","So those tend to book way in advance. So the first quarter in the U.K. looks like it's shaping up pretty well right now. It's really the forecasting the second, third and fourth quarter with the closer-in booking pattern, because the cruises you're selling coming into the spring and summer are shorter-duration cruises. It starts to look like them -- like the booking patterns in many of the other businesses including our German business, which is shorter cruises.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Steven M. Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","David, I guess this question is probably best for you. I think you said on -- I want to make sure this is right. In terms of the cost assumptions next year, did you say if you strip out the higher insurance cost and the higher pension cost and the development cost, your cost assumption would basically be flat?","David Bernstein","Correct. And if you take into account the prior year ship incident costs, we would have been flat year-over-year.","Steven M. Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then what happened in the fourth quarter in terms of is there -- were there 1 or 2 things that kind of drove that cost number higher than you guys were expecting?","David Bernstein","No. It's all the way across the board in a number of instances. There wasn't anything specific. It's -- as I said before, it's really tough quarter-by-quarter. I mean, if you remember back in the third quarter, we beat the cost guidance we -- and this quarter, we were above. So you got to look at the full year on an annual basis.","Steven M. Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the onboard side of things, those numbers have actually been trending, I think, a little better than most people have expected, and just maybe how you're thinking about the onboard trends as we move into '13.","David Bernstein","Our onboard trend overall around the globe is -- for '13 is very similar to '12. '12, we were up like a little over 2%, and our guidance for '13 is in the similar range with increases in all the major categories. Our operating companies have done a great job with some new initiatives, and so we're expecting those to be driven higher as well.","Steven M. Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I guess last question for -- probably for Micky, I guess. In terms of the -- with the potential changes here in tax law, I mean, how are you guys thinking about deploying your free cash here over the next couple of years back to shareholders? Is it kind of a wait-and-see mentality right now in terms of how you do that? Or can you just give us some color on that?","Micky M. Arison","Well, what we've said over and over is we're going to return free cash flow to shareholders. Until we know what the tax law is going to be, it's hard to really respond. But once we know that, obviously, we'll take it to the board and see what -- if they prefer a different direction or same direction or whatever. But until we see the final package, it's very hard to guess. And so what we've done so far, as you know, is that special dividend at year end, and we're waiting to see what happens in January.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just to revisit your guidance on Europe, you've seen Thomas Cook and TUI basically imply that over the next 6 months, that things are kind of flattish in terms of bookings and pricing. So again, just to summarize -- or to take that guidance versus what you're seeing out of Europe x Costa, is it truly just a capacity issue, that you're adding capacity in what's been your strongest market, Germany? Is that, to boil it down, what we can take away as the difference?","Howard S. Frank","One of the ways -- I don't know enough about how they manage their business at TUI and Thomas Cook. But they can -- I do know historically they can move capacity up or down in order to generate higher prices. So it's not always a good analogy to look at what they're doing and how they're faring in the market from a pricing standpoint versus we're doing -- certainly, we do have increased capacity.","Micky M. Arison","Yes. Generally, when they talk about volumes, they talk about absolute volumes. When we talk about -- and we're talking about capacity adjusted. I don't believe they do that. And so if we just had flat volumes, we'd be in deep concern, especially in Germany where our capacity increases.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay. And then to revisit, I guess, some framework on Costa, given the 2 ships that are out of service and then the Concordia top of that, I think in previous calls, you mentioned that $300 million would be sort of a new normalized run rate as far as profitability in Costa. I just wanted to clarify, are you counting in the new ships that Costa will be taking delivery of? It would seem that yes, you lost 2 ships. You sold one, got rid of one and then the Allegra, what happened there. Those weren't that, I can't say, profitable, but had less profitability, higher cost structure clearly than Concordia. But now you're adding -- going to be adding 2 new ships. Could that -- with the new ships, could that new normalized run rate be back closer to the original $400 million?","Micky M. Arison","First of all, I'm not going to comment on your number. I'm not exactly sure where it came from. But we only have one ship under contract for Costa at the end of '14, so the profitability would not be seen until '15. So I mean that's all I can say at this point, that we'd expect Costa's profit to be up in '15, obviously, with at least the capacity increase that they have.","Howard S. Frank","We do believe that Costa -- that over -- from after '13, we continue to believe that Costa will continue to grow its profitability in '14 before the new ship is delivered. So whether it gets back to the numbers that they previously had, that will take a few years. We've always said that, that may take a few years.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then a final question relating to the return of capital. It appears again that the company, as you stated in the past, was going to return the excess free cash flow. With the special dividend this year, has there been any further thought regarding coming up with a formularic [ph] portion of that on a go-forward basis?","Micky M. Arison","I think we're now defering to see what comes out of Washington and then we'll make a decision on how we go with that forward.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Assia Georgieva with Infinity Research.","Assia Georgieva","A couple of questions. First of all, the good close-in bookings that we have seen both in Q3 and Q4, are you expecting that Q1 is not going to be a repeat of that? We are basically a quarter of the way into the quarter, and I would think you're already there seeing those, or you don't see them and therefore guidance is not including any pickup on sort of just near-term pricing.","David Bernstein","Yes. We gave you our best guess for first quarter, which included what we expect the close-in bookings to be. We're typically 85% to 95% done at this point for the first quarter, and we're in that range. So it's very hard to read every last booking. Maybe we get a little better or a little worse, but we gave you our best guess for the first quarter.","Howard S. Frank","Which is what we do every -- It's what we do every quarter.","Assia Georgieva","I understand. But it's safe to assume that you expect the continuation of this trend at least to some extent in Q1.","David Bernstein","We built into that forecast good, solid bookings for the remaining 10-odd percent of the occupancy for the first quarter.","Assia Georgieva","Okay, okay. And the second question is, based on all the troubles that Europe is in and the fact that shipyards may be a lot more open to discussions in terms of ship cost, have you looked at any newbuilds? Especially the Carnival brand is not going to have anything any time soon and Holland America has been without a newbuild for a while. In 2015, you do have almost 5% capacity coming in, at least based on my figures. So for 2016, '17, is this a good time to actually be speaking to them? Or are you holding off and focusing primarily on returning free cash to shareholders?","Micky M. Arison","Well, we've committed -- we've said now for 5 years that we'll be building 2 to 3 ships a year. That's what we're doing. Whether the yards are doing well or not doing well, whether the price is plus or minus 5% or 10%, it's not going to make us build more or less. I mean, we're going to do it when the returns are right and in a much more conservative way than we've done in the past. We believe that the growth rate in the industry needs to slow, and that's what we're doing.","Assia Georgieva","Okay. So, Micky, if I read you correctly, right now, you'll be holding off to see how the near-term demand picture, meaning over the next 6 months, a year, develops before you actually commit to anything?","Micky M. Arison","I don't want to say that it has anything to do with near-term demand because these are long-term decisions. These are 3- to 4-year delivery and then 30-year assets. So I would say that our strategy hasn't changed. We're talking 2 to 3 ships a year. There's nothing imminent. We've just recently announced a Carnival Cruise Line newbuilding and a Holland newbuilding, and we have nothing imminent right now other than what we recently announced.","David Bernstein","And for the years you're talking about, '16, '17 and beyond, we have plenty of time, so we don't have to make decisions today. We can do that at some point in the future.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I think we've exhausted just about everything. But just to be fair to you guys, I mean, it does sound like this is really a short-term booking issue and that given what you're seeing right now, it's hard to really give much guidance beyond what you've provided. So am I reading that correctly? I think you said it earlier, Howard, just about this is the time of year you give the 2013 and this is what you're dealing with at this time.","Howard S. Frank","I mean, it certainly is more challenging to give guidance for 2013 because of the closer-in booking pattern that we're seeing, and it -- so there's sort of a wider span of where this -- how this could all play out than in past years when we had a longer-term -- we had a longer booking pattern. So it's more of a challenge. There's more estimating here, and we think we've factored in reasonable estimates. And as I said before, if we do better, that would be great and if we -- but it does -- there are no guarantees. These are just our best estimates.","Howard S. Frank","Clearly, 3 or 4 weeks into wave season, you have better sense of where you're going, so...","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Rick Lyall with John W. Bristol.","Richard Ellis Lyall - John W. Bristol & Co., Inc.","I have 2 questions. The first is the fuel efficiency. 5% is a good number. I think it's much stronger than a 2% to 3% kind of number you were guiding to over the last several years, and some of that is itinerary-driven. How much further do you have on the itinerary runway to realize fuel efficiency versus other operational improvements?","Micky M. Arison","It's funny because each itinerary is modeled, you make these decisions based on certain price levels of fuel, and so you're willing to give up x amount of yield for y amount of fuel savings when fuel is at one price and a different decision based on another price. So it's hard to tell. I think our brands were very aggressive this year to get the fuel cost down and took some yield risk to do it, and I'm sure that's baked into their forecasts. And we firmly supported those decisions, and there is some additional risk to it on the yield side. But we believe that profitability-wise, it's the right decision. To go beyond -- a lot of these discussions are longer than 1-year term. And so I believe that we will see significant fuel savings in '14 as well. But whether it will reach this kind of level or not, I don't know. Historically, we've been at the 2% to 3% range a little bit more. And -- anyway, we pushed hard this year and I suspect we will continue to see some savings in '14.","Howard S. Frank","And new ships, more efficient ships will drive some of the metric as well, plus retrofitting ships with new technologies are also drivers. It's a combination of things that are driving the 5%.","Micky M. Arison","About half of it has been -- about half or a little bit more than half next year is itinerary-driven.","Richard Ellis Lyall - John W. Bristol & Co., Inc.","All right. Second question, and this is a very long-term question. What do you think the global balance of your capacity should be? How much should be in Asia? How much should be in exotics? How much should be in Europe? How much in the U.S.?","Howard S. Frank","I don't think you really know the answer to that question, because as we all look at the Asian markets as a new market and potentially a strong market for us, it's going to take a while to build it and to get the visibility for cruise vacations in those markets. Over time, look, I mean Asia, it should be no different why Asia is any different than Europe and the U.S. So you can see a relative -- but over the long term, you can see a relative equal balance. But it can take a long time to get there. I'm talking over the...","Micky M. Arison","This is the kind of thing that we're tweaking all the time. We're always working on the margin. I mean yesterday, Carnival Cruise Lines announced a ship being moved from the East Coast to the West Coast because of demand cycles in Canaveral versus Long Beach. So you're looking at this -- management is looking at this stuff every day and looking towards '14 and '15 and where their brands should be relative to where they are now.","David Bernstein","But with a 2-year decision time horizon, as Howard said, this will take time to balance out.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to you.","Howard S. Frank","Well, thank you very much for the good questions and the tough questions, and we want to wish -- take this moment to wish everybody a happy and healthy holiday season and new year, and we look forward to seeing you in the new year. All the best. Thank you.","Micky M. Arison","Thanks, everybody. Happy New Year...","David Bernstein","Thank you. Happy holidays.","Micky M. Arison","Happy holidays.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

I am Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation & plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning.","Today, I am joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison via phone from Europe as well as David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Roberts, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Here with me here in Miami. Before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking. Therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today\u2019s press release.","Our company is off to a good start again this year with adjusted earnings of $0.38 per share exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.05. Our first quarter results combined with our strong book position enabled us to increase the midpoint of our previous guidance range by $0.15 and raise our full year earnings expectations leaving us well positioned to deliver for the year. ","Year-over-year for the first quarter despite a $0.13 drag from fuel and currency both moving against us, strong operational improvement contributed $0.10 per share to the bottom line, which when combined with $0.02 of accretion from our share repurchase program enabled us to exceed the high end of our guidance range for the quarter. Our business, any business is all about the people.","Our consistently strong financial performance is only possible because of the extraordinary efforts of our employees worldwide to exceed our GAAP expectations and to deliver memorable vacation experiences as well as our travel agent partners who support our brands around the globe. It was reinforcing to see constant currency revenue yield growth this quarter of roughly 3.8% and that's on top of the 4.7% improvement achieved in the first quarter last year.","We continue to drive revenue yield growth by increasing demand in excess of our measured capacity growth through our ongoing guest experience and public relations effort. In fact, we have many efforts underway are ready this year to keep the momentum going throughout 2017 and beyond. We kicked off the year by unveiling our latest guest experience innovation at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on January 5th. We were privileged to be the first travel company ever to deliver the opening keynote address at CES, the one of largest tradeshow.","There, we unveiled our leading-edge guest experience innovation, the Ocean Platform, featuring our Ocean Medallion. This is the first interactive guest experience platform designed to transform vacation travel into a highly personalized and elevated level of customized service for millions of guests. The Ocean Platform will be launched on Regal Princess beginning in the fall this year and rolled out to three additional Princess' ship early next year. Ocean has already garnered global recognition, receiving 14 billion media impressions to-date across a broad spectrum of business, travel, technology and innovation forums, and has also enabled Carnival Corporation to be named as one of fast companies, top ten most innovative companies in 2017.","Now, we surprised many by being selected to give the keynote at the world's leading technology conference and this kind of global exposure is part of our continuous efforts to keep cruising at the forefront of consumers vacation considerations set. Building on those efforts, we just added a fourth show to our increasingly popular roster of U.S. original content television programs. Our Ocean Network Television show yet another innovative approach to expand the market for cruise vacations by creating experiential content, designed to engage viewers through showcasing exciting adventures, exotic cultures and popular global destinations.","We have taken great care to develop TV shows that we believe families and people of all ages will truly enjoy watching. To capture a broad audience in a highly engaging way and demonstrate why cruising is such a great vacation at an exceptional value. Our newest TV show Good Spirits premiere February 16th on A&E, well timed at the height of wave season. Good Sprits joins our other three Ocean programs airing every Saturday morning. Ocean Treks with Jeff Corwin on ABC, The Voyager with Josh Garcia on NBC and Vacation Creation with Tommy Davidson and Andrea Feczko on the CW Network.","In just their first season, the TV programs are already garnering attention based on their popularity and ratings, even receiving the influential Parents' Choice Awards. Combining these original TV programs representing nearly 100 hours of television programming have already reached an audience of over 75 million viewers and have last on measurable increase in cruise considerations and even more favorable perceptions of our brands. Additional opportunities are in the pipeline for this year. Holland America, Jeff signed an exclusive agreement with O, The Oprah Magazine the feature series of adventure cruises beginning with O's voyage to Alaska on Eurodam.","Again, these efforts combined with our creative programming around the world like the reality television shows of cruise featuring Princess Cruises and battleships featuring P&O, both in the UK or Bravo Chef our engaging new marketing campaign for Costa featuring Shakira both in Italy are into air to reach audiences multiple times and multiple ways that helps drive demand for our brands ultimately leading for higher yields. Our new ships combined with highly publicized in all events around the world are another ways that we drive demand.","On January 7th, we marked a new era in ultra-luxury cruising at a festive evening ceremony in Singapore, the world's best-selling soprano Sarah Brightman presided over the naming ceremony as godmother of the new Seabourn Encore. The crown jewel of the Seabourn fleet is getting new standards for ultra-luxury cruising. Our strategic fleet enhancement plan is also an important part of our measured capacity growth strategy, which includes re-pricing less efficient ships with newer, larger and more efficient vessels.","During the quarter, we signed an agreement with Fincantieri to build two new cruise ships designated by Holland America and Princess brand for delivering in 2021 and 2022. We expect that capacity growth to be around 4.5% compound annually through 2021 and some new ships to replace existing capacity. We also further our efforts to build on our leading presence in China through our cruise joint venture with CSSC, China State Shipbuilding Corporation, China's largest shipbuilder and an official signing ceremony held at the Great Hall of the People of Beijing attended by a Chinese President Xi and Italian President Mattarella. Our joint venture for the Chinese markets of the first ever cruise ships to be built in China, supporting China's larger efforts which prioritize cruise industry growth in its five year economic development plan. The first ship is planned to be delivered in 2023.","We've already established a strong foundation and a leading presence in China through both our Costa and Princess brands despite the recent itinerary changes for Korea. Our development strategy is progressing this year with the first purpose-built ships to China delivered to our Princess brand later this week. Meanwhile, Costa will expand its home ports in China with [Indiscernible] Tianjin and Xiamen next month. And then there is Cuba, as our historic values for Cuba with our Fathom brand, we've recently received approval for Carnival Cruise Line to feature Cuban port. We\u2019re very excited Carnival Paradise will be sailing from Tampa beginning the summer and we have request already submitted for a number of our other brands.","During the quarter, we've furthered our efforts to leverage our industry leading scale. We continue to contain cost and we remained on track to deliver more than 75 million in savings this year. So in summary, the combination of our strong fourth quarter results and our ongoing efforts to create demand and contain cost, enabled us to increase the guidance range for the year, reflecting in continue delivery of strong operational improvement.","Looking forward, growth is the result of the combination of well executed business plans and innovation that makes a difference, our fleet enhancement program, our guest experience innovations including the Ocean Platform, our aggressive public relations and its corresponding positive impact, our Ocean network programming, our yield management advancements, our ongoing efforts that contain cost, our new sourced markets including China, our new destinations including Cuba, our effort in areas of sustainability and having positive social impact in the communities we touch, all, all are building blocks, leading us well position from multi-year period of earnings growth and sustained double digit returns on investment capital.","With that, I'll turn the call over to David.","David Bernstein","Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin please note all of my references to revenue ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I will start today with a summary of our 2017 first quarter results then I'll provide some insights on booking trends and finish up with an update on our full year 2017 guidance.","Our adjusted EPS in the first quarter was $0.38. This was $0.05 above the midpoint of our December guidance. The improvement was all operational driven by increased net ticket revenue yields which benefited from stronger pricing on closing bookings on both sides of the Atlantic, while higher than guidance net cruise cost excluding fuel due to the timing of certain expenses between the quarters was offset by favorability in a variety of other areas.","Now let's look at our first quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased almost 4%. The North American brands were up over 5% while the European, Australia and Asian brands also known as our EAA brands were up almost 2%. Our total net revenue yields were up 3.8%.","Now let's break apart the two components of net revenue yields, net ticket yields were up 4.1 %, this increase was driven by our North American brands deployment in the Caribbean as well as our EAA brands deployments in both Europe and the Caribbean. Net onboard and other yields increased 2.9% with increases on both sides of Atlantic. Net cruise costs per ALBD excluding fuel were up 3.2% driven by the timing of O&M, dry dock and G&A expense. As they have previously indicated, the best measure of net cruise cost per ALBD excluding fuel is on a full year basis as the timing of expenses between the quarters often varies from the year to year.","In summary, our first quarter adjusted EPS was in line with the prior year, which as Arnold indicated strong operational improvements of $0.10 and the $0.02 accretive impact from the stock repurchase program both being offset by the impact of higher fuel prices, costing $0.08 and the unfavorable impact of currency worth $0.05.","Now let's turn to 2017 booking trends. Since December, both booking volumes and prices for the remainder of 2017 have been running ahead of the prior year. At this point in time for the remainder of 2017, cumulative advanced bookings are well ahead at considerably higher prices.","Now let's drill down into the cumulative book position. First for our North American brands, the Caribbean and the seasonal European programs are both well ahead in the prior year on both price and occupancy. For Alaska, occupancy is ahead at nicely higher prices. Secondly for our EAA brand, the European deployments which represent 62% of the remainder of 2017's capacity both price and occupancy well ahead of the prior year.","Finally, I want to provide you with an update on our full year 2017 guidance. As Arnold indicated, our first quarter results combined with our strong book position enabled us to raise our full year earnings guidance, the increase was driven by two things compared to our December guidance.","First, raising our net revenue yield guidance to 3%, a half point increase. And second, a benefit of $0.08 from lower fuel prices and the favorable impact of currency while net cruise cost without fuel for ALBD are still expected to up approximately 1% for 2017. Putting all these factors together, our increased adjusted EPS guidance for 2017 is $3.50 to $3.70 versus $3.45 for 2016.","And now, I'll turn the call back over to Arnold.","Arnold Donald","Thank you, David. Operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Please proceed.","Robin Farley","Great, hopefully, you can hear me okay. I couldn't help but noticed that the full year raise for earnings and yield is basically just the amount that you see, your first quarter guidance by. So, I was wondering if given the strength that you're seeing with bookings you through the quarter what's on the books will continue through the quarter. It seems like there would potentially be upside to the rest of your full year guidance maybe you could just select a little bit of color on that? And I don\u2019t know if you have any thoughts instead of demand from European passengers versus North American as we get later into the year? Thanks.","Arnold Donald","Okay. Thank you, Robin. We're always giving our best estimate at a given point in time and we're certainly doing that now, and we've got a long way to go till the end of the year and obviously we are going to do our best to beat the guidance as we always do. We have plucked up a little bit above what you see in terms of current fuel and currency and the gains in the first quarter, but we are also factoring in some contingencies for every impact we might see yet in the year.","Robin Farley ","Okay, that's actually always going to be provided by, if you had any thoughts about sort of demand brought by geography just here I know lot of the strength you set in Q1 was driven by Caribbean demand? And that will be rough of rest in Q3, so just if you had any thoughts on the other pieces? And maybe including, it sounds like obviously your guidance always fractures in that things may not be perfect through the year and so wondering, if you built in a lot because there were some of the political situation in China that's causing you to be more conservative that kind of thing? Thanks.","David Bernstein","Sure. Look in all of the remaining quarters of the year, we are expecting yield increases, and we are expecting good yield increases on both sides of the Atlantic. So, we do see good demand for both the European passenger as well as the North American passengers. And as far as the China and Korea situation is concerned, we are doing our best, it\u2019s early this just happens, it\u2019s unfortunate as Arnold indicated the itinerary disruptions. But keep in mind that we've got itinerary -- we\u2019ve had itinerary disruptions before we\u2019ve made some changes, and we've done our best to include what we believe the potential impact is in our guidance.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Please proceed.","Steve Wieczynski","So, can I ask a question little bit differently in terms of what Robin has asked, but I guess when you look at the yield guidance, I mean I can\u2019t remember the last time you guys raised your yields guidance so early in the year. So I guess the question is when you look back to December what markets really have changed so much in such a short-period of time to give you the comfort to raise that range so quickly?","Arnold Donald","Well, I think first of all just keep in mind, we are now into wave season and through wave season before we weren\u2019t, so you really have to see how things are going to play out. So, we've got a lot more information now, but we still have a long way to go. But based on what we see, we have the confidence that we share with you. By market a lot of people were concerned about the Caribbean and relative capacity changes on all that, and once again, we kind of demonstrated that we feel we are creating enough demand for the capacity that we have and are able to continue to see relative outperformance in the Caribbean. Alaska is also strong and David may have a comment. Europe is -- the North America brands for Europe are ahead on booking and ahead on pricing, so they are doing well as well as the A brands are doing well.","David Bernstein","Again, I just probably would reiterate everything Arnold said. I mean it was an excellent wave season and so we felt confident with the additional information to raise the guidance 0.5 point at this point in time. ","Steve Wieczynski","Okay got it and then second question, I don\u2019t know if you'll answer this or not, but in the release you talked about your book position being very strong at this point related to last year. Can you maybe help us think about that little bit more from a quantitative prospective meeting? How much inventory is actually left to sell this year versus last year? Can you put numbers around that at all?","David Bernstein","There is a little bit less left to sell for the reminder of the year than there was at this time last year. We had indicated that we're well ahead on occupancy and the booking curve has continued to move further out and we feel very good about the overall book position at this point. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Please proceed.","Felicia Hendrix ","If you could just stay on the booking curves on topic for one second, can you help us understand given the length of the booking curve perhaps? How booked you're for 2018 versus this time last year?","David Bernstein","We're ahead of the prior year for 2018. but keep in mind that it is very early\/ And so I would not read too much into that in terms of 2018, but we're ahead.","Felicia Hendrix ","Okay, that\u2019s good to hear. And then Arnold in your prepared remarks unless I miss something, you didn\u2019t really talk about the new CRM net yield system that you have implemented. And I'm just wondering, what are the most important aspects of that that will be evidenced to our as investment community that analysis your financials? And is there any way to quantify what that can do to your net yield? I know the impact is more in 2018 and 2019 and this year, but is there any where to that could be quantify for us?","Arnold Donald","We're not quantifying at this time, but what I can tell you directionally is about 30% of the inventory on the fixed brands and on that new revenue management to would be impacted in 2017, more in the 85% to 90% in 2018 of their inventory will be impacted. The results have been really good. Evidence of us for that is when the two suggests a different approach than the revenue science that would have taken without the two. And so early on, they're seeing things which may some go back and double and triple check to and we keep controls and what not. But it's really been helpful and we have absolutely seeing increased yield from the teams utilizing the two.","One of the most powerful things above the two though, it doesn\u2019t when I used an adjustment of the two fits let's so do it and it\u2019s the cause of right question inquiry and the right conversation. And now revenue management teams across the brands are in real-time collaboration, nonstop, and that alone with either without two enhancements will be beneficial, but with the two has been really powerful. So, I think we will maybe try to quantify some stuff they want. The two runs as core to volume, small amount of inventory right now and what again in different environments with the different conditions and different points in the booking curve over period of time and continue refinance. But it\u2019s no question it's helping us on yield right now.","Felicia Hendrix","That's a great and helpful and we look forward to more information on that and just that housekeeping. Can you give us the second quarter and full year G&A and interest expense guidance and then just review the capacity increases for the remaining quarters of the year and the full year? Thanks.","Beth Roberts","Sure. Depreciation in the quarter 460 million to the second quarter, full year depreciation should be about a $1.850 billion, interest expense running 50 million in the quarter, total interest expenses 200 million. It hasn't really changed that much and in terms of capacity growth by quarter we have 3.6% in the second quarter, 2% in the third, 2.1 in the fourth. ","Arnold Donald","And overall for the year I think 2.9.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup. Please proceed.","Greg Badishkanian","So two questions. First one sort of 2018 you mentioned bookings were well ahead or ahead, how about ATVs or pricing, the other side of that equation? I am assuming those are ahead too, right?","Arnold Donald","Yes, current.","Greg Badishkanian","And just on China, so how are the Chinese consumers really reacting to the South Korean travel ban whether it's you're hearing from your travel agent that bookings are impacted or you're seeing increase in cancellation. Is there any reaction to maybe adding an extra day fee versus an extra port in Japan just little bit of color on kind of how the consumers reacting?","Arnold Donald","Sure, keep in mind that China today is still more of a B2B business and so a lot of the movement happens at the distribution level terms of where they took groups of vacationers. So in any event, it\u2019s early, we have disruptions as David mentioned often around the world. So, we're placing with a sea day or second port in Japan in some cases you know that can be advantageous to us and sometimes have engaged advantages sort of yes. We are not a ferry, lot of times people wanting to go to Korea to shop and so I'm sure they're individuals that be disappointed that you know they can't go to Jeju to shop like they'd intended to, but we replace that with other ports our great experience on board we're hopeful that we can manage to get satisfaction. The issues still becomes in terms of the distribution, can we effectively persuade them within the same groups of people or will they switch, who they send and what's the impact of that.","Greg Badishkanian","And is it still first you know when you look at the first half being down, second half being up in terms of net yields. Is that -- could we still expect you know second half being up in that yields in China.","Arnold Donald","You know it's still too early to be sure, but we're hopeful that yields will be positive in the back half of the year and we're monitoring the situation, our team is absolutely working hard to make sure that we deliver.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar. Please proceed.","Jaime Katz","So, I'm curious one of your competitors last quarter said they were comfortable where the length of the booking window was, and it sounded like there was maybe some concerned that there would be revenues that were left on the table, if they continue to lengthen any further. Can you talk about maybe where you feel you guys are with the lengths over the booking curve and whether you would prefer to sort of stay where it is to optimize your revenue capture or continue to sort of lengthen from current length?","Arnold Donald","Our competitors are land based vacation, but I'm assuming you're talking about some of the other cruise company. But in any event, the issue on the just implementing the booking curve look, we are always trying to maximize the revenue and to do that where you want to be at a different point in the booking curve will vary all the time and has a lot to do with a bunch of things from itinerary mix to source market mix et cetera, et cetera. So, we are always trying to optimize that so we can maximize revenue. At this point, we wouldn\u2019t arbitrarily try to further lengthen the booking curve, but we wouldn\u2019t necessarily try to shorten it either. We're just monitoring and using our new revenue management two for the six brands and existing two for the other brands to help us sort that out. But our goal is to maximize revenue, not to have the longest booking curve.","Jaime Katz","Okay, and then as far as the new itinerary is going to Cuba, has there been any progress on sort of port infrastructure build outs to get some of the newer ships there, any movement just recently with the government and the changes that have happened in the government here as well?","Arnold Donald","No, not that I am aware of at this point in time, obviously, our numbers of ships going for the first time including Paradise for us which we are very excited about it, as I mentioned in my opening comments. So, we are sending largest ships Paradise probably the largest ship from the U.S. in Cuba going. And so, it won't happen overtime, they are going to pace and take their time, but again there is a lot of change already occurring there. Additional cruise companies are now going to Cuba after our initial four-way with Adonia and Fathom brand and so things are increasing and it will just have to continue to work with them and go at the pace they want to go. ","Jaime Katz","And then can I just clarify I think there was some commentary saying that the CAGR of the capacity growth was 4.5% for the 2021 was that for the specific brands or for the fleet?","Arnold Donald","That's our overall fleet-wise capacity growth and of course that number could vary it because we are focused obviously on a yield environment for us to grow we have to deal with the increased yield, we are not can be in a growth just through capacity because of the large base we have and so will what we need to do right now we are trying the curve trading demand that we are able to maintain and will suspend that than that capacity growth would be certainly capacity lot of continue with yield improvements if it's some reason that we all change or they changed and we've looked at some accelerating retirements because we are committed to measure capacity growth that are in our brands that allows us to increase yield until borrowing increased financial performance. That are the aspect about us that's a little different from the other folks and the industry is set. We have a lot of geography to spread our capacity over including new geographies potential like China and the Cuba and then we\u2019ve made brands. So, we have ten different brands. And so that growth was is really modest.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed.","James Hardiman ","I thought we could drill down geographically a bit here. I guess first at the Caribbean obviously the concern there was that after couple years of flattish capacity. 2017 we're seeing more moderate capacity growth. I guess from what you seen so far and obviously so far so good with respect to the first quarter. But maybe some of those capacity increases have been necessarily in reflect to being you numbers yet. But overall, how you're seeing the industry digests that incremental capacity, if you look out over your bookings, the reminder of the year? And then with respect to Europe, seems like things are getting better. How much for that just lapping some of the geopolitical events from last year? And how much of it is ultimately sustainable maybe some of these economies finally getting a little bit better seeing better demand?","Arnold Donald","One another thing that is interesting about the cruise business is we have never been able to show a strong coloration between the performance of the business and economies. So, we do well in recession periods and we do well in growth periods, obviously stronger economics undoubtedly our tailwind. But we haven\u2019t really been able to correlate performance directly to economies.","Have been said that back to original coming about the Caribbean, as you mentioned, our capacity growth is higher than shouldn\u2019t have been in the past few years. We haven't to get through the year, but right now we're well ahead on bookings, we\u2019re well ahead on pricing, and obviously the results through the first quarter were very strong and those itineraries have been completed. So, we're doing very well in the Caribbean, and we expect to continue to do well.","In terms of Europe I would say overall, again it's a combination of creating demand, measuring capacity growth to our brands in the European arena and just strong brand marketing on the prior of the North American brands for their European itineraries. And so, we're doing well and we've got way ahead on price and we're ahead on bookings.","David Bernstein","And the only thing I'll add is that the capacity growth, it is bigger in the second and third quarter then the full year for the Caribbean, but when we take a look at this in our book position and our expectation in that quarter, we do anticipate good solid pricing or yield growth in the Caribbean in all four quarters.","James Hardiman","Great and then couple of questions on the new administration and how that might impact your business or not. It sounds like you're full steam ahead with respect to Cuba, there've been grumbling that the Trump Administration may want to roll some of the progress under the Obama Administration with Cuba back a little bit. How do you think about that? Do you see that as a legitimate risk? And I don't know under Trump Administration is the actual listing of the embargo with significantly less slightly and does that impact further investment there that you\u2019re going to need to really grow that as a viable market? And then its travel ban, we've been hearing from other parts of the travel industry that international visitation to the U.S. had taken a hit. I don't think that would impact your business or the broader cruise industry best I can tell, but speak to that to whatever extent that's relevant.","Arnold Donald","Sure. I think on your -- on your first point around Cuba. What's regulating Cuba right now is Cuba. So, they're determining, how many ships are coming and which ships and what time and all of that. Should the Trump administration take a different position than exists today then we'll have to deal with that. Today to be honest with you Cuba, you can't find it in outnumbers, it's the one ship Adonia now will have Paradise going, which will be a little bit bigger ship, but still that's one ship not sailing every week even to Cuba. And so, it's going to be hard to find the numbers given the scale of our business. So, it's really building for the future and we'll see what happens. I learned a long time ago never to try to predict regulation or legislation or what an administration would do or won't do and we'll just have to play it all the time.","We obviously believe that people having the ability to travel is the good thing and we hope that steps will be taken to encourage travel rather than from restriction. So, we'll see how it plays out, but at this point in time, we're sailing ahead. In terms of the travel ban more broadly or similar kind of comment, first of all we haven't really been able to measure any impact from the noise around the travel ban or the actual bans themselves at this point in time. The only thing that can really directly impact us is severe restriction of travel, because we are discretionary travel and if people can't travel that will impact us. But we haven't seen anything to-date, we aren't anticipating anything, but obviously we would adapt and react our assets or mobile, that\u2019s one of the duties of our business. You know can have disruptions like China, them advising their citizens not to go to Korea and impacting no travel to Korea, and then we just redeploy and manage around.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura. Please proceed.","Harry Curtis","Quick question for David on nomenclature. What's better well ahead or considerably higher?","David Bernstein","You know considerably higher is better than well ahead, but we're just trying to give you directionally some color on the overall picture.","Harry Curtis","And you're throwing us a curve. So my first question is related to a comment that you made in the press release talking about reaching consumers through multiple touch points. I don't know what, to what degree there's any interaction between that and the CRM system, but can you talk about the expanded channels that you are -- that you're pursuing and whether or not it has more of an impact on revenue or on the cost side?","Arnold Donald","Okay, thank you. When we talk about multiple touch points, the goal is we're like with any advertising is just to keep your brand and in this case we want to keep cruise in a positive way, out in front of people all the time. So that when they're thinking about a vacation, they have that unique idea of what about the cruise, so that's that object how do we do that, we do it through all the traditional marketing and approaches with the brands taken and not traditional ones they take digital marketing, traditional advertising, media et cetera. We do it through the events with the new ships and ships are big promotional opportunity and every time we have a new ship and inaugural event where we get position wise out there.","We do it through the things like also the consumer electronics ensuring being the key note there that's a whole bunch of different media audiences that cruise now gets highlighted into the positive ways. So if someone who was being in the New York Times now goes to their technical publications, they are talking about cruise, they are talking about the New York Times down in cruise, so it's just reaching frequency. Most fundamental advertising concept there is, but doing in a way that's powerful, that's positive, that adds to understanding and hopefully entire to steep with the consider.","Cost versus revenue our marketing costs are up a bit over the last few years some of the savings we've been honestly we've reinvested to drive yield to trade demand and drive yield, but basically a lot of this reallocating the balance we were spending from one type of approach to another and then we've heavily leverage our public relation that as you can tell from everything have gone. So, it's not just the matter of producing the TV shows for example or producing an ad like the Super Bowl ad we did, but it's all of the public relations efforts around that, so leverage the impact of those executions.","Harry Curtis","Very good, and just wanted to shift gears really quickly to discuss free cash flow 2017 should be another strong year of free cash flow after all of your CapEx? You've got a very strong leverage ratio. Do you think that 2017, once again it balanced the share repurchase with dividends the way you did last year or do you see a better return buying more stock this year given your attracted multiple relative to any other consumer stock out there?","Arnold Donald","That will be a Board decision obviously at the time, but just philosophically we try to stay in a search ratio of dividend payout, turning some because dividends you're going to do those forever and hopefully and so that you want to make decision that you want to get some ratio there. And so we target a ratio on dividend payout and then the balanced we like to give back to the shareholders and stock repurchase.","Harry Curtis","Go ahead.","David Bernstein","So, I was going to say the target ratio that we have targeted historically and we've reiterated is about a 40% to 50% payout ratio and so we're constantly looking that where it will be talking to the board about the dividends and the remainder it's not just the free cash flow, but we've said a number of times that with the strong balance sheet we can return free cash flow and more to shareholders, and our expectation is we will do that overtime.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Beckel with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.","David Beckel ","Last quarter you had indicated that you are less than 50% book for China at that period of time, can you give us an update on 2017 China bookings. ","David Bernstein","The bookings in China at the moment are still ahead of the prior year, but it's all everything that just happened is indicated with Korea and itinerary disruptions. As Arnold indicated, it creates some caution and we try to include that in our guidance and in developing full year guidance as we had indicated. So, this is in evolving market and it\u2019s a B2B market as Arnold has walked you through. And so that next month or two will be, we'll learn a lot more and will be able to provide more information as we move forward. ","David Beckel","Got it, and might be little on fair given how recent the travel ban is, but I was wondering how you guys thought about what steps you would take if this ban were to persist through the end of this year for example? Are there any contingency plans for example moving your home ports further start or anything like that you would be evolving to share with us?","Arnold Donald","You mean the advice that Chinese government has given to their\u2026","David Beckel","Yes, if Korea is not an option for the reminder of the year?","Arnold Donald","Because you know technically it's not a travel ban, right. But anyway based on what they have said look, we think China is still one of the largest cruise market in the world, cruising is in there five year plan. We're excited about our partnership in China with CSSC, had another big signing, I mentioned with President Xi and Mattarella from Italy. So, we are very positive on China. We continue to make good money there. It's still holistically accretive to us versus our alternative deployments to the ships, so all those are positive indicators.","I don\u2019t like China forecast the regulatory stuff and all that, but in our guidance, we would assume this is going to persist through the end of this year. All indications are would be temporary. Again, it's just the matter of changing deployment. So you don't go to Jeju, you add an extra port in Japan or you have an extra sea day. And in overtime, we would be looking at other itinerary changes potentially maybe tapping more in the fly cruise and that type of things.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Stephen Grambling","You alluded to this in response to Harry question, but could you quantify trends you're seeing in new to cruise passengers and how that looks across regions?","Arnold Donald","I'll give you the overall data that has some qualitative comments by regions, but overall what's happening if you leave China out of it, it's just an artifact of the construct. New to cruise is decreasing as a percent of the total and the reason it is because of the bake of those cruise before it grows and industry is limited on the capacity growth with the number of shipyards. So, you actually see, if you leave China out of it. You actually see a decline in the percent of new to cruise in a given year, okay. So, that\u2019s the trend. Obviously for us, we're more as driven yields, our ship sail for, we have great occupancy. But we're focused on yield and so we're trying to drag demand like crazy because of the oldest economic rule there is, which is supply and demand. And so the more demand the more we can get yield, and that's what it\u2019s about when the terms of actually physically sailing a lot more people you know where capacity constraint as an industry which is the place to be.","David Bernstein","I don't have all the data, on the new to cruise by brand or by region, but I will say that when you look at it globally those regions or those brands that are growing faster tend to have a little bit higher new to cruise percentage, as you would imagine as you're growing the brand overall of the region overall, you have more first timers or new to cruise who are sailing on your ships during that period of time.","Stephen Grambling","That's helpful color, and then I guess changing gears a little bit on that 4% capacity growth of 2021 I guess how are you planning returns return on invested capital on those ships in your pipeline relative to the overall portfolio? And could the impact of these new ships drive you to push ships into retirement sooner if it makes sense? Thanks.","Arnold Donald","Yes, sure, first of all the new ships inherently give you a higher return on invested capital in general because of the mix of scale, the density, the efficiency, just the combination of everything and so you're going to build the new ships because they're inherently more efficient and position you for a stronger return on invested capital in all kind of environments. So, new ships are coming. Your question about does it encourage you or maybe cause acceleration of retirement you know that's more market demand question because as long as the ship is giving you the economic return across that there's always return on invested capital you want it, if the guests are happy with it, obviously that's step one and has to be relative to the guests.","But the guests are happy with it and you're getting an economic return you're going to keep sales and when it gets to the point where the capital you have to put into it is so great you can't get a return to maintain that ship at the guest standards and the regulatory standards or what have you, then you will retire or if you get to the point where you know you just aren't creating sufficient demand for the capacity you have you're going to retire ships. So it\u2019s an economic decision and we're always looking at each ship to see what the return is and what the alternatives there to drive the returns and the ship is unable in any environment and we look forward to get the kind of returns we need with the return on invested capital then that ship will ultimately either be sold off or scrapped.","Stephen Grambling","I guess one quick follow-up on nine quantifications, so are the new ships I guess what I was asking are the new ships relative to other new ships in the past getting a bigger contribution than they have historically for any reasons based on planning technology et cetera? Thanks.","Arnold Donald","Yes, I would say the newer ships today are getting even better returns obviously the industry is getting a better return. So you know in the past the industry was mid single digits or lower, industry is now creeping up and in our case, for our ships absolutely we're seeing a higher return on the new ships than we would have historically seen in the past on new ships. But we're driving our overall returns higher than we had in the past as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.","Tim Conder","Thank you. And again Arnold that's early and David and everyone congratulations. Couple of things here, just a clarification the 4% to 5% that you throughout there just to clarify that's net or gross number what you see?","David Bernstein","You're talking about the capacity growth through\u2026","Tim Conder","Yes, I am sorry.","David Bernstein","I know that assumes some retirements, it's 5% overall gross capacity growth, and just as we've always indicated, we've sold about 19 ships in the last decade, and we do have one leaving our fleet next month. And so we do anticipate that we will see a couple of ships leave the fleet overtime and we've factored that in.","Tim Conder","So that 4.5 midpoint is a net numbers what you are saying correct.","David Bernstein","Correct. ","Tim Conder","Okay, I know it's early, but yourselves and some competitors have laid out some capacity that itinerary already bookings open for through 2018. At this point what do you see the capacity growth outlook in some of the main regions in 2018 Caribbean. Alaska, Europe as a whole?","David Bernstein","We unfortunately, Tim, I don\u2019t have that detail available with us, we should have that for on the second quarter call for all of our brands. ","Tim Conder","Okay. And then two questions related to Europe, again it's unfortunate and then hopefully we don\u2019t see any more but any impact from the incidence in London last week and capacity that would seems with people are adjusting to the new world but just any commentary there. And then it's been trying before hasn\u2019t gone through but the EU Parliament and the base requirements for U.S. citizens just your thoughts on that it would be implemented in May that are you commissioned would approve what type of impacts would they have on North American's going to Europe?","Arnold Donald","Okay, first of all the London incident obviously very recent, we will see what kind of impact if any have has. But unfortunately, these things on a longer rare and historically what happened as we see any kind of a reaction is relatively short-lived and things bounce back and return. I have to see on this one, but I honestly don\u2019t anticipate a lot of impact, but we're monitoring and paying attention. But again these things are not that rare anymore unfortunately and people just in my opinion do the right thing and continue to live their lives. So, on that one, the second part of your question again what was it?","Tim Conder","EU parliaments passed a resolution or whatever that the U.S. citizens would need a visa, they come to Europe and can just use a passport trying to get some relief I guess for five countries and the EU were currently we require passport for them to come to the U.S. has been trying before I haven\u2019t gone through, but this if would -- what are your thoughts or potential impact of that Arnold?","Arnold Donald","I think the impact would be slim to none. The reality is U.S. citizens have to have reasons to go lots of places and they get them as and vice versa all the people travel to U.S. and what have you. So, visa is not an unusual thing than travel and I think it would have a limited impact.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.","Jared Shojaian","So demand is obviously very strong year to date, if you had to parse things out between that are macro tighter supplying your core markets with China and now on the global mix, and then just cruise specific initiatives to drive more consumer interests. How would you weight these three by what you think is most impacting the yield strength right now?","Arnold Donald","I actually think what\u2019s impacting the most is one thing you did mentioned, which is the guest experience on both the ships. And the most powerful marketing tool we have is word of mouth, our brands execute for the guests are exceptionally higher level, frankly across the industry and there is good execution for the guest. And I think collectively, that is actually driving demand more than anything. I think all the other things we do that the brands individually do, what we done at [Indiscernible] with the various television programs and PRF, it's an all back obviously add weight and the cumulative effect is the very positive thing. We\u2019ve seen specific increase in consideration and preference for the brands tied directly to the TV programs. We're on an ABC, NBC and the other networks. So, we see the physiological impact of that. All the time we think that actually translates and the people taking the cruise or taking more cruises that would have otherwise.","The macro effect a good economy is the good tailwinds I mentioned before, but also as I mentioned before, the economy is being great everywhere in the world. All economies on that grade but yet we fell see good improvement in cruise and those areas where economics is not great. And so I would say the macro has an effect but on a weighted basis versus the Beth that mentioned so far it will probably be reduced. In our case in some of our brands, I think our capacity management in Europe with Costa brand is particular had a positive impact for that brand; we use some ships into China. And in particular that brand which is kind a reduced capacity at points in time has benefited from managing capacity, proactively managing capacity. When they gets the newer shift that come in and have a even higher return that the capital basis, that brand was the continues perform, where they are doing well, they are growing earnings, they are growing yield and the way that they do that even on a bigger fashion, what's the new shift are coming in again in couple of years. So, that will be how we parse that out that, that answered your question?","Jared Shojaian","Yes, thank you. That\u2019s helpful, I guess the other side of the new to cruise equation are the repeat guest. So how does your recapture rate of first time cruisers compare today versus historically? So in other words, are you finding that a greater percentage of people cruising for the first time want to cruise again? Do you have any data or anything you can share on that.","Arnold Donald","What I can tell you is that the base obviously of those to cruisers the first time haven't expanded and therefore an aggregate number is look like, we got a higher percentage of repeat cruises as today the thing you had in the past. And in terms of the capture rate is strong, is much stronger then it was in past, that I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think so, so it's just artifact of the numbers that the number repeat cruises is to the higher percentage today than it was in the past. ","The trick was always as it works with the travel professionals to help people get on the right cruise for them, okay. If they get on the right cruise and their promoter scores are super high and the repeat is a given. If they get on the wrong cruise for them obviously you know that's a double problem. Number one, they may not repeat themselves, but also they're not going back telling their friends and family and colleagues, how wonderful cruise is and that hurts us even more. So the trick is to get them on the right cruise and we're working hard to do that and we've improved that for sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Assia Georgieva with Infinity Research. Please proceed.","Assia Georgieva","Good morning guys, congratulations on the great quarter and I guess I got very lucky to sneak in two quick questions. First of all in terms of the South Korean ban which we're not going to call a ban. If it were lifted let's say in a month, aren't you very flexible in terms of adding those ports of call pretty much immediately, is that fair?","Arnold Donald","Yes, we can make changes pretty quickly, the ones that have been redirected to a port in Japan maybe not, the sea day ones almost certainly. So it's that we can reintroduce.","Assia Georgieva ","And as a flip side to this Majestic Princess obviously is purpose built for China, but other ships new builds could be redirected elsewhere if you see decline in returns is that fair as well?","Arnold Donald","Well, it's absolutely fair, and also Majestic Princess even though she was purpose-built for China with some modifications she'd be free to sail anywhere in the world. I mean she would fit in the Princess brand. She still fits within the Princess brand and so we do have flexibility with the ship but we don't anticipate I mean we were excited about taking Majestic to China, having the first purpose built ship there we think there's opportunity for five fly cruise as we move the ship around the Chinese they fly somewhere and then cruise on Majestic which is you know purpose built for them so we think it's going to work really well, but the reality is for some reason it didn't. She's an outstanding ship that fits in the Princess fleet and we can move her anywhere.","Assia Georgieva","Great, it's great to have that flexibility. My second question is is it fair to assume for the second half of the year that and I know it's too early, especially in terms of Q4 but given comparisons and seasonality that Q3 the cadence of the quarters will probably show a Q3 that's better than Q2 and Q4?","David Bernstein","I think it's -- we're not at this point going to give guidance on Q3 and Q4. You've got the Q1 actuals, the Q2 guidance and the full year guidance and so overall you can see what the differential is it's not that great, baked into our guidance, but we're not going to give detailed guidance by quarter.","Assia Georgieva","David, thank you for avoiding that. Again thank you so much for taking my questions.","Arnold Donald","What I can tell you the team will be working really hard to make what you say come true though.","Assia Georgieva","I'm trying at my end here, you know tracking for if you know the signs, so I'm with you. You have a great day and again thank you for taking my questions.","Arnold Donald","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That thus concludes the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines."],"4371":["Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) Q4 2015 Results Earnings Conference Call December 18, 2015 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Arnold Donald - President and CEO","Micky Arison - Chairman","David Bernstein - CFO","Beth Roberts - IR","Analysts","Harry Curtis - Nomura","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays","Robin Farley - UBS","Steve Wieczynski - Stifel","Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs","Jamie Katz - Morningstar","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo Securities","Kevin Milota - JPMorgan","Dan McKenzie - Buckingham Research","Assia Georgieva - Affinity Research","Brian Egger - Bloomberg","Operator","[Audio Gap] Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. This is Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation & plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning. Today, I am joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison, David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Roberts, our Vice President of Investor Relations. Now before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking. I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release.","2015 was a great year for our company. In fact, one of our strongest ever, all thanks to the dedication and enthusiasm of our 120,000 team members who delivered nearly 11 million joyful vacation experiences. And due to the vital support from our tens of thousands of travel agent partners around the globe.","Despite a $0.10 drag from currency and fuel, despite macro economic and geopolitical challenges, despite MERS and despite the usual weather and other one-off events, we were able to exceed the high end of our full year guidance that we provided last December, delivering over 4% higher revenue yields, 40% growth in earnings and that's after a 25% earnings increase last year and well over $4 billion of cash from operations.","Our strong cash flow was more than enough to fund our capital commitments and return value to shareholders through our 20% increase in the dividend to over $900 million annually and the recent repurchase of more than $400 million of Carnival stock.","I am very proud of our team's many accomplishments this year, particularly the successful efforts to increase awareness and consideration for our great cruise vacations. , including our multi-faceted campaigns, those around the Super Bowl, that generated over 10 billion positive media impressions during the height of wave season.","P&O Cruises delivery of Britannia, the largest ship ever built specifically for British guests and named by her Majesty, Queen Elisabeth II, drawing a worldwide audience and a ringing endorsement of cruising. Princess Cruises' 50th anniversary celebration, which reunited the original cast of the Love Boat TV series and included an award-winning float in the Rose Parade.","Cunard's 175th anniversary salute to Liverpool where the three Queens, Elizabeth, Victoria and Queen Mary II, captivated 1.3 million onlookers in what may have been the largest attendance at a single day maritime event in history. And most recently, our five ship event in Sydney Harbour, which garnered P&O Cruises Australia well over three hours of live coverage on Australia's Today Show.","Now these well-crafted opportunities showcase our brands, increase an awareness and consideration for our cruise vacations. In fact, our positive media impressions are up threefold in just two years.","This year, we made significant progress on multiple other efforts designed to further our journey toward consistent yield improvement by creating demand and excess of supply. Now we reinforced our leadership position in the burgeoning China cruise market with the successful introduction of our fourth ship in 2015.","And we are well positioned in 2016 with two more year-round ships entering the market, one each for our Costa and Princess brands. In 2017, we will have both our Carnival Cruise Line and AIDA brand enter the market along with Princess Cruises' Majestic Princess, the first ship built specifically for Chinese guests and designed to maximize Chinese consumer demand.","In addition, we recently signed a joint venture with CSSC and CIC to begin a new cruise brand in China. Eventually, we expect to bolster our growth in China for many years to come. Entering the market with multiple brands allows us to grow our presence faster and achieve deeper penetration by serving more of the differentiated market segments that exist there.","We also launched our 10th brand in the Carnival Corporation family, Fathom, addressing a whole new travel category. We are excited about the prospects of doing good while offering meaningful experiences to travelers, initially to the Dominican Republic.","We are also excited about our planned sailings to Cuba, made possible by Fathom. To date, Fathom has helped generate over 20 billion media impressions and counting.","Now, of course, the best way to increase demand is to continue to exceed our guests' expectations. We continue to bring the best specialty restaurants and celebrity chef-designed menus to sea. We have further elevated the guests' dining experiences through our growing list of celebrity chefs, which now include the renowned Thomas Keller, as well as Australian chef, Curtis Stone and chocolatier, Norman Love, joining Marco Pierre Weight, Guy Fieri and David Burke, amongst others.","Our entertainment offering continues to be further enhanced, including BB King's Blues Club, Lincoln Center Stage and composer, Stephen Schwartz of Wicked, along with a host of other innovations. The diversity of great entertainers aboard our ships keeps getting better with headliners like folk legends Crosby, Stills & Nash, jazz star, Herbie Hancock; country singer, Trace Adkins; Diana Ross and even the Grinch through Carnival Cruise Lines Seuss at Sea program.","And to give consumers yet another reason to take a cruise, we will even host our first fashion week at sea. Now these, along with fresh retail and gaming options, including the launch of innovative new mobile gaming at sea, are all designed to offer guests even more of what they want and in turn drive higher onboard revenue.","We are realizing the benefits from improved coordination, which has already contributed to the yield [ph] improvements we've seen. We've now completed the design phase of a common revenue management system for six of our brands; the full impact of which we will begin to see in 2017.","We continue to share learning\u2019s to improve onboard beverage revenues through bar-related experienced innovation, menu design and all-inclusive beverage offerings. The behavior of communicating, collaborating and coordinating has already resulted in improved beverage revenue across the fleet; yet it is still in its early stages.","Now we've also prioritized 2016 sourcing savings opportunities and have identified efforts to deliver another $75 million of cost savings, bringing the cumulative total since we began the conversation to $170 million to help offset inflation.","Clearly, all these efforts and many others are simply building blocks. And its very gratifying to see return on invested capital in the year at nearly 7.5%. Now that's up from roughly 4.5% just two short years ago.","In fact, a number of our brands have reached the double-digit threshold already, including our flagship brand, Carnival Cruise Lines. We are very, very proud of the Carnival brand team who have worked so hard and so effectively to accelerate the brand's return to double-digit return on invested capital.","So look, we have much more to do to keep the momentum going into 2016 and beyond. In 2016, we are especially excited about our new ship deliveries, AIDAprima, Carnival Vista, Holland America [indiscernible] and Seabourn Encore, offering innovative features such as an outdoor ice rink, a lazy river ride, an open air sky ride, the first IMAX theater at sea and BLEND, the first purpose-built personalized wine blending venue at sea and many, many others, all engineered to help exceed guests' expectations.","We expect each delivery to help drive demand well in excess of our measured supply growth. Our capacity growth in both North America and Europe is less than 2% next year. As expected, our overall 3.5% capacity growth is less than the industry growth and will again be weighted toward the Asia-Pacific region as we transfer our capacity to meet the increasing demand there.","We remain committed to our ongoing strategy to drive demand and our booking levels for the first three quarters of 2016 are well ahead of last year with pricing comparisons turning increasingly positive.","Of course, we start the year with our usual degree of caution since we give guidance before the wave season begins and we face more difficult comparisons as we lap our very strong 2015 success.","At this point in time, we expect a favorable environment in North America tempered somewhat by ongoing geopolitical and macro economic uncertainties, particularly for European markets and destinations.","We currently expect another 20% improvement in earnings in 2016 to a midpoint of $3.25. That's a historical high for our company and more than double what we earned in 2013. As we benefit from continued strong operational execution and at the moment an added boost from the net impact of fuel and currency.","Now while we cannot count on this benefit from fuel and currency over time and while the path may not always be smooth, we are confident in achieving our double-digit threshold and we have multiple avenues to get there.","So while we are briefly celebrating the year and indeed it was a great year, we remain focused on our primary objective. We expect return on invested capital of 8.5% in 2016 and we expect to reach double-digit return on invested capital in the next two to three years.","And now I'd like to turn it over to David.","David Bernstein","Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I'll start today with a summary of our 2015 fourth quarter and full-year results. Then I will provide some insights on current booking trends and finish up with some color on our 2016 December guidance.","Our adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.50. This was $0.12 above the midpoint of our September guidance. The improvement was essentially driven by two things, $0.04 from net revenue yields, which benefited from improved pricing on last minute bookings, as well as strong onboard spending, and $0.05 from lower fuel prices and currency.","I am pleased to report that we still would have been significantly higher than guidance even without the benefit of lower fuel prices and currency.","Now let's turn to the fourth-quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 2%. The North American brands were essentially flat, while the European, Australian and Asian brands, also known as our EAA brands, were up close to 6%.","Our total net revenue yields in the fourth quarter were up just over 4%. Let's break apart the two components of net revenue yield. Net ticket yields were up almost 4% driven by our North American brands from improvement in the Caribbean and late season Alaska programs.","Net onboard and other yield increased just over 4.5%, mainly related to bar, casino and communications as our initiatives in those areas continue to pay dividends. Net cruise cost per ALBD, excluding fuel, were up just over 3%, which was in line with September guidance.","In summary, the fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.23 higher than the prior year driven by operational improvements worth $0.13 and favorable net impact of lower fuel prices and currency worth $0.10.","Now let's look back at the full year. Our adjusted EPS was $2.70 versus $1.93 for the prior year. The $0.77 improvement resulted from $0.46 of operational improvements driven by a strong 4.3% revenue yield improvement and a $0.31 benefit from lower fuel prices and currency.","The 2015 adjusted EPS exceeded the high end of the initial guidance range we gave last December of $2.30 to $2.60. The improvement over last year's December guidance resulted from essentially two things, $0.40 of higher net revenue yield from better than expected net ticket yields at our North American brands driven by Carnival Cruise Lines and stronger onboard and other yields. This was partially offset by a $0.10 drag from fuel prices and currency.","Let's turn to booking trends for 2016. As I indicated at the beginning of my remarks, all of my references to ticket prices will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. We have transitioned our P&L analysis from constant dollars to constant currency.","We are now working to transition our bookings data to constant currency as well, which we expect to complete over the next year. We do currently have some bookings data in constant currency that we will share with you.","However, you will occasionally hear me refer to certain bookings data in terms of constant dollar until the transition is complete. Remember that constant dollar comparisons do not remove transactional currency impacts.","For example, constant dollar does not remove the currency impact of the Aussie dollar revenue at our US dollar brand Princess Cruises. At this point in time, for the first three quarters of 2016, cumulative fleetwide bookings are well ahead at slightly higher prices. The fact that we are well ahead on the booked position with less left to sell should bode well for pricing on future bookings.","Now let's drill down into the cumulative fleetwide book position. First, for our North American brands, Caribbean occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at higher prices. For Alaska, occupancy is nicely ahead of the prior year at higher prices. 2015 was a great Alaskan season and 2016 is shaping up to be even better.","For the seasonal European program, occupancy is nicely ahead of the prior year at lower constant dollar prices, primarily driven by transactional currency and ship mix as the Carnival Vista is sailing a Mediterranean program this summer right after we take delivery of the ship in Italy. Secondly, for our EAA brands, both occupancy and pricing are in line with the prior year.","Now turning to booking volume. Since September, for the first three quarters of 2016, booking volumes are in line with the prior year at higher prices. Since our book position is ahead and we have less to sell than the prior year, booking volumes being in line with the prior year is an encouraging trend that gives us the opportunity to get higher prices on the remaining bookings.","Finally, I want to provide you with some color on 2016. Many early indications are positive, but as Arnold mentioned, our guidance is tempered by ongoing geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties, particularly for the European markets and destinations.","With that said, for 2016, we are expecting net revenue yields to grow by approximately 3%. This increase does include one point of yield resulting from an accounting reclassification in our EAA segment.","However, the reclassification has no impact on operating income as the dollar change in net revenues is offset by an equivalent dollar change in the cruise cost. For the full year, we are expecting to see yield improvement in almost all itineraries.","However, we are being cautious on Asia where industry capacity is expected to increase by 33% this year and Australia where the industry capacity is expected to increase by 19%.","Now turning to costs. Net cruise costs without fuel per ALBD are expected to be up approximately 2% for 2016. However, this does include a 1.5 point increase resulting from the reclassification in our EAA segment that I previously mentioned.","Without the reclassification, costs would be flat to up slightly, which is in line with what I indicated on the September conference call. Broadly speaking, there are four major drivers of the cost change.","First, we expect to benefit about 0.75 of a point from the lower drydock days in 2016. Secondly, we are forecasting about a point of benefit as we further leverage our scale. Offsetting these benefits is about 1.5 points for forecasted inflation and additional investments in both the products and new markets, which we expect to cost about 0.5 point.","This includes enhancements to both entertainment and food, along with the upfront investments by Carnival Cruise Line and AIDA in 2016 to support their entry into China in 2017.","For 2016, we are forecasting to benefit from the impacts of lower fuel prices, which we expect to be partially offset by the stronger dollar. The net favorable impact of lower fuel prices and currency included in our guidance is $0.22 versus the prior year. Putting all these factors together, our adjusted EPS for 2016 is $3.10 to $3.40 versus $2.70 for 2015.","And now I wanted to share with you some of our current rules of thumb about the impact of currency and fuel prices on our 2016 results. To start with, a 10% change in all relevant currencies relative to the US dollar would impact our P&L by approximately $0.30 for the full year and $0.04 for the first quarter.","For fuel price changes, a 10% change in the current stock price represents a $0.10 impact to the full year and $0.02 impact for the first quarter. The third rule of thumb relates to our fuel derivative portfolio. A 10% change in Brent would result in a $0.04 change in realized losses on fuel derivative for the full year and a $0.01 impact for the first quarter.","On a final note, for your planning purposes, I wanted to let you know that we expect the March conference call to be a little later in March than usual to allow time for internal management meetings that will be held around the South Florida Cruise Shipping Convention in mid-March.","And now I will turn the call back over to Arnold. ","Arnold Donald","Thank you, David. Operator, now let's open it up for questions, please. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this question-and-answer session is being recorded Friday, December 18, 2015. One moment please for the first question. Our first question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura. Please proceed with your question.","Harry Curtis","Good morning, everyone. First with a revenue related question. You talked about the inventory left to sell. If you could put that in percentage terms, do you have 50% of your inventory left to sell through the first three quarters? I'm just trying to get a sense of how much is left to sell.","David Bernstein","Generally speaking when we talk about where we are at this point in time for the whole year, we are about half sold, far more sold than the first and second quarter than the back half of the year, but we are about 50% sold on average.","Harry Curtis","Okay. Very good. And then my second question is related to fuel. Do you have any interest in changing the way that you are approaching your hedges given the extremely low level of bunker fuel and the impact that it could have should the price of Brent for whatever reason increase significantly?","Arnold Donald","Hi, Harry. Good morning. We review that constantly, but so far, with forward pricing, we haven't seen an opportunity to do anything that we think makes sense. Obviously, nobody really knows, as is evidenced by what happened the last couple of years. But we constantly review it. But at this time, we see no reason to do anything different.","David Bernstein","Keep in mind that given the collars and given the fact that the bottom of the collars are roughly $78 to $80, if fuel does go up, we are very well protected up until the $80 and then we get back into the collars. So we are well protected at the bottom end.","Harry Curtis","Okay. My concern is not the bottom end; it's the top end.","David Bernstein","We do have the high end in the collars, but, as Arnold said, we are not changing, given our point of view and given the amount of collars we have out there, we feel that we are well-protected for the next three years.","Harry Curtis","All right. Perhaps I'll give you a shout later on to get into more detail on that. Thanks.","Arnold Donald","Okay, you bet. And just one last comment, the last time we almost pulled the trigger on that, we would have taken all the losses and then a couple of days later, we would have been back in a loss situation again. So we constantly look at it though.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Please proceed.","Felicia Hendrix","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So you guys have both said in your prepared remarks in the guidance in your yield guidance, you built in some cautious outlook.","One point was caution regarding Europe and the geopolitical events. Just wondering how much that's weighing on your yield forecast for 2016?","Arnold Donald","At this time, overall, we are being - we hope we are being conservative. If you look at the high end of our guidance, that would be a 4% yield improvement. So definitely it's factored in along with a host of other things.","But we feel confident we are going to see yield improvement next year. At this point in time, we've done what we think is prudent and makes the most sense. We are pre wave. We've got a lot of information yet to see.","Felicia Hendrix","And that 4% is inclusive of the reclassification?","Arnold Donald","Yes, on the high end of the guidance.","Felicia Hendrix","Yes. Okay, just wanted to make sure. And then just moving to Asia where you are also being cautious because of the capacity increases there, when you look at China specifically for next year, what's the trajectory of pricing that you have baked into your forecasts?","Arnold Donald","In the end, we expect overall our returns in China to be above the fleet average again next year. We have a significant capacity increase, 60% plus and around 60%. And so we - it's a unit growth story for us in China.","So we are anticipating that while yields may come down a bit on balance, our returns are going to be better than the fleet average and overall, we are very, very positive on the China market.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Please proceed.","Robin Farley","Great, thanks. I wonder if you could, on the China question, give us a sense just kind of ballpark of what you think China maybe contributed to your yields in '15 and what part of your guidance for next year is driven by China?","David Bernstein","In 2015, keep in mind, we did have about a 50% increase in capacity in China. And also with the impact of MERS, we did see yields down just a little bit in China in 2015. And as Arnold indicated, we are looking at a 60% increase in China capacity in 2016.","And so - but it is a unit growth story and China is still getting yields, particularly on the ticket side way above other parts of our business and it's an excellent market and it's gotten a very promising increase.","Keep in mind though that China is still in 2016 just 5% of our business and so it's a very small piece of the total. But, as Arnold said, it's a unit growth story and over time, we do expect it to be very promising.","Robin Farley","Okay. Great. And my other question is I know your commentary about volume and pricing better than the guidance that you had talked about in September. But I'm just thinking about in the last month or the last five weeks, there's been a few incidents in the world.","Can you give us a sense of maybe how - I would assume there's some volume reduction initially after a disruption and then are volumes back to normal levels now versus a couple of weeks ago?","Arnold Donald","We saw some impact from the events and the media associated with it and obviously saw the European activity was particularly impacted. We saw some movement for North America brands - for itineraries that had that as a destination.","All that's been factored into our guidance going forward. It's reflected in our projections and we feel confident about the projections at this point in time.","David Bernstein","Overall, I mean, as Arnold indicated, we see the blip, but it has started to improve and we feel very good about the overall trend and where we are today. So - and we built all of that into our current guidance.","Robin Farley","Great. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Please proceed.","Steve Wieczynski","Good morning, guys. So, David, you kind of glanced over the accounting reclassification, I guess. Could you go into a little bit more detail as to what exactly it is and I guess why, at this point, why is this being done now?","David Bernstein","Steve, it relates, as I said, to the EAA brand and it simply is a re-class between revenue and cost and there is no impact on operating \u2013 I am sorry, operating income. It really benefited internal management reporting and really this change, it's not material.","We weren't even required to disclose it, but we just wanted to be transparent so that everybody understood where the revenue yields were and that the 3% did benefit by about a point of the accounting reclassification.","Steve Wieczynski","So I guess another way to say it too is that if you look at your yield guidance for next year, it's essentially 2% and then I think Arnold noted on the top end of that could be more like 3%. Is that the right way to think about it?","Arnold Donald","That's the right way to think about it, yes.","Steve Wieczynski","Okay. And then second question, I guess, just a little bit bigger picture question with China. I guess, Arnold, how do you think about the market in terms of you guys are taking a bunch of different brands in that market, AIDA and Costa and some other brands like that.","Do you think an AIDA brand will resonate well in that market, and is it something that along the lines down the road you could create a little bit more confusion with the tour agencies over there? ","Arnold Donald","I think, first of all, as you are well aware, there are over 100 million outbound tourists in China already and today, cruise is capturing less than a million of those tourists and that number is going to grow dramatically in terms of the total number of outbound tourists and the fit for cruise is far greater than, less than 1%. So there's plenty of demand.","And then the Chinese are not that different than Americans or Europeans or anyone else. There's a huge distribution curve of different interests and appetites. For some, a German product is going to be something they are very excited about; for others, an Italian product; for others, an American product and so on.","And so we see the opportunity in China to introduce a number of brands to take advantage of the pent-up demand there and to fit the various appetites and desires and different types of cruising experiences that the Chinese will want, similar to other people around the world. So that's it in a nutshell.","So yes, we are launching AIDA and Carnival brands in 2017. We already have Princess and Costa there today. We have the joint venture with CSSC and CIC for a domestic brand launch sometime in that kind of timeframe.","And so we are very excited about China. It is today only 5% of our capacity. There may be discontinuities at times as you try to get distribution lined up with that pent up demand, but it's all, from our perspective, very manageable.","But a very great market, a strong future market, a contributing market today to the bottom line and to our whole approach on developing relative scarcity around the world.","So the capacity growth that you see for us, a lot of that goes to China and therefore - and similar for some of the other companies in the industry as well. And so that constrains the capacity growth in the other markets.","Steve Wieczynski","Thanks for that, Arnold. Could I add one more question onto the end of that I guess, when you look at China next year and your yields there next year, will there be a significant impact from your change in terms of port mix and also some colder itineraries as well?","Arnold Donald","We've been sailing year round in China for a while. As you know, we are number one in China in terms of home port activity and so we've been season-long. So you won't see a lot of seasonality in our business.","You won't see a lot of port differentiation at this point either between Shanghai and Tianjin and the mix of our business either in China. So we are expecting again good yields in China, better than the fleet average next year. But with capacity expansion, we do recognize it's more of a unit volume growth play than a pure yield play.","Steve Wieczynski","Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Steven Kent","Hi, good morning. Two questions. First, we saw a news story that Costa will be selling direct in the UK. Is that something we could see in other markets or for other brands in the UK? So that's my first question.","And then, second, look, your guidance has been very conservative the last few quarters. This quarter, $0.50 was $0.10 above the high end of the range. I guess what I'm trying to understand from an operating perspective is where is that upside coming from quarter after quarter since so much of your bookings are on the books, they are pre-sold. So I'm trying to see where the variability is when you look back over the past few quarters to the upside?","Arnold Donald","Okay, first of all, concerning the Costa comment, travel agents are absolutely essential to our business. They are a critical part of our business. And something got lost in translation or whatever, but the bottom line is we are not moving away from travel agents. The reality in the UK for Costa is that they have very little business there and they are choosing to concentrate elsewhere.","However, travel agents in the UK who choose to book on Costa can still do that. The existing travel agents who are approved travel agents, they can still do that and they can do it through Genoa and the mechanism is in place. So something got lost in translation there, but Costa is not going direct in the UK.","David Bernstein","And your second question, Steve, there's a lot of moving pieces to our guidance. I guess I would categorize them into four categories that affect our ability to get the accuracy correct.","First of all, the net ticket revenue. I mean, yes, we always say 85% to 95% of our bookings are on the books when we give the conference call, but we are trying to project that last 10% or 15% and like this time in the fourth quarter, we got better last-minute pricing on those bookings and that positively impacted the results.","Second is onboard. We have no advanced bookings for onboard revenue and it gets very difficult to project the exact amount of money that 2.5 million or 3 million people are going to spend each quarter on our ships, and so this quarter, we were a couple of cents better on onboard revenue.","Third is net cruise costs. And I think, as I've said in the past, while we are pretty good at the full year, it's very difficult to predict every single month and every single quarter the exact split. So we do occasionally talk about the seasonality or the timing between the quarters.","And really the fourth is fuel and currency. I mean, if you've got a crystal ball that we could use, I would love to have it, but I will tell you, we take the current spot price of fuel and the current currency rates and we bake them in and they do change.","In fact, in the fourth quarter, as I indicated, we saw a $0.05 improvement from the net impact of fuel and currency. So those are the four things that vary and we are doing the best we can.","Arnold Donald","Obviously, we've beaten the high side estimate for a number of quarters in a row and beaten guidance at minimum a number of quarters in a row. We're going to work like crazy to keep doing that.","Having said that, it's not always going to be smooth sailing and certainly quarter-to-quarter not, and maybe not even year-to-year. And so we do the best we can in the forecast. But fundamentally we are on a path to get to the double-digit return on invested capital.","And that's the ultimate goal, and we celebrate the mileposts along the way and we work like crazy to accelerate achieving that and we will continue to do that. But we are trying to be as transparent as we can.","Steven Kent","Okay. Thank you. ","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jared Sajan [ph] with Wolfe Resources. Please proceed.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So you said advanced bookings are well ahead of last year, but does that apply to advanced book load factors as well more on an occupancy basis?","And if so, how do you arrive at just 2% yield guidance with higher bookings and higher prices? Thanks.","David Bernstein","When we say bookings are ahead, we are talking about booked load factors or occupancy onboard the ship. So you can say it's sort of like a, let's call it a capacity-adjusted metric. So we are definitely looking at occupancy and we are looking at cabin occupancy.","Now prices are ahead. We talked about that, but we have only recently seen pricing turn positive, as Arnold had discussed. And so overall we had indicated we are slightly ahead and so we do have to see a continuation of this improvement for us to achieve our overall 2% yield guidance in the net ticket yield basis.","So with that in mind and also tempered by the macroeconomic and geopolitical issues, we think we gave you our best guess it's a 2% yield guidance, but we hope we are being conservative and do better.","Arnold Donald","3% yield guidance.","David Bernstein","3%, sorry. Forgot about the accounting re-class, apologize.","Unidentified Analyst","Right, okay. Thanks. And then just as a follow-up, separate question here, are you comfortable taking on incremental debt to fund the buyback? And assuming you have $4 billion in CapEx for next year, correct me if that's not the right number, plus about $1 billion for the dividend.","It would seem like you would have to take on more debt if you want to buy back stock. So can you just help us understand how you are thinking about that? Thanks, guys.","David Bernstein","Sure. Okay, well, it's a couple of factors that we are putting here. First of all, if you go back to 2015 and you look at what we did, we had, in 2015 about $2 billion of free cash flow.","We returned $800 million in the form of dividends. By the end of the year, we had only returned $300 million in the form of share buyback. So we still - we returned $1.1 billion and we still, as of year end, have $900 million of free cash flow that we are expecting to return in 2016. so we've got end - we also have significant free cash flow expected in 2017. So we have plenty of opportunity to return free cash flow to shareholders.","And on top of that, I think I've said this before, over the long run, if all we do is return free cash flow to shareholders because of the earnings over time, we would delever.","So overall debt levels over the extended period of time can increase and we can maintain the same leverage ratios and return that cash flow to shareholders as well.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Katz with Morningstar. Please proceed.","Jamie Katz","Hi, everybody. Good morning. I have a couple questions. First, can you talk a little bit about the CSSC relationship and how you are preliminarily thinking about building out that relationship, whether there's an opportunity to move some older ships into capacity there or if you are thinking about maybe newbuilds despite putting so much new capacity into China, or maybe you haven't gotten to that point yet?","Arnold Donald","Yes, so, first of all, we had an original memorandum of understanding agreement that basically covered everything, port development, shipbuilding, domestic cruise company ship-owning, etc.","And we now have, from that agreement, executed a joint venture agreement around establishing a domestic brand together there. So we're concepting that out with them. Over time, that brand, whatever form it takes, would include both ships transferred in, existing ships, as well as newbuilds over time.","And clearly, CSSC being a shipbuilding entity is clearly interested eventually in building cruise ships. And they also have an agreement with Fan Cantiere [ph] in development around shipbuilding.","So ultimately, it would involve new ships and just keep in mind that the China market over time will, probably like it is in almost every other consuming activity, be the largest market in the world just from sheer numbers. So over time, China will be able to absorb many, many, many cruise ships.","So we are excited about it. We are looking forward to developing it. We are excited that that agreement is now reflected in China's national five-year plan showing their commitment to development of a cruise industry and to working with us, and so we are really looking forward to the partnership.","Jamie Katz","Okay. And then on some of the cost savings that you've talked about, I know in the past you guys have talked about things like air. But I'm curious if the next $75 million in cost savings that you mentioned earlier on the call are coming from new opportunities and maybe what those opportunities are.","Arnold Donald","We have efforts going on an ongoing basis, so it's important for me with the organization that these aren't one-off projects. Its ongoing underlying behavior, communicating, collaborating, coordinating, and so airlines, we definitely have realized benefits from that and we'll continue to going forward. In the area of food and beverage, we are beginning to pick up momentum in that area across the brands as they collaborate with each other.","And it's not only on the cost savings side, which was your question, but it's also on the revenue-generating side in terms of how they package beverage packages, how they are presented to the guests, who presents them to the guests, the incentives involved, the timing and learning\u2019s from that that actually help drive onboard revenue as well.","Other areas include technical, which we are at the very beginning of. There's huge opportunity in that area and we are not even - we've barely begun that one. And there are a host of other areas as well.","David Bernstein","Yes, things like media buying and marketing, port shore excursions. I mean, there's a long list of things. We are working through them in a variety of phases because you can't accomplish everything at one time.","So we did a point last year, $75 million to $80 million last year. We are doing another $75 million this year and we hope to continue to be able to produce additional savings in 2017 and beyond.","Arnold Donald","And again, it's not just a one-shot deal. These are ongoing behaviors that constantly drive savings in the areas. So it's not a one and done in the various areas, but we are very excited about them, especially excited about seeing the behavior and the enthusiasm of our various team members who are engaged in this and working together.","Jamie Katz","Okay. And then, lastly, would you guys be kind enough to offer just capacity growth by quarter if you have it?","Beth Roberts","It is 3.9% for the first quarter, 1.8% for the second, 3.9% for the third, 4.3% for the fourth for a total of 3.5% on the year.","Jamie Katz","Excellent. Thank you, guys, so much.","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Tim Conder","Thank you. Just a couple here. Arnold, you had mentioned when you sort of started laying out your vision for the Company here of it's much easier to generate incremental revenue from your existing customer base.","Can you maybe give us an update as to where repeaters stand right now, maybe just in North America and Europe? I know a lot of the new customers are coming from Asia, but just in North America and Europe, your customer base repeaters versus first-timers?","And then as it relates to China, how should we think about comps sitting net yields versus as you expand into new sourcing areas from China versus capacity? I guess if we had to break down your net yield outlook, it sounds like it's going to be down a little bit given multiple factors, are comps sitting at yields still looking pretty good? And then I guess do you have to lower a price for somebody that's a first-timer in China?","Arnold Donald","Okay. Well, let me answer your first question with regards to just onboard revenue generation. Could you repeat that again - the first part of your question?","Tim Conder","It relates mostly to\u2026","Arnold Donald","Oh, first-timers\u2026","Tim Conder","In US and Europe in particular.","Arnold Donald","Yes, two disruptions for first-timers. First, there was a lot of capacity last year in the Caribbean, a lot of capacity and to fill that capacity, we had to have last year a lot of first-timers to fill out that capacity last year.","It was a major increase and I'm talking now 2014, okay, in the Caribbean. And so that expanded the base for the Caribbean. You mentioned China already as being the other component.","Outside of those two dynamics, the trends are pretty much the same as they have been in the past, which is a smaller and smaller percentage of new to cruise only because the base is getting larger and that base grows and capacity isn't expanding dramatically.","So there's always a slight downward trend in number of new to cruise required if you don't have significant capacity increase in any other market. So it's just an artifact of the numbers.","If you look at our total business though, that's a little bit different because we have approaching 11 million individual guests a year and probably 3.4 million of those are new to cruise.","A large portion of that number - it used to be 2.7 million. A large portion of that number is driven by China and as I mentioned, that big expansion in 2014 of capacity in the Caribbean.","In regards to China, we don't have like same city, if that was what you were asking. Our sourcing -- we expand the sourcing as we expand ships, but the ports that they are selling from are the same and so Shanghai and basically Tianjin.","And so we are expanding the sourcing, we are reaching further out into the China market for guests, but in terms of -- the ports are pretty much the same.","David Bernstein","Yes, and Tim, when you look at it, same port year-over-year, we are actually hoping to do better year-over-year in the yields, but keep in mind, as Arnold indicated, we are looking at approximately a 50%, 60% capacity increase in China.","So we are being cautious, as I indicated, in our guidance as we move forward into next year. But, remember, overall that China yields are better than the fleet average. It is only 5% of our overall business and it is a great market. And so it's a unit growth story and the operating income in China is improving quite dramatically from 2015 to 2016.","Tim Conder","Okay. I guess with the questioning on China, I was just trying to understand, as the industry has entered the market, you get the great prices and if you are growing penetration, should you still get that same price because everybody is coming from the same base of not knowing what a cruise is.","So - or is it just trying to put a lot of capacity through a very tight funnel? Is that what's pulling the yields down? But I do get the thing that overall from a global mix standpoint, this is still very, very positive for yourselves and the industry.","Arnold Donald","Again, there are some discontinuities potentially in the market because of the way the distribution channel operates and where we are chartering ships and what have you. But philosophically, our intent is for strong pricing in China and China is a place where we are profitable.","We intend to be profitable and if things started moving a different direction or prices plummeted too far, then we would pace the growth and we would change destinations for the ships. We don't have any interest in creating a market in China, that's a big discount market or anything like that.","Tim Conder","Okay, great. Thanks for the clarification.","Arnold Donald","But it's still above the fleet average.","Tim Conder","Okay. Thank you for the clarification and great year.","Arnold Donald","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Milota with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin Milota","Hey, good morning, everyone. Two model-related questions here. Within your guidance, have you assumed any buybacks and if so, could you give us a dollar amount that's pegged there?","And then secondly, on the income statement, what in the 3.10 to 3.40 EPS guidance, what are you factoring in for the fuel derivative net impact to EPS? Thank you.","David Bernstein","Sure. We did not include any - we did not assume any additional buybacks in our guidance. We had bought back a little over 8 million shares as of yesterday. We did assume that in our guidance, but we have not assumed any additional.","And as I did mention, we probably still have another $900 million or $800 million from this point forward of free cash flow from last year that we can return to shareholders. As far as the 3.10 to 3.40, the fuel derivative, I think it was\u2026","Beth Roberts","It looks like about 200\u2026","David Bernstein","No, no, no, in 2016, it was $336 million of losses.","Kevin Milota","And that's on a net basis?","David Bernstein","Realized losses, yes.","Kevin Milota","Okay. And could you just confirm the dollar amount? So you did $300 million in buybacks in the fourth quarter and about $100 million or so here in the first quarter of '16?","David Bernstein","Yes, something close to that.","Kevin Milota","Okay. Very good. Thank you.","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your question.","Dan McKenzie","Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Congrats on the quarter. I am wondering if you can talk a little bit or just update us a little bit on your port expansion in Asia just in general and when any potential new ports might come online.","And just tied to that, how you would expect that to benefit the China part of your business.","Arnold Donald","Over time, there's no question there's going to have to be additional ports in China and obviously, there are a number of local entities in China working on that if we are focused on China. To handle the volume in China, there's actually going to have to be expansion in ports surrounding China as well, so Taiwan, Korea, Japan.","It will be necessary to expand the capacity of those ports to handle the Chinese guests. So that's all in discussion and under analysis and development and it is definitely going to be required as is expanding the cruise terminals in Shanghai and in Tianjin and points nearby there. Basically those same cities but different locations for the terminals.","So all of that is underway. It's all going to take some time, but with the pace of things, keep in mind we can only build so many ships a year because there's only so many shipyards.","There's demand right now everywhere in the world for cruising, so you are only going to move so many ships from other markets into the China market. So there is a natural pace to this that exists because again of the artifacts of the construct with shipyards and demand elsewhere in the world.","So we are working diligently and I'm sure others are too and looking at different ports in China, as well as working with ports in Asia, throughout Asia, where the Chinese would want to sail to.","Dan McKenzie","I guess kind of what I'm wondering is if the ports would represent a capacity constraint to that part of the world because, as you think about outbound travel of China doubling by 2020, just given the macro volatility, that statistic is perhaps something less than that, but I'm guessing cruise ports aren't going to double by 2020. I'm just wondering if you can just\u2026","Arnold Donald","They probably won't. You are absolutely right. There is a bit of a constraint. But the other thing to think about is fly cruise for the Chinese, which helps demand in all the rest of the world markets.","So the bulk of those 100 million tourists today are flying out to somewhere and so fly cruise for the Chinese to Europe, to North America, to Alaska, to the Caribbean, they become a huge source market for existing itineraries and that will be part of the opportunity as well.","Dan McKenzie","I see. Thanks for the color.","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Assia Georgieva with Affinity Research. Please proceed with your question.","Assia Georgieva","Good morning and congratulations on the great results. I had a couple of quick questions. Q1 is going to be probably a little bit stronger then Q2 and that's probably because you have much more of an exposure to the Caribbean in Q2, Europe may be somewhat weaker. We probably are still close to the Paris events and is it fair to assume that it's not going to be a bell curve sequentially Q1 through the rest of the year and that Q2 might be a slight downward blip?","David Bernstein","The reason that Q1 was better has a lot to do with the comparison to the prior year. It's got more favorable comparisons because the second, third and fourth quarter of last year were up more than the first quarter. So it's a little bit on the prior-year comparison. But your point is well taken.","We talked about the Caribbean doing very well, talked about it being booked well-ahead. It's at nicely higher prices and as a result of that, the first quarter we do expect to be a little bit better than the remainder of the year in terms of the net revenue yield.","Assia Georgieva","Thank you, David. And the second question is more of a philosophical question, if you will. It seems that a lot of the newbuilds that are going to be headed to China in 2016 and 2017 and that's on an industry-wide basis are going to spend if they can the European summer season in Europe.","Is that because you are trying to take advantage of that strong season despite the very good yields that you are getting in China?","Arnold Donald","We can't speak for others. We can only speak for ourselves and for us, our first newbuild going into China will be the Majestic Princess in 2017 with our Princess Cruise Lines. And our focus is to get her into China, she's purpose-built for China.","David Bernstein","She does do a little bit in Med.","Arnold Donald","And she does a little bit of Med, but the ships are built in Europe and have to be trans located over to their destination market. So in our case, she will do some inaugural stuff in Europe simply as a way to make her way over to China.","Assia Georgieva","Okay. Take care and again congratulations.","Arnold Donald","Okay. Thank you.","Thank you very much. David\u2026","David Bernstein","Operator, I guess we'll take one more question at this point.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Brian Egger with Bloomberg. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Egger","Good morning. I just wanted to parse the language a little bit on your 2016 yield outlook. So in September, you had said that first-half cumulative bookings were well-ahead on lower constant dollar prices and now I think are saying first three quarters, they are well-ahead on slightly higher constant currency prices.","So I just wanted to know if that generalization would be the same if you had revised that in constant dollar terms \u2013 just make there's no change in significance there.","David Bernstein","Yes, the most important thing, if I go back, we were behind in constant currency and as we said, for the last three quarters, prices were up and now we are ahead. And so it's been a good booking quarter for us, good volumes, higher prices, as Arnold indicated, an improving pricing trend and that's why we are forecasting the yield improvement. It was something we had expected would occur and it has occurred over the last 13 weeks.","Arnold Donald","But the difference isn't in the terminology -- or in the metric of constant dollar versus constant currency. The difference is actually in the bookings.","Brian Egger","Okay. Thank you.","Arnold Donald","Hey, look, everyone, I want to thank you all for being on the call. Thank you for helping us celebrate what was really a great year. Happy holidays to everyone and I'll be a little unprofessional and say happy birthday to our Chief Financial Officer here. It's David Bernstein's birthday today, so David, happy birthday. Hey, everyone, thank you very much and happy holidays."],"4226":["Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Q2 2013 Earnings Call June 25, 2013 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Howard S.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, June 25, 2013.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Frank, Vice Chairman and COO. Please go ahead, sir.","Howard S. Frank","Thank you, Andre. Good morning, everyone. With me this morning is Micky Arison, our Chairman and CEO, at least he'll be the CEO until sometime this early July; along with Arnold Donald, who is also here this morning on the call. And Arnold, of course, as you know from the announcement, will be our CEO beginning sometime in early July. David Bernstein and Beth Roberts are also with me as well.","And let's start this morning off with some comments by Micky in terms of the changes that have been made. Micky?","Micky M. Arison","Thank you, Howard. Most of you will have seen the organizational announcement that we released this morning. I just want to make a few brief comments to reinforce what was said in the statement. I have decided, and the board has agreed, that this is a good time to split the roles of Chairman and CEO for Carnival Corp. I'm not going anywhere. I will remain Chairman, and my plan is to continue in that role for the foreseeable future. You can be assured that I will continue to do everything I can to add value to all our shareholders and in fact, to all our stakeholders.","I am very committed to the continued success of the company and all of its brands. I will work closely with the board and our management team to guide the next phase of our growth, and I'm excited about the future. I will continue to dedicate my experience and my energy to it.","I've been discussing this with the board for some time now, and we have had a robust transition plan in place, with a deep bench of excellent internal executives in our brands and corporate functions, plus a very strong group of individuals on our board. So we were well positioned to make this decision.","We announced today that our board member, Arnold Donald, will become CEO starting next month. I believe Arnold is the best person for this job. He has been an asset to the -- he will be an asset to the future of this organization, and I'm very pleased that he's agreed to take on this role and will drive the company to the next level.","","Howard, our Vice Chairman and COO, will continue in that role. He will continue to bring his many years of experience to the operation of the company, and he and I will work closely with Arnold to generate the growth and performance that everyone expects from our company.","As stated in our release, Arnold's experience, qualifications make him well suited for the CEO role. He has a unique combination of board-level knowledge of our company and personal experience building and leading successful businesses. I know he will be successful in his new role as CEO. Many of you will have a chance to meet him in the coming weeks and months.","And I'd like to invite Arnold to make a few statements.","Arnold W. Donald","Thank you, Micky, and good morning, everyone. As you all know, Micky is a great leader, and in collaboration with Howard, you've witnessed him build with his team the largest and most successful leisure travel business in the world. And I'm personally honored and I'm very enthused to have the opportunity to join and operationally lead the team here at Carnival in our next stage of growth.","My experiences in operating businesses and as a board member certainly gives me the appreciation that it will be very necessary for me to spend some time getting into much greater depth on the company's operations, finance, marketing and strategy, but I am optimistic for an accelerated onboarding process and being able to make a contribution as CEO relatively quickly, thanks to having the advantage of some level of understanding of the company from my governance role in many years of close observation.","I know a lot of the key people in this organization well, having seen them present at board meetings and other reviews for board members and having spent time with them personally concerning their roles and their points of view. Those experiences give me strong confidence that Carnival Corporation & plc has a great team, excellent fundamentals as a business, a very bright future, and we are well equipped to address over time any challenges facing our industry.","I'm looking forward to helping -- to more profitably, consistently deliver on our promise of an exceptional, joyful vacation experience at a great value as perceived by our 10 million plus passengers yearly, reinforcing our company's strength, expanding globally the appeal of our Carnival lines and over time driving our return of invested capital at higher levels. I'm very much looking forward to meeting with our investors, our policymakers, our business partners around the world in the next several months, and I want to assure you that I expect to be accountable, that I believe as the current management team does, in transparency and responsiveness when it comes to important relationships our company has. And I'm very much again looking forward for the chance to meet with you over time.","I'm fully committed to creating value for our investors and all the stakeholders that Carnival serves, and I'm very eager to start in the next few days. Thank you.","Howard S. Frank","Thank you, Arnold. This is Howard, again. Let me -- let's go back to the usual format, and David will take you through the color for the second quarter. David?","David Bernstein","Thank you, Howard. Before I begin, please note that as some of our remarks on this conference call will be forward looking, I will refer you to the cautionary statements in today's press release. Also, all of my references to revenue and cost metrics will be in local currencies unless otherwise noted as this is a much more useful measure of business trends.","Our non-GAAP EPS for the second quarter was $0.09 per share. The second quarter came in $0.03 above the midpoint of our May guidance, driven primarily by the timing of SG&A expenses between second quarter and the remainder of the year.","Now let's look at our second quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 1%. The Europe, Australia and Asia brands, known as our EAA brands, were up 4.6%, driven by increases in AIDA and Costa, while our North American brands were down 1% as a result of more dry-dock days in the second quarter compared to the prior year.","Our total net revenue yields in the second quarter declined almost 2%. Now let's look at the 2 components of net revenue yields. Our net ticket yields declined 2.7%. Our EAA brands were down 3.8%, driven by declines in Northern European brands, partially offset by increases at Costa and P&O Cruises Australia. The North American brands were down 1.8%, driven primarily by promotional discounting at Carnival Cruise Lines.","Net onboard and other yields increased 0.5%. The small increase in net onboard and other yields that we saw in the first quarter continued in the second quarter. On the cost side, net cruise cost per available lower berth day, excluding fuel, were up almost 9% versus the prior year. This increase was slightly less than we expected in our May guidance. The 9% increase from last year was driven by Carnival Triumph's repair costs, non-recurrence of last year's one-time litigation and other settlements, incremental insurance costs and more dry-dock days compared to the prior year.","As a result of our ongoing efforts to reduce fuel usage, our consumption for available lower berth day declined almost 6% this quarter, which is much more than we had anticipated earlier in the year and saved us $0.05 per share versus the prior year. Fuel savings this quarter -- fuel prices this quarter were down almost 10% versus the prior year, which saved us an additional $0.08 per share.","In summary, the second quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.11 lower than 2012 earnings of $0.20 per share, driven by higher net cruise costs without fuel, lower net revenue yields, which were partially offset by lower fuel expenses.","During the second quarter, we took the opportunity to increase our fuel derivative coverage. We now have 0 cost collars to protect our P&L against fuel price spikes for about 40% of our consumption for the remainder of 2013 through 2016, and 25% for 2017. In addition, during the second quarter, we also took the opportunity to narrow the foreign sealing bands on a few of our outstanding collars. In our earnings press release, you can see the complete list of our current derivative position for each year.","Now turning to our 2013 outlook. I will skip the net revenue yields as Howard will discuss that shortly. For the full year, net cruise costs, excluding fuel, for ALBD are forecasted to be up 3.5% to 4.5% versus the prior year. This is the same as our interim May guidance, about 1 percentage point higher than our March guidance, driven by increased selling and administrative expenses as certain of our brands expect to increase their marketing spend in the back half of 2013.","On a final note, for 2013, at the midpoint of our guidance range, we expect our cash from operations to be $2.7 billion, and our net capital investment is forecasted to be $2.1 billion. At $0.25 per share, our regular quarterly dividend represents $775 million of cash being returned to shareholders on an annual basis. Therefore, we expect that cash from operations will cover substantially all of our CapEx and our regular quarterly dividend.","At this point, I will turn the call back over to Howard.","Howard S. Frank","Thank you, David. I will comment separately on the call about the progress we made at Carnival Cruise Lines and Costa Cruises, but first let me bring you up to date on the last 11 weeks of bookings since the end of March.","For this discussion, I've taken Carnival Cruise Lines' bookings information out of the mix, which I'll also comment on separately. All of the pricing information I will be discussing is using constant currencies.","Fleet-wide bookings during the last 11 weeks, from the end of March covering the next 3 quarters, are running higher year-over-year at higher prices, and as I said, this excludes Carnival. The North American brands' bookings and pricing during this 11-week period are higher. And for EAA brands, bookings and pricing are also higher versus the prior year. We see the EAA booking pattern as a particularly encouraging sign, especially given the continued softness in European economies.","Our Carnival Cruise Lines' bookings and pricing over the last 11 weeks are both lower year-over-year in a high-single-digits, low-double-digits range, respectively. During the last 6 weeks, there has been a gradual improvement in Carnival's booking volumes and pricing, and we are hopeful that this trend will continue. With the successful reintroduction of the Carnival Triumph in Galveston 2 weeks ago, we believe this will serve as a bottoming inflection point, and we are expecting Carnival's Cruise Lines pricing to gradually improve over time.","Regular booking is down by major trades as in -- for North America brands, Caribbean itinerary booking volumes for the last 11 weeks covering the next 3 quarters, and this excludes Carnival, are slightly lower year-over-year at slightly higher prices. Alaska bookings, again excluding Carnival, are significantly higher at lower prices. And European itinerary bookings for North America brands, and this, of course, excludes Carnival as well, are slightly lower at nicely higher prices.","By major trades for EAA brands, European itinerary booking volumes, and that's approximately 60% of EAA capacity, are significantly higher at higher prices, a very encouraging sign. Caribbean itinerary volumes for EAA brands, which are just under 10% of EAA capacity, are running behind last year but also at nicely higher prices.","Now let me comment on the cumulative booking status for each of the third, fourth quarters of 2013 and Q1 of 2014. For the third quarter, on a fleet-wide basis at the present time, occupancies are slightly behind last year at slightly lower prices. North American brand occupancies, and this excludes Carnival, are slightly behind at flattish pricing. Alaska pricing is behind last year, and North American brand -- European itinerary pricing is higher versus last year. Carnival Cruise Lines' pricing is lower on all of its major itineraries versus last year.","EAA brand occupancies for the third quarter, which are largely in Europe trades, are slightly behind last year at lower pricing. Occupancies for our Asian and Australian businesses are nicely higher year-over-year, with slightly higher pricing. The performance of Costa in China is particularly encouraging given the doubling of its capacity in Asia during the quarter.","As we said in the press release for the third quarter, we are forecasting revenue yields to be lower by 3.5% to 4.5%. If we take Carnival out of that mix, revenue yields will be lower in the 1.5% to 2.5% range. For the fourth quarter on a fleet-wide basis, excluding Carnival, cumulative occupancies are slightly lower at slightly lower pricing for North American brands. Excluding Carnival again, occupancies are lower at higher prices. Carnival Cruise Lines' occupancies for the fourth quarter are also lower at higher prices -- slightly higher prices.","For EAA brands, occupancies are flattish year-over-year at lower prices. Costa brand occupancies for the fourth quarter are nicely higher at lower prices. This is the first time during the last several quarters that Costa has been ahead of the closer end booking curve this early in the booking process. We read this as a very positive sign and are expecting Costa to have a nice increase in revenue yields in the fourth quarter.","For the first quarter of 2014, data is very preliminary but the picture shows that on a fleet-wide basis, and this includes Carnival, occupancies are lower year-over-year at higher prices. North American brands occupancies, again including Carnival, are lower year-over-year at nicely higher prices. EAA brands occupancies are also lower at slightly higher prices, but this information is early, and I wouldn't read too much into it.","Now let me just make some separate comments about the Carnival Cruise Lines brand, if you will. The impact of the ship incidents earlier this year on the Carnival brand has resulted in Carnival having to make a significant reduction in its profit forecast for the remainder of this year. Carnival-forecasted year-over-year profit decline is estimated to have a $0.50 per share effect on the company's year-over-year results. Of this, approximately $0.27 is primarily due to lower revenue yields, $0.16 results from lost sailings and repair costs relating to the Carnival Triumph refurbishment, increase costs for Carnival's vessel enhancement programs, and a higher planned marketing spend in the second half of the year for Carnival Cruise Lines amounted to $0.07 a share. And that builds to the $0.50 decline in year-over-year results.","As I said earlier, we do believe a successful reintroduction of the Carnival Triumph early this month, together with the ship enhancements, will be made -- will be the catalyst for the Carnival turnaround. I should add that the Carnival brand is very resilient, with a very large number of past guests that understand the great fun experience and value of a Carnival vacation. Almost 4.5 million guests sail with Carnival every year and have a great vacation. We are confident that as time passes, this brand will come back stronger than ever.","Having said that, our advisers are saying that the recovery will be gradual, and it will take 2 to 3 years for the Carnival brand to fully recover. But the good news is that it appears that the recovery has started. Based on recent surveys, consumer perception of the brand has significantly improved since the incidents back in March, and we expect this trend to continue once confidence builds back in the brand. We will need to cycle through a full year before we begin to see positive pricing comparisons, which should begin in the second half of 2014.","I also want to take this moment to thank the travel agent community for their support of Carnival Cruise Lines during this period. Travel agents know that Carnival provides great fun-packed vacations to a wide spectrum of consumers, families, adults, adult couples, singles and retirees and at very affordable prices. Many of our travel agent partners have been very supportive of Carnival during this challenging period, and for that, we are very grateful.","On the other side of the Atlantic, Costa Cruises' market recovery continues. The company is forecasting a return to profitability this year from a loss in 2012. Michael Thamm has made a number of changes to the management team, and we are starting to see the results of those efforts. The perception of the brand in the Italian market, which is its largest market, has significantly improved from last year and continues to trend in a positive direction. Recent year-over-year booking volumes and pricing have been strong, and it appears that the cost to recovery is well underway. Of course, a major challenge in Europe right now is the weakened economies, especially in Italy and Spain, but we still expect to grow year-over-year revenue yields for Costa in 2013. Second quarter revenue yields for Costa were higher year-over-year as David mentioned, and we expect Costa revenue yields for the third and fourth quarters to also be higher.","From an overall perspective, while the year 2013 is disappointing for our company, we believe the worst is over, and a gradual recovery to our business is starting to build. In North America, our premium and luxury brands will have a solid performance in 2013. However, it is clear that more needs to be done to strengthen consumer demand for taking cruise vacations. So beginning in the second half of the year, we are planning to increase marketing spend across all North American brands and expect this to continue into 2014.","Let me bring you up to date on several recent management changes at the company. Roger Frizzell joined us just yesterday as a Senior VP of Corporate Communications. Roger will be very helpful to us in working in our media relations, as well as developing a corporate communications plan. Roger joins Carnival after a very successful track record at several major companies, including Pacific Gas and Electric, American Airlines, Hewlett-Packard and AT&T.","Captain David Christie has also joined the corporate management team as a Senior Vice President, Maritime Quality Assurance. David was instrumental in establishing our CSMART simulated training facility in Almere in the Netherlands and is leading the effort on behalf of the corporation to build our new global training facility, which will also be located in the Netherlands. This new training facility will include 5 bridge and 4 engine room simulators, as well as additional training and classroom facilities for our ship and shore-side staff. We believe this new Carnival education and training center of excellence will be the largest and most comprehensive maritime facility in the world.","Captain Mike Kaczmarek has moved over full time as Vice President of our Corporate R&D Technology group. This group has been responsible for developing the new scrubber technology, which is now successfully operated under a pilot program on one of our ships. We are planning to install the scrubbers on 2 more ships later this year, and we expect to begin a full rollout of scrubbers installations on our ships in 2014. We have a number of other R&D projects underway primarily focused on fuel savings technology, including the piloting of a bubble system on one of our ships later this year to improve the ship's hydrodynamics. And later in 2014, we are pilot testing using LNG on one of our ships. We have made significant R&D investments over the last several years and the results have been gratifying, with fuel savings in 2013 forecasted to be at 5%.","We have also begun to search for a Corporate Executive Vice President to oversee the various maritime departments in the corporate organization, and this includes our corporate maritime policy, our maritime quality assurance, and -- which includes CSMART and our maritime auditing group. This executive will also have a see-through line of sight to the senior maritime executives in each of the operating companies. These corporate management changes are part of our plan to move towards a more consistent maritime and technical policies and practices throughout the worldwide fleet.","We have also made a number of changes to our management teams at Costa and Carnival U.K., and we are confident that under Michael Thamm and David Dingle's leadership, our European businesses will continue to improve in 2014. At Carnival Cruise Lines, the marine and technical management teams has recently been augmented with the additions of Richard O'Hanlon, a former U.S. Navy Admiral, as Vice President of Nautical and Safety Operations; and Mark Jackson, a former Coast Guard Captain, as Vice President of Technical Operations.","Turning to our newbuild program, our current schedule includes 7 new ships to be added to the fleet between now and 2016. Two of the ships are for the AIDA brand, the strongest-performing brand in the fleet. And the remaining 5 ships on order are spread across 5 of our other major brands. We believe these new ships, which have a capacity of 50% to 70% higher than the existing ships in their respective fleets, are far more fuel efficient and will help to improve our return on invested capital for the company. We plan to add ships to our fleet only where we believe we can generate higher overall ROI for the brand. In other words, ships that will improve the brand's operating margins without negatively affecting the margins on the existing ships in the brand. At the same time, we continue to seek buyers for certain of our older and smaller ships, and those efforts are ongoing.","So with those comments, Micky, Arnold and the rest of the team is here to answer any questions you might have. Andre, can I turn it over to you now?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Micky, I'm just wondering, as you transition to your Chairman-only role, are you immediately relinquishing all the day-to-day roles, including those related to operations, shipbuilding? Just wondering how involved you're going to be. You were deliberate in saying in your prepared remarks that you weren't going anywhere, so I'm just wondering how you view your role going forward.","Micky M. Arison","Well, primarily, I do my role as doing whatever Arnold needs me to do. I'm -- my basic philosophy has been with all our CEOs, that I'm there to help them be successful. And anything that I can do to make -- to help Arnold become hugely successful and the company hugely successful, I'm prepared to do. So I obviously will continue to work on areas that I have extensive knowledge, in newbuildings and other areas, but it's really going to be a collaborative thing between me and Arnold to decide what are the best uses of my time. I'm going to be looking to Arnold to run the day-to-day corporate operation, and I may even take a couple of golf lessons.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Sounds nice. And, Arnold -- I'm kind of jealous. Arnold, congratulations to you as well. And also, since you aren't new to the company and now in the CEO role, what do you think are going to be your immediate agenda items?","Arnold W. Donald","Thank you. Immediately, we're T minus 8 days or 9 days or whatever it is before I come in, but the immediate thing is to spend in-depth time with the leadership team. And we have some tentative plans as a team, Micky, I and Howard together, and we'll refine those through conversations with the rest of the leadership team. But immediately, it's to spend time with them and then ultimately, of course, to contribute to a very strong team that's already proven in the industry, has built the world's largest leisure travel business and is continuing to operate successfully and to join that team and help drive over time the return on invested capital and additional customer satisfaction.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Howard, have I burned through my questions, or can I ask one more?","Howard S. Frank","You could have because you're so nice. We're going to have -- let you have one more question.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Thank you. And Howard, this one's for you.","Howard S. Frank","Oh, no!","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","On the Carnival brand, you gave us some great color as usual. I appreciate that. But just wondering, what areas do you think you have the most work to do? Is it with the travel agents? Is it with the consumers? Is it both? And just wondering if you could walk us through some specific examples of efforts you've been making there and maybe highlight some of the near-term wins that you may have had, if any?","Howard S. Frank","I think the Carnival team, the marketing team and the sales team, have been increasing their engagement with the travel agent community, and that will continue. There are more things to roll out. I think the reintroduction of the Triumph was sort of the tipping point, I think, for beginning that process. And they're very encouraged by the early responses they've been getting. And we've been seeing it actually in the booking pattern itself. The successful reintroduction of the ship in Galveston was a very positive event for the company. We've also put on a lot of communications on all the investments we've been making with the ships to get people to rebuild trust in the brand. And especially, that's important with the consumer and the first-time cruiser. That's going to take -- and that's going to go on for quite some time. So there's a multitude of efforts being made by Jerry and his team to move this forward, and you'll see a lot more unfold, I think, over the next 6 months.","Micky M. Arison","If I can just add that when you're carrying 4.5 million passengers, most of them coming from the United States, meaning that upwards of 1 in 3 passengers that go on a cruise in the United States go on a Carnival Cruise, and 99% of them are coming back happy and telling their friends and getting on Facebook and Twitter and then telling people what a great time they've had. That is powerful, 90,000 folks every single week coming off those ships in the U.S. and talking about the great experience and right now, the great value they got as well. So I think that will help accelerate the comeback of the brand.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My questions are -- first, just in terms of your 2- to 3-year estimate for recovery of the Carnival brand, what assumptions are behind that, of the people that you spoke with? I don't think there's any past industry events, but did you look outside the industry, for example? Or what helped you determine that?","Howard S. Frank","Yes. I mean, there were -- our consultants have basically used an analogy of 2 other non- -- Greg, non-industry events, and we're tracking the same way. In terms of consumer perception, we're tracking the same way, which was a significant fall off in brand perception and then a gradual recovery until it's 3 years out. So their view is that while we're a very different industry, it's likely that we will follow the same pattern, and that of course assumes that we get it right and we get the marketing out there right, and we get our media communications out there properly, and we continue to stay in touch with our consumers and our travel agents. So their feeling is that we should track","-- and by the way, I would say up until this point, it has tracked. In some cases, a little bit better than one of the issues that -- one of the companies that had a mishap. So I think we're doing okay. It's not an exact science. It's just their best guess as to how long it will take for us to get back on -- get the brand back to where it was.","Micky M. Arison","Again, that is coming from consultants who have gone through similar types of situations. But I do think the strength of the brand, the amount of market share it has in the United States and the amount of people coming back, will excel. But safety was never an issue, and I think it's important for people to understand that. And a lot of the examples that our consultants give us do have significant casualty issues associated with the brand damage. So I'm very hopeful that the recovery could be much faster than the consultants are leading us to believe.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And that makes all sense, by the way. And, Howard, just with respect to the recovery you mentioned over the last 6 weeks, I don't know, you speak a little bit faster sometimes than I can follow, so when you were talking about the last -- what other color did you give around that? Are bookings flat year-over-year at this point? And when -- if not, when would you expect those to be for the Carnival brand?","Howard S. Frank","Well, based on a very recent couple of weeks, bookings have been up nicely for the Carnival brand. That's the most recent. And that's since the reintroduction of the Carnival Triumph. Bookings have been positive across the brand. And for the Triumph and the Magic, the 2 ships that are in Galveston, bookings have been substantially higher year-over-year. So that's kind of giving us the feeling that -- and by the way, it is the beginning, so I don't want to set up expectations here that we can't achieve. But certainly, we're very encouraged by what we see.","Micky M. Arison","Right. I also should mention that the refit of the Carnival Sunshine, all the bunch of 2.0 additions, have been incorporated into the Carnival Sunshine. And...","Howard S. Frank","We've been trying to [indiscernible]...","Micky M. Arison","Some were added to the Triumph, a few were added to the Triumph, but all of them were put into the Carnival Sunshine. And the response from the guests of all these various new features have been just absolutely fantastic. So I think Jerry and his team, as far as upgrading the product and making Fun Ship 2.0 a really viable addition to the Carnival brand, particularly on Carnival Sunshine, has been hugely successful.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura Securities.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Can you give us a sense of the repair costs that you've isolated in 2013 at $0.16 a share? How much of those are likely to bleed into 2014?","David Bernstein","The repair costs should be -- for the Carnival Triumph should be completely done. There's a little bit in the third quarter, but that will be it.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And what about retrofit? Will that continue into 2014?","David Bernstein","Are you talking about the vessel enhancements?","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Correct.","David Bernstein","We had -- yes, we had talked about the vessel enhancements being a multiple year process. So there will be some of that in 2014 as well.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Can you quantify that for me?","David Bernstein","Not at this point. It was probably around $0.06, $0.07 a share in 2013, but we're looking -- we're working through those issues as we put together the detailed schedule for 2014. And I'll probably give you more color on that later in the year.","Howard S. Frank","Yes, we're typically waiting to do that. We'll have really much better information later on in the year as we go through the individual business plans for the operating companies and see what their plan is for 2000 -- for the 2014 rollout of these investments.","David Bernstein","Keep in mind though, that the overwhelming majority of the $600 million to $700 million that was in the press release is CapEx. There's only some small pieces that will be in the P&L.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And then a similar question as far as marketing, you isolated that at $0.07 a share this year. Do you think that, that incremental cost stays about the same next year? Or does it go higher? Or might it come down a bit?","Howard S. Frank","Harry, again, let's just wait until the end of the year when we go through the business plans and we'll -- because the -- I think each of the brands, and it's also true in Europe as well, are also looking at changes in their marketing approach. So we'll have a better sense of the overall increase in marketing for 2014, but that won't happen until sometime later in the fall.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then greetings, Arnold. Just -- you've been on the board for 12 years, you've got a pretty good idea of how Carnival runs. Do you see any pretty clear opportunities to improve the company's return on invested capital? Is there any low-hanging fruit that you think you might want to focus on?","Arnold W. Donald","Well, as you know, there's a difference between being on the board and being in operations. So I've had close observations. I think the team in place has been a continuous improvement in terms of cost management, as well as revenue generation. So I feel strongly that we'll discover some opportunities, additional opportunities along the way. But I feel the team is performing very well right now.","Howard S. Frank","Harry, just let me -- let me just jump in here for a second. I think the view is that to drive increased -- we can at the margin improve ROIs in a variety of different ways, including some of the things that we -- in terms of the newbuilds that we have that are better -- much better, more efficient ships and so on, much -- drive much higher returns. But clearly, revenue improvement is part of our plan to drive our -- we need to do that. I think we'll see some of that naturally occur as the Costa brand improves and as the Carnival brand improves. We'll start to see some benefit from that. And I think one of the thoughts that are going around in the various companies is the increase in the marketing spend I think that we're talking about is also there, is also being planned, I think, to drive better revenues on the net line. So I think those are the kinds of strategies that we're talking about right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ian Rennardson with Jefferies.","Ian Rennardson - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I've got 2 lines of questioning for you, please, number one is regarding the new CEO role. Did you search both internally and externally for the new CEO? What is the mandate? And do we really see any material shift in policy and strategy? Do you think we'll be adding more capacity than planned? And then the second revolves around the ECA, the oil price. But 2015 is not that far away, and your 10-K tells us you've got, in a worst case, $265 million of extra cost because of the low sulfur fuel requirement. Are you in a position to talk to us about how you can mitigate that, to what degree you can mitigate that? And if you can mitigate it, what the extra CapEx might be?","Micky M. Arison","Okay, let me first -- on the issue of the Chairman\/CEO role, we've been talking -- I've been talking to the independent directors of the board for quite some time about where we go from here as far as corporate management and structure. We said 10 years ago in our discussions in the U.K. that we were totally committed to the DLC structure, very sensitive to U.K. governance and have moved in that direction over the years. And obviously, a key element of those discussions over the last 10 years has been splitting of the Chairman and CEO role. So I've been sensitive to that for quite some time. we've been talking about it for quite some time, myself and the -- and Stu Subotnick, who is the Lead Independent Director and Chairman of the Nominating Governance Committee, talked extensively with the committee about various candidates. We did not do a full -- we didn't hire consultants to do a full external search. We felt very, very comfortable. I recommended Arnold as a choice and Stu, and the committee immediately supported that, as well as all the independent directors. So we felt we had the right candidate. There was no reason to go beyond that, and we're -- and I'm delighted that -- we didn't know when Stu called Arnold, whether it would be something he would entertain, and we were delighted he did, and that's the way -- that's the direction we went. Clearly, this ties much greater with the U.K. governance model than the U.S., but I think, even in the U.S., it's starting to move in this direction. So that's the way it all happened. As far as ECA?","David Bernstein","Yes. Thank you, Micky. Howard did mention in his notes that we had a scrubber on -- that is successfully operating on one of our ships, and we're going to put scrubbers on 2 more ships later this year and that we then expect to roll out the scrubber installations in 2014. We may not have every single ship equipped with scrubbers by January 1, 2015, but we'll clearly prioritize those ships that have the biggest impact. So in 2015, with the new ECA, we do believe we can mitigate a significant portion of that $265 million. We may not get it all in 2015, but we will get it all shortly thereafter as we do the installation. It's about $1 million to $1.5 million per engine. You got to do at least a couple of engines on each ship. So it is a significant amount of CapEx. But the numbers that we've been giving out for CapEx do include our anticipated scrubber CapEx as well. So those are already in the numbers you've heard Beth give out.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Rollo with Morgan Stanley.","Jamie Rollo - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First question. I think you said for the Carnival brand that as you cycle through next year, the yields wouldn't recover till the second half. So is that sort of an informal guidance for yields of the Carnival brands be down in the first half broadly? And then the second question was on the implied yield guidance for the fourth quarter. It looks like quite a wide range of sort of between 0 and down 4%. And 0 will be a pretty big recovery from Q3's minus 4% guidance figure. I was wondering if you could talk a bit about that please and where the risk lies within that Q4 range?","Howard S. Frank","Jamie, this is Howard. It wasn't really in -- the Carnival cycling through a full year before it starts to see positive pricing was not meant to be guidance. What I meant to say is that we'll begin to see in the second half of 2014 the possibility of yield improvement on the pricing that we're taking on a year-over-year basis. So it'll be because of the easier comparisons. And if you assume improvement in the perception of the brand, and that we should start to see some pricing improvement, how that falls out in 2000 -- in the third and fourth quarters remains to be seen. So I'm not suggesting that's guidance. But we're hopeful that, that will be the beginning of a positive year -- year-over-year improvement in pricing. On the issue of yield guidance, I'm going to turn it over to David.","David Bernstein","Yes, Jamie. This is what happens when you round everything to whole percentages and all. I understand the math that you're working through. The expectation on the fourth quarter is that we'll see a little bit better than the third quarter. We are -- as Howard mentioned, we are seeing continued improvement, particularly in Costa in Europe. And as some -- those brands improve in the fourth quarter, the number will be a little bit better than third quarter. Still down, but a little bit better than third.","Jamie Rollo - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And a kind of follow-up from the previous question on scrubbers, I was under the impression they made engines a bit less fuel-efficient just on a consumption basis, obviously cleaner with sulfur. But would there be any impact on fuel consumption once they're fully rolled out?","David Bernstein","There are some incremental operating expenses relating to the scrubbers, but there really isn't anything significant in the way of fuel consumption changes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lena Thakkar with HSBC.","Lena Thakkar - HSBC, Research Division","A couple of questions. Firstly, I just wonder if you could give a little color around the comments of nicely higher. Just trying to think what that means. Is that a sort of low-single-digit number or sort of mid-single digit? It's just -- I've heard that a few times through the call and just trying to understand what that means. And secondly, if we think about Costa, I understand most of the recovery so far this year has been occupancy-driven. Are we now to assume that the remainder of the Costa recovery is therefore pricing-driven? And I wonder if you could tell us how much of -- or what sort of year-on-year improvements Costa has seen so far and if you expect that sort of a run rate for the rest of the year? Or you expect the revenue, the yield improvements to be sort of lower going forward, given that they are based on pricing rather than occupancy?","Howard S. Frank","So that's the first time I've had a question about nicely higher in a while. So nicely higher is somewhere between slightly higher and significantly higher. I hope that answers your question. It is in the mid- to high-single-digits range when I talk about nicelies. It's usually north of 5%. And that's kind of how I see it. And so it's an -- if you come up with a better term for me, send me a note. On the Costa occupancy and pricing improvement, yes, it's on both sides of the ledger. And with the third -- second quarter pricing was up. I'm not sure if it was driven more by occupancy. Yields were up. I'm not sure if they're driven by occupancy and pricing. But clearly, we're seeing even further improvements -- if the -- assuming our forecasts are correct here, and their forecast -- further improvements in Q3 and Q4 over Q2 on -- and a lot of that is going to be driven by pricing.","David Bernstein","Yes. You know what happens with Costa because each quarter was so dramatically different, you get a mix impact. Remember their pricing was down in first quarter because of the year-over-year comparison and the strong prior year. So in the back half of the year, we are definitely seeing the overall yield increase is much greater than the occupancy increase. We are seeing the pricing there as Howard indicated.","Operator","Our next question comes from Assia Georgieva with Infiniti Research.","Assia Georgieva","I have a couple of questions. Again, discussing the Costa recovery, we are basically 1.5 years since the incident. At the time, you had expected the $500 million swing to profitability, and we seem to be -- to have recovered the vast majority of that. So in 2014, do you think we'll be back to regular profitability? And the second question is related. Can that serve as a model or a potential pattern for the Carnival brand?","Howard S. Frank","Yes. Well, I -- first, I don't think we're -- you're right. The guidance was, I think originally, that we took a $500 million hit to operating. I don't think we've gained anything near that back. We went from a loss to a profit right now. And so we're well on our way back, but we still got plenty of room to recover on Costa. And we're hopeful we'll start to begin to see more of that in 2014. But that will even continue into 2015. So we're greatly encouraged by what we're seeing at Costa right now.","Beth Roberts","Of the $500 million, roughly $100 million of that swing was the loss capacity, which we do not expect to get back until the ship returns. We have the next delivery, which is in 2016?","Howard S. Frank","The end of next year. The end of next year.","Micky M. Arison","Oh, end of next year.","David Bernstein","End of '14 -- '15.","Micky M. Arison","'15, you'll get the effect of it. End of '14 ...","Howard S. Frank","End of '14, the ship gets through.","David Bernstein","And we had indicated Costa's yields for the year were down 16%. We had indicated back in December that we had expected to get about half back this year. But because of the difficult economic environment in Southern Europe, we're expecting to get back 1\/4 of it. And we do expect to see continued improvements as we go along.","Howard S. Frank","With respect to using Costa as an example of what will happen at Carnival, it's really hard to say because each situation was unique and different, and the markets that they trade in are largely -- are different. And Costa is still dealing with the issue of the Concordia still in the water and probably won't get onto the process for parbuckling it. And moving it out will take probably next 6 to 9 months. So they're still dealing with that issue in Italy. But remember, they market into -- and you know this well -- into Italy, Germany, France and Spain. That's their primary markets. Carnival is principally U.S. markets, and it's really -- it's too early in the process to know if the changes are going to be analogous or not in terms of -- or the improvement are going to be the same or not. I think it's just too early to know.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Katz with Morningstar.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","You guys have mentioned marketing spending increase a couple of times already on the call. Can you talk a little bit about how you're allocating those dollars to reach the consumers and where you're getting your most bang for your buck? And then also, if you've seen any pockets of strength or weakness change in consumers globally, would you be able to offer that information?","Howard S. Frank","Jamie, I think -- we're talking about a number of different brands all doing -- making changes. And I'm talking about anticipating -- increasing their spend in the marketing area. A lot of it is going to be focused on travel agents and travel agent co-op marketing, more trade advertising. A lot of it is social media and web-based marketing and is also for the consideration to going back and doing more TV. So it's a variety of these things. Having said that, we haven't seen -- we are going to start the process later on or earlier in the fall to go ahead and look at the marketing programs for each of the brands, and we'll be better able to, I think, articulate exactly what the spend is going to look like and where it's going to be allocated to. I don't know if that helps but it's still early for me to comment specifically. And your second question was -- say that again?","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Were there any kind of pockets of strengths or weakness as far as like geographically with consumers that you saw change over the last quarter or 2? I mean, I know Europe was mentioned as kind of looking a little bit more promising, but has anything like the North American consumer become significantly stronger or weaker? Is that too hard to parse out with the Triumph?","Howard S. Frank","All I can tell you is that patterns both in North America and Europe on a year-over-year basis, pricing and volume seem to be pretty good right now. So it's a pretty positive story. I understand it more North America. I kind of scratch my head a little bit in Europe, to be honest with you, but I'll take it. It is a -- things seem to be -- I think maybe it's consumer confidence strengthening or positive things that are going on. And so we're very encouraged by what we're seeing in Europe right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of things here, relating to Europe in general, if we can characterize using December as the benchmark, you first called out at that time that you had some concerns about Northern Europe. You mentioned that a little bit here in your preamble. Maybe give us some color regarding Northern Europe relative to then. And then it appears that maybe Northern Europe on a year-over-year basis is a little weaker, but Southern Europe, obviously off of an extremely low bar here, is starting to turn to the positive. So a little color on Europe, I guess, number one. And question number two would be related to the redundancies and the retrofits on the ships. It sounds like mid-'14 is when a decent amount of those where you're mitigating a lot of the risk. If you can just give us a little more color and confirmation on that.","David Bernstein","I can start with Europe. When we went through the guidance in December, we had indicated that we expected our Northern European brands to be down. And I think I also indicated just a moment ago, we expected Costa to get back about half the yield it had previously lost. As the months and weeks passed, we did see more weakness throughout Europe than we had anticipated. And as we talked on the previous conference call, we brought down the yield guidance relative to Europe, actually in both Northern Europe and for Costa. As I said before, Costa is only expected to get back a quarter of what it previously lost. Now with that said, our -- even though our Northern European brands, the yields are going down, the yields in P&O Cruises and AIDA are still some of the highest in our fleet. They're doing -- they're performing incredibly well, and the return on investment to those brands is again above average for our fleet. So it's a directional change in reduction, but it's still -- their absolute performance is very good.","Micky M. Arison","As far as mitigating risk, I would say we've done a number of things to mitigate risk immediately so that the risk level is clearly mitigated. Again, I have to reiterate that it's not a safety issue and that the items that we talked about in our press release, the CapEx, we're rolling out as much as we can in operations. Some of it will require dry docking and because of that, there may be a 2- or 3-year rollout of some items. But many are being programmed and taken care of while the ships are being in operation. So it's a variety of things. But believe me, every day, the risk is being mitigated more and more.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Would you say, Micky, that it's fair that -- the risk of another incident I know can never be 0, but -- a repeat type of incident by mid-'14, is that a fair timetable when a lot of that will be taken away?","Micky M. Arison","There's nothing you can be assured of except death and taxes, but we're doing everything we can to mitigate the risk as quickly as we can.","Howard S. Frank","By the way, I would just say this, Tim, that, that risk exists not just -- you're talking about relative risk. These are essentially enhancements. We got to keep in mind, and we've said it a number of times, that Carnival Triumph's situation didn't result in anybody being even injured. So I mean, the systems worked, and that's important to remember. All we're doing now is we're enhancing -- further enhancing the systems and further -- making -- to make sure that our customers are comfortable and that we deal with the issues more quickly and more effectively so that we can get the ship back up and running should something happen. But by and large, this is just enhancements. And the rollout of this will be largely -- what you have to do is you have to manufacture a lot of this equipment before you can even install it. And then many of the -- Micky said many of the installations will be -- have to be in dry docks. Some of the installations can be done on the run. Many of the items have already been ordered, and we're waiting for delivery of it and then the installation of it. But the rollout of this will be this year, second half of this year, '14 and '15 where most of the work will be done.","David Bernstein","And while we're rolling out the work, the more permanent work, we are putting power packs on the ships very quickly, and that will mitigate some of the risk that we talked about in terms of comfort in the unlikely event anything happens.","Beth Roberts","I just wanted to add-on to the capacity -- to the comment about Europe, Northern Europe versus the Med. I think it's fair to acknowledge that the Northern European products did have a significant capacity increase this year relative to the Med, and we do not expect that to recur in 2014.","Micky M. Arison","Yes. Going back to the risk issue, I do want to reiterate what the former head of the NTSB said, the due risk of driving to the port is a lot higher than anything you do once you get on the cruise. It's probably true. The risk of getting in your shower is a lot higher, too.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just your guidance excluding the Carnival brand that you talked about booking volume and pricing up for the next 3 quarters. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of if you excluded the Costa brand as well from that, whether the rest of the fleet would be up in volume price just since Costa is obviously being helped by the year-over-year comparisons. Is the rest of the fleet up in price and volume, excluding Costa as well as Carnival?","Howard S. Frank","We have the information someplace, but I don't have it right at hand.","David Bernstein","Yes. Why don't you give Beth a call after? We don't have the information cut in that many different ways right here at the table.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Okay, sure. And then my other question is you talked about the reintroduction of the Triumph as kind of marking the bottoming of the Carnival brand, and I certainly understand symbolically how that would. But I wonder if you could sort of translate that into more specifically -- you mentioned volumes have been up since then, but can you talk about whether that's with prices having to be down or just sort of quantifying something a little more specific to bookings to see that, that was the bottom more than just kind of the symbolic reintroduction?","Micky M. Arison","Clearly, prices have been sharp at Carnival Cruise Lines, but they -- to what -- the context of Howard's point, they haven't been sharper since the Triumph has been reintroduced. We haven't done anything to reduce price since the Triumph has been reintroduced. And I think what was important was that it was reintroduced looking fantastic with a lot of media board, a lot of hoopla in the area. And I think that created the positive spin in an area that was most impacted, which is the greater Texas, Houston area. And I think the coverage was terrific. The -- George Lopez did a great job, Guy Fieri did a great job, DJ Irie did and the whole Carnival team there, introducing some of the new Fun Ship 2.0 features and so on. And the ship looked great. So that clearly had to help.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nick Thomas with Merrill Lynch.","Nicholas Thomas - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wondered whether you could first of all just provide a little bit more color within your full year yield guidance in relation to -- just trying to sort of split that out between the North American brands and the EAA brands. And also an idea on your expectations for the Carnival brand within that? And then secondly, I think a few questions ago and apology if I missed some of the color that was given around this, but a few questions ago, you indicated a degree of encouragement around what you're seeing in Europe fairly recently. Most of the data points that you gave in terms of the next couple of quarters were still sort of occupancy and pricing being down. I wondered whether you could provide a little bit more color around what it is you've been seeing more recently in Europe that leaves you more encouraged.","Howard S. Frank","On the North American, Europe pricing for the year...","David Bernstein","The full year is down 2 to 3 in total. North America in total is slightly more than the average, and Europe is slightly less than that. So they're averaging out into the middle part of that range. And Carnival Cruise Lines is down in the mid-single digits for the full year overall. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color. And Carnival is what's driving the North American brands obviously to be down for the year.","Howard S. Frank","My recollection is that the premium and luxury brands in North America have a flat yield, flattish yields year-over-year x Carnival.","Nicholas Thomas - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So north -- within North America in total, that would be slightly worse than the down 2% to 3%? The Carnival brand which is broadly half of North America to be down mid-single digit, so therefore means the rest of the North American brands would still need to be sort of down broadly in line with the overall group guidance? Is that [indiscernible]?","David Bernstein","Flattish.","Howard S. Frank","Flattish. Flat. Flat.","David Bernstein","To get to the high end of the range.","Nicholas Thomas - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So presumably...","Howard S. Frank","Let's -- what I suggest you do is you double back with Beth on this stuff, and she can take you through it.","Nicholas Thomas - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Flattish for the rest of the North American brand is what you're saying?","Howard S. Frank","Correct. Correct. Yes. On Europe, essentially, what we've seen in the last 11 weeks is an uptick in European bookings and pricing across all -- I believe substantially across all brands. I can't remember every brand there, but it's always been a very positive development in Europe. That's about all I can tell you.","Nicholas Thomas - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Presumably, that's been skewed given the statement you made, what, sort of 5-ish weeks ago when you had the intra-quarter update. When at that stage, Europe was a little worse than it had been. Presumably, the comments you were making was your improvement over an 11-week timeframe. That actually quite skewed towards the latter 5 weeks post that more recent update. Is that fair to conclude?","Howard S. Frank","No. I think that's a little bit of apples to oranges comparison. What I was saying 5 or 6 weeks ago, or I think what we were saying, is Europe is softer than our expectations and our guidance, our earlier guidance. This is more year-over-year bookings. And so that has shown improvement over the 11-week period, including that earlier period that we were talking about. However, it was short of where we thought it would be. So it wasn't as strong. We thought it would be stronger, but it wasn't as strong as it was based on our earlier guidance. So they're a little bit of different comparisons.","Nicholas Thomas - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. But compared with sort of 5 weeks ago, nothing particularly material has changed versus your expectations 5 weeks ago. It's the year-on-year numbers that you've seen improving.","Howard S. Frank","I think the 6 -- I can't recall exactly. We have 6 weeks data, and we have 11 weeks data. And the 6-week data didn't differ materially from the 11-week data.","Micky M. Arison","Really haven't changed our expectations.","David Bernstein","Yes, we haven't changed...","Micky M. Arison","We haven't changed our expectations.","Howard S. Frank","Right. So it's still [indiscernible]. Exactly. In fact.","Micky M. Arison","[indiscernible] a little color of recent bookings [indiscernible] haven't changed our expectation.","Operator","We presently have no further questions at this time.","Howard S. Frank","Okay. Well, thank you very much. I know there'll be follow-on questions, and Beth is around, and we appreciate it. And we look forward to -- Arnold and Micky and I, Dave and Beth look forward to seeing everybody soon. So...","Arnold W. Donald","Thank you very much.","David Bernstein","Thank you.","Micky M. Arison","Thank you.","Howard S. Frank","Bye bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference for today.

[Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, June 20, 2019.","I'd now like to turn it over to Mr. Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation. Please go ahead.","Arnold Donald","Thank you, Keith. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. As Keith said, I'm Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation & PLC, and today I am joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison as well as David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Roberts, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","I want to thank you all for joining us this morning. Now before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking. Therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release.","Now given the vessel disruption that unfolded this week with Carnival Vista, we decided to move the call to today because we wanted to provide the information that the impact was limited to $0.08 to $0.10, and we wanted to provide the information as quickly as possible. Obviously, we're disappointed with this morning's announcement as well as in our change in guidance. From our initial guidance for 2019, we acknowledge that we would not deliver for this year the growth rates in earnings and returns that our business is capable of and that we are committed to deliver over time, and we are disappointed in the reduction to that guidance.","However, we have the foundation, and we remain steadfast in our commitment to consistently deliver double-digit earnings growth and growth in return on invested capital over time. We delivered second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.66, that's higher than the midpoint of March guidance by $0.08 per share and only $0.02 per share lower than last year despite a $0.09 drag from fuel and currency.","For the full year, voyage disruptions related to Carnival Vista are expected, as I have mentioned, to have a financial impact of approximately $0.08 to $0.10 per share, and that's from a combination of modified itineraries, canceled sailings, and the unusual nature of the repair given the unavailable damaged dry dock in Grand Bahama Shipyard, where repairs otherwise would have occurred.","Now we're updating our adjusted earnings guidance range, previously $4.35 to $4.55, now $4.25 to $4.35 due to the voyage disruptions; the U.S. Government's policy change on travel to Cuba which impacted earnings by $0.04 to $0.06 per share; lower revenue yields in the second half of the year resulting primarily from ongoing headwinds for our Continental European sourced brands estimated at $0.10 to $0.12 per share and that represents 0.5 point off our prior full-year yield guidance. That's partially offset by $0.02 per share reduction in cost due to lower fuel consumption and a favorable $0.08 per share from changes in fuel and currency since the time of our March guidance.","The U.S. Government's policy change for travel to Cuba has the financial impact of approximately $0.04 to $0.06, as I just mentioned per share, as we have to make deployment changes very close in. While the regulatory change was disappointing as these sailings had experienced strong demand and were well booked at significant yield premiums, we were able to adjust our itineraries to provide our guests with attractive alternative vacation experiences utilizing the six destination ports that we own and operate in the Caribbean, which are among our highest-rated destinations based on guest feedback.","However, the suddenness of the regulatory change is disruptive and has led to a concentration of industry-wide capacity and to a select number of lower-yield deployment options. As always, we remain focused on pricing discipline.","Now, our Continental European brands have been facing heightened geopolitical and macroeconomic headwinds, which has impacted operating performance this year. Our growth in these markets has continued to outpace general travel but growing into a contracting travel market has put pressure on ticket prices this year.","In Germany, land-based tour operator booking trends have been running significantly behind this year, while our German cruise brand has grown double digits but not been able to hold price in that environment. Now, despite these headwinds, our German brand, AIDA, has among the highest returns in our portfolio.","In Southern Europe, while the environment had been challenging for multiple years now, we have encountered a further deterioration in the economic environment in Italy with Italy experiencing recession, a heightened geopolitical environment in France given the ongoing yellow vest disruptions, further compounded by increased land-based competition at significantly low rates, resulting from the reopening of resort destinations in Turkey and North Africa. Prior to this year, despite what had already been a challenging economic environment, particularly in Southern Europe, Costa was executing along the path toward double-digit return on invested capital. In fact, in the last five years, Costa more than doubled return on invested capital, albeit starting from a lower base.","Now newbuilds are a very important part of the path to double-digit return on invested capital and given the inherent cost efficiencies gained by the greater scale and fuel efficiencies of our new ships. Now we've not taken delivery of a new ship in Europe for Costa in over five years, and that ship is still among the highest returning ships in our entire fleet.","We have also entered into an agreement to sell two ships from Costa to our China joint venture next year. We're evaluating further opportunities to optimize our future performance, including accelerating demand and rightsizing capacity. Clearly, in 2019, exacerbated by recent events, we are not performing, as I mentioned, at the double-digit earnings growth rate or growth in return on invested capital that we target. Now we have been aggressively working to enhance our action plan to drive results in 2020 and beyond as some of these action items are in the process of being rolled out and some are still being evaluated.","Now, I'll highlight a few that we expect to benefit 2020 and beyond. While we remain focused on cost containment and aside from the impact of voyage disruptions, we are maintaining the cost guidance we gave for the year. Included in our guidance is a planned increase in our investment and demand creation in the back half of the year to further position us for 2020. However, that increase in advertising is offset by cost savings in other areas.","Now we continue to roll out applications across multiple brands, designed to enhance the guest experience and to promote onboard sales, including Ocean Medallion for Princess, and we expect to have 11 Princess ships rolled out by the end of 2020. Of course, our ongoing newbuild program is integral to the growth in earnings and return on invested capital over time. And as we mentioned before, not only are our newbuilds on average roughly 15% to 25% more cost efficient and approximately 25% to 35% more fuel efficient, they also help to create further demand for cruising.","And of course, we continue to reinvest in the existing fleet to drive demand and have more major refurbishment projects planned next year. For our Carnival brand, we've garnered double-digit yield premiums and double-digit return on investment for the renamed Carnival Sunshine. And we're off to a strong start for the recently reintroduced Carnival Sunrise with both booking volumes and pricing up double digits.","On the cost side, we are now positioning beginning of 2020 to take advantage of the natural cost containment that comes from leveraging the increased capacity from newbuilds. And we've also initiated zero-based planning project for our 2020 planning process. Now this is in addition to our efforts to leverage our industry-leading scale estimated at $75 million or more annually and the greater economies of scale afforded by our higher capacity growth. That said, we will not be afraid to spend money to invest, especially which we have an opportunity to drive demand and earn a return on investment.","We remain very confident in our portfolio of cruise brands. Over the past 5 years, we have had even stronger cumulative yield growth from our EA segment than our NAA segment on similar capacity growth, and believe our brands continue to outperform the broader travel market in Continental Europe. We remain confident we can continue to grow demand for cruise at good prices because we operate in an underpenetrated industry with an overall growing global travel industry. We're well positioned to take advantage of the acceleration and retirees globally and the millennial generation, which overindexes to cruise. ","And at the same time, cruising generates higher satisfaction levels than land-based alternatives and prices at a value to comparable land-based alternatives. So we operate in an industry that is capacity constrained, the ships are full, so are the shipyards, and the mobility of the assets allows us to optimize the demand environment over time. There are headwinds every year. And over the past five years, we've demonstrated our ability to overcome multiple headwinds and deliver strong operational improvement. Now this year, our growth has been hampered by a complements of events, which our people have worked hard to mitigate. We remain confident with actions we're taking that over time, we will continue to deliver double-digit earnings growth and significant growth in return on invested capital.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to David.","David Bernstein","Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I'll start today with a summary of our 2019 second quarter results, then I'll provide an update on current booking trends for the back half of 2019 and finish up with some additional color on our 2019 June guidance.","As Arnold indicated, our adjusted EPS for the second quarter was $0.66, this was $0.08 above the midpoint of our March guidance. The improvement was driven by 2 things, $0.02 of favorability in net cruise revenue and $0.07 of favorability in net cruise costs without fuel substantially due to the timing of expenses between the quarters. Both favorable items were partially offset by $0.01 unfavorable net impact from fuel price and currency.","Now let's look at our second quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 4.6%. Our North America and Australia segment, more commonly known as our NAA brands, was up 0.5%, while our Europe and Asia segment, more commonly known as our EA brands, was up almost 12%. Our total net revenue yields were up 0.6%.","Now let's break apart to two components of net revenue yields. Net ticket yields were essentially flat. Our NAA brands were up 3%, driven by yield improvements in the Caribbean, while our EA brands were down 3.5%. Net onboard and other yields increased almost 2% with increases on both sides of the Atlantic. In summary, our second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.02 lower than the prior year with the benefits from slightly higher net revenue yields and lower dry dock costs, driven by less dry dock days during the quarter being more than offset by higher depreciation expense costing $0.03 and the $0.09 unfavorable net impact of fuel price and currency.","Turning to 2019 booking trends. At this point in time, cumulative advanced bookings for the back half of 2019 are slightly ahead of the prior year on occupancy at prices that are in line with last year. Now let's drill down into the cumulative book position for 2019. Cumulative advanced bookings for our NAA brands are higher than the prior year on occupancy and slightly ahead on price, driven by nicely higher prices in the Caribbean and the seasonal European program, while pricing in Alaska is well lower than last year's record pricing. Cumulative advance bookings for our EA brands are slightly behind the prior year on occupancy at lower prices, again driven by our EA brand sourcing in Continental Europe.","Given our strong book position at the end of the second quarter, with less inventory remaining for sale than the same term the prior year, we had anticipated better pricing on booking volumes during the second quarter, which was included in our March guidance for the back half of the year. In light of these booking trends primarily driven by our EA brands, we have lowered our price expectations on the remaining inventory. Therefore, we are forecasting full year net revenue yields to be approximately flat versus March guidance of up approximately 1%.","Yield guidance for third quarter is now forecasted to be flat or down slightly versus the prior year, while our fourth quarter, we are now forecasting yields to be lower. We do expect yield improvement in both quarters in our NAA brands, which is being offset by yield decline in our EA brands. For the full year, we now expect yield increases in our NAA brands to be up more than 1%, which were impacted by the recent restrictions on travel to Cuba. While for the full year, we now expect yield declines in our EA brands to be more than 1% driven by our EA brand sourcing in Continental Europe.","So now let me provide you with some additional color on our 2019 June guidance. The $0.08 favorable net impact of fuel price and currency is driven by lower fuel prices, which will benefit us $0.15, while currency movements will cost us $0.07. Our full year net cruise costs without fuel per ALBD guidance increased slightly as a result of the voyage disruptions and is now expected to be up approximately 0.7% versus March guidance of 0.5%.","And now, I'll turn the call back over to Arnold.","Arnold Donald","Okay. Keith, we're ready for the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And the first question is from the line of Robin Farley from UBS.","Robin Farley","Couple of issues I would love to ask about. First is, in your opening comments, you've talked about the German market and Costa's market, and you didn't say too much about the U.K. And just given what's going on with Brexit, I wonder if you could give us a little bit of insight into demand in that market?","Arnold Donald","First of all, good morning, Robin. The U.K. has been a better market despite Brexit. There would be a number of reasons for that, but overall it has been better. I don't know if David would like to add any additional color?","David Bernstein","No. I think you summed it up. It has certainly had an overall impact. It would have been better had it not been for Brexit, but we are doing okay in the U.K.","Robin Farley","Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then the comment about 2020 bookings in the release, well ahead that price is in line, but I wonder if you could talk about how -- has that also -- it sounds like the last three months that there was this kind of an increasing pressure in Costa's markets and in Germany. Is that also impacting 2020? In other words, the commentary on 2020 was really about what's on the books, but in terms of what's coming in incrementally on 2020, if you could give some insight?","Arnold Donald","Yes. I'll start and then I'll let David fill in with some details. I think going into 2020 it will still be a challenging environment in Europe, but there is a couple of changes for us. First of all, we had significant increase in the German market this year, not just us but the industry, and that will not be the case in 2020. So significant double-digit capacity increase this year, next year that will not be the case. And then in Costa, we have the new ship. This is the first new ship in over five years, Smeralda, and she is booking very well so far. It will introduce a number of efficiencies and stuff, so that also is a positive going into 2020 for Continental Europe. David, have you got any comments?","David Bernstein","Yes. So, we made some comments on the booking trends in the second quarter for 2019, and clearly there are similarities with the booking trends into 2020. They were clearly stronger in our NAA brands during the quarter, and so we are seeing the overall economic headwinds extend beyond just the back half of 2019 for our EA brands. But it is very early in the overall process, and so there is a lot of time left as we go through the year.","Arnold Donald","And while the environment seems similar, as I mentioned, the conditions we're operating in within our own brands is different going into 2020 and that gives us you know a basis to build on.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steve Wieczynski from Stifel.","Steven Wieczynski","I guess when we look at your revised guidance, I think you said most of that yield reduction was -- is related to Continental Europe, but I wanted to ask about other markets, I guess, specifically, maybe around Alaska. And I guess the question here is, you guys called out some Alaska pressure back in March, and I guess what I'm getting at here is, you know has that stayed pretty much neutral or has that intensified as well?","Arnold Donald","I would say, again a general comment, so overall, our North America brands are doing well with regards to guidance and what we had included in guidance. And I'll let David give you the details on them.","David Bernstein","Yes. I had indicated in my prepared remarks that the current pricing on the books in Alaska was well lower than its record levels last year, which is pretty much consistent with what we had said previously that we have 18 ships in Alaska. We have more Lloyd ships in Alaska than the rest of the industry in over double the number of ships. So, Alaska is a very high-yielding market for us. It's performing very well, but we are seeing -- with the capacity growth in Alaska this year, as we had indicated before, we are seeing lower pricing, but it's still yielding very well for us, and we're very pleased with the results and we'll continue to work hard to improve upon that.","Arnold Donald","And just to refresh your memory, we do have the tour complication in Alaska, where we have a tour business that has a certain amount of capacity and even though you can increase the number of guests going to Alaska, we don't necessarily have additional rooms in the resorts and other things to -- for total yield once you get to onboard revenue, et cetera, excursions. So that's another level of complication, but Alaska is strong, is profitable, is growing.","Steven Wieczynski","And I guess to add on to that, does -- David, I guess, this is probably for you, but does your updated guidance that you put out today assume that European sourced customer weakens from current levels or basically stays kind of status quo from what you're seeing today?","David Bernstein","It's really hard to say because you're now getting into voyage-by-voyage and country-by-country detail. We try to generally understand the overall economic environment and did our best to go voyage-by-voyage sourcing and come up with a reasonable plan that we believe is our best guess.","Steven Wieczynski","Okay. And last question, I guess, for me is, I'm not sure if I am allowed to do this or not, but I think you said, Micky is there today. So I was wondering if I could ask him a question around Cuba, given it sounds like he might have had some direct dealings with Washington officials. And I guess, Micky, if you are there, can you maybe help us understand what those meetings were like? And if you were somewhat surprised at the eventual outcome of the situation?","Micky Arison","I was definitely surprised at the outcome, but I don't think it's appropriate for me to comment on meetings.","Operator","The next question is from Jared Shojaian from Wolfe Research.","Jared Shojaian","Arnold, you touched on the supply environment in Europe. I think you said double-digit growth this year for Germany. Can you tell us what the industry supply growth is in all of Europe, not just Germany, versus what you guys are seeing next year in 2020? And along those lines, do you think you need to reduce capacity?","Arnold Donald","I will answer the latter part of your question first as David looks up the details on these percentage growth here, but it was double digits in Continental Europe this year uniformly. And I think overall for -- you said for the industry, so it would be much higher than ours individually probably. But in any event, we are always looking at rightsizing every market, every source market, every destination market. And you know obviously, we'll be looking at that going into next year and beyond in Europe, especially in Southern Europe.","David Bernstein","So I can answer your question, but the hard part of answering your question, first of all, I only know the numbers for us. I don't have all the numbers for the industry for 2020. And for us in total, we are seeing -- we have 7.3% capacity growth and we do expect to see 11% capacity increase in 2020 in Europe, 26% in China and 8% in Alaska. And that is our capacity increase overall for the whole corporation. But when you go in brand-by-brand, in 2020, it's very different.","Arnold Donald","And if you look at the total capacity increase this year?","David Bernstein","For us, it was 4.5% in Europe.","Arnold Donald","Continental Europe.","Beth Roberts","I think what Jared -- to point Jared's question was really the industry supply growth for the European source market not the deployment. From a source market perspective, we are looking at 9% supply growth in the EA segment this year and it compares to the comparable rate next year. If you look at Continental Europe, it is down from 13% to 10%, that is mostly reflection of -- sorry, includes Asia, AIDA is up mid-single digit, Costa is up low double digits, again, with the new ship this year. Costa is -- Asia is up with the new ship and Cunard is down slightly and P&O is up high single digits.","Arnold Donald","So that would be all of Europe. If you want to focus -- sorry, we didn't have the answers as frankly for you, but the bottom line is this, if you look at AIDA, AIDA was up double-digit capacity growth this year.","Beth Roberts","20%.","Arnold Donald","Almost 20%. And there won't be -- they will be up 5% or 6% or something next year. Costa was up almost 14% this year, but that was with existing hardware with -- not with new ship -- it was not within the newbuild. Next year we'll be up in Costa, but it will be the newbuild with Smeralda, which is -- brings in efficiencies and so on and so forth. So the brands will be experiencing a different dynamic as well there was capacity increase from others in Germany this year and they will not have capacity increase next year. So when you look at those markets that primarily we're focused on, all those brands that primarily we've been focused on in this conversation with the yield adjustment, they will be going into a better situation even if the overall environment hasn't changed much in Europe. And in addition to that of course, we're going to do a number of things ourselves from creating demand and other things to try to improve the performance there. Having said all that, AIDA is still growing earnings in Europe and so on and so forth. So we have an opportunity still to focus on what we want to focus on, which is earnings growth and return on invested capital, and we have a good base in AIDA to do that going forward and have the opportunity with Costa as well.","Jared Shojaian","Okay. I'll go back and check the transcript on. There's a lot of information unpacked there. But I mean, if I am understanding everything you said, it seems like there's still a decent amount of capacity growth in 2020, maybe not to the same degree as what you saw in 2019. And so obviously environment is a little bit challenged, if you do have more supply coming on in 2020, I mean, what can you do to mitigate this besides, I guess, more marketing here or whatnot? I mean why not just come out and, as the largest player in the industry, take out some capacity right now, I mean, maybe if you can help me understand that better?","Arnold Donald","I would say, first of all, AIDA is one of the highest return brands that we have. And so while it may not be a yield story, it's an earnings and it is an accretive story, and it is helping us overall deliver. Costa this year, as I mentioned, had existing hardware, did not have new hardware and the capacity increase there, with the new hardware they're getting us is going to provide us with a new vessel, give us an opportunity, again, for financial performance and return generation. We will be looking at overall capacity though, this July not, but we will be looking overall at capacity to see if we feel with all of that we still need to make some other adjustments.","Jared Shojaian","Okay. And just one last quick one for me. Arnold, you talked about leveraging scale and benefits of cost beginning in 2020. 2020 is really the first year of, I guess, a little bit more supply growth for you for the next few years. Is it reasonable to conclude that your unit costs, and I am talking constant currency, NCC ex fuel, should be down in each of these next few years. Is that kind of how you guys are thinking about it?","Arnold Donald","I think the opportunity is definitely to have unit cost reductions. The question is, is it worthwhile to reinvest that to create demand? And so that's -- the trade-off will be evaluating and assessing. But absolutely, it gives us the opportunity for unit cost reduction with the capacity increase, and either that goes to the bottom line or should be invested to drive yield.","Operator","The next question is from the line of James Hardiman from Wedbush.","James Hardiman","So just to clarify on Europe, I'm just trying to understand, do you think Europe is getting worse since the last time you reported or did your previous guidance just assume that it would get better?","Arnold Donald","I think, again, when we give guidance, we factor in a whole lot of things. And even now with this guidance, we have a half year to go and things happen. And so even within this guidance, we are assuming some things are going to go wrong in the second half of the year. I think what happened -- and if and though you're asking just about Europe, but you know we look at things holistically because there's so many moving parts. And what's happening right now is just complements of events. We've had them in the past, but we were able to overcome them this year, the complements kind of overwhelm us. But we've had issues in other markets over the years, where you had a yield challenge where -- you guys worry about China one year and other time it was Caribbean and the stuff moves around. So yes, Europe definitely is weaker than it appeared at that time. But again, things -- some things get stronger, some things get weaker every year. And so in this case, it happens to be Europe, and we have to look at it and look ahead and see if we need to make other changes, look at the changes we're already making and whether that will accommodate us to help us drive towards what we're chasing, which is double-digit earnings growth and elevated return on invested capital.","David Bernstein","So I'd add to that. I think I tried to explain in my prepared remarks that we were sort of surprised at the levels of bookings and the prices that we needed during the second quarter. So the demand we're seeing and the environment we're seeing is really, you could say, it's something similar to what the ECB is seeing as they are talking about creating more stimulus to help the economic environment in Europe. So it was a bit of a surprise and that's why we took -- we reflected that in our guidance this quarter.","James Hardiman","Okay. And then my second question was on Cuba. So the $0.04 to $0.06, just trying to figure out, I mean, it's not a big number to begin with, but I'm trying to figure out how much of that flows into next year? In other words, how much of it was the fact that you have -- you get premium pricing on Cuba versus all of the disruption and rebooking? And then secondarily, are there any secondary consequences of the Cuba travel ban, maybe a ripple effect as the Cuba stops get replaced with other stops? I'm just trying to figure out if that has an impact on ships that weren't even initially going to Cuba?","Arnold Donald","Yes, thank you. Again, complex question, the reality is Cuba is gone for the foreseeable future and so it didn't add into plans for next year. And therefore, that higher-yielding itinerary is off the table. And companies like us and others will have to adapt to see what they can generate. Having said that, it was already the Caribbean. The ships are already stopping at -- off the Caribbean islands. And so while the overall itinerary yields will potentially be less if we can't come up with creative ways to generate more onboard revenue or whatever. That -- the fact is the effect, it's a certain percent of capacity and next year who knows what percent it will be because some of those ships may move out of the Caribbean entirely. So yes, it could put some additional pressure, but the Caribbean has been a very strong market this year. Yields are up, occupancy is up. I mean, it has been a very strong market and even with the impact of Cuba.","David Bernstein","So keep in mind that a lot of the $0.04 to $0.06 was disruption from the cancellations in the short-term. Next year, we have a lot of less bookings on the books so that -- but keep in mind there's also a full year impact versus this year was a half year impact. To add to what Arnold had said, one potential dynamic that we can't anticipate is that our competitors did increase their short cruise capacity when they started sailing to Cuba and without the Cuba demand, it may be hard to build the short capacity. So we really can't predict what others will do and if they'll keep the capacity in the short market versus going back to long cruises. And so this is one of the things we'll be watching very closely.","Arnold Donald","But having said that, that's a deep build to manage the Caribbean right now. I mean looking into early -- it's early, but looking into 2020, bookings are very strong, and it looks good.","Beth Roberts","Did we answer your question? I just want to make we addressed it.","James Hardiman","Yes. That was a perfect answer. I really appreciate it.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Felicia Hendrix from Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix","So Arnold, bigger picture's question, so with -- with Costa and AIDA and your other kind of, what I call, country-specific brands, your competitors have been successful with moving to global sourcing over time. And I understand that the structure of their company and their strategy is different than what you all have with your many, many brands. And it probably would be a challenge to kind of change the strategy, just given how entrenched you are there. But I am wondering, is there any sense to, at least, examining a strategy shift in the brands so that you could remove the vulnerability you have? I mean I know like today it's an issue and tomorrow you will not have an issue, but you are really like entrenched in kind of subject to what is going on in each specific economy, so I was just wondering if you thought about that.","Arnold Donald","We've looked at the model all the time because it's just part of managing the business. But the reality is, our model, over the last five years, you look at things, like return on invested capital, common financial metrics, has performed comparably, in some cases, better, in some cases, slightly not, but in any given year, a model could benefit more or less. For example, this year, we actually had less dependence on Cuba because of our portfolio than others, so the impact on our total business of Cuba, while it is an impact, is less than what was from other players. We have more activity in Europe than they do. So the impact in Europe to us is more dramatic than it is for them. And so those things move around, but overall the model has delivered over the last five years. This year, we had a modest growth plans in the first place as we're prepping for the capacity build coming over the next several years, and we feel strongly the model was going to deliver and the proof will be in the pudding. But in any given year, one can look slightly better than the other. But it's a portfolio, it's a portfolio approach and portfolio of brands and overall it delivers.","David Bernstein","Yes. And I do want to point out, we do have global brands as well within the portfolio and they also do want to point out that some of our competitors do have national and regional brands. They're just not consolidated into their results because they're treated from an equity perspective. But as Arnold indicated, we get very strong results over time in the long run from the variety of types of brands that we have in our portfolio.","Arnold Donald","It does make our yield story more complicated. But in the end, as you guys know, we're chasing earnings and the return on invested capital, but it absolutely makes the yield story more complicated.","Felicia Hendrix","Yes. I think some of it, too, is that those other country-specific brands just --- from what the world understood are actually not seeing some of the challenges that you are seeing, like see in AIDA, so, but anyway it just points to something...","Arnold Donald","We would like to point out to you guys on AIDA though. I would like to point out on AIDA, just to make it clear. While that's a yield challenge this year and we revised some yield stuff, overall AIDA is growing earnings. And as I said, it's one of the higher-performing brands that we have. And so we're very confident about it going forward, and I think the dynamics in the future, along with the actions that the brand team are taking and we're taking overall, is going to just enhance that performance. Go ahead, I am sorry, you were...","Felicia Hendrix","That's helpful, thank you. That's helpful. No, yes, so just to clarify, on your comments on Alaska, is there a -- is it status quo in Alaska for you or is it -- eventually, people might have interpreted what you said as Alaska is getting worse. Is that your interpretation?","Arnold Donald","No. I wouldn't -- Alaska is not getting worse or anything. Go ahead, David?","David Bernstein","Yes. No. I mean -- okay, I mean, there are a little puts and takes in the NAA brands. But the only two things I'd really call out in the NAA brands versus our prior guidance was the voyage disruption and the travel restriction to Cuba. Other than that, it was a bunch of small puts and takes.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. Perfect. And then just on your onboard, so I think you said that, that was up 2%. So that's a nice positive. Can you just talk about what you're seeing there and to the extent that, that's surprising how you not expect that to trend throughout the year even though it's hard to predict?","David Bernstein","Yes. So as I indicated in my prepared remarks, we did see increases on both sides at the Atlantic. And we are -- we do expect to see those type or better yield increases in the balance of the year in onboard and other revenue, which is what we included in the guidance. We got a lot of things in the works, which should hopefully continue to improve those numbers as we move forward.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo.","Timothy Conder","Thank you for the color on Alaska. One thing I did want to follow up there though is, we do understand and it's been going on and even happened to a degree last year, how -- you're limited on your tour side and then as the capacity grows, you're not able to grow the tour onboard as -- that the same rates you are, the lower ticket price, so that's a little negative mix on the yield. But all that being said, your two competitors did add significant amount of capacity, yet they didn't -- have not really seen the pressure that you're seeing in Alaska. So were there some executional issues in Alaska that if you had to do it again, you would maybe do a little bit differently, if we rewound things 12 to 18 months, I guess, is one question there.","Arnold Donald","Yes. I don't know about the competitors in Alaska, I won't make any comment on that, but I can tell you about us. I mean, wish -- we have 18 ships in Alaska, we're doing our very, very well on Alaska. Alaska is a growth segment for us, a growth destination market for us. And so we don't feel there is a problem in Alaska. Now when you look at yields and you're just trying to track yield changes, yes, all those things come into play that we're growing, and we're still making incremental money on the additional guests, but they come in at a lower total yield if they're not getting the hotel rooms and some of the other things that are associated with the land tours, so that can be a mix drag. But beyond that, overall we're doing well on Alaska. Any other comments, David?","David Bernstein","Yes. The only thing I'll add is since we have more Lloyd ships in Alaska than the rest of the industry combined, so it is difficult for us to move the needle dramatically year-over-year just by adding 1 or 2 new high-yielding ships to the mix compared to our competitors.","Arnold Donald","Right.","Timothy Conder","Okay, okay. Fair. Maybe shift to China, granted it's only 5%, 6% your total capacity, but you called out basically Europe and China in the press release, but then in your preamble, you seemed to focus mostly on Europe. China, are you seeing any fallout here short-term, given all the, let's just call them, \"festivities\" over the last six months geopolitically there or what are you seeing, I guess, how things transpired, especially over the last 90 days from your business in China and then the outlook?","Arnold Donald","Overall, chain is doing better and we've had yield increases and the business is better. So go ahead, David.","David Bernstein","Yes. I think what you're referring to is because we break the world into two segments, our NAA and EA, somebody may have interpreted the booking comments to be both the E and the A and it really was just the E.","Arnold Donald","And it's actually just the Continental Europe part of the E.","David Bernstein","Exactly.","Timothy Conder","Okay. So there is a little island to the west, the U.K. as you said before. Really that's been fairly stable in your view over the last 90 days.","Arnold Donald","Yes.","David Bernstein","Correct.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Grambling","As a follow-up to Jared's question earlier on capacity, you had slowed portfolio-wide capacity growth somewhat in tandem with the ROIC targets being announced over the past few years and your opening remarks cited newbuild as a key part of the path to double-digit ROIC. So can you just walk us through your thought process on new ship growth versus deletions on a portfolio-wide basis, perhaps comment on how locked in your orders are as we looked out over the next couple of years?","Arnold Donald","Okay. In terms of newbuilds, you're always going to build new ships, because they are more cost efficient, you get economies of scale, they're more fuel efficient, they are just more efficient. So the question when it comes to capacity is how quickly are you going to divest lower-performing vessels? And that depends on how the market goes. So if we see persistence in market challenges and creating a demand to fill the ships, then we would accelerate capacity reduction on lower-yielding ships. But the new ships are the wrong place to go because those new ships are giving you your double-digit return on invested capital.","Stephen Grambling","So maybe as a follow-up on what happened with Vista, that's a relatively new ship, how should we be thinking about what happened there relative to other new ships and the broader fleet?","Arnold Donald","First of all, Vista is a very high-performing ship, which is why we have a significant impact from -- of few weeks of cancellation and some modified itineraries where we had to kind of take care of our guests in the right way, given the fact it was a little bit disruptive to their vacation plan. So this is a very high-performing ship, mechanical issue that reduce the speed of the ship. Some mechanical issue that reduced the speed of the ship, wasn't a safety issue, just reducing the speed of the ship. But reducing the speed forces a change in itineraries and you got to get it repaired. And so it's not unique to Vista, the particular equipment is on other ships, not just ours, but other companies, there have been other issues with other ships with the particular equipment involved. And obviously we're addressing that with the manufacturer and being in front of it on other ships that have that same piece of equipment.","David Bernstein","We did have an issue on the AIDAprima last year, but it had a dry dock that was very close by and we were able to quickly take it into dry dock and return it to service. Unfortunately, with the dry dock unavailable at the Grand Bahama Shipyard, we had to find some other alternatives to fix the ship and so it's taking a little longer than it might have otherwise have taken, which magnified the impact.","Stephen Grambling","So just to be clear, so the impact that you're citing is specific to Vista, or is it a potential that as you're looking at the part in other ships, there could be another potential impact?","Arnold Donald","No. It's essentially -- is specific to Vista.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Harry Curtis with Instinet.","Harry Curtis","Arnold, you mentioned the refurbishment plan. Can you give us a sense of how your number of dry dock days in 2019 is different from '18? And then what is the outlook for 2020? I am just trying to get a sense of, is there any meaningful difference, given the impact on the likely sailings?","Arnold Donald","So leaving the unplanned, just the dry dock out of it, go ahead.","David Bernstein","Yes. So for '18, we had 500 days. The number is same essentially in '19. And for 2020, it's going to be a little higher, 520 days.","Harry Curtis","Okay. So not particularly meaningful then?","Arnold Donald","Right.","Harry Curtis","Okay. And then, Arnold, you mentioned your objective of over time achieving double-digit earnings growth. Given the capacity increases that we're likely to see globally and particularly in the markets that have had an impact on your pricing in 2019, is it -- does your intuition give you the sense that you're going to be able to achieve that double-digit growth in 2020?","Arnold Donald","Again, it's early. We're not giving guidance here for 2020. But clearly, we will be working towards that objective.","Harry Curtis","So in order to achieve that objective, if you have 7% capacity growth, how much pricing power would you need to get to '20 -- to double-digit earnings growth next year, just in kind of broad strokes do you think?","Arnold Donald","Depending what we do with the cost savings that would address. So can you get there with as little as 1% yield improvement? The answer is yes you could. Obviously, we'll be driving fleet yield above and beyond that. And so just the matrices we've shown you in the past, we've shown investors in the past, there is the capability to deliver double-digit earnings growth and increase return on invested capital. Obviously, we're going to be working to drive beyond all that and that can effect the combination of cost versus yield.","David Bernstein","And just to give you math behind that, a 1% yield growth will drive a 5% earnings growth, and a 1% cost reduction will drive a 3% earnings growth on top of the 7% capacity growth.","Arnold Donald","Capacity.","Harry Curtis","But as a practical matter, with 7% capacity growth next year, the industry typically dials up marketing costs pretty significantly in anticipation of that capacity growth. So it would seem to me that your -- the opportunity for a decline in net cruise costs next year is pretty remote, given the amount of capacity that you're going to have to get ahead of with higher marketing spend, is that fair?","Arnold Donald","We'll have to see. We're not given guidance here. But the reality is with that kind of capacity growth, you definitely have a lot of cost improvement that you have available to you, to either put to the bottom line or to reinvest. We already invest heavily in promotion, given the scale we have, and whatnot. And we will continue to invest. But the practical reality, again, is, in the end, you're chasing a certain amount of reach and frequency and messaging, et cetera. You don't always have to ramp up proportionally to the increase in demand you need. How you message, sources of messaging the people, how you reason what's used in PR versus paid media versus direct mail versus digital on and on and on. And then leveraging our scale effecting -- more effective media bias because of our scale, et cetera. So there's a lot of dynamics there and we're focused on being cost effective. We're not afraid to invest. But at the same time, we expect to harvest some of the cost improvements from the capacity increase. And with that level of capacity increase, you have more opportunity.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Assia Georgieva with Infinity Research.","Assia Georgieva","In my 22 years of following this industry, this has got to be one of the most informative calls, so thank you so much for spending the time. Couple of questions. In Alaska -- in terms of Alaska, competitive pressure probably played a role. Is it fair to say that we have some of that capacity additions?","Arnold Donald","I think the fact that there are other companies having more ships going to Alaska and getting more new to cruise to try to go to Alaska will absolutely play a role. I don't think there's been anything that's -- just from the tone of questions, it makes it sound like Alaska is weak or something, and that's just not the case. Again, you've got yield dynamics. But in the end, we're chasing earnings and return on invested capital. And so while Alaska, we would love to have higher yields in Alaska, even higher, we're going to work to do that, Alaska is a very strong market.","Assia Georgieva","And as a follow-up and kind of switching gears to Europe, Southern Europe seems to be issue as opposed to Brexit, as opposed to really Germany, is there any specific macroeconomic problem that you're seeing? I mean we had Spain going through a major recession years ago, Italy, Greece, et cetera. So we shouldn't really be in such poor shape. And isn't there the opportunity, given that it's kind of closer end booking market from -- in terms of passenger sourcing that there could be upside to Europe for Q3 and early part of Q4?","Arnold Donald","We're certainly going to work to try to beat what we have in guidance in Southern Europe. But we've given you our best projection at this point is what's included in our guidance. It has been a challenging environment for some time and at periods of time, it gets even more challenging. And that's what we're facing now.","Assia Georgieva","All right. I hope it works out better than it has so far.","Arnold Donald","Thank you. We're going to work hard to work out better, and thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Brandt Montour from JPMorgan.","Brandt Montour","Just quickly from me, so Dominican Republic, we haven't really talked about that. Just curious, what is the annual exposure to that market for you guys in terms of capacity? Have you seen any type of cost stiffness from the consumers due to the recent headlines there?","David Bernstein","So we haven't noticed any impact on any of our bookings going to the DR as a result of what's happened in a couple of hotels there, which have all been isolated incidents from what I've read. And so overall in fact, my son was in the DR last week, spent a week there and had a wonderful vacation.","Brandt Montour","That's great to hear. And then quick, I know we talked about Alaska a ton. For next year for the industry and for you guys, capacity growth, what's kind of the early read there? Is there any relief that you think will get there?","David Bernstein","Sorry, your question was a little...","Arnold Donald","The question is capacity in Alaska next year, is it going to be up, down or flat? Is there any relief?","Beth Roberts","It was up 16% this year, and for us it's up 8%. We don't have the industry yet, but we are more than half of the industry.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia","I wanted to follow-up on Robin's question on onboard yields. I mean clearly, it's a brighter spot, but it is kind of growing at a lower pace than it has over the last few years. I guess, I am wondering if that's -- that you've pulled so many arrows out of the quiver and so it's just settling end of lower pace or if you're seeing some sort of impact from the discounting in Europe, bringing in a passenger that's spending less, but any context you could give us around that would be helpful.","David Bernstein","Yes. So if you went back to the guidance we gave in December, we actually included in that guidance yields in the second quarter that were up approximately 2% similar to the results. We had some itinerary changes and seasonality that affected the second quarter. So we anticipated the second quarter being, call it, the lowest increase of the year. And as I said before, we do expect slightly higher increases in the third and fourth quarter.","Sharon Zackfia","And just to follow-up on that, so are you seeing any impact from the discounting in Europe flowing through to onboard yields there?","David Bernstein","So our onboard revenue in Europe, as I said, in both cases, we're seeing increases on both sides of the Atlantic, and we are not seeing any significant impact on onboard revenue in Continental Europe.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Robin Farley from UBS.","Robin Farley","Just circling back, I have a follow-up question.","Arnold Donald","Welcome back, Robin.","Robin Farley","Yes, thanks. See, but I got in line again. Just on Cuba, I know you said, no plans for Cuba next year. I guess just thinking about the fact that maybe some of the challenges in Cuba, just given the size of the port, there -- some of the ships there are smaller or older ships and may not be as easily repositioned. And so I guess, I just wanted to get your view on, do you kind of wait for a year, put them in something to get through the next year and kind of wait to see if there is a change in administration, a year out that would maybe have a different view of relations with Cuba. Is that the kind of...","Arnold Donald","No. I think, look, we welcome whenever Cuba is open for cruise travel again. That obvious, that's first thing. But the second thing is, our ships that we have are our ships that we have. We didn't change our concentrate, certain type of hardware to Cuba versus other. So it's the core of our Carnival fleet, core of our Holland America fleet, the core of our Seabourn fleet, and so it's our normal ships. Having said that, clearly, as I said, as best in the case of Carnival, the ships are ready in the Caribbean and they would stop at other ports in the Caribbean along with Cuba. Cuba was a draw. You were getting definitely guests who wanted to go to Cuba, now was a draw and it lifted yields and so on. But we don't see it as an overwhelming capacity shift or anything. But clearly, it introduces a factor that causes us to have to work harder to fill the ships at good pricing.","Only other comment I will make Robin is that the Caribbean has been very, very strong overall. So you don't want that to happen, but it happened in a strong destination market. We'll take a couple of more questions. We're little over time. But I know we started one minute or two late, so couple of more questions, Keith.","Operator","Okay. The next one is a follow-up from Jared Shojaian from Wolfe Research.","Jared Shojaian","Just one housekeeping, real quick too. Just on capacity, D&A and CapEx. I didn't see any guidance in the release, I think you normally give it in your 10-Qs. But can you tell us how you're thinking about capacity growth and CapEx over the next few years and then how to think about D&A for this year?","Beth Roberts","Capacity growth is -- for this year was 4.5%; for next year, it 7.3%; for '21, it is 6.1%; and for '22, it's 5.3%. Those are growth numbers. They can't go up, but they will come down. CapEx is $6.7 billion in '19, $5.7 billion in '20 and $5.9 billion in '21 and $5.4 billion in '22. Interest is $195 million roughly for the year and depreciation is $2.22 billion for the year.","Jared Shojaian","Great, that's very helpful. Thank you, Beth. And then just on your booked position for 2020, if you removed new hardware you have coming on and then old hardware that's leaving the fleet, I think you're selling a couple of Costa ships, if you just neutralize for hardware, are you in the same booked position for 2020 that you called out in your release or is it not as strong?","David Bernstein","So it's very difficult. I mean, I haven't actually taken -- done that analysis. But I will tell you that every time we do an overall mix analysis for a new ship, given our size, the mix is very tiny. And so I am assuming it's a very tiny impact on the bookings as well.","Jared Shojaian","Great. And then just one last one. I know you just talked about the Caribbean and the strength that you're seeing, but I apologize if I missed this, but have you seen any promotional activity from any of your competitors? I mean, can you just talk about that a little bit?","Arnold Donald","Well, we see promotional activity all the time from other cruise lines and, I guess, some of ours will occasionally do promotion as well. Have we seen a ramp-up in promotional activity related to the Cuba ship? And I guess the answer to that would be, yes, we have. But we've been holding price and doing well with that.","David Bernstein","One more question, Keith.","Operator","The next one is a follow-up from Assia Georgieva from Infinity Research.","Assia Georgieva","I managed to sneak in again. Thank you, Keith, and thank you the team at Carnival. So in terms of what we're looking at Cuba, if you had a choice, let's say, tomorrow, hypothetical, the administration says, \"Well, you can go back end.\" Would you be willing to jump at the opportunity? Or would you take a wait-and-see stance?","Arnold Donald","No. Absolutely. Whenever we can go back to Cuba, we absolutely will go back to Cuba. So a great experience for guests. Obviously, there's a lots of Cuban-Americans who want to connect with family, but more broadly for Americans. And then for the Cuban locals in terms of the impact for them, it is a big driver for the micro economy there for the individual citizens of Cuba. So we would absolutely go back. We had great experiences for our guest and we welcome that opportunity.","Assia Georgieva","Yes. I would imagine based on the rough calculations that for the second half of this year, it's about $250 million direct impact to three major cruise companies and probably over 1.5 year, it's probably $1 billion worth of lost economic impact, correct, roughly?","Arnold Donald","It's a significant lost economic impact for Cuba, there's no question about it. All right thank you very much everyone. I know we kept you a little long. Just know that again while we're disappointed having to revise guidance, very disappointed with the situation. With Vista, our teams are working hard to mitigate all that. We are still working hard to beat last year's record earnings. We're still obviously generating great cash and so on. But more importantly, we feel of a strong foundation and with the actions we're taking and the actions that we are considering to take and we'll eventually take some subset of those, we're confident we'll be well positioned for our objective of double-digit earnings growth and double-digit return -- growing at double-digit return on invested capital over time. Thank you very much.","Operator","That does conclude the conference call for today.

Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Carnival Corporation Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Friday, June 22, 2012. I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Frank, Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer. Please go ahead.","Howard S. Frank","Good morning, everyone. We are all here in Miami: David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; Beth Roberts, VP of Investor Relations; and Micky Arison, Chairman and CEO of Carnival Corporation. Before we proceed with the formal comments this morning, I'm going to just turn it over to Micky.","Micky M. Arison","Hi, everybody. I just want to warn you that -- many of you know we had quite an exciting evening last night and a very long evening last night. So if during the presentation you hear any snoring in the background, that's me, and I apologize if I'm not totally coherent this morning. But I'm going to do the best I can. David?","David Bernstein","Thank you, Micky. Before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this conference call will be forward-looking. I will refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release. Also, all of my references to revenue and cost metrics will be in local currencies unless otherwise noted, as this is a more useful measure of business trends.","Our non-GAAP EPS for the second quarter was $0.20. The second quarter came in $0.13 above the midpoint of our March guidance. The improvement was driven by better-than-expected pricing on close-in bookings and higher onboard and other revenue worth $0.05.","Lower net cruise costs, excluding fuel, were worth $0.03. Lower fuel prices were worth $0.01; and 2 nonrecurring items, each worth $0.02. The first nonrecurring item relates to insurance proceeds received for the total loss of Costa Concordia in excess of its net book value and was forecasted to be received in the third quarter in our March guidance, while the second nonrecurring item is a litigation settlement we received relating to Queen Mary 2's propulsion pod.","Now let's look at our second quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased over 2%, roughly the same for both the North American brands and the Europe, Australia and Asian brands or, as we call them, our EAA brands. Our total net revenue yields increased -- sorry, decreased 1.4% in the second quarter. However, excluding Costa, total net revenue yields increased 1.1%, with net ticket revenue yields flat and net onboard and other revenue yields up 4%.","With respect to net ticket yields, the North American brands were up 1.5%, driven by improved yields in the Caribbean and Alaska, partially offset by lower yields in European and other itineraries. During the second quarter, slightly more than half of the North American brand's capacity was positioned in the Caribbean.","Excluding Costa, our EAA brands' net ticket yields were down 2.7%. For net onboard and other yields, again excluding Costa, the increase was 4%. This was driven by our North American brands, while our EAA brands, excluding Costa, were flat despite lower occupancy. We were pleased with the results, as we saw improvement in all categories of onboard revenue.","On the cost side, net cruise cost per available lower berth day, excluding both fuel and the 2 favorable nonrecurring items I previously mentioned, were down 2.2% versus the prior year. The decline in net cruise cost per ALBD was greater than what we expected in our March guidance.","As a result of our ongoing efforts to reduce fuel usage, our consumption per ALBD declined 3.2% this quarter, thus continuing a multiple-year savings trend. Fuel prices this quarter were 12% higher than last year, costing us $0.09 per share. Currency rates this quarter versus the prior year cost us an additional $0.02 as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar. In summary, the second quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.06 lower than 2011 earnings of $0.26 per share, driven by higher fuel prices as reduced revenue yields were more than offset by lower net cruise costs.","Excluded from our non-GAAP EPS but included in our GAAP EPS were unrealized losses on fuel derivatives of $145 million, or $0.18 per share, resulting from marking to market our portfolio of fuel derivatives. As we first discussed on the December call, we believe it is more meaningful to evaluate our earnings performance by excluding the impact of unrealized gains and losses on fuel derivatives until the gains or losses are realized. This appropriately lines up the economic or the cash impact of the fuel derivative with the underlying fuel price risk, which it is intended to mitigate.","In March, we entered into zero cost collars for an additional 19% of our estimated fuel consumption for the second half of fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2013, bringing the total to approximately 38% for this period. We feel comfortable with this level of protection for the next 18 months.","In addition, we also have zero cost collars in place that cover approximately 19% of our estimated fuel consumption for fiscal 2014 and 2015. We will look to opportunistically increase these percentages over time.","While the unrealized losses on fuel derivatives are excluded from our non-GAAP EPS, realized losses are not. Through the end of the second quarter, there were no realized losses. However, our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance for 2012 includes $0.07 per share of forecasted realized losses on fuel derivatives by applying the current Brent prices to the derivatives that settled in the second half of 2012.","Now turning to our 2012 outlook. I'll skip net revenue yields, as Howard will discuss that shortly. On the cost side, for the full year, net cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD are forecasted to be down 0.5% to 1.5% versus the prior year. This is 1 percentage point better than our March guidance. Our operating companies identified opportunities in a number of areas to further reduce costs. Certain expenses relating to the Costa Concordia incident were less than we had forecasted, and the litigation settlement I previously mentioned also contributed to this improvement.","On a final note, I wanted to share with you our current rules of thumb about the impact that fuel prices and currency can have on our results. To start with, a 10% change in the current fuel price, excluding the impact of fuel derivatives, represents $0.26 per share for the full year. For the remaining half of 2012, it represents $0.13 per share. As we all know, the price of a barrel of oil has moved substantially in recent days. Just to be clear, the price of Brent was $93 a barrel the other day when we locked off our forecast.","The second rule of thumb relates to our current fuel derivative portfolio where a 10% reduction in the price of Brent for the remaining half of 2012 would result in an additional $0.04 of realized losses on fuel derivatives that would offset the $0.13 per share favorable impact from the reduced price of fuel.","With respect to FX movement, a 10% change in all relevant currencies relating to the U.S. dollar for the remaining half of 2012 would impact our P&L by $0.11 per share.","At this point, I will turn the call over to Howard.","Howard S. Frank","Thank you, David. Before my formal comments, let me just mention that the Miami HEAT winning an NBA championship last night is a defining moment. It's broader than just basketball. It really is a defining moment for the community. It brings the community together, so there's quite a bit of an excitement down here. Most of us have lost sleep, Micky more than anybody else. But it's -- we'd like everybody to offer congratulations to the HEAT Organization, to Micky Arison and, of course, to LeBron James, who was absolutely spectacular. We were all involved, and we all either watched it on TV or at the arena, and so it was a great evening and a great week for us.","Now to my formal commentary. As we indicated in the press release, during the second quarter, we experienced a significant improvement in booking volumes for all of our brands in North America and EAA. Over the last 7 weeks, booking volumes, this excludes Costa, have run 8% ahead on a year-over-year basis. The booking momentum percentages are approximately the same for both North America and EAA brands, the percentage improvements that I'm talking about.","For Costa, the booking momentum for the 7-week period has even been more encouraging, running approximately 25% ahead year-on-year. Loss of booking momentum beginning this past January and continuing through the end of March resulted in our falling further behind in our year-over-year occupancies across all of North America and EAA brands.","Toward the end of March, marketing programs were restarted, which included significant price initiatives to stimulate consumer demand, and we began to see a strong rebound in bookings beginning in early April. I think it's fair to say that the revenue yield impact from the pricing initiatives taken during this period was slightly greater than we had originally anticipated. Perhaps to some degree, this may have been attributable to the further softening in consumer demand which was experienced this spring, particularly in the North American market. Also, as we mentioned in our prior earnings call, the significantly higher air cost for North American passengers traveling to Europe caused bookings for these itineraries [ph] to slow and resulted in our having to take further price reductions for these programs.","During this past spring, North American brands experienced slightly lower pricing than we originally forecasted. North American brand European itineraries experienced the largest declines in pricing, not just because of the slowing North American market but also because of the challenges in locally sourcing business from the softer European markets for these sailings. As a consequence, for the remainder of 2012, we have modestly reduced our revenue yield outlook for North American brands for the second half of the year. And for the full year, North American brand revenue yields are now forecasted to be flat on a year-over-year basis.","Revenue yields for our European brands, excluding Costa, are also forecasted to be slightly lower than previously anticipated, primarily due to the significant softening in the Spanish market. Ibero, our Spanish cruise line, has suffered a significant decline in revenue yields. Fortunately, there were just 3 ships operating in the brand, so the impact of the struggling Spanish economy on our financial results has not been significant.","The good news in Europe is that bookings and pricing for the U.K. and German brands have held up reasonably well during this past spring. Please keep in mind that all of my comments on revenue yields are in constant dollars.","Now turning to Costa itself for the Costa brand. The picture has improved. Costa's booking volumes stimulated by significant pricing initiatives as part of their remarketing campaign introduced in April have shown considerable strength. And this has been in all of their major markets: Italy, France and Germany. For the last 15 weeks, volumes were 13% higher for Costa. And the last 7 weeks, as previously mentioned, Costa's booking volumes were running 25% higher year-over-year.","Costa suffered significant loss in booking volumes beginning in mid-January, which created a huge gap in their occupancies for the remainder of 2012. Costa's revised marketing strategy has been focused on catching up on bookings lost during this earlier part of the year. So it's not surprising that pricing has been deeply discounted. We do expect that when the year-over-year occupancy levels begin to normalize, Costa's cruise pricings for -- prices for 2013 should start to firm up.","Costa's revenue yields for 2012 are forecasted to be down in the mid-teens levels on a year-over-year basis, and we expect Costa's operating loss to be in the range of $100 million. While I'm on the subject of Costa, let me just make a -- take a minute to comment on some recent management changes at Costa.","As we indicated in a press release earlier this spring, we have made some new senior management appointments in our Costa Cruise group, which is comprised of Costa, AIDA and Ibero Cruises. For some time now, there was a plan in place for Pier Foschi, the CEO of the Costa group, to step back from the day-to-day running of the Costa group after he reached the age of 65. Pier reached 65 in late 2011, and there was a succession plan in place for Michael Thamm, the CEO of AIDA Cruises, to replace Pier. So beginning this July, Pier will step back from day-to-day responsibilities but will continue to serve as Chairman of the Costa board and a Managing Director of the Costa group, with responsibilities for government relations and strategic business initiatives. Pier will also stay on the board of Carnival Corporation.","Michael Thamm will become Chief Executive of the Costa group and a member of the Costa board and relocate to Genoa, Italy, which he's in the process of doing right now. Gianni Onorato will continue as the President of Costa. Michael Ungerer, who was Michael Thamm's #2 executive at AIDA, will take over as President of AIDA Cruises. Alfredo Serrano will continue as President of Ibero Cruises in Spain. Gianni, Michael and Alfredo will report to Michael Thamm. We're very pleased with the seamless management transition in our Europe cruise business and wish these executives continued success in the future.","Now turning to full year, the guidance for 2012. We have increased our non-GAAP earnings midpoint range guidance to $1.85 per share for the year, a $0.30 increase over our previous guidance. In broad terms, the $0.30 is comprised of a $0.40 improvement from lower fuel prices, offset by $0.07 of fuel derivatives cost and $0.03 for currency. The approximate $0.08 of forecasted lower revenue yields from the previous guidance is offset by about $0.08 of lower unit costs.","Based on our 2012 earnings guidance, forecasted operating cash flow is expected to be in the range of $3.2 billion. Net CapEx for the year is estimated at $1.9 billion. So after the dividend, that will leave us with approximately $500 million of free cash flow. 2013, our CapEx is currently estimated at $1.8 billion. So with operating cash flow expected to improve in 2013, there should be further increases in free cash flow come 2013.","Now turning to some of the color on the next 3 quarters. For the third quarter, capacity is expected to increase 2.9%. 3.4% in North America markets and 1.6% in EAA. At the current time, on a fleetwide basis, third quarter pricing and occupancy is lower than a year ago. Keep in mind, my comments on the third and fourth quarter exclude Costa, unless I indicate otherwise.","North American brand capacity in the third quarter is 38% in the Caribbean, slightly up from a year ago; 24% in Alaska, slightly higher than a year ago; and 25% in Europe, which is about the same as last year. North American brand pricing is lower than a year ago at slightly lower occupancies. Pricing for Caribbean itineraries is in line with a year ago, with pricing for both Alaska and European cruises lower versus last year. Occupancies for Caribbean and Alaska cruises are slightly lower versus last year, and occupancies for Euro cruises are lower than [indiscernible].","EAA brand capacity in the third quarter is 85% in European itineraries, up from 82% prior year. EAA brand pricing, this excludes Costa again for European and all other itineraries, is slightly lower than a year ago on slightly lower occupancies. U.K. brands pricing is higher than a year ago, and German pricing is slightly lower. For Ibero, our Spanish brand pricing is significantly lower than a year ago due to the significant softening of the Spanish economy, which I mentioned earlier. And also, as expected, Costa pricing in the third quarter was significantly lower than a year ago.","Third quarter guidance as we indicated in the press release is expected to be in the range of $1.42 to $1.46 per share versus $1.69 last year. Revenue yields are expected to be 3% to 4% lower versus last year, and that excludes Costa. And net cruise cost, excluding fuel, is expected to be slightly lower than last year. Changes in currency, net of lower fuel prices and derivatives, is expected to have a $0.03 -- a $0.03 negative effect on Q3's earnings.","Now turning to the fourth quarter. Fleetwide capacity is expected to be 3% to 4% higher than last year. 3.9% of that is for North American brands, 2.1% for EAA. Fleetwide pricing, excluding Costa, is slightly lower than a year ago on lower occupancies.","North American brands are 43% in the Caribbean, slightly higher than a year ago; 13% in Europe, about the same as last year. The balance is in various other itineraries. North American brand pricing is slightly lower than last year at lower occupancies. Caribbean pricing is higher than a year ago at flat occupancies. Europe pricing is lower versus last year at lower occupancies, and pricing for all other itineraries taken together is slightly higher than a year ago on lower occupancies.","EAA pricing in the fourth quarter, and this excludes Costa, is higher versus a year ago at lower occupancies. Pricing for Europe cruises, which represents 61% of EAA itineraries, are slightly higher on lower occupancies. For all other itineraries taken together, pricing is also higher on lower occupancies. Costa's pricing and occupancies are lower than a year ago.","Although pricing for Europe brands, excluding Costa, is higher at the present time because there are more cabins to fill versus last year, we expect pricing for EAA brands to decline as the quarter closes. On a fleetwide basis, similar to the third quarter, we're forecasting EAA revenue yields, excluding Costa, to be lower in the fourth quarter.","Now turning to the first quarter of 2013. My comments now include Costa's data for both years. Fleetwide capacity for the first quarter of 2013 is expected to be higher by 4%; 3.4% in North America, 4.9% in EAA. Fleetwide occupancies at the present time are lower than a year ago, with pricing at the present time slightly lower versus last year. Booking data for the first quarter of 2013 is in its early stages of development, so I wouldn't read too much into the data at this time.","For North American brands taken together, occupancies are flat year-over-year, with overall pricing currently lower. However, pricing is higher for most of the North American brands but lower in total, partly due to itinerary changes and the mix of the 4 brands' pricing.","I should mention that revenue yield comparisons for the first quarter of 2013 versus first quarter 2012 will be more challenging, given our stronger first quarter North American yield performance this past quarter in -- for the past first quarter in 2012. On a fleetwide basis, EAA brand occupancies are behind last year with higher pricing. Although still early, pricing on Costa's bookings for Q1 is also higher on a year-over-year basis at lower occupancies. But as I mentioned earlier, you shouldn't read too much into the information for the first quarter of 2013 as there's still a long way to go before the first quarter closes.","I should mention that a -- certainly, a positive development for 2013 is our expectations, at least currently, that lower fuel prices should provide a boost to earnings. Using our current fuel price of $620 per metric ton, we are currently estimating that lower fuel prices should benefit first half 2013 earnings per share by approximately $0.23.","So that's a little bit of, hopefully, a silver lining for going into 2013. Having said all that, Jennifer, I'm going to turn it back to you, and we'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Steven Kent from Goldman Sachs.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Could you just talk about -- when I'm looking at the way you're describing the balance of 2012, it sounds like the third quarter is going to be very weak, probably a little bit weaker than I would've expected or our team would've expected. But then the fourth quarter, using again your guidance, would suggest a very, very strong rebound in the fourth quarter to get to your full year numbers. Maybe I'm calculating that wrong, David, but I just want to make sure we're going that way. And if that's the case, what gives you the confidence on the fourth quarter that things are going to improve that dramatically from the second and third quarter?","Howard S. Frank","Steve, this is Howard. Actually, based on our current forecasting, we are estimating that Q3 and Q4 yields will be down in the same relative range of 3% to 4%. I said 3% to 4% down in Q3. My guess is it will be in that range in Q4 as well. So I'm not quite sure how you did your calculation, but that's the way our numbers work.","David Bernstein","And that's excluding Costa in both quarters, what Howard just mentioned.","Howard S. Frank","Yes.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, but I mean, if you -- for the third quarter, you're negative 6 to 7 for the whole company, right? For constant dollar? And then in the -- for the full year, you're negative 3 to 4. So something has to happen pretty dramatically...","David Bernstein","For the first quarter, it was up. The first quarter was up.","Howard S. Frank","The first quarter -- yes, yields were up, close to 3%, I think, on a constant dollar basis. What I suggest is go -- I think Beth can take you through it, but I think that's just the way the numbers work right now. But Q3 and Q4 basically look like they're going to be in line. There's always more -- the further out you go right now, it's always more difficult to predict. But I think Q3 is -- they're not -- while we're behind, there's still not that much inventory left to sell so...","Micky M. Arison","But it sounds like the assumption is wrong. So maybe after the call you can follow through with Beth and see where this -- yes.","David Bernstein","Yes. The fourth quarter is -- I mean, 2.9% up on constant dollars in the first quarter, 1.4% down in the second.","Beth Roberts","In the back half. It's in about [ph] the same range that we guided to in the third.","David Bernstein","Yes.","Howard S. Frank","And we're still in the same range -- we're still in the same range that we were in March 5.","Micky M. Arison","And we're going -- and by the way, these are only -- they're only modest changes, yield from -- in North America and Europe from previous -- I think it's important to put in context that when the incident occurred, it was the 2nd week of January, which is really the peak of the beginning of wave season. And when we reported, it was March 5, only a few weeks into that. So we estimated how deep the hole was and how much we'd have to incentivize to get that hole filled, and we missed by what appears to be a rounding error at this stage.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And on the close-in bookings, it sounds like you had to incentivize more as you got through Q2. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about the...","Howard S. Frank","Q2 held up pretty well.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I'm sorry, Q2 was better, but you're incentivizing more going to Q3.","Howard S. Frank","Correct.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So can you just talk about what kind of programs you're doing...","Howard S. Frank","I think it's pretty well understood that Europe has been challenging this year. I think everybody understood that, particularly for the North American brands, and that continues to be the case although -- we're well into it now, and it's pretty much full. So we pretty much know where we are.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Felicia Hendrix from Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just to -- I was actually going to yell that you should wake up, but it sounds like you're pretty awake, even though you gave us that disclaimer.","Micky M. Arison","The only thing is that I have -- I've got Queen like running in through my brain constantly.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So I think -- just to touch upon how you just answered the last question, if I remember correctly, normally, you're about 85% to 95% booked in the quarter that you're in. And then the next quarter out, you're about 55% to 75%. So just in terms of trying to think about your confidence in the guidance that you've provided, are you within those ranges?","Micky M. Arison","We are.","Beth Roberts","We are towards the lower end of the ranges, which I think -- the comments that we're behind the prior year. But still...","Howard S. Frank","But within the ranges.","Micky M. Arison","Yes.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So within the ranges at the lower end for both the third quarter and the fourth quarter.","Howard S. Frank","Correct.","Micky M. Arison","Correct.","Howard S. Frank","And the third quarter -- there's not that much left to sell. Even though we're behind maybe by a point or 2, there's not that much left to sell in Q3.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then obviously -- the fourth quarter's range is wider, and that kind of gets to my next question because what we've been hearing is from the -- all cruise lines, not just you, your competitors, you've been holding price for as long as you can and then discounting kind of lower -- the closer you get to the cruise. So when we think about that, when we think about the fourth quarter kind of being usually -- historically a more difficult quarter and, in light of the guidance that you gave, I mean, how confident are you in that?","Howard S. Frank","I'm confident in the guidance we gave right now. To be honest with you, I think we're going to -- the numbers aren't going to change dramatically, I think, for the second half of the year.","Micky M. Arison","I mean, we always know [ph]. Obviously, we only give guidance that we're confident in. But we never know -- you never know, we never know about hurricanes. We never know about the election season. I mean, there's a lot of things that can happen between now and then. But based on everything we know today, we're very confident.","Howard S. Frank","Yes.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And is it fair to assume that in your guidance, you kind of take into consideration these programs that you might be implementing to stimulate demand?","Howard S. Frank","Oh, they've already been implemented.","Micky M. Arison","They've been implemented, and our volumes are up substantially, as we said in the press release. So they've been implemented, and they're working. And they're working very significantly, obviously at Costa and well in the other brands as well.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Robin Farley from UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Actually, I don't have a question about the yield guidance. It basically sounds like it's kind of just narrowed, I guess, in the same range. It's narrowed within it. I did have a question on your free cash flow. You talked about next year having more free cash flow and less CapEx. Can you give us some color on your thoughts about share repurchase? Because I think you have $350 million authorization still outstanding and -- just some thoughts on that?","David Bernstein","Yes, we did resume the share repurchase during the last quarter, but we only wound up purchasing about 150,000 shares. Our share repurchase program is designed to be opportunistic, and we are being patient given the market volatility. And at the moment, it's actually $330 million that remains on the program.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, so -- but any sort of thoughts about -- just strategically whether you feel like -- looking ahead, free cash flow will be greater next year versus this year, but are you not comfortable sort of spending that in advance of getting it? Or I guess, just trying to think about what your expectations are over the next 12 months, understanding that day to day is opportunistic.","Micky M. Arison","I don't think we're comfortable preempting the board. That's a board decision, and I think our position is basically what it has historically been. We're going to return free cash flow to shareholders in a combination of ways: dividends and stock buyback, depending on what the board decides.","David Bernstein","And our free cash flow this year, given our new guidance, we would expect it to be in the range of $300 million to $400 million, using the midpoint of the guidance.","Micky M. Arison","And I think we explained -- I'm not sure if it was on the prior call, but we suspended the repurchasing for a while for -- but the reasons...","Howard S. Frank","Yes, to be sensitive...","Micky M. Arison","Sensitive to the issues regarding the incident. But as David said, we're now back and prepared to continue.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Rick Lyall from John W. Bristol.","Richard Ellis Lyall - John W. Bristol & Co., Inc.","Promotional activity in North America and Europe, it's not reflected in the ticket yield. Can you talk about both the depth and the impact of those promotions? And I've got a follow-up.","Micky M. Arison","The impact is what it is. It's what we anticipated back in March. It's just -- like I said, a rounding error because it's just a little bit more extensive than we thought. But overall, it's pretty much what we thought after missing such a significant part of wave season. So I'm not sure I understand what you mean by the depth in your question. But...","Richard Ellis Lyall - John W. Bristol & Co., Inc.","If you've had to offer more free flights, more onboard credits, et cetera, than you thought back then.","Micky M. Arison","Yes. Correct.","Howard S. Frank","Yes. What I said is we had to do more promotions, especially for the European programs, or where there was other programs where there was a major air component.","Micky M. Arison","The range we had was 2 to 4, and now it's 3 to 4. So again, it's a fraction of a point that we're talking about. So yes, we gave -- we did do a little bit more than we had anticipated in March. But again, in March, we're only a few weeks into the situation. So I think we did a pretty good job of guesstimating what would need to be done to fill that hole. But we didn't get it 100% right, but we still got it within the range. So...","Richard Ellis Lyall - John W. Bristol & Co., Inc.","Right. Okay. And then I've got a question about the fuel hedging. So when I look at the schedule in the release out through '14 to '15, you're kind of holding in the 70 to 80 floor range, and you're keeping the upper range 125, 130. How do you think about migrating the band? Are you going to march the band down? Or are you going to kind of consistently stay in the 80 to 125, 130 range?","Micky M. Arison","It depends what the band is at the time that we meet. I mean, we meet on a regular basis and discuss this. Again, we look at this -- or I look at this anyway as insurance. It was, at the time, cheap insurance. It's now become a little bit more expensive insurance. But that's what it is. It's insurance, and we keep looking at -- we meet on this on a regular basis, and if opportunistically we can get lower bands, we obviously would take advantage of that at the time.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Steven Wieczynski from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Steven M. Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","One of the brands you guys haven't talked about is AIDA, and I know that was a brand that had been -- seen some pressure from the Costa event. So could you just update us on what you're seeing there?","Howard S. Frank","Yes. I mean, AIDA's -- there was that period, I think, subsequent to mid-January, where business was quite soft. But their business has come back quite nicely. And as I mentioned, their yields are slightly down. I'm not -- what I think -- I don't think they're dramatically different than when we -- how we originally budgeted the year for AIDA. So they're holding quite nicely, and they picked up a lot of booking momentum. It took a while to come back, but it's a very, very powerful brand in the German-speaking markets, and it's doing quite well. It just -- it seems to be -- has normalized quite nicely.","Micky M. Arison","They had a naming ceremony in Hamburg for their new ship, and to give you a sense of the power -- the viewership on the river were -- was 1.4 million people. Actually, more people showed up to see the naming ceremony of that ship than the Diamond Jubilee, [indiscernible] a pretty powerful brand.","Steven M. Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then the second question, I guess, will be a little bit more for David on the expense side. I mean, the expense control seems to be -- you guys seem to be doing a phenomenal job there. I guess in the other expense category, I mean, that was down significantly, even if you exclude, I guess, the $34 million there from the litigation and the insurance proceeds. So what was being pushed out of that line item?","David Bernstein","You also have some cost related to the Costa Concordia incident -- oh, you're talking about the second quarter...","Howard S. Frank","[indiscernible].","David Bernstein","Yes, the second quarter, the 494 versus the 556?","Steven M. Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Right.","David Bernstein","Yes, I'll have to get -- I don't have the detail with me here. I'll have to -- we'll get back to you on that.","Beth Roberts","We'll take a look.","David Bernstein","I don't [indiscernible].","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Assia Georgieva from Infiniti Research.","Assia Georgieva","I had a couple of quick questions. First of all, Costa's second quarter occupancy was probably up significantly after the end of March pricing program. How did it compare relative to your expectations? Could you give us -- let's say, if it was a 10% change in occupancy or higher?","Micky M. Arison","Relative to which expectations?","Assia Georgieva","Your March 5 expectation.","Micky M. Arison","The expectation changes every week.","Howard S. Frank","You're talking about how we [indiscernible] the guidance of March?","Micky M. Arison","In March, we really were unsure whether we could move occupancy at all. And we discussed that a lot, that we were going to do continuous surveys to see whether -- if we put stimulus in the market, if it would work. We didn't want to put pricing stimulus just to put it in there without having the response. And what we found is, relatively quickly, that with pricing stimulus, we could generate significant demand because of the strength of the brand in its key markets. And so the occupancy levels versus where we thought we were in March are significantly higher, but the pricing offset virtually all of that. But we're far more pleased with this kind of result than what we were talking about in March, because it is accelerating, in my mind and I think the mind of management, the comeback of the brand, to have full ships or relatively close to full ships, with happy passengers coming back, enjoying the brand and saying what a wonderful time they had. It generates a whole different ambience onboard, creates onboard revenue. There's lots and lots of positive elements of having higher occupancies than we had anticipated. So compared to March, the occupancies are significantly better. The response is significantly better to the incentives that were put in place than we thought in March.","Assia Georgieva","And still you expect the loss to be in the $100 million range, which was the original expectation. So it's pretty much a trade-off between price and occupancy at this point?","Micky M. Arison","Correct, correct.","Howard S. Frank","Yes.","Assia Georgieva","Okay, okay. My second question. In the past, it seems that onboard spend has been almost a leading indicator to higher ticket pricing. Do you think we may be seeing some of that, especially on the onboard part?","David Bernstein","Well, we are seeing some increases in onboard. We were very pleased. In fact, we took the guidance up almost 1 point on onboard from March to the June guidance. So the trend is very favorable, and I hope it is a leading indicator.","Howard S. Frank","It's too early to say. But I don't know that we've ever necessarily seen it that way. It certainly indicates that consumer spend is up, but there are a lot of elements to that 1% improvement.","Micky M. Arison","I mean, I do think that all of our brands have put a lot greater emphasis on being creative on ways, whether it's Fun Ship 2.0 or other programs out there, that will generate more onboard revenue. So it's really hard to say whether -- how much of it is -- if you talk to the marketing, the onboard marketing guys, they'll tell you it's all them. So it's hard to tell how much is that and how much is just consumers willing to spend more.","Operator","Our next question is from Tim Conder from Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","If you could -- we could just stay on the onboard topic here, it sounded like, again, from your preamble comments, that, that was -- remains skewed to the North American brands. But also, Micky, you alluded to, in part of your answer there, that you're seeing that nice recovery in Costa. Just a little bit more color, I would guess, on the rest of the European brands as it relates to onboard?","David Bernstein","Yes, well the onboard is actually -- I said it was flat on the European brands, despite the lower occupancy. So you're actually seeing some additional spending on a per diem basis. So the onboard spend per person is going up. It was just we had a couple of points less occupancy on the brand. So flat on a yield basis.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just any color, commentary. We've touched on North America. We've touched on Europe. But given a little bit of weakening in the Australian economy, a little bit, and then just overall related to Asia, what are you seeing out of Asia, Australia collectively?","Howard S. Frank","I think they're really very different markets. I think in Australia we're seeing -- we are being challenged. There's a lot more capacity coming into the Australian market, including our own capacity. So yields are -- on a year-over-year basis, pricing has been down. But it's still a very, very profitable market for us, and our pricing seems to be -- we're able to get a whole lot of better [ph] pricing with our brands in Australia than we see our competitors getting right now. So we're very pleased with Australia. And = it's likely that we may be through the worst part of it in terms of the additional capacity. Next year, Carnival brings a ship down to Australia, and it's performing quite nicely right now. So we're very pleased with Australia. In Asia, it's a pretty positive situation. We moved the larger ship into the China market, the Costa Victoria, and it's doing quite well. And we expected that we would be breakeven this year in Asia, or maybe make a little bit of positive cash flow, and that looks like it's going to be the case so far. So bookings -- pricing in Asia or in Southeast Asia or in China is quite good right now.","Micky M. Arison","And we're adding another 2,000-passenger ship in Costa Atlantica.","Howard S. Frank","Yes. As a result of that. Mickey's right on. Next -- beginning next spring, we're bringing a second Costa ship to Asia, the Costa Atlantica. The situation is really developing nicely.","Micky M. Arison","And we're entering the Japanese market with Princess. So we're aggressively starting to size up in Asia, and we're very, very, very optimistic that we're starting to see that opportunity come to fruition.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And gentlemen, if I may, if you could just round out that whole discussion then with color, a little color on South America? And Micky, I'll offer my congratulations, too.","Howard S. Frank","Well, South America business for us is mostly -- mostly begins this coming winter, but it's shaping up nicely. As I mentioned, Costa's pricing at this point for Q1 is up year-over-year. A large -- a good part of their itinerary is -- they have 4 ships in South America this winter, and so those ships are doing nicely. Ibero, to be honest with you, I don't -- I'll get back and I -- I don't know the Ibero pricing in South America for this winter yet.","Micky M. Arison","It\u2019s still early. Still early, because South America season is basically mid-December to mid-March, so it's a very short season. It\u2019s still quite early. But early indications are positive.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I just wanted to go through the yield guidance for the rest of the year. I guess, different than Steve, I was a little surprised that there wasn't going to be an improvement, perhaps in the fourth quarter, sequentially on yields. And I know it's a less predictable quarter, but I would've thought, with the timing of the Concordia incident, kind of the booking curves there impacting the summer as well as the preponderance of ships in the Mediterranean in the summer, that maybe you\u2019d get some release as you move more towards the Caribbean and so on as we moved into the fall. If you could help us think about if you're seeing just general signs of more economic weakness that may be exacerbating some of the other ancillary effects on the business.","Howard S. Frank","Sharon, the way the demand profiles work is your Q3, your summer quarter, is your quarter of your strongest demand in your business. And so when you get into Q4, it's a little bit more of a struggle in terms of demand. Ships are coming back from Europe or coming through -- going back from Alaska. So it's always -- fourth quarter is always more of a challenge in terms of demand stimulation, and all we're saying right now is that Q4 will be like Q3 in terms of yields.","Beth Roberts","In terms of the capacity mix, it's not as different as you would think. The Caribbean is about 24% of our exposure in the third quarter as opposed to 28% in the fourth. And the Med is actually 25% in the third quarter, going up to 29% in the fourth. So we do have a heavy Med exposure in the fourth quarter. Europe, the northern part of Europe, is a little less. 25% going down to 7%.","Howard S. Frank","And that includes Costa's...","Beth Roberts","That\u2019s all-in [ph].","Micky M. Arison","What you have to remember is our fourth quarter includes September. September through October is still very heavy Med period, but you've lost the Baltic, which is your highest-yielding European business because it's the end of the season, and those ships move back into the Mediterranean. So your capacity in the Mediterranean for half the fourth quarter is actually higher, as Beth pointed out.","David Bernstein","And getting back to Steve's question on other ship operating expenses, the 2 reasons for the decline year-over-year in the second quarter, one was dry dock. We had significantly less dry-dock days in the second quarter this year than the prior year. One of the things we mentioned was, in the first quarter call, we had significantly more dry-dock days in the first quarter of 2012 than '11. So that was just a seasonality on dry dock. And the other thing was currency. The euro was 1.43 last year in the second quarter on average. And this year, it was 1.31. So currency has driven the number down as well.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Greg Badishkanian from Citigroup.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","First question is just on European source business and maybe getting a little bit of color by geography. I know you mentioned Spain was soft, U.K. and Germany held up. So I'm just wondering, did U.K. and Germany actually get incrementally better over the last 7 weeks? And then did any other major market stand out as maybe bucking the trend one way or the other?","Micky M. Arison","The U.K. wasn't really impacted as much as anywhere else. I mean, the U.K. held up pretty well throughout the year, throughout the process. Germany had to have bounced back.","Howard S. Frank","Germany bounced back.","Micky M. Arison","Yes. It had to have bounced back. We're hesitant on Italy and France, only because Costa is our primary brand in those markets. Obviously, the volumes now are very, very strong at significantly lower prices. So the one -- the areas that we're very clear on is that Spain is terrible, U.K. has been fine and Germany has bounced back and, I think, is fine.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And second question, just on the new versus the seasoned cruiser, any change in trend there over the last month or two?","Micky M. Arison","Yes. I think we said at the time of the incident that it's likely that first-time cruisers would be more impacted than experienced cruisers as experienced cruisers understand both the value and the safety of the product, while first-timers may not. At the time of our March call, we said that while it's kind of intuitive that, that may happen, we have no empirical evidence that it did happen. I can say now that we have empirical evidence that it did happen and that first-time cruisers did decline and were impacted. Our surveys clearly show that they were impacted by the events. And hopefully, the further we get away from those events, the more likely it will -- they will bounce back.","David Bernstein","We also saw, after the global financial crisis and we reduced prices, we also saw an uptick in repeat passengers as well at that time. As Micky said, the people saw the value much quicker and jumped on the bandwagon and started booking.","Micky M. Arison","Right. But we see it in actual -- we now see it in actual bookings, and we now see it in actual surveys that demand from first-time cruisers has declined since the incident. We're hopeful, as we get further along, that, that will start to rebound.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. So maybe next year, a little bit easier comparisons from the Concordia when you lap that, right?","Micky M. Arison","Hopefully.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jamie Katz from Morningstar.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I have a question actually on the booking curve. And can you guys talk a little bit about how many people are booking closer in versus further out? And has that shortened even more this summer than you guys had anticipated? And then the second question is, well, Costa has done obviously very well over the last few weeks. Can you elaborate a little bit more on the pricing that you've sacrificed to get there?","Micky M. Arison","Well, as we've said, we basically gave up pricing for occupancy, and it was awash. So on the booking curve, it's a function -- it's purely a function of the hole that was created during wave and the need to fill that hole, which meant that there was a requirement by the brands for closer-in business. So I don't know if that is a booking curve issue or an issue that you had this hole that was created, starting in the 2nd week in January. I mean -- so it's a very unique set of circumstances that -- we really haven't experienced before anything quite like it. And I don't see any reason why, over time, and I mean relatively short time, as we catch up on occupancy, and we're getting there, that the booking curve won't go back to where it was traditionally. But we needed to be more close in because we have some space to sell.","David Bernstein","I think we're encouraged by the fact that we're still within historical ranges despite all the -- the event and the incidences that occurred.","Micky M. Arison","Good point.","David Bernstein","And as to the Costa, what they gave up on pricing, they're selling to 20% to 30% below the prior year in order to get the volumes and the occupancy.","Howard S. Frank","I think we indicated for the full year we'd be down in the mid-teens, right? On a yield basis?","Beth Roberts","Yes.","David Bernstein","Correct.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Lena Thakkar from HSBC.","Lena Thakkar - HSBC, Research Division","A couple of quick questions. Firstly, on Costa. Hypothetically speaking, if you were to get back yields and occupancy rates in line with pre the incident, where would that negative $100 million profit go to in 2013 do you think, bearing in mind all the capacity changes? And then the second -- sure, go ahead.","Howard S. Frank","Let me -- before you ask the second question. I think there's an underlying assumption that we'd get it all back in 1 year, which I don't think is, to be honest with you, is realistic. What I would say is this: that we forecasted that the swing in Costa's earnings for this year is at about $500 million dollars.","Beth Roberts","And about $100 million of that was the loss of the ship itself, which is not coming back.","Howard S. Frank","Right.","Micky M. Arison","Right. It's not coming back.","Howard S. Frank","So I wouldn't want to get into a hypothetical about if you get back all your revenue yield losses in 2013, what it would look like. I think that, that could be -- I don't want to mislead anybody, because I don't think that's going to happen. It's going to take a couple of years for this to come back.","Micky M. Arison","Yes. And remember also, we have taken both the Concordia and the Allegra out of Costa's, and they sold the Marina. So compared to where we were a year ago, looking forward, they are 3 ships -- they're down 3 ships. So clearly, their earnings can't be what it would have been had they had those 3 ships.","Lena Thakkar - HSBC, Research Division","Yes. No, and that's sort of what I was getting at, I guess, even if it did take 2 or 3 years, where is the new base, I guess. Okay. And then just on the second question, slightly -- on a slightly different topic in terms of direct bookings. I was just wondering where you are in terms of direct bookings versus third party across the fleet and where aspirations are in that department.","David Bernstein","Yes. Direct bookings in last year were 19% of our total business. That has moved up year-over-year. We don't have any specific aspirations. I do expect the number will continue to creep up over time.","Howard S. Frank","As people become more and more comfortable booking directly, it's easier for them to just do the bookings. It's such a natural occurrence almost.","David Bernstein","With the passing of generations and the improvement of technology, we would expect it to creep up.","Lena Thakkar - HSBC, Research Division","And do you have any plans at all to reduce commission rates, like you did in the U.K., elsewhere?","Micky M. Arison","Well, first of all, the answer to that is no. But I think it's important to understand that we don't believe we've effectively reduced commission rates from the standpoint of the travel agencies' community, because there was so significant discounting and rebating going on, that their in-pocket commission was far less than what they have now. And so I think the clear indication, based on what we've said about the U.K. market and how it has held up through this whole period, is that our team in the U.K. made a very, very good decision. Travel agents, in effect, are getting, overall, better compensated, because they are not rebating, and pricing stability has been brought to the marketplace. So I think it was an overall strong decision for the U.K., but it was a unique issue in the U.K. that doesn't really exist quite the same anywhere else. So no, there's no plans to reduce compensation. It's still the North American, and I should say Italy, France, Germany. The travel agency distribution is still a very, very critical part of our overall distribution strategy. They've been supportive of us, and we continue to be supportive of them.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Leibowitz from Horizon Kinetics.","David Leibowitz - Horizon Kinetics LLC","Two quick questions. One, with the drop in the price of fuel, do you still have surcharges in Europe?","David Bernstein","Yes, there are currently surcharges on a couple of the European brands in Germany and the U.K., yes. Fuel supplements.","David Leibowitz - Horizon Kinetics LLC","And secondly, when the dividend was reinstituted, the comment was we had a lot of catching up to do. Obviously, this year, we couldn't do any catching up. On a priority list, and at least 2 members of the board are on the call right now, the board would rather do catch up or buyback?","Howard S. Frank","I'm not quite sure what you mean by catch up.","Micky M. Arison","Yes, I don't think we use the word -- term catch up. And...","David Leibowitz - Horizon Kinetics LLC","I apologize for the wrong term.","Micky M. Arison","Yes, we generally use that on hamburgers.","David Leibowitz - Horizon Kinetics LLC","Not in Brooklyn, we don\u2019t.","Micky M. Arison","Brooklyn, we put the mustard on the hotdog. All I can say is that -- we said that the free cash flow will be distributed to shareholders. Clearly, we have board members who prefer dividends. Remember, we have a mixture of board members who are more U.K.-centric, and we have board members who are more U.S.-centric. So we have both views. We have views that are aggressive toward buyback, and we have views that are aggressive toward dividend, and we try to find a happy balance. And we will continue to try to do that.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Kevin Milota from JPMorgan.","Kevin Milota - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Was hoping you could give us a sense for the revitalized marketing effort and how big of a driver that was behind what you've seen over the last 7 weeks in terms of the increased bookings that you've seen. And also, secondly, on the Costa brand strategy, from the first quarter, it sounded like you were trying to hold price at the mercy of occupancy levels. Just wondering how -- shortly thereafter, the May -- or excuse me, March 5 call, you effectively flipped that strategy to take occupancy at the mercy of price.","Howard S. Frank","I mean, Kevin, in terms of the marketing efforts, I indicated that -- how we were booking over the last 7 weeks. And the volumes are up significantly during this period. So clearly, the marketing -- I'm talking broadly now. I'm not just talking about one particular brand. So the marketing efforts have worked to recapture some of the lost business, albeit it's been at lower prices than we would've liked.","Micky M. Arison","But let me add that we haven't increased the marketing budgets of any of our brands beyond Costa. Costa right now is pumping a lot of marketing dollars, again, not just to create volume but to rebuild the brand and so on. So other than Costa, all the others are working within what we would have anticipated as their normal marketing budgets at the beginning of the year.","Howard S. Frank","Yes. And on the Costa brand strategy, I think you're right. I think, initially, the thinking was, based on advice they were getting from marketing consultants in Europe, was that to -- and it was very early in the process, that the strategy would be just to maintain price and that you -- regards to how you price the product would be difficult to start to generate a lot of bookings. I think that changed over time as they got further and further away from the incident. And the marketing people came back and said, no, no, no, let's -- after they did a lot of market tests and decided that let's go ahead and start to use price and see if we can stimulate the market and regenerate the bookings, and that happened.","Micky M. Arison","And I think we said that on the March 5 call. We said that right now, it appears from the surveys we've done, from the marketing consultant information we're getting, that price stimulus would not work because of the extent of the event but that we would continue to do weekly surveys to judge if that was moving in a different direction and, at the point that we were comfortable, based on those surveys, that we can stimulate demand and we can get Costa back into the kind of occupancies it traditionally had, that we would make that move. And a few weeks later -- I mean, they stayed out of the market completely for, I don't know, 8 weeks?","David Bernstein","Last week in March, first week in April.","Beth Roberts","[indiscernible] the earnings.","Micky M. Arison","From the second week of January to the last week in March, they totally stayed out of the marketplace. And beginning of April, when we felt comfortable that the market perception were clearly that Costa brand is a great vacation value, one that is highly thought of in their key markets and those numbers stabilized to pre-incident level, we went heavy, and it worked.","David Bernstein","And the advertising they were doing was price-driven. They had a very simple message. I think, if I remember correctly, it was like EUR 75 per person per day for May, EUR 85 for June, EUR 95 for July, and that drove bookings.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jamie Rollo from Morgan Stanley.","Jamie Rollo - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just one question, please. It's really a question on the comps, on the yield comps in 2013. You sort of referred to this. But just thinking about it, H1 this year, your yields were up around 1%. In the second half, you're guiding to down about 7 including Costa and, as you say, Q4 showing no improvements over Q3. So I'm just wondering whether your comment is really asking us to think about H1 yields next year to maybe re-base, to sort of drop mid-single digits? Or are things recovering fast enough to sort of hold them flat next year?","Howard S. Frank","I think it's too early to say. I think in Q1, I think our yields were up close to 3% on an overall basis for the first quarter of 2012. So what I said is that comps would be more challenging. And also, as you roll out of these -- eventually, as you roll out of these price incentives, you're still booking business in Q1 that will probably have some impact of some of this lower pricing in Q1. But so far, if you look at the overall pricing picture, although I think we're still behind on occupancies in Europe, the pricing picture so far was positive in Europe, including Costa. So I think a lot depends on how quickly the bookings will come back and how quickly we get the volumes back to backfill the space that we lost.","Micky M. Arison","And you also have to keep in mind, despite where we are deployment-wise in Q3 and 4, Q1 deployment is totally different. And so that has a huge impact on this as well. I mean, like we said, we're very happy in the Med in Q4 -- Q3 and 4, but we're clearly not in Q1. Our Med is what percentage?","Beth Roberts","5% in Q1.","Micky M. Arison","Yes, it goes from 28% in Q4 to 5% in Q1. So that has a major impact, too, Jamie.","Beth Roberts","We had 50% in the Caribbean, and then there's a big component in Brazil, the Latin Americas.","Jamie Rollo - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So you're not guiding to any yields decline in Q1 at this stage then?","Micky M. Arison","We're not guiding anything.","Howard S. Frank","We're not doing any guidance.

Bristol & Co.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Carnival Corporation's Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, June 24, 2014.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation LLC. Please go ahead, sir.","Arnold W. Donald","Hello, everyone. This is Arnold Donald, and with me today is David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; Beth Roberts, Vice President of Investor Relations; and Mickey Arison, our Chairman.","I'll start with a few comments, and then I'll hand it over to David to review in more depth the quarter results and some looks ahead.","So, first of all, it feels like we've turned a bit of a corner. We achieved not only better than expected results for the second quarter, but we also achieved year-over-year earnings growth. And we're working very hard to build on our current momentum.","Our progress is a credit to the outstanding efforts of our 120,000 shipboard and shore side team members who strive to create exceptional vacation experiences each and every day for our 10 million plus guests around the globe.","We were pleased to see our European brands\u2019 revenue yields turn positive in the second quarter and particularly encouraged by the favorable pricing trends emerging not only in Europe, but in North America, as well.","We're making every effort to maintain pricing integrity, despite aggressive price moves by other cruise lines, even if it means giving up a little more occupancy than we had planned, as was the case, for example, in our summer Caribbean deployment.","We believe this strategy can have positive implications next year and particularly, as we have already rebalanced our deployment for 2015.","So, next year, we expect flat capacity in Europe and Alaska for our brands and a slight reduction in Caribbean deployment, with a notable double-digit decline in the third quarter. And we hope that will make for a better balance between supply and demand in our more established markets in both North America and in Europe.","As we had anticipated, our capacity growth in both Asia and Australia is up mid to high teens next year, albeit off a very small base, as we continue to expand our global footprint.","We were the first major cruise company to enter China. In fact, we have home ported in China now for over eight years and we can feel the momentum building.","During the quarter, we announced deploying a fourth ship to serve the fast growing China market next year. And in addition, we also announced the transfer of two smaller Holland America ships to support the growth of the P&O Australia brand.","And we also made significant progress on a number of strategic initiatives this quarter which we expect will improve our operating performance going forward, beginning with our recent decision to rationalize our brand portfolio by absorbing the smaller Ibero Cruises brand in Spain into the Costa brand by the end of the year.","Now that Costa has had a leading presence in Spain for many years and is already well-established there. We believe the Costa brand can serve our Spanish guests, exceeding their cruise vacations expectations while improving efficiency for our company.","Now one of Ibero's two ships, the Grand Celebration, will be transferred to the Costa fleet and become the Costa Celebration. The remaining Ibero ship will leave the fleet later this year. This is in keeping with our ongoing strategy to optimize our fleet by selling or disposing of older, less profitable vessels.","This brings the total to five ships which we have sold or will leave the fleet in 2014 and 2015, including three smaller seaborne ships and one Costa ship. Both brands have one larger, more efficient ship expected to be delivered by 2016, which will replace that capacity and generate higher returns.","Now while these new ships will result in a small net addition of capacity, their real advantage is a tremendous increase in efficiency, including offering higher yielding balcony cabins, more than 20% lower unit costs, and greater than 40% fuel efficiency while at the same time enhancing the guest experience.","As you know, optimizing our fleet is an ongoing process and we have a number of ships remaining in the fleet that we expect to replace with newer, larger, more fuel-efficient vessels over time, as we continue to advance our fleet.","We remain focused on elevating our customer experience through both new ships entering service like the Regal Princess which was introduced this quarter, as well as the new product initiatives being rolled out across the existing fleet. For example, Carnival Cruise Lines launched the first of its Carnival LIVE Concert Series this past quarter with a number of sold out performances.","In fact, just last week Jennifer Hudson performed sold out shows onboard two of our ships in Cozumel. We have received great feedback on the guest experience which should result in even higher guest satisfaction scores and we have sold thousands of tickets to-date for this Concert Series.","Given the positive response, we have already begun working on the 2015 program. In March, we also officially launched our Seuss at Sea program on Carnival Splendor, and in May, debut a new Marine-Themed Children's Program Carnival's Camp Ocean onboard Carnival Freedom.","Both programs are extremely popular with our family segment. It will be rolled out fleet-wide across the Carnival brand. And these are just a few examples of new product development that will better attract and serve our differing target customer psychographics across our portfolio of leading brands.","At the same time, increasing our fuel efficiency fleet-wide continues to be a cornerstone of our strategy to improve returns. We remain on track in our efforts to reduce fuel consumption by 25% in 2014 compared to 2007.","Moreover, we have rolled out our leading edged scrubber technology on a dozen more vessels so far this year in order to mitigate the higher cost of fuel under the pending eco requirements.","We have made progress on a number of other initiatives to leverage our scale as well. Those are still in early stages, and we expect we will be in a position to share more down the road.","These initiatives have been met with strong enthusiasm and a sense of renewed energy by our teams around the world. However, they will take some time and, of course, a lot of effort to fully implement.","On the revenue side, our brand segmentation study is well underway. And we are conducting conversations with thousands of consumers, both cruisers and non-cruisers. And we have reviewed 30 million guest records to understand what our guests love about our brand and what we can do to increase loyalty across our portfolio. We believe it to be the largest ever quantitative market research study of the cruise and leisure market.","At the same time, we are conducting a global review of our revenue management systems, processes and strategies. We have commissioned a team of leading revenue management experts who have already begun visiting our major brands to identify best practices and new opportunities to improve our revenue management tools and stochastic modeling. We believe these are opportunities that will allow us to capture higher yields.","On the cost side, our group travel sourcing initiative is well underway. We recently issued a global RFP to the broad network of airlines we use around the world. We are among the largest air travel buyers in the world and have historically taken a regional view for these relationships.","Now, we will take a global view. Although, it\u2019s premature to quantify the impact, we expect to begin to see the benefits as early as next year. And we will communicate to you as we achieve the major milestones.","We are also in the process of issuing RFPs for global sourcing of our largest food products in regions of common deployment and that is beyond the major regions where we are already leveraging our size. We are now focused on capitalizing on our scale in Australia and parts of Europe.","As I indicated in the press release, I believe we are experiencing an inflection point for our company. I am excited about the future and we are fully committed to moving forward at an aggressive pace as we simultaneously execute a number of initiatives to improve return on invested capital over time.","I would now like to turn it over to David Bernstein for some comments. And after his, we will take Q&A. David?","David Bernstein","Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this conference call will be forward-looking. I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release. Also, all of my references to revenue and cost metrics will be in local currency as this is a much more meaningful measure of our business trends.","I will start today with a summary of our second quarter results and then get into more detail on, first, our overall positive booking status; second, our yield expectations for the remainder of the year; and third, our booking patterns by program or deployment for each of our two major business segments, the North American Brands and the European, Australia, and Asia Brands, known as our EAA Brands. I will then finish up with an update on our improved full year 2014 June guidance.","Our non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $80 million. I'm pleased to report that our second quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.10 above the midpoint of our March guidance and that was driven mainly by two things.","First, better than expected net revenue yields at most of our brands worth $0.04 which was split between net ticket and net onboard and other yields. And second, lower than expected net cruise cost without fuel which was also worth $0.04 and that was due to lower than expected occupancy as well as the timing of certain expenses between the quarters.","Now, let's turn the second quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 5%. The North American brands were up 8%, while the EAA brands were flat. Our total net revenue yields in the second quarter declined just over 2%.","So, let's break apart the two components of net revenue yields. Net ticket yields declined almost 4% and that was driven by our North American brands which were down over 7% as anticipated in our March guidance. This was due to the promotional pricing environment in the Caribbean resulting from the large increase in industry capacity.","However, our EAA brands were up over 2% and that was driven by better than expected improvement in our Continental European brands. Net onboard and other yields increased over 2% despite the lower occupancy with increases on both sides of the Atlantic.","Net cruise costs per available lower berth days, excluding fuel, was up just over 1% and that was driven by higher advertising spend as we invested to accelerate the recovery of ticket prices and higher dry dock costs.","As result of our ongoing efforts to reduce fuel consumption, I am happy to report that our consumption per ALBD declined 6% this quarter and saved us $0.04 versus the prior year.","In summary, our second quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.03 higher than the prior year. It was driven by improved fuel consumption, lower fuel prices and favorable exchange rates, all of which was partially offset by lower net revenue yields and slightly higher net cruise cost without fuel.","Now, looking at the fine print for our recent booking trends and yield expectations for the remainder of 2014. We are excited that during the second quarter our overall booking curve continued to lengthen, a trend which began during the first quarter and was highlighted on our last conference call. We are pleased with the overall new direction and anticipate that this trend will continue.","At this point cumulative fleet-wide booking for the remainder of the year are slightly ahead at higher prices. However, the pattern is different for each of the two major business segments.","Our EAA brands are significantly ahead on occupancy with flat prices which bodes well for pricing on the remaining inventory. The North American brands are ahead on price, but are still behind on occupancy as a result of the large increase in industry capacity in the Caribbean.","Given these booking trends, we expect yields for the third quarter to be flat to down slightly compared to the prior year. Our EAA brand yields, which turned positive in the second quarter compared to the prior year, are doing well and are forecasted to be positive for the remainder of the year. However, we don\u2019t expect our North American brands yields to turn positive compared to the prior year until fourth quarter.","As we discussed on the prior calls, for the better part of the last year, Carnival Cruise Lines has been following a new revenue management tactic, holding price and giving up a few percentage points of occupancy.","While we mentioned this before that it has benefited us over the last few quarters, it's still a technique that we are analyzing. In the interim, Carnival has continued with this approach and as a result, we are forecasting slightly lower occupancies for the third quarter.","Remember that yield is a combination of price and occupancy. It's the lower occupancy that's causing our yields to be lower for our North American brands and the company in the third quarter. However, ticket prices are forecasted to be higher, which is an encouraging sign.","For the full year, we're expecting net revenue yields to be down slightly, which is essentially the same as our March guidance. We exceeded our second quarter yield guidance and did roll the $0.04 benefit into the year. However, $0.04 is only a quarter of a percentage point for the full year.","Overall, the back half of the year, our forecast has not changed, with a slight improvement in the fourth quarter offsetting the lower occupancy in the third quarter.","While our net revenue yield guidance has a number of moving parts, I'm pleased to say that the overall general direction is slightly positive towards higher yields.","Now, looking at the booking patterns by program or deployment for each of the two major business segments for the remainder of the year. First, for our North American brand, I'll walk you through the Caribbean, Alaska, and their seasonal European program.","The Caribbean is behind on occupancy, but ahead on price and represents almost 44% of the remainder of the year for the North American brand. Booking volumes during the last quarter have been good. They've been higher than the prior year, albeit at promotional rates.","Alaska is nicely ahead on both price and occupancy, which bodes well for the remaining inventory. The seasonal European program for our North American brands is strong and we're well ahead on both price and occupancy.","For our EAA brands, the year-round European program, which represents almost 80% of the EAA brands' capacity for the remainder of the year, is significantly ahead on occupancy, with flat pricing. Recent booking volumes are meeting expectations at nicely higher prices.","Switching to costs. Our full year cost guidance has improved slightly from our March guidance, as we now expect net cruise costs, excluding fuel, for ALBD to be flat to up slightly.","The improvement comes from lower occupancy and greater collaboration amongst our brands. We feel good about the small wins to-date and the greater collaboration bears fruit, and we look forward to bigger wins. Of course, the bigger wins generally take more time to realize.","Putting all these factors together, our 2014 non-GAAP EPS guidance is $1.60 to $1.75 per share with a midpoint that is higher than our previous guidance.","Essentially, we've flowed through the better than expected second quarter revenue yields worth $0.04, the improved cost guidance worth $0.06, and improved fuel consumption and other items worth $0.04, all of which was partially offset by higher fuel prices and unfavorable currency movements worth $0.06.","At this point, I'll turn the call back over to Arnold.","Arnold W. Donald","Thank you, David. And we'll open up, Melody, to Q&A, please? Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions)","And our first question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Robin Farley - UBS","Great. Thanks. I wanted to ask about Q3, because you had such a strong result in Q2 versus your expectations. And I think the general expectation had been that your yields would start to be positive in Q3, even with the weak Caribbean, since Caribbean's only, I think, about 27% of your capacity in Q3. And given the strength in Europe and Alaska, maybe it's surprising that the 73% or the rest of the fleet isn't enough to get Q3 into positive territory.","So, I wonder if you could give us a little bit more color on what the degree, if Europe is up double-digits that is kind of implying very large double-digit declines in Q3 in the Caribbean, on top of what had already been a tough Caribbean season last year for you. So, I wonder if you could give a little more color around that.","David Bernstein","Sure. Well, to start with, we had indicated that we thought our yields would be slightly positive in the third quarter last time. So, all we're talking about is a very small movement from a tad positive to slightly negative at this point.","And it was just -- there was a more promotional environment in the Caribbean than we had anticipated. And as a result, Carnival Cruise Lines decided to hold price and give up the occupancy and it's the lower occupancy that's driving the yield down.","As I indicated in my notes, the ticket prices are moving in a positive direction overall. So, we were very pleased with that, but it's the lower occupancy. And it's a couple of points of occupancy overall that we're expecting lower from this year -- from last year to this year, which is driving the price down - the yield down, sorry.","Robin Farley - UBS","Is it fair to say that European yields are up double-digit in Q3 and Alaska up at least high single-digit? Just to try to get a sense of the huge variance here versus the Caribbean.","David Bernstein","Yeah. We didn't indicate that Europe was up double-digits. What we had indicated was that bookings and pricing are well ahead and very strong and Europe was doing very well for our North American brand.","Alaska, the same thing and that the EAA brands were moving in a positive direction and we were expecting single-digit increases in all the categories.","Robin Farley - UBS","And then I guess just lastly in Q4, which you're expecting to be positive now, but just thinking about some of the same issues continuing into Q4 and since there's a slightly higher concentration of Caribbean in Q4 versus Q3, I guess just trying to get a sense of your conviction level.","There's probably some late fall Caribbean that is still unbooked. And how do you get comfortable that Q4 will absolutely bring the full year -- to your full year guidance really all being carried by Q4?","David Bernstein","I think what we do is try to give our best guess of where we're today given the booking trends, given what we're seeing on the books. One of the big differences between Q3 and Q4 is that the increase in the Caribbean as an industry is significantly less. I think it's up 13% in Q4 versus like 22% in Q3.","So, we're expecting to see a better Caribbean overall environment in Q4 than we saw in Q3 on a comparative basis. And therefore, we're anticipating that yields will be up slightly in Q4 as part of our overall guidance.","So, we feel good. It's looking at what we have on the books and what we have remaining to sell that gives us the confidence that the yields will turn positive in Q4.","Beth Roberts","And as a company, our capacity growth in the fourth quarter is only 5%, 6% in the Caribbean, which is a much lower hurdle for us as an entity versus the 19% we absorbed in the third quarter.","Robin Farley - UBS","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Kent with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Kent - Goldman Sachs","Hi. Arnold, could you talk a little bit about the air expense reduction? How big of an opportunity is that? At one point, I thought it was measured in the hundreds of millions of dollars and I'm just wondering why that -- what's the delay or what could accelerate that?","And then just to Robin's question, because it doesn't really make a whole lot of sense, the guidance for Q3. Is something happening on last minute bookings? Are last minute bookings coming in a lot better than expected? And is that Europe or North America that maybe is doing that?","Arnold W. Donald","Okay. First of all, on the air question, overall between the air and port combination team that we've put together, they're dealing with about $1.1 billion or $1.2 billion of annual costs.","The air component of that is split between crew and passengers, charters for passengers in Europe, et cetera. But there is an opportunity there, for certain. We've issued the RFP. We are going to be in negotiations with a number of airlines. And so we are not throwing any numbers around for obvious reasons.","But the reality is there will be an opportunity there for certain to capture some value by leveraging our scale. And we fully expect to begin to see the benefit of that next year.","With regard to our comment about hundreds of millions of dollars, I wouldn\u2019t anticipate being able to sell 50% or 30% of the cost or anything like that, which would result in your hundreds of millions of dollars on other basis.","But we certainly have an opportunity to save substantial dollars that can contribute to the bottom-line. And of course, we have the initiatives across number of other areas as well with regards to provisions and technical stores, et cetera.","Your second question again\u2026","David Bernstein","Sure.","Arnold W. Donald","Go ahead, yeah.","David Bernstein ","Yeah. As far as the last minute bookings and what's happening, in the first quarter what we had indicated was that the last minute bookings on Carnival Cruise Lines and -- in the Caribbean were better than anticipated. And remember, the first quarter Caribbean capacity was only up a couple of percentage points. It was the second, third and fourth quarter that were up significantly on a year-over-year basis.","In the second quarter, as I indicated in my notes, as far as the ticket revenue was concerned, it was the EAA brands, particularly the Continental European brands that performed a little bit better than we had expected.","Of course, the overall increase in yields year-over-year had to do with -- some of it was ticket and some of it was onboard and other yields as well. Some of the programs on onboard, particularly our casino program and our casino partnerships are bearing fruit and the onboard revenue did well in the second quarter. And we didn\u2019t change the onboard revenue for the remainder of the year despite the lower occupancy, because of some of the improvements that we are seeing.","Arnold W. Donald","What I can tell you in regards of the guidance question has come up a couple of times in different ways. Obviously, we have confidence in the guidance we provided. We anticipated a number of the things that have occurred already this year.","We feel we have reasonable line of sight barring unforeseen mega macro issues that we have confidence in the guidance that we provided for the year. Go ahead\u2026","Steve Kent - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thanks. No, I was just going to say it's -- given what you seeing so far and given what you've seen in Q1, Q2, that better than expected results are -- better than expected bookings are coming in.","David, you said that it was Europe in Q2 and given what Robin and I are both seeing, which is that you have a lot of capacity in Europe this -- for Q3. It's surprising that that won't carry over into Q3.","David Bernstein","I understand what you are saying. I mean, it\u2019s a mix of a number of different things and factors. Just as an example, one of the things we talked about on the last conference call were the expectations for Japan, which had an impact on the third quarter as well.","So, there are a lot of factors that are coming together including the lower occupancy in the Caribbean, Japan and other things, which is yielding our net guidance.","Steve Kent - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Please proceed.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital","Hi, good morning. Thank you. So, David, the promotional environment in the Caribbean that\u2019s been persistent and we\u2019ve all known about it. Is it worse than what you saw it would be when you last reported your quarter?","David Bernstein","I think it's fair to say the fact that the guidance for the third quarter, it's fair to say that -- as I indicated before, a little bit worse than we had anticipated. But there are other positives that are more than offsetting that and that\u2019s why the net trend is positive. We're never going to get everything perfectly correct. There is always some pluses and minuses.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital","Right, that\u2019s fair. So, it's also fair to say, you reported the ticket prices in the North American yields were down 7% in the second quarter, it's fair to say that will be worse in the third quarter? Correct?","Arnold W. Donald","No.","David Bernstein","No.","Arnold W. Donald","No, not at all. You have different comparisons, right? So, first of all, the first half of last year was booked prior to the voyage disruption that caused a number of issues for us and in the industry in general. So, you've got a different comparison half-to-half. So, we are not saying we're going to be down 7% in the third quarter, or anything like that, David?","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital","Okay. So you're still going to see sequential -- so you're going to see -- could you say you're going to see sequential improvement in yields generally? You will see sequential improvement in the Caribbean as well, I guess, that\u2019s where I'm trying to get to.","David Bernstein","Yes. Well, and for the North American brands had it not been for the change in capacity, as I said, the ticket prices were up than we've would have gotten -- a change in occupancy we would have gotten higher yields. So it\u2019s the lower occupancy that\u2019s driving it.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital","Okay. That\u2019s fair.","Beth Roberts","I just want to say the -- we are seeing a recovery from the down over Q in the second quarter to the flat to slightly down in the third quarter. So things are improving.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital","I'm just trying to separate out the Caribbean, but I get it, you were clear. Let's move on to cost for a second. Arnold, regarding your initiatives, you've been pretty consistent to say that a more detailed discussion of this is going to take some time and you reiterated that again today.","Just wondering, you've kind of -- you've been in for a year and you've been examining these costs. Just wonder if you can give us some sense of when you might be ready to discuss that.","And then also will the cost initiatives be incremental to your cost base or will they be used to reinvest in the business and offset inflation. How should we think about those?","Arnold W. Donald","Good. First of all, it hasn\u2019t been a year yet, I have all the way to, I think, July 3rd for that.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital","Okay. Rounding -- I'm rounding, I'm sorry.","Arnold W. Donald","Okay. With regards to the costs, we have a number of initiatives as I mentioned on the way. In the end we want to deliver the results and so the best way to do that, at times we have lot of things to manage, including the negotiations with outside parties, and so we are not too anxious to float numbers around for obvious reasons, because they can obviously influence the discussion.","We could glob a bunch of numbers together across various initiatives and whatever, but I'd rather led the troops, as I mentioned to you before, bottom it up and as I mentioned before they often come through much more aggressively than if we just mandated arbitrary targets.","So, it's going well. We are beginning to experience everyday just through the ongoing behavior of collaboration and coordination, communication across the brands. We began to see benefits in cost areas as well as in revenue generating areas and sharing our best practices.","And we're beginning to see results and we feel good about our quarter and we feel good about the year. We feel very good about looking ahead to the future and realizing those. So we will reveal along the way. Once we've completed the RFPs and have done a good deal, we'll probably share the level of cost improvements that we've been able to achieve. But that would be more likely the process in some of these areas.","With regard to -- what was your second question?","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital","Well, just as we anticipate this -- I mean, should we think about these initiatives as being incremental to your cost base. In other words improving it or are they basically going to be kind of used to reinvest in the business and offset inflation?","","Arnold W. Donald","Yeah. It's going to be a combination. We have our annual strategy reviews in August and September. The brands will come in with their plans and request for investments and what have you. Where we see line of slight on an investment producing higher returns and we're not -- obviously we'll make that investment.","And where we don\u2019t, we probably won't. And so, some of the savings, I'm sure will go to smart investments that are more powerful bottom-line and some of it will directly go to the bottom-line.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Arnold W. Donald","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Harry Curtis with Nomura. Please proceed with your question.","Harry Curtis - Nomura Securities International","Good morning. Let's just look ahead to global capacity shifts in 2015. I think you made a brief comment about your expectations for Europe and the Caribbean. Could you just review those again with respect or maybe keeping in mind the 4% to 5% increase in fleet capacity overall. What are your expectations not only for what you expect but also what you expect in capacity growth in the Caribbean and Europe next year?","Arnold W. Donald","I think everybody wants to answer that. Dave you want to answer, go ahead.","David Bernstein","Yeah. Overall, our capacity for the year is up little over 2%. And as Arnold said, we're looking at relatively flat capacity in Europe year-over-year, flat in Alaska. On a full year basis, we are looking at the Caribbean being down slightly. But there is a couple of big things there, particularly in the third quarter. I think Arnold mentioned double-digit decline in the Caribbean. So that should bode well for pricing.","And the other thing is that as we have indicated before within the Caribbean the biggest promotional activity has been in the South Florida market and we are also making some changes in the overall deployments around the Caribbean. So while it's going down, it\u2019s also being redeployed and changing as well. ","And we had talked about the double-digit increases in both Asia and Australia and New Zealand. So that's where we are investing overall and that's where the overall increasing capacity is going. ","Arnold W. Donald","And we see some capacity reduction in the industry as well -- in the rest of industry in the third quarter next year in the Caribbean, for example. And [overall] [ph] for the year some reduction by the rest of the industry.","So that should help things - the added time and investment in marketing and all those people that are sailing this year having great experiences onboard and already thinking about booking next year. So, you know, all of that should bode for a better environment in the Caribbean next year than we experienced.","Harry Curtis - Nomura Securities International","Okay. So as a follow-up, industry-wide there should be a lift of roughly eight to 10 ships next year. Where do you think they're going? And how are you positioning yourself in those markets against those other new ships coming?","Beth Roberts","The industry growth for 2015 we do have the North American brands pretty flat. Our European -- the industry has an increase in European brands of roughly 6%. And the Asia-Pacific region is really carrying the most growth at 16% for the industry that is off a very small base.","Harry Curtis - Nomura Securities International","Okay. Let me just quickly touch on one last question. When we think about the Carnival brand, how has that been rebounding relative to your expectations particularly in the Caribbean over the last three to four, five months? And can you give us an update on where the Carnival pricing has rebounded to versus where it was?","Arnold W. Donald","With regards to the brand image, it has rebounded very well. And it continues to muster great brand image strength, driven in no small part due to the fact that we had a lot of people sailing on Carnival. And they are thrilled with the experience.","So both from a broader consumer perspective, but certainly amongst those that are cruising, the Carnival brand image recovery has been partly very strong. And kudos and hats off to our employees and their brand leadership of that brand, for all the initiatives they undertook to help make that happen.","With regard to the second part of your question, David?","David Bernstein","Yeah, we don't give detailed by brand and ticket yields and pricing for each of our individual brands. But it's fair to say that overall the rebound has not been what we had hoped because of the promotional pricing environment in the Caribbean for Carnival and occupancy as well. We're holding price and giving up the occupancy. And that's worked very well for us over the last year.","We will keep analyzing that and see where we go. But hopefully next year, with the redeployment in the Caribbean and the lower capacity, we do hope to be able to fill the ships and to bear those fruits and get the yields up.","Harry Curtis - Nomura Securities International","That's great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jaime Katz with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Jaime Katz - Morningstar","Good morning and thanks for taking my question. First, I am curious if you guys are willing to comment on where your best opportunity is on the cost side or not necessarily putting a dollar amount with it, but obviously, the costs have been pretty well controlled in the recent years. So where are your best opportunities to continue on that path? ","And second, how do we think about the Asia-Pacific market potential longer term, and the cadence of moving ships into that territory without over penetrating it too quickly? Thanks.","Arnold W. Donald","Yeah, thank you Jaime for your questions. With regards to the cost side, first of all, we do have opportunities everywhere. We do. If you try to force rank them you would have to come up with categorizations.","So if you take some broad categories like air and port, and provisions, food, hotel services, different things, they are very large buckets. And the teams are resolving exactly what their targets are.","Right now, I would say that there is considerable opportunity across all of them. And cumulatively 1% improvement non-fuel, non-payroll. So even payroll out of it, leaving fuel cost out of it, 1% cost improvement yields $60 million to us, okay.","And so we are mining every aspect, because just a few percentage points can give us significant positive impact. And I would like to leave it at that for now. But I want you to know we have a focus on it and where it emanates from is just coordination and communication and then single sourcing in some instances are limited sourcing, multi sourcing, you know, across the brands and just leveraging the scale that we have.","The brands individually have done good jobs at managing their costs. Some of the brands have done outstanding jobs. And we want to mine those best practices, deploy them across the fleet and across the brands.","And then leverage the scale we have and negotiations and take advantage of that. And doing that, as I mentioned, 1% improvement is worth $60 million to us. So that would be how I would answer that question.","David Bernstein","As far as the Asia-Pacific region and the growth in the long-term, I mean, the market has tremendous potential. When you look particularly at China which is the largest market and you look at the areas in Shanghai, Beijing, Guangdong province, you are talking about over 130 million people, probably double the size of the U.K., so there is a lot of opportunity there.","We have been growing the market slowly, taking it one ship at a time making the decisions as we go along. And China and Asia are doing very well for us. And we are looking forward as a great growth opportunity for us over the next few years.","Arnold W. Donald","There is always the risk of timing, if everybody floods the market at once, and so on and so forth. But right now what we are able to see looking ahead, we continue to see China as very promising.","Australia is definitely a hot market and people want to send their ships there. And if you are going to be in China, you're not going to be there all year long, you are probably going to spend some time in Australia with the ships and so on. ","And so all of that will add some complexity, but we feel very well positioned in those markets. We feel that the growth that we have staged and what we see coming from the industry, on balance, nets positive in the short term and very positive in the long-term.","Jaime Katz - Morningstar","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lena Thakkar with HSBC. Please proceed with your question.","Lena Thakkar \u2013 HSBC PLC","Thanks, a couple of questions. Firstly, I know you don\u2019t sort of discuss performance by brand. But I think you have made an exception for Costa in the past. Can you help us to understand how much of the 15% yield loss you are sort of planning to recover this year and therefore how the European pricing is weighted towards that Costa recovery?","And then just secondly, more generally, on the sort of occupancy and price dynamic, you have clearly changed the way you think about that. And I am just wondering if that's a more longer term dynamic whether you will continue to sort of give up occupancy in various markets where it make sense. And just on that, does it mean we should think about a different EPS sensitivity to yield change given the mix of occupancy in price.","Arnold W. Donald","Okay. So, on the latter part of your question, we have focused on a couple of markets on trying to ensure some price integrity, okay? We continue to pursue that, and we will as long as we see net benefit. If ultimately we don't see net benefit, we would discontinue that, okay.","And each market is its own market, its own source of guests and how they buy and shop, and how they think. And we really have to be careful, one-size-fits-all, even one-size-fits-all-times even.","And so we're going to be very disciplined and very analytical in our approaches. So, we do, in fact, optimize, because as I mentioned many times to you all, the reality is we fill 78 million plus passenger cruise days a year and $1 more per day is worth $78 million to us. So, the details matter and the discipline and the fine tuning matters.","So, I wouldn't want the team to be operating on a one broad swoop anything, because that's not going to optimize the return for us and accelerate our path to return on invested capital. So, there is no grand single scheme plan. So, I want to make that really clear.","The second thing with regards to that is if you look at Europe in particular, the booking patterns have improved. So, people are booking further ahead than they did the prior year. Occupancy is up, yields are up, so that's all very positive stuff. We expect to see similar trends, in due course, on a consistent basis in North America, as well. I don't know if David had any additional comments he wanted to make, or Beth, but go right ahead.","David Bernstein","Yeah, I guess, Costa was down 16% as a result of the incident. And we had given out some information on the brand because of the circumstance. Last year in 2013, we had indicated they rebounded four points. It was less than we had hoped, because they were facing economic headwinds.","This year, Costa does continue to improve, it\u2019s a few points higher than the prior year. So, it keeps going in the positive direction. But as you had indicated, we're trying to stay away from giving brand-by-brand improvement -- or brand-to-brand changes.","Lena Thakkar - HSBC Bank PLC","Okay. And just as a quick follow-up, Arnold, you talked about the net benefit of the pricing and occupancy dynamic. Are you thinking net benefit for just this year, i.e., the short-term or the future benefits of holding that price and how that may help to perhaps derive a bit more pricing power?","Arnold W. Donald","Yeah, absolutely, we're thinking over time and monitoring carefully and tracking carefully to see if we're having the desired effect. So, it's not just in the moment. We're thinking longer term, no question about that.","Lena Thakkar - HSBC Bank PLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Arnold W. Donald","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo Securities","Thank you. Let's return to the Caribbean and the Carnival brand in particular. Again, in the third quarter, you said that you've given up a little bit more occupancy to hold price. As we look to fourth and first quarter, going forward and granted you've got more capacity in the Caribbean seasonally, but year-over-year, the capacity growth is slowing for yourselves and the industry.","Do you see -- have we reached the inflection point in the Caribbean to where potentially that occupancy can improve along with price or hold price and occupancy can improve in the fourth and first quarters at this point?","Arnold W. Donald","Go ahead, David.","David Bernstein","You know what given what we're seeing in the overall booking trend, and the pricing and everything else, I do believe that we can see yield improvement overall in the Caribbean. And the Caribbean does vary by quarter significantly.","We see the third quarter -- as we said, we gave up price and occupancy for the CCL brand. We gave -- I'm sorry -- we gave up occupancy and held price. And in the fourth quarter, I mean the brand still expects to hold price. And overall, we do anticipate an improvement for the fourth quarter.","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. So, maybe we're seeing this inflection here in the third then moving to the fourth, is that fair to say then?","Arnold W. Donald","Yeah, that's fair to say.","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, okay. And then gentlemen, you had given some color regarding onboard deals, how those were improving nicely both in the North American brands and in the EAA brands.","In -- please correct me if I'm wrong, did I hear that the Europe, if you just sort of looked at it year-over-year in the second quarter had improved a little bit more than North America or was that fairly balanced and then the expectations for the remainder of the year?","David Bernstein","What I said was the EAA brands improved a little bit more than we had expected in the second quarter. That was all what we had guided to and that\u2019s what drove the increase from our guidance. ","I had indicated that North American brands were down in the second quarter.","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, okay.","Arnold W. Donald","The other comment -- I know you guys are focused pretty heavily on the Caribbean I can understand it. But the bottom-line is in the fourth quarter the capacity changes for the industry year-to-year in the fourth quarter are nothing were near as dramatic as they were in the third quarter in the Caribbean. ","And beyond that, we just believe a number of other things we implemented, whether it\u2019s marketing initiatives, the pricing philosophy whatever, we are seeing strength. We have to play it all the way out to see where we end up.","But right now we definitely see improvement in the fourth quarter which gives us the confidence to give the guidance we have and increase the guidance from where we were.","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. And just one last thing on the onboard, David, is it being driven by the changes predominantly on the casino or are you seeing that in other areas of onboard also.","David Bernstein","We are seeing some -- positive things in a number of other areas. I guess, I'd mentioned the casino only because it was the largest positive of all of the variety of items. ","Arnold W. Donald","And because David has responsibility for casino now.","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. Okay, thank you gentlemen.","Arnold W. Donald","Very good.","Operator","Our next question comes from Assia Georgieva with Infiniti Research. Please proceed with your question.","Assia Georgieva - Infiniti Research","Good morning guys. This is Assia. Beth was very helpful in providing the Caribbean capacity distribution up 19% in Q3, up only 5% to 6% in Q4. Could you give us capacity for the corporate entity?","David Bernstein","Well, capacity by\u2026","Assia Georgieva - Infiniti Research","Meaning all destinations by quarter.","David Bernstein","Assia, why don\u2019t you call Beth after the call? There is a long list of details and she'll be happy to go through it with you. ","Assia Georgieva - Infiniti Research","Okay, great. Thank you for that. And secondly, with Europe being so strong, I think none of us expected it to be that good this year before wave season started. Do you see indications for 2015 or is it still too early?","David Bernstein","It's very early for 2015 overall. I mean, we will give you some indications in December when we talk about our guidance for next year. But, overall, remember we had been facing some economic headwinds particularly in Europe and so it is somewhat improving environment. And so hopefully that does help us positively in 2015.","Assia Georgieva - Infiniti Research","Okay. Thank you, David. And one last quick question. I should understand that you expect Q4 yields to be slightly up, correct?","David Bernstein","That\u2019s correct.","Arnold W. Donald","That\u2019s correct.","Assia Georgieva - Infiniti Research","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Rick Lyall with John W. Bristol. Please proceed with your question.","Rick Lyall - John W. Bristol & Co.","Yeah. I have two questions. First, have you commented on what the cost savings are from folding the Ibero brand into Costa and are there any other broader opportunities in the brand overhead structure?","Arnold W. Donald","First of all let me answer the latter part of the question -- thank you Rick for the question. In terms of other opportunities, if the question is, do we plan to roll in the other brands up? Absolutely, not at this point in time. So we have really leading brands. Even the Ibero decision took some time, but Costa is so strong in Spain and the opportunity was there to minimize marketing cost and other related cost to maintain a separate brands.","So given that, and it was a small brand, we thought it was the right thing to do. But, if you go beyond that brand in terms of thinking about rolling up in the other brands that is not on the table right now at all. So I want to make that really clear. ","David Bernstein","And, Rick, keep in mind that Ibero was a highly integrated brand within Costa, and it was only two ships, so very tiny brand. And so as a result, there will be some cost savings. But you might be talking a penny or two. I mean, we are not talking about big dollars here. ","Arnold W. Donald","We will take one or two more questions, Melody.","Rick Lyall - John W. Bristol & Co.","Okay. I had a follow-up on your profitability in China. Can you comment on where the relative profitability of China is versus other brands or other geographies?","David Bernstein","Yeah, we have said before that overall, the yields in China was slightly less than the corporate average. And, you know, the thing that really drives that is somewhat on the onboard, while the gambling is great the Chinese don\u2019t seem to drink very much, so there are differences and that\u2019s what makes the yields slightly lower than the overall corporate average at this point.","Rick Lyall - John W. Bristol & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Arnold W. Donald","Okay. One or two more\u2026","Operator","Mr. Arnold?","Arnold W. Donald","Yes.","Operator","I apologize. We have no further questions at this time. So, I will turn it back over to you.","Arnold W. Donald","Well, thank you everyone. We appreciate your interest and your time. Again, we feel good looking forward. And we look forward to giving you guys updates along the way. Thank you very much everyone and thank you Melody.","Operator","Thank you, sir.

We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines."],"4374":["Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) Q3 2016 Earnings Conference Call September 26, 2016 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Arnold Donald - President and CEO","Micky Arison - Chairman","David Bernstein - CFO","Beth Roberts - SVP, IR","Analysts","Robin Farley - UBS","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital","Steven Wieczynski - Stifel Nicolaus","Jaime Katz \u2013 Morningstar","Greg Badishkanian - Citigroup","James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities","Harry Curtis - Nomura Capital","David Beckel - Bernstein Research","Jamie Rollo - Morgan Stanley","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo Securities","Arnold Donald","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. I am Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation & plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning.","Today, I am joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison; by David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and by Beth Roberts, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking. Therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today\u2019s press release.","Despite a series of geopolitical events that unfolded as the year progressed, including Turkey, Paris, and Brussels, despite heightened concerns around Zika, around Brexit and around China, despite fuel and currency both working against us resulting in an $0.18 drag from our initial 2016 guidance, we have exceeded the high end of our quarterly guidance and we are raising our expectations for the year.","This quarter, we delivered the highest quality earnings in Carnival Corporation\u2019s history, with record net income of over $1.4 billion, $0.17 per share higher than the prior year exceeding the high end of our guidance and $0.07 above the midpoint. Despite the numerous headwinds, we are well on track to achieve our new guidance midpoint for full year adjusted earnings per share of $3.35, more than doubling our 2013 earnings of $1.55 per share. More importantly, our return on invested capital will also nearly double from 4.6% to 8.8% over that same time period.","These strong results could not happen without the hard work of our 120,000 passionate employees and without the strong support of our travel agent partners. Looking forward, our booking trends are strong heading into 2017 with higher occupancy levels at higher prices, building momentum for continued earnings growth. Our record results and favorable booking trends reflect our ongoing efforts to create demand in excess of measured capacity growth, together with the benefits of leveraging our scale. Our world leading cruise lines continue to outperform, particularly in the Caribbean with continued strength in close-in pricing. Moreover, all of our major brands in North America and Europe experienced net revenue yield improvements despite the geopolitical environment in Europe. Europe is our single largest deployment in the third quarter at 45% of our total capacity. ","Now, there has certainly been a lot of noise around China, so I\u2019m going to spend a little extra time on China in my comments now. First, China is a profitable market for us. Our ships operating in China optimize our overall brand performances. As we\u2019ve previously indicated, China is a unit growth opportunity, and we expect the yield to be down as the distribution system improves its ability to service the growing market there. To demonstrate our commitment to grow the industry in China, we have factored into our results and into our guidance, potential adjustments to our contracted prices in support of our distribution partners. The distributors are gaining experience translating pent up consumer demand for cruising into sustainable market pricing, and we certainly want to help them as they adapt to a rapidly growing market. ","Again, even with those adjustments, we are raising our guidance for the year, affirming that we can manage ups and downs in this embryonic market. As we previously pointed out, China represents just 5% of our capacity, and even with capacity growth well above our global average, it will remain a relatively small percentage of our total business. We continue to expect china to be a growth market, especially since the growth in the cruise industry is backed by the Chinese government as is evidenced by its inclusion in the current 5 year plan. We will participate in this growth. We have 16 marketing offices in China in 2016. That\u2019s up from just 8 in 2015. We plan to open 4 more offices and to significantly expand our distribution network in 2017. ","Also in 2017, the brand new majestic Princess will enter as the first purpose built ship for the Chinese market. Our capacity growth in China is expected to be 26% next year compared to 66% this year. Industrywide growth in china is expected to be 31% in 2017 compared to 100% this year. Those numbers sound big, but keep in mind that the large year-over-year percentage increase is over a very small base. So these growth rates are directionally equivalent to adding less than one 3,000-berth vessels to our China fleet and roughly two 4,000-berth vessels to the industry fleet overall in 2017 in China. Regardless of the rate of growth in China, we are firmly committed to overall measured capacity growth and fully capable of managing the sustainable double-digit returns on invested capital. ","Concerning new builds, our most recent announcement included 3 new ship orders for 2021 and 2022, our first orders for those years. Before 2020, there\u2019s been no change in capacity from previous announcements. To optimize deployment, however, we have reallocated the new builds among our brands. Over the next four years, three ships are planned to be purpose-built for Asia, our fastest growing region, which is still in its earliest stage of development. At an average of roughly three ships per year, we\u2019ll be spread across all our established markets. In fact, we have a very measured capacity environment during this time at the brand level, with two ships each for our North American brand Carnival Cruise Lines, our global brand Princess, our luxury brand Seabourn, and our German brand AIDA. Effectively, one ship every other year for those brands. In addition, over the same four-year period, we will deliver just one ship each for Holland America lines, Costa in southern Europe, P&O in the UK, and P&O in Australia. ","And during this, time we will continue removing ships from our fleet. In fact, the number of berths that are eligible for removal will more than double by 2020, and more than double again by 2024. Given this potential replacement cycle increase, we expect that a greater portion of our new build capacity will actually replace older, less efficient ships. As in the past, we will sell ships into secondary markets that do not compete directly with our brand. Within those secondary markets, there are older ships operating today that will soon reach retirement age and need to be replaced. We expect our net capacity growth through 2020 to be 3% to 4% compounded annually, consisting of double digit growth in Asia and obviously 3% or less growth in our established markets in North America, Europe, and Australia. ","Meanwhile, we continue our efforts to create demand in excess of measured capacity growth. We have stepped up our aggressive public relations efforts with three innovative 30-minute programs airing weekly on ABC, NBC, and CW, every Saturday morning beginning in October. Each program showcases our brands creating amazing vacation experiences that are designed to expand the audience for cruising, by providing increased consideration and at the same time, changing perceptions by dispelling the myths of cruising with compelling original content. We're excited by the prospect of connecting people, places, and cultures across the world to create unforgettable experiences. Collectively, these programs provide an hour and a half of content per week, with over 150 scheduled airings and an annual expected viewership well in excess of 150 million people. And we have further innovations on horizon that will be unveiled in January of 2017, designed to further enhance our already great guest experiences.","Additionally, we launched the initial phase of our yield management system this quarter, helping us drive incremental revenue yield over time. We are currently market testing across six brands for a portion of the inventory to refine algorithms. The full rollout will be completed by late next year. Although we have already benefited from the sharing of best practices, we expect this new yield management technology to contribute in 2017, and even more so in 2018. ","We also continue to make progress on our cost containment efforts, and remain on track for more than $75 million of cost savings this year. In summary, we are committed to measured capacity growth, currently planned at less than 3% in the established markets. Our brands are differentiating themselves in the market, and delivering fantastic vacations for our guests, as evidenced by our strong yield performance. We continue to build demand for cruise and continue to aggressively contain costs, while still investing in enhanced guest experience and demand creation. We are improving our capability to extract yield in any environment through enhanced revenue management tools. ","Moreover, we remain committed to returning value to shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased another $700 million of Carnival stock through our ongoing buyback program. In the last year, we have invested nearly $2.5 billion to buy back over 50 million shares of our company stock, demonstrating conviction in our ability to execute and achieve sustainable double digit returns on invested capital. ","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to David.","David Bernstein","Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I\u2019ll start today with a summary of our 2016 third quarter results. Then I\u2019ll provide an update on our full year 2016 guidance, and then I'll finish up with some insights on 2017 booking trends and a few other items to note for 2017. ","Our record adjusted EPS for the third quarter was $1.92. This was $0.07 above the midpoint of our June guidance. The improvement was driven by a number of factors. First, $0.02 from net revenue yields, which benefited from stronger pricing on closing bookings at our North American brands. Second, $0.02 from lower net cruise costs excluding fuel, as a result of timing of certain expenses between the quarters. Third, a penny from the favorable net impact of fuel prices in currency versus our June guidance rates. And fourth, a penny from the accretive impact of the shares we repurchased since the last earnings call. ","Now let's turn to the third quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased almost 4%. The North American brands were up over 2%, while our European, Australia, and Asian brands, also known as our EAA brands, were up over 6%. ","Our total net revenue yields were up 2.7%. Now let\u2019s break apart the two components of net revenue yields. Net ticket yields were up 3.1%. This increase was driven by our North American brands deployment in the Caribbean, Alaska and Europe, as well as our EAA brands deployment in Europe. These net ticket yield increases were partially offset by yield reductions in Australia, driven by large industry capacity increases in a highly penetrated market, as well as yield reductions in Asia, where distributors are gaining experience growing the market. The majority of these yield reductions were anticipated in our initial 2016 yield guidance provided during our December earnings call. ","After eight straight quarters of mid to high single digit yield increases, our net on board and other yields increased 1.3%, over much tougher comparables from the third quarter 2015, as our current initiatives continue to pay dividends, while our brands develop new initiatives for 2017 and beyond. ","Net cruise cost per ALBD excluding fuel, were up 5%, driven by the timing of advertising expenses, and the remastering of Queen Mary 2 in dry dock as discussed on our last earnings call. This was about a point improvement versus what was planned in our June guidance. But again, this was due to the timing of expenses between the quarters. ","In summary, our third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.17 higher than the prior year, driven by three things. One, operational improvements worth $0.05 despite the high net cruise cost seasonalization in the third quarter. Two, the favorable net impact of fuel prices in currency were $0.02. And three, share buyback accretion worth $0.10. As Arnold indicated, since the beginning of the third quarter, we repurchased over $700 million of our shares for a total, since late last year, of over 50 million shares at nearly $2.5 billion of buybacks. At this point in time, we have approximately $500 million remaining on the $3 billion stock buyback authorization. Our September guidance EPS calculations assumes shares repurchase through last week. For the full year, the calculations assumed 748 million shares outstanding on a weighted average basis, while the fourth quarter calculations assumed 730 shares outstanding. ","Next, I want to provide you with an update on our full year 2016 guidance. As Arnold indicated, we are well on track for achieving adjusted EPS of $3.35, which is the midpoint of our 2016 September guidance range of $3.33 to $3.37. The $0.05 improvement compared to the midpoint of our June guidance was essentially driven by two things. Improved net revenue yields worth $0.03, $0.02 of which we achieved in the third quarter and an additional penny we expect to achieve in net ticket revenues during the fourth quarter. And $0.02 from the accretive impact of additional shares repurchased since our June conference call. ","Now let's turn to 2017 booking trends. Since June, bookings for the first half of 2017 have been at significantly higher prices, with bookings volumes lower than the prior year, as there is less inventory remaining for sale. At this point in time, for the first half of 2017, cumulative advance bookings are ahead at considerably higher prices. ","Drilling down into the cumulative book position, first, for our North American brands. Caribbean occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at nicely higher prices. For all other deployments, occupancy is ahead of the prior year at higher prices. Secondly for our EAA brands. For Europe deployments, occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at slightly higher prices. For the Caribbean deployment for our EAA brands, occupancy is in line with the prior year at slightly lower prices. However, prices on these bookings over the last quarter are well ahead of the prior year, clearly an improving trend. For Asia, occupancy is in line with the prior year at nicely higher prices. And for Australia, occupancy is also well ahead of the prior year at prices that are in line. However, prices on the bookings over s last quarter are well ahead of the prior year, also clearly an improving trend. ","And finally, a few other items to note for 2017. We are forecasting a capacity increase of 2.5%. We are planning for an increase in dry dock days from approximately 380 in 2016, to 470 in 2017. Remember, we did benefit in 2016 from lower dry dock days, compared to the 563 days we had in 2015. As we have indicated on previous conference calls, the dry dock days will vary each year, but probably average around 450 to 475 days given the current size of our fleet. As we indicated last year, given the amount of CapEx reinvestment in the existing vessels, and other areas of our business to drive yield improvement, we do expect depreciation expense to increase percentage wise, more than capacity and currently expect depreciation expense to be around $1.9 billion for 2017. ","Given the volatility of fuel prices and FX rates over the last year, we wanted to share with you the year over year impact that these items would have on our 2017 results, if we used current fuel prices and FX rates. The 2017 year over year impact would be an unfavorable $0.28. $0.24 for fuel prices, including the impact of fuel derivatives and $0.04 for currency. ","Although it\u2019s early, 2017 appears to be shaping up to be another good year. We are well positioned for continued earnings growth, given the current strength of our bookings and pricing trends for next year. ","And now operator, let's open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead. ","Robin Farley","Great, thank you. I know your first half commentary, you're looking very strong. I wonder if you could clarify on maybe two areas where investors may be kind of most concerned, and it's really I guess given demand or concerns about North American demand into Europe. That would really be more of a Q3 issue. I wonder -- I know it's still early, but can you give us any sort of early read on that? And then the other area, China of course, and I realize China is in your first half guidance as well, but I wonder if you could just sort of give any color on you know how chartered -- how much you\u2019re chartered for next year at this point already. Thanks.","Arnold Donald","Good morning, Robin. First of all, with regards -- let\u2019s take the second one first on China charters. We\u2019re just in the process now and that was part of our consideration for making adjustments we\u2019ve made that we've included in the guidance going forward on this year's activity. So no real guidance yet for 2017 on that except what David shared in his comment about where the bookings were for Asia overall. In terms of the North America brands in Europe, again our booking curves look strong, and look good as do our pricings, but you're asking about third quarter 2017, obviously that\u2019s ways off. ","Robin Farley","Okay, maybe just one clarifying comment. David, you mentioned occupancy for Asia overall in line so far in the first half, so that would -- and that commentary would include China -- in other words any charters for the first half for China suggesting in line with last year at this time.","Arnold Donald","Yes. Right now, our charter activity is strong in China. Our occupancies this year were very good. We anticipated as we said in the opening comments that we would see yield decline, but China is profitable, occupancy levels are high, which means the increased capacity was absorbed in terms of having guests on the ships. The ships are sailing full. And chartering for next year at this point is in process, but solid. We don\u2019t see any consternation around occupancy for next year.","Robin Farley","Okay. Great. Thank you. ","Arnold Donald","And Robin just one last comment, I\u2019m sorry. Real quickly, the guest satisfaction levels are very high as well. So China is a great market, still small part of our overall base, but it\u2019s a very strong market. ","Robin Farley","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi. Thanks for the time and good morning. Just sticking on your outlook for 2017, David, it appears that the commentary that you had for the first half this quarter has improved since the color you gave last quarter. You guys did give us some nice color on the call, but I was just wondering specifically what is driving that improvement.","David Bernstein","It\u2019s a variety of things. We\u2019ve talked all along essentially about the strength of our booking. Our booking position as well ahead. We talked that pricing at this point is considerably higher. We\u2019ve been working all along, all year long on our yield management systems. Best practices across the brands have been very helpful. As Arnold mentioned, we just rolled out for the 6 brands the prototype and the new revenue management system and that will be helping in addition for 2017 and beyond. So there\u2019s a lot of good positive deployment optimization across the brands have contributed. So there\u2019s a lot of very good things going in our favor and we feel very good about the overall book position for 2017.","Felicia Hendrix","That's helpful. Thank you. And so your fourth quarter outlook is basically in line with what was implied when you reported last and also in line with consensus. There have been some travel agent reports about pockets of inventory in the Caribbean for the remainder of the year. I'm assuming that's being contemplated in your guidance. But is there anything that you can see today that might cause some risk or concern about the guidance for the rest of the year?","Arnold Donald","No, we don\u2019t see anything in terms of the guidance for the rest of the year. Our bookings are very strong in the Caribbean. We\u2019re well ahead with higher pricing. We don\u2019t see softness. Our brands continue to outperform in the Caribbean.","Felicia Hendrix","Thank you for that. And then just finally Arnold, you touched upon this earlier in your prepared remarks. Could you just talk a little bit more about the decision to move AIDA from -- it was originally -- one of your AIDA ships originally anticipated to be in China next year. Now it's going to be in the Med and then earlier in the year you moved that China decision for Carnival brand to be in China. You took that out. So I was just wondering if you could talk about those decisions, and would we perhaps see those brands in China in 2018? ","Arnold Donald","Again deployments are kind of a holistic decision, so a lot of things go into consideration. Obviously, the market you\u2019re considering deploying it in, but also in the case of AIDA, the AIDAperla, our new ship, we\u2019ve gotten confirmation of when she\u2019s going to come in. So we now know the capacity situation we\u2019ll have so that was the relative strength of the market in Germany for AIDA. So all of those things factor in as well as the dynamics in China itself. Similarly with the Carnival, as I mentioned on a previous call on that one, it was a combination of things for how well the Carnival was doing in the Caribbean at a time capacity coming in, with the Vista coming in, and other things. And the fact that we have distributed ports, home ports here in the US, and getting the right ship in the right home port, all of those things factor in ultimately for an optimized deployment decision. And that\u2019s the beauty of our inventory is that it\u2019s mobile. We kind of adjust and adapt and we\u2019re constantly seeking to optimize.","Felicia Hendrix","Great. Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Steven Wieczynski","Good morning, guys. Arnold, can I follow up on China? Let me ask another question. I know you'll probably get sick of them. But I know you were just over there, I guess it was last week at a pretty major cruise conference.","Arnold Donald","Yes.","Steven Wieczynski","Can you give us maybe the two or three main takeaways that you came back with?","Arnold Donald","The takeaways were the ones I went over with frankly which is, number one, cruise is in the 5 year plan for China. So that means the government has committed to developing the Cruise industry. The reason for that is pretty self-evident. We\u2019ll employ, overall with port development and infrastructure, and supply chain, and training as well as ship building that will employ millions, and millions, and millions of Chinese. So the government is very interested and they see cruise as an economic engine going forward. So you\u2019ve got the support of the central government and the various provincial municipal governments, so that\u2019s very important. The second thing is there\u2019s a growth market. ","The third thing is that growth is constrained. I know that percentage is not large and everything, but as I\u2019ve tried to point out in my opening comments, we\u2019re talking onesies, twosies, and ships. And the reason the growth is constrained is because we have large addressable markets that are underpenetrated everywhere in the world. And so we have lots of places to put ships these days, and so we are not going to just take all the ships in the existing markets and move them unity to China. And then there\u2019s constraint on the number of ships that can be built in China -- for the China market in the near term here. So all of those things put additional constraints. ","Beyond that clearly as we anticipated, as you guys have identified through your assessments and stuff that yields declined, we see China as a unit volume, a unit growth story as ultimately accretive to earnings, which it has been for us and overall helping us optimize yields across the global fleet and it\u2019s working really well. Having said that, there is a gap with distribution. It\u2019s an embryonic market. Distributors are finding their way for the first time in cruise. It is a charter market, a B2B market, so then it reduces possibilities of discontinuities that you might not see if you had a direct to consumer kind of a market. ","So all of those things are things we already knew going over. Those were affirmed. But the other thing I was affirmed was the enthusiasm for the government for the cruise industry, the fact that the guest satisfaction levels are high, that our ships are definitely occupied comparable to prior years, despite the insignificant percentage increases in capacity, and we see it as a future market. Now, having said all of that, with all the increases we are talking about, this 5% of our capacity next year with the additional increase, including the Majestic Princess will be the first purpose built ship for China entering late next year. Even with that, it\u2019s going to be 6% of our capacity. So we can only grow so fast, and because of the relatively small percentage of our total fleet, it\u2019s every manageable for us with any pits and stops or bumps in the road we might encounter. But we are committed to work with the distributor partners, our distributor partners in building a sustainable business in China.","Steven Wieczynski","So if I can follow up on that real quick, so is the biggest hurdle that you guys see still the distribution network, or is it the infrastructure is still not really in place at this point?","Arnold Donald","The short time opportunity of course is with the distribution system that benefit fully from the pent up demand there is for cruising by connecting it to the capacity there. So that\u2019s the immediate opportunity. The near term opportunity of course is to further develop the markets from a port and destination standpoint, and that\u2019s a near time opportunity and there\u2019s lots of work going on with that. So that\u2019s the next opportunity and the near time opportunity and we are working on and of course, the Chinese government is working on it. We are working on it in other places, the places the Chinese want to go to. So there\u2019s additional itinerary planning that needs to evolve in ports capable of taking the large number of Chinese guests that will be frequenting it.","Steven Kent","Okay, great. Last question, very simple. Your Caribbean bookings are, in terms of your commentary, are probably much better I think than folks would expect at this point. So is it fair to say the Zika impact is basically zero at this point?","Arnold Donald","Yes. We\u2019ve seen no material impact from Zika. We didn't get any cancelations or they\u2019re not enough to mention. We didn't see any impact on booking volume or timing or anything. So we have not seen an impact from Zika. Having said that, you know, could there be a little bit of noise? That is just overwhelmed by the great demand that there is for the Caribbean would have been even greater and hypothetically you can say that, but we have seen nothing to suggest there was impact from Zika.","Steven Kent","Okay, great. Thanks Arnold. ","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jamie Katz with Morningstar. Please go ahead. ","Jaime Katz","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I'm curious on the new ship builds that you guys are doing with CSSC, if there's any infrastructure spend that maybe needs to happen to facilitate that or whether that sort of goes under the China government spend plan and won't require very much investment on your part. ","Arnold Donald","No, there will be no investment on our part. First of all, just to explain the construct. CSSC and Fincantieri have a shipbuilding joint venture. Ourselves, CSSC and CIC have a joint venture on a ship-owning joint venture that\u2019s still being finalized, as well as a ship operating joint venture that is being operationalized -- is being finalized. So we are investing in the ship building infrastructure and I need to tell you that that\u2019s on the part of CSSC. I\u2019m not sure if Fincantieri is contributing to that or not. You\u2019d have to ask them. But that partnering with CSSC and ourselves, we're looking -- we will be at this point a minority participant in the joint venture, open to manage, the marketing and manage the fleet. But CSSC and CIC, these are the majority owners of the joint venture for the domestic Chinese effort. ","Jaime Katz ","Okay. And then your selling and administrative expenses came in quite a bit lower than we had modeled. Can you talk about maybe where you guys have made the most gains there and where you still see the best opportunity to gain on some of the expense structure you currently have in place?","Arnold Donald","We've had success across a number of fronts. We\u2019ll highlight more where we -- definitely we\u2019ll achieve our $75 million target this year and we'll have more detail on that in the next earnings call. But we continue to see opportunities across the board. Some highlights this year were freight and marketing as well as food provisioning. Going forward, we see additional opportunities in all those areas. Plus we're beginning to get to stores, our technical stores, which is a big area of expense for us, inventories on the ships et cetera. That takes a little more time to get things coded properly so you can monitor and measure, but we\u2019re starting to make progress there. David? ","Jaime Katz ","Okay, and then --","Arnold Donald","Excuse. I think David had a comment. Go ahead.","David Bernstein ","Yeah. On the SG&A expenses, of course I don't know exactly what\u2019s your model. We did give guidance for the whole year for net cruise cost without fuel being up 1.5%. We did beat our third quarter cost guidance because of the timing of certain expenses. And I mentioned that one of them was advertising. So we may have spent a little bit less in the third quarter in advertising than we previously anticipated, which could have affected your comparison. ","Jaime Katz ","Okay. Thank you so much. ","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup. Please go ahead. ","Greg Badishkanian","Great. Thanks. Just to follow up from Steve's question before on Zika, that you're not seeing a noticeable impact. Why do you think that you're performing better than some of your competitors in the Caribbean in the fourth quarter where we've been hearing about some aggressive discounts and promotions coming from some of those competitors lately?","Arnold Donald","We\u2019ll not make any comments obviously on the competitors, but just for ourselves, it runs the gamut from first and foremost. Our people and our brands have done a great job developing the guest experience and the guests are having just tremendous experiences and we are exceeding their expectations across the brands, as they go into the Caribbean, especially with the Carnival brand. So that's number one. Number two, in the case of the Carnival brand in particular again, we have a very large base of previous cruise-goers that are loyal to the brand and that obviously helps us because those people have experienced the brand and love it and want to do it again and again. And then thirdly, we're better in our revenue management skills. And so we have shared best practices across the brands on revenue management and our people are getting increasingly sophisticated and doing very, very well.","Also, we've anticipated a bit of an election slowdown, as historically there's always been a little fall off in booking volumes around election time. And so there could be some of that, but in our case again, right now we're doing so well, and we're so far ahead and the pricing is strong. We\u2019ve got great close-in pricing right now and so it's been very good. But relative to what the other companies, other cruise lines, I wouldn't have a comment, but other than to say I'm sure it's a combination of the relative moves they made in deployments and stuff, but I have no idea. ","David Bernstein","The only other thing I wanted to add is that in the Caribbean, keep in mind that our capacity is distributed across multiple home ports, which I think we benefit from as well. ","Greg Badishkanian","Okay. That's helpful. Moving to China and if you think about 2017 and how your negotiated pricing ultimately will end up, I know you're not going to give us a specific number right now, but maybe just some thoughts of how you think that that will proceed and also is the right way to think about it. If you're growing the capacity there by 26%, would you expect the profitability of your China business to grow equal or greater to that in 2017, so that's what you're managing to, that profitability growth. ","Arnold Donald","Real quickly, I think the important thing for us in China is to ensure that we are developing sustainable business there. Sustainable for our distributor partners, sustainable in terms of the government's desire to have the cruise industry be established there and obviously sustainable for us from a profit standpoint. So it has to be a win-win-win. So that begins the constraint around how much we will negotiate, because we're not going to negotiate to a point where it's not economical for us and that just won't happen. And so having said that, the other comment is if you take the impact this quarter, given even the additional consideration we've reflected in the guidance going forward, the impact for the full year yields for us is -- across our fleet is a rounding error. ","So we believe that we can effect a sustainable business in China over time. We're going to make practical economic decisions. Our assets are mobile. And because of such a small percentage, even in the future when we start looking at adding additional ships above our overall capacity, we can move a few ships around and manage things effectively through smart deployment. Having said that, for next year, right now we see good relationships with our distributor partners and an ability to attract value. Hopefully it will be proportionate to the capacity increase or greater, but at this point we haven't finalized those conversations and it's too early to give real guidance. ","David Bernstein","And also the capacity increase is driven to a great extent by the introduction of Majestic Princess and that's the first purpose built ship for the China market and we really do believe that that will generate a lot of great excitement and further stimulate demand in the market, which should be very helpful on the pricing side. ","Greg Badishkanian","Good. All right. That's helpful. Thank you. ","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. ","James Hardiman","Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. So a couple questions here. Obviously since the last time you guys reported, there were a number of geopolitical events. Could you maybe walk us through what happened during and following that time? It doesn't seem to have really hurt your numbers for the quarter or in terms of the outlook. Was it that you didn't see any impact on demand? Was it that you're maybe a little bit more insulated because you don't have a whole lot of exposure to US customers going to Europe? Or did it in fact impact your business and your yields would have been all the better for the third quarter and in terms of the outlook if it hadn't been for those geopolitical events?","Arnold Donald","Real quickly, in terms of that many US going to Europe, we do have in our Holland America brands, Princess brand, and even in our Cunard, we have a number of Americans who go to Europe across our brands, Seabourn, et cetera. So it is important to us. So the impact was this. In the cases when things got a little dicey in Istanbul, in Turkey, we obviously had to make deployment itinerary changes. So again, generally speaking, we go where guests want to go and we go obviously where all the information we have says it's okay to go, it's safe to go because safety is number one, obviously. ","So how it affects us is we make itinerary deployment changes, either because guests don\u2019t want to go or because we\u2019ve gotten intelligence in the world community that it's wiser not to go. It affects us that way. Initially we can see booking impacts right after an incident. Those tend to fade away. As you know, if you go back over years, this is not a year where this is the only time this has happened. It happens to some extent almost in recent times, almost every year for the last several years, as does a Zika or MERS or Asian flu, whatever these things, Ebola even. And so every year there's geopolitical tensions. There\u2019s some kind of disease consternation. There\u2019s macroeconomic malaise. There\u2019s isolated or concentrated over-capacity in the cruise industry. Every year in some markets around the world, those things happen and it's part of our business. ","So we manage that. We anticipate it. We change deployments. We do good revenue management practices, manage around it and that's basically it. So to us it's normal business. I wish it wasn't that way. Every now and then hopefully we'll get lucky and there won't be those incidents because we think we would do better. Some of those itineraries we had to redirect, our high yielding shore excursion items, which could have added additional revenue and earnings to the bottom line. ","We used to be in the Black Sea. We haven't been there in quite a while. The Black Sea was one of the highest yielding both from a ticket standpoint and on-board revenue standpoint, are itineraries we could have had. And so hopefully sometimes those things will work in our favor and we\u2019ll do even better. But right now we expect that stuff to happen every year and we have to manage it and we have to deliver double-digit return on invested capital in those environments. ","David Bernstein","One of the things that we've said previously is that, as Arnold indicated, there's always something going on out there and people to some extent have gotten used to that and they go on with their lives and they continue to travel and continue to book cruises. And so we did very well in the third quarter and as we had indicated, we raised our guidance for the year. ","James Hardiman","That's very helpful. And then my second question may or may not be related to the first, but can you talk a little about the slowdown in on-board. I know you mentioned that the comps are just fundamentally tougher. I guess A, was maybe some of that the results of some of the itinerary changes that you just spoke to or maybe sourcing changes as you try to bring in more Europeans to those European destinations versus North Americans, which typically spend more while on board? And then I guess just going forward, should we expect on-board to be a drag on overall yields going forward or does that revert back to where it\u2019s been the last year and half?","Arnold Donald","So first of all we\u2019ve had almost eight quarters of very strong on-board revenue growth. So the comparisons obviously are getting more difficult. On the other hand, we are still growing on-board revenue and it\u2019s still a growth story. So we would not characterize it as a drag. We would definitely characterize it as still accretive to the bottom line, because it is still growing and we think there is opportunity to grow beyond where we are today obviously.","David Bernstein","I guess some of it, if you look at the detail relative to the categories of on-boarding and what drove some of the change in the increase, we did see some really nice increases in both beverage and casino, which make up about half of the on-board revenue. And the areas where we saw some lower on-board revenue relating to shore excursions, which we talked about, relating to itinerary changes and itinerary optimization across the brands, as well as shops where last year benefited from some strong guarantee arrangements in 2015 and prior periods. ","James Hardiman ","Got it. Very helpful. Thanks guys. ","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura. Please go ahead. ","Harry Curtis","Good morning everybody. There seems to be some skepticism today about the outlook for your comments about next year, that it's still too early to tell much. Maybe you can give us a sense of how well booked you are overall fleet-wide this year versus the same time last year. And do you really think that it is too early to, with this data, to make any initial conclusions that you're off to a good start?","Arnold Donald","I think the conclusion is we\u2019re definitely off to a good start, but we\u2019re not prepared to give guidance yet in full for 2017. ","David Bernstein","We\u2019ll give guidance on the revenue side in December when we get closer, because it is far out at this point. Harry, we had said that we are ahead of the prior year and we're ahead at considerably higher prices. So we're feeling very good about that overall position. We had talked about how we were moving the booking curve further and further out, and we have continued to move it out for the early half of 2017. All the markets, I went through the details, both for the North American market and our EAA brands and everybody was pretty much ahead on pricing, except EAA for the Caribbean and Australia, which was in line. And I even said in those areas the booking activity for the last quarter was well ahead of the prior year. So those areas were, even though they were in line or slightly lower, they were improving. So we feel very good about the overall trend for the first half of 2017. ","Harry Curtis","So following up then on your comments about the yield management roll out, to what degree do you think the yield management, the new system is or maybe having or playing a factor in these higher prices? And perhaps you could just educate us on what's changing. ","Arnold Donald","Well, first of all in terms of the impact of the new system, you're not seeing much direct impact on the new system right now. You\u2019ll see on maybe 30% of inventory going into \u201917 some impact and then the full impact for the current state of the system, and it will take it to a higher level next year, but the full impact for the current state of the system will probably be more in 2018. What you are seeing though is the fact -- just the fact by working on it, we're sharing best practices across our 10 world leading cruise line brands, and that sharing and them working together on the two and so on clearly has been advantageous and has boosted our yields. ","Beyond that, again as I mentioned, is a combination of creating demand of clever deployment, and of exceeding guest expectations once on board so that when they leave, they help us create demand themselves not only for them to come back, for others that they share with. The brands are differentiated. That helps as well and we've done some smart things in terms of -- within the brands of our various home porting decisions and distributing the home ports to access various destination markets. So it's a combination of things. We have good momentum. That has to be maintained. Of course what will help us in the end is, if the other cruise companies also fill and fill at high prices, that ultimately is helpful to us. If they don't, that's a drag for us because it sets a psychological tone in the marketplace. But right now we are doing very well and the first half of next year looks very strong.","David Bernstein","The only thing I want to add to that, the one of the thing that\u2019s been very helpful is the brands have been working collectively together comparing pricing, making decisions and as a result of that, given the fact that the size of our company, I think that has benefited us tremendously over the last couple of years as well. ","Harry Curtis","Thank you. And just a quick shifting of gears here. Carnival is rapidly becoming an impressive free cash flow generator, and in it seems the market is valuing higher dividends today more than it has in the last decade. Have you given consideration to even getting more aggressive with dividend payout versus share repurchases? How do you prioritize at this point one versus another? ","Arnold Donald","First of all, clearly that\u2019s the board decision right off the bat, but having said that, historically you\u2019ve seen what we've done where we've done a combination of dividend increases and share buyback. I'm sure that trend will continue in the future, but we evaluate it constantly and we\u2019ll see where the board wants to go. Our current dividend yield is strong, but we\u2019ll be evaluating that each quarter. ","David Bernstein","One of the things we've said in the past is that we are targeting a 40% to 50% dividend payout ratio. So one of the things you do want to be careful of, we want to make sure that our dividend is sustainable through all cycles. And so we feel like staying within that range, it would be sustainable. So you can take that as guidance. That's what we discussed with the board, and we continue to target that. ","Harry Curtis","Thanks very much guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David Beckel with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.","David Beckel","Thanks a lot for the question, and thanks particularly for all your Chinese commentary. Really appreciate that, but I\u2019ll lobe another one in there just for good measure. You talk a lot about net revenue yields in the region. I was wondering, what I haven't heard as much is any color on the trajectory of net cruise cost, specifically as it relates to China, inclusive of things like office expansion, incremental marketing and the like. Could you potentially provide us any color or context around how to think about that for that region? ","Arnold Donald","I'll make the comment, but I think it\u2019s very important that David comments since his last name is the namesake for your firm it seems like. But in any event, look, it's an embryonic market. We think there are opportunities over time to actually improve our net cruise cost position on ALBD basis, as we expand and get greater scale and so on. And we think there's opportunity to actually improve that part of the equation as well. Right now it\u2019s not the driver for anything, but as we get more capacity there and we begin to expand our supply chains, training centers and so on and so forth, we think we'll be able to actually over time improve on that cruise cost.","David Bernstein","As Arnold indicated, I mean in 2015 we had eight offices in China. We went to 16 offices in 2016, and we're going to open up four more and in 2017. So clearly we are making an investment, but we believe the investment is for the long term. Keep in mind that we've got an $8 billion cost base. So a 1 percentage change, a 1.0 change on net cruise cost without fuel is $80 million. So an investment in China is really just fractions of a percent and a very small change in the overall picture for a company our size. ","David Beckel","That's really helpful. Thanks. And as a follow up, I just wanted to ask a question about the distribution system in China. I was curious, we've heard some color about various selling practices on the ground in China. I was curious what level of control you have with respect to pricing discipline from the travel agent community. Thanks. ","Arnold Donald","You bet. First of all, basically for us right now it\u2019s a B2B business. We charter with some Asia distributors. They then sell through their network, but they often in turn expand their network through sub-agents or sub-distributors. And that's a negotiation between them and those sub-distributors on pricing and so on. So how we control the pricing, which we don't really per se control, we control what price we're getting and then it\u2019s up to them to manage to see how much profit they\u2019re going to take and so on and so forth. But all the control we have is in the end, if they come back and say hey, I didn\u2019t do as well as I thought, why don\u2019t you help me out, et cetera? ","That\u2019s a negotiation that\u2019s afoot and it happens every year. But that\u2019s the level of control we have by our degree of willingness to negotiate. Some cases they may have had legitimate challenges. In some cases they\u2019re just negotiating to get a better deal and you\u2019ve got to do your best to sort all that out when you don\u2019t have total transparency to the ultimate price that the Chinese guest that was on the ship paid. We try to get at that various ways, but of course others try to make certain we can\u2019t get to that information, and that\u2019s a just business, normal in business. You can think of other constructs in other places where a manufacturer sells to a distributor and may not know exactly what that distributor priced that and so on in any other market, any other industry. So that\u2019s the nature of the business today. Over time, that will probably evolve to a different model, but that\u2019s what it is today.","David Beckel","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Jamie Rollo with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Jamie Rollo","Yes. Thank you. First of all, on the supply growth in the industry, you said that Carnival's only growing at 3% to 4% out to 2020, but obviously the industry order book is much bigger than that. So, I'm just wondering what your thoughts are on the size of that order book. It's clearly much, much bigger than it was at the last peak. Particularly if China's been able to absorb those new ships, are you worried about the capacity in the developed markets a few years hence?","Arnold Donald","I think that obviously China is growing rapidly and is able to absorb a lot of capacity that makes everything easier. But on the other hand, as I tried to point out earlier on the call and some of the questions, China is going to be limited in how many ships are going to be available for it to take because people are building ships for other markets as well. I think what you have to think about is net capacity growth. So we\u2019re always going to build new ships and so will others and the reason is because the ships are more efficient and they give you the opportunity for enhanced revenue opportunity, versus the existing ships. And so new ships are always going to be coming. The question is, how many ships leave? How many ships go to secondary markets and so on? ","And in the opening comments, I referenced the fact that the number of berths that are getting to retirement, the amount of capacity that\u2019s going to retirement age is going to double in 2020 and going to double again in 2024. And so there will be a need for some of that capacity just to replace. And then the rest will get regulated by the market place. If there\u2019s scarce supply relative to demand, some of the less efficient ships will continue to sail. If there\u2019s not that relative scarcity, then some of those ships will exit. They\u2019ll either go into secondary markets or they\u2019ll leave the fleet and be scrapped. And so that\u2019s the real dynamic. We know what we\u2019re going to do. We are committed to measure capacity growth and we know how to manage within our brands and across the various destinations. And so based on that, we have great confidence that we\u2019ll be able to manage to the sustained double digit return on invested capital that we have promised within the next two years.","Jamie Rollo","Thanks. And a couple of housekeeping ones, please. You mentioned fuel and FX $0.28 headwind for next year. Depreciation I get to $0.12 from the $1.9 billion. Did you give us figures for dry dock?","David Bernstein","For dry dock, I didn\u2019t give a figure, but the dry dock has increased. It\u2019s probably worth a little bit less than a half a point on a year over year basis for net cruise costs, excluding fuel.","Jamie Rollo","0.5% headwind to net cruise cost ex fuel? Okay.","David Bernstein","Less than half a point. A little bit less.","Jamie Rollo","Got it. And then could you -- the 100 basis point yield benefit from the accounting change, was that evenly spread through this year? Did that help every quarter, including Q3?","David Bernstein","Yes. The accounting replay was pretty much evenly spread through the year.","Jamie Rollo","Okay. And final one, the weakness in on-boards, that's nothing to do with onboard credits or given the way you account for those -- do those come through the ticket line or the on-board line?","David Bernstein","If somebody gets an on-board credit associated with a value package where they are purchasing it ahead of time, then that is a reduction in the ticket price and we get the full benefit of the onboard. So we didn\u2019t have anything to do with that, the items I had mentioned.","Arnold Donald","But onboard is not -- I may have misheard what you said at the beginning, but we\u2019re not weakening in onboard. We\u2019re still growing onboard. It\u2019s just not at the rapid rate that we had in some of the previous quarters. And then I just want to add one comment too concerning the new builds and that is, for us, because we have 10 brands, 3% to 4% is not the same as 3% to 4% for a single brand type of cruise company. So we\u2019re speeding out these new builds across a number of brands, which gives that brand base an opportunity to absorb the capacity while they\u2019re creating the excess demand required to get relative scarcity that we\u2019re chasing. So we are overall managing to measure capacity growth in total, but we\u2019re also doing it by brand and that allows us to more effectively manage against a committed base of loyal cruisers to that brand and reduce the number of new to cruise at any point in time we have to generate for any given brand.","Jamie Rollo","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Jared Shojaian","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I know you don't want to give formal guidance for 2017, so I'm going to try to ask this a bit differently. But if I look at your booking commentary for 2017 now, it seems better than your commentary for 2016 at this time last year. And now you're doing 2.5% yield growth ex the accounting reclassification in a year where you've had unexpected headwinds. So I guess the question is, just directionally, is there any reason why the yield growth in 2016 can't be replicated again in 2017? Thanks.","Arnold Donald","That\u2019s a clever way of asking for guidance on that, Jared, but I will say this, that you\u2019re absolutely accurate, that this time last year, while we were ahead of bookings, we were not ahead on pricing and this year we\u2019re ahead on bookings and pricing. So that\u2019s obviously strong momentum going forward. It\u2019s still early though and I think we have to just continue to work hard and let things play out, but I\u2019d rather be displaced and give you guys guidance at the appropriate time.","David Bernstein","And you said we had headwinds this. As Arnold indicated, we\u2019re going to have some sort of headwinds every year. There\u2019s always some political event or something that goes on around the world. So just keep that in mind as well.","Jared Shojaian","Okay. Thanks. I figured I'd try. ","Arnold Donald","That was very good.","Jared Shojaian","And then just a follow-up question. I haven't heard anything on Cuba on the call today. I know earlier this year you said you expected to have more deployments by year end. Is that still your expectation? Curious anything you can share on that. Thanks.","Arnold Donald","At the risk of you playing a tape back, I think we said we were hopeful we have additional by year end, and I\u2019d say at this point in time, while that\u2019s a possibility, we might know something before this year is out about additional brands going next year into Cuba. Again we are hopeful. I wouldn\u2019t say we expect it, but we are working on it and hopeful. As you know, to date, we are the only ones that have received approval by Cuba to sail to and from Cuba from the US. So we\u2019re the only ones so far. I\u2019m sure that will change. Exactly when it will change and how many other brands we can get in there beyond our Fathom brand that we have now remains to be seen, but we\u2019re in constant conversation with the various authorities in Cuba.","It\u2019s been an exciting year in that regard for us. It\u2019s helped us across our fleet in a number of ways with the positive media and so on and so forth, but beyond all that, while it hasn\u2019t been find with a single ship of 700 guests, obviously financially it\u2019s not usually material. But it has been important in establishing the relationships and the dialog and the partnerships to prepare the foundation for what will be a destination that will help refresh the Caribbean and ultimately contribute to that relative scarcity that I like to talk about, excess demand relative to supply and be a source of strength for yields and returns in the years to come.","Jared Shojaian","Okay. Thank you very much.","David Bernstein","Operator, we are over our allotted time, but we will take one more question, if there\u2019s one out there.","Operator","Of course. Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Tim Conder","Thank you for squeezing me in here. Just a couple of maybe housekeeping. Arnold, you talked about that I think maybe the investment community's focused excessively on the gross capacity growth and ignored the net capacity growth. So, a couple related to that. One, could you maybe give us industry expected net capacity growth by major regions for 2017? And then, two, just maybe a range of top line here looking out through that 2020 on that industry net capacity growth as you see it at this time. And I guess maybe another way to ask that latter part is, should we anticipate a -- what type of range of retirements each year on a go-forward basis to go from gross to net, I guess is another way to ask that.","Arnold Donald","I understand you guys have modeled that you kind of need to populate with data and some of the variables, but the practical reality is beyond 2017, as we go into the future, that\u2019s a flex thing and in our case, we\u2019re going to manage it as we read the markets in terms of what relative scarcity exists, what\u2019s the demand that\u2019s been created relative to the supply and what we see, and basically we can do that relatively easily financially because we look at the ships and see what kind of returns we\u2019re getting on them and what the probability as well for increased performance or better performance in the coming year. So for us, that will be a flex thing. Historically, I think we\u2019ve averaged a little more than a ship a year \u2026","David Bernstein","It\u2019s one or two ships a year we sold.","Arnold Donald","For us.","David Bernstein","Yeah. 18 ships since 2006 and so we\u2019ve said a number of times that we could expect to see something along that pace, or as Arnold indicated, to be more or less. It\u2019s very hard to tell.","Arnold Donald","I wouldn\u2019t try to make an assumption for the industry again in terms of net, but again what we\u2019re looking at is how do we manage in various environments and how do we ensure that we\u2019re going to deliver sustained double digit return on invested capital and improve earnings growth in various environments and we\u2019re confident we\u2019ve got multiple pathways to do that and some of those, if proves to be necessary includes accelerating retirements.","Tim Conder","Okay. And then the capacity by region for 2017 for the industry as you see it at this point, say Europe and whether you want to break that into Med, ex-Med, North America and just Asia in general.","David Bernstein","The way we see it right now is that for the year, the Caribbean and again, this is the industry, is up 6%. Europe is down approximately 4%. Actually the Med is down 11%, but northern Europe is expected to be up about 9%. We\u2019re looking at Alaska, up close to 7% and overall the industry, all other programs. So overall the industry is going to be up about 4% from a capacity perspective.","Tim Conder","For the global industry, up 4% on a net basis?","Arnold Donald","Yes.","David Bernstein","Correct.","Tim Conder","Okay. And then is China, still mix accretive to your global capacity, mix accretive on an EBITDA basis?","Arnold Donald","Yes. It\u2019s relative overall.","David Bernstein","As Arnold indicated, by having the ships in China, each of our brands, both Costa and Princess are optimizing their operating income and net profits.","Tim Conder","Okay. And then very last, China, is that the reason you said some contracts rolled off on onboard? Was it China or was it elsewhere?","Arnold Donald","No.","David Bernstein","No, no. this had nothing to do with China. I said there was some guarantee arrangements for onboard on the shop side with certain of our brands which we benefited from in 2015 and prior years that didn\u2019t repeat itself in 2016.","Arnold Donald","Hey guys, thank you for your interest. We really appreciate the questions and the attention. We\u2019re committed to, as we\u2019ve always said, to exceed our guests\u2019 expectations, leverage our scale and to deliver sustainable double digit return on invested capital. We\u2019re enjoying a great quarter, a very strong year, happy to raise the guidance and looking forward to delivering in the years to come as well. Thank you very much."],"4231":["Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) Q3 2014 Results Earnings Conference Call September 23, 2014 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Arnold Donald - Chief Executive Officer","David Bernstein - Chief Financial Officer","Beth Roberts - Vice President, Investor Relations","Micky Arison - Chairman","Analysts","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays","Joel Simkins - Credit Suisse","Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs","Steve Wieczynski - Stifel","Harry Curtis - Nomura","Jaime Katz - Morningstar","Assia Georgieva - Infiniti Research","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo Securities","Robin Farley - UBS","Nick Thomas - Merrill Lynch","Stuart Gordon - Berenberg","Jamie Rollo - Morgan Stanley","Ian Rennardson - Jefferies","Arnold Donald","Good morning. This is Arnold Donald, CEO of Carnival Corporation & plc. I\u2019d like to thank you all for joining us for our Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Today I am joined by David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Roberts, our Vice President of Investor Relations. Although, our Chairman, Micky Arison is traveling today, he is on the phone with us.","Before I begin, please note that because some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking, I must refer you to the obligatory cautionary statement in today\u2019s press release.","This is an exciting time for our corporation. Last quarter we indicated that we felt like we were turning the corner and our third quarter confirmed that we have. The 15% earnings improvement achieved in the third quarter and the increased guidance expected an even stronger improvement in full year earnings is truly a credit to our global team.","I am especially pleased to see yields inflect positively in the third quarter, and we are well-positioned to continue that trend. There is a notable lengthening in the booking curve, particularly across our European brands and bookings taken during the last quarter are running ahead at higher prices in both North America and Europe for the first half of next year.","As it relates to effectively leveraging our scale to drive revenue and contain costs, our efforts and communicating, collaborating and coordinating across our brands are beginning to take hold, producing a few smaller early wins and showing progress in areas that would deliver in 2015 and beyond. We should have more to say in that arena next quarter.","We are wrapping up our planning process which has me very excited about our business going forward. Fuel and environmental related investments will temporarily impact our costs progress primarily in 2015.","Frankly, I am personally impatient to realize even stronger results more quickly, but it is clearly in all of our best interest to make the investments in environmental stewardship and energy saving technology that we are planning for next year. Not only do we view sustainability as the core guiding principle, these one-off expenses next year will yield financial benefits to us for many years to come.","As you know, higher fuel prices had a meaningful impact on our business model, accounting for 5 point reduction in return on invested capital to-date. Without mitigation, the impending eco requirements were originally expected to have a further $0.35 reduction on earnings when effective in 2015.","We plan to aggressively roll out our new technology developed over the last three years limiting the cost impact of eco to approximately $0.10 in 2015 and virtually eliminating any impact whatsoever by 2017 while protecting the environment.","At the same time, we have a series of technology initiatives in progress related to energy efficiency in areas like propulsion, lighting and air conditioning to name a few that we will continue to roll out during the resulting accelerated dry dock schedule. These initiatives have a quick payback period as we continue to steadily reduce few consumption in the years to come.","It is gratifying to say we have reduced our fuel consumption by another 5% this year and 25% since 2007, meeting our stated goal of delivering a 20% reduction in carbon emissions ahead of schedule while saving more than 1 billion gallons of fuel and $2.5 billion of fuel cost during that period.","This efficiency improvement is a testament to the breadth of efforts undertaken to reduce the consumption on more of the existing fleet and the energy efficient advances that have been designed into the new ships delivered during this time period.","During the third quarter, we\u2019re also pleased with the steady progress that both our Carnival and Costa brands have made. Carnival Cruise Lines was recognized in YouGov 2014 mid-year Buzz Rankings Report as the most improved in consumer perception among all brands in the U.S., a nice affirmation of the success of the combination of recent marketing and product initiative as well as the effective public relation.","Our teams put a lot of effort into achieving the sharp turnaround and it\u2019s gratifying to see their effort recognized. We\u2019ve had great success with Seuss at Sea and Camp Ocean for the kids and for the adults with our Concert Series Carnival LIVE. Carnival LIVE has presented 24 concerts over 18,000 of our guests and will present 25 more concerts by year end with over 12,000 tickets already sold.","In addition, we recently renewed the Great Vacation Guarantee, a hassle-free program that provides 110% refund if you\u2019re dissatisfied. As you might expect, we\u2019ve had very few who have requested that refund. In fact, our guest satisfaction has increased substantially since we launched Fun Ship 2.0 in the fall of 2011. We have now added 300 Fun Ship 2.0 experiences across the Carnival Cruise Line fleet. ","For the Costa brands, we have seen a steady improvement in both yields and profitability as well as the doubling of trust and confidence in brand perception in the core markets.","We are well positioned for continued success in 2015 as we welcome the Costa Diadema to the fleet to be celebrated in November 7th during a special christening event in Genoa, Italy with the ship\u2019s Godmother selected from participants and a worldwide travel agent competition.","Two days earlier on November 5th in Fort Lauderdale, Princess will also celebrate its newest cruise ship which entered service in May, the Regal Princess, with the naming ceremony featuring the original cast members of the TV series, The Love Boat, as Godparents. 2015 marks the 50th anniversary of Princess Cruises and there are a plethora of special activities planned for our guests throughout the year.","In July, Princess announced plans to build another new ship which will enter service in 2017. The vessel will carry 3600 passengers and feature the successful design platform introduced by sister ships, Royal Princess and the aforementioned Regal Princess.","In keeping with our company\u2019s strategy of measured capacity growth, this will be our only newbuild in 2017. And we also have plans underway to sell the smaller Ocean Princess. And speaking of celebrations, the Queen Mary 2, 10-year anniversary celebrations last quarter included James Taylor entertaining Cunard guests on a transatlantic crossing.","In July, Cunard, which remains the aspirational cruise experience for many around the world, was recognized as number one among the top megaship cruise liners in Travel and Leisure\u2019s annual reader survey for the world\u2019s best award 2014. During the quarter, we furthered our efforts to stimulate demand across the globe.","I\u2019m particularly pleased with our public relations efforts and really want to recognize the efforts of all our public relations teams across the company. We enjoyed a significant increase in our share of voice globally. In fact, in the most recent quarter, our positive mentions doubled based on the many operational and guest improvements being implemented by all our brands.","While we made a great stride in getting our message out, there are many additional opportunities ahead for us. ","Also with respect to stimulating demand, China continues to be a focus for emerging market development where we expect double-digit growth over the next few years.","We expect China to some day be the largest cruise market in the world. We are already the largest cruise operator in Mainland China, having been the first to enter the market through our Costa brand in 2006. Our China operations have been profitable and continued to improve as we increase yields and add more capacity.","Next year, we will again lead the industry with four ships home porting in Mainland China and 12 marketing offices in the region. At all levels, the Chinese government and government affiliate organizations including the Ministry of Transport, the National Tourism Administration, the municipal and port authorities in for example, Shanghai and Tianjin, and the China Cruise & Yacht Industry Association have demonstrated impressive vision, and have worked hard to pave the way for the development of the cruise industry in China, reflecting the high importance we place on future growth with China to support our brands with strategic initiatives and coordinate our growth strategy in China. Our Chief Operations Officer, Alan Buckelew will relocate to Shanghai and manage his full corporate responsibilities from there.","Again, the third quarter was strong. Our guidance for the year is up significantly. We are making real progress across many fronts, and we are excited about our prospects of returning to double-digit return on invested capital in the next three to five years.","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to David to take you through our financial results and updated guidance. David?","David Bernstein","Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note all of my references to revenue and cost metrics will be in local currency, as this is a much more meaningful measure of our business trends. I will start today with a summary of our excellent third quarter results and then give you more detail on our improved 2014 full year guidance. And while it is early, I will finish up with some preliminary insights into what we are seeing for 2015.","Our non-GAAP EPS for the third quarter was a $1.58. I\u2019m excited to report that this was $0.17 above the midpoint of our June guidance, driven essentially by three things. First, better than expected net revenue yields worth $0.11, which was evenly split between ticket and onboard and other yields. Second, lower than expected net cruise cost without fuels worth $0.03, and third, lower fuel prices worth $0.02.","We were pleased to see that net revenue yields and net ticket yields both turned positive in the third quarter, which we believe is the beginning of the positive trends we\u2019ve been expecting. On the cost side, the slightly lower than expected net cruise cost without fuel was simply due to the timing of certain expenses between third and fourth quarter.","Now, let\u2019s look at our third quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 2%. The North American brands were up almost 4%, while our European, Australia and Asia brands also known as our EAA brands were essentially flat. Our total net revenue yields in the third quarter were up almost 2% despite lower occupancy. Although I\u2019m happy to say that occupancy was almost a point higher than we had anticipated in our June guidance.","Now, let\u2019s break apart to two components of net revenue yields. Net ticket yields were up almost 1% and this was driven by our EAA brands being up 4%, resulting from improvements at our Continental European brands and double-digit increases in China. Our North American brands were down just over 1% due to the continued promotional pricing environment in the Caribbean. However, the yields were better than we had anticipated in our June guidance both in terms of price and occupancy.","Net onboard and other yields increased over 5% despite lower occupancy, with increases on both sides of the Atlantic and across the board in almost all categories. This increase was considerably more positive than we anticipated in our June guidance. It was a great quarter for onboard revenue. Net cruise costs per available lower berth day excluding fuel, was up 0.5 point, and that was less than our June guidance due again to the timing of certain expenses.","In summary, third quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.20 higher than the prior year, driven by improved net revenue yields worth $0.09, the 2% capacity increase, favorable exchange rates, improved fuel consumption, and lower fuel prices.","Now looking forward at our fourth quarter yield expectations. With the overwhelming majority of the quarter booked at this point at higher prices, we are well-positioned to achieve our fourth quarter total net revenue yield guidance of up 1.5% to 2.5%. This is due in part to our expectation that the North American brands net ticket yields will turn positive consistent with what we discussed on the June conference call. Remember the EAA brands turn positive in the second quarter. Given the overall positive yield trends in the back half of 2014, we now expect full year 2014 net revenue yields to be flat with the prior year.","Turning to the cost side. With the majority of the year now complete, we have narrowed the range on our full year cost guidance. We now expect net cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD to be up slightly. Putting these factors together, our 2014 non-GAAP EPS guidance is $1.84 to $1.88 per share with the midpoint that is $0.19 higher than our June guidance. Essentially we flowed through the better than expected third quarter yields worth $0.11 and increased our fourth quarter revenue yield forecast slightly. We also benefited by $0.04 from the net impact of fuel prices and currency. While it\u2019s still early, I am going to provide you with some color on what we\u2019re seeing for 2015. At this point, cumulative fleet-wide bookings for the first half of 2015 are ahead at higher prices.","Now let\u2019s look at the booking patterns for each of our two major business segment for the first half of 2015. First, for our North American brands. The Caribbean is ahead on both price and occupancy and represents 56% than the first half of 2015 capacity, while other North American brand deployments combined, which includes the early part of the seasonal European program are also ahead on both price and occupancy. Booking volumes during the last quarter have been good, ahead of the prior year at nicely higher prices. Secondly, our EAA brands are also ahead on occupancy but prices that are just about in line with the prior year. Booking volumes during the last quarter are higher than the prior year at slightly higher prices.","With increased net ticket yields expected for both our business segments for the fourth quarter of 2014 and positive early booking patterns for the first half of 2015, we are confident that we will see solid yield improvements for 2015. As we usually do, we will provide detailed yield guidance for 2015 during our December conference call.","Having completed our planning meetings with all our brands for 2015, the cost picture is taking shape. As we indicated in the press release, we expect net cruise costs per available lower berth days to be up around 3% for 2015. The majority of the increase is due to significantly higher dry-dock days in 2015, as we are working hard to accomplish a number of things. First, installing exhaust gas cleaning systems, or EGCS, more commonly known scrubbers, which will reduce the impact of the new 2015 eco requirements. Second, installing new fuel efficiency technology to reduce fuel consumption. And third, completing the vessel enhancements we announced last year.","As we look further out to 2016, we expect that the majority of the higher dry-dock costs in 2015 will be reversed since we currently anticipate a lower level of dry-dock days in 2016. I am pleased to report that the various cost initiatives that we are working on for 2015 and beyond are beginning to take shape and are expected to completely offset inflation in 2015. However, we won\u2019t rest there. Over the years we have developed an excellent track record of cost control, and we will continue to focus on leveraging our scale and reduce costs further in 2015 and beyond.","As Arnold indicated, we are aggressively rolling out the EGCS on our ships. The currency schedule calls for EGCS to be installed on 16 ships before the beginning of fiscal year 2014 and 42 ships are expected to have commissioned EGCs by the end of fiscal year 2015. We expect these efforts to mitigate the vast majority of the impact from the new ICA requirement.","As we indicated in the press release, we currently estimate that the new requirements will cost us about $0.10 in 2015. Going forward, we expect about half of this to disappear in 2016 and the remainder should just about disappear in 2017 as the result of the installation of EGCs on additional ships.","And now operator, we\u2019re ready to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays","Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. David, since you ended on cost, I\u2019ll start my question there. Thank you for all the color regarding the increase -- regarding -- related to the higher dry dock days and what\u2019s driving that? You mentioned this a little bit in your prepared remarks but I\u2019m wondering if you could just give us some color about what is going on with your just underlying cost structure ex this dry dock cost driver? What\u2019s going on with your current ongoing cost saving initiatives? And is there any way that those might further offset this cost guidance that you provided us with today?","David Bernstein","Felicia, about two-thirds of the cost increases, I said, was relating to dry dock and the other third was really an investment in various areas of the business in terms of things like deployment and occupancy and other things, which are driving the remainder of the increase. And on the flipside, I think as Arnold indicated lot of the leveraging our scale and the efficiencies are taking hold and we\u2019re expecting to see that completely offset inflation. We\u2019re still working very hard, that\u2019s our direction at this point and as we made greater strides, we\u2019ll update all our projections and forecasts accordingly.","Arnold Donald","Felicia, as we offset the inflation with some of the initiatives that we have, we\u2019re looking aggressively. We\u2019re not afraid to invest if we see a line of sight return from that investment. So we aren\u2019t afraid to reinvest to the business to drive yields and to drive revenues. So you\u2019ve got a mix going on there some of the cost increases in vessels.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays","Okay. Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And Arnold, there was a comment in the release that you made your recording statement that you\u2019re gaining momentum towards your goal of achieving double-digit returns in ROIC over time. I was just wondering if you could talk more about that comment over what time -- obviously, we\u2019re not looking for specific date. I know you not going to give one but are you thinking about over the next two to three years or are you looking at longer than that?","Arnold Donald","We\u2019re looking at three to five years to get to double-digit returns. So we have a large business here, system hits with fuel increases and other things. But we definitely see the path in the next three to five years to get to double-digit return on invested capital.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays","Okay. Super helpful. Thank you. And then just David, one last housekeeping, your occupancy rate in the quarter actually came in lower than we are expecting. And we were estimating kind of this strategy that you\u2019re using and then near-term to kind of navigate through the tough promotional environment in the Caribbean. I'm just wondering, how should we think about occupancy rate in the fourth quarter? And in 2015, do you think this strategy will continue? It sounds like things are getting better in the Caribbean for you. Thank you.","David Bernstein","Sure. Well, I\u2019m not sure. Our occupancy rate came in 1.7 points below the prior year, which as I think I indicated in my notes was a bit better than we had anticipated. So we were able to do much better. That was part of the yield improvement that we saw in the third quarter. And as we move forward, I think, I talked about this on the last conference call that holding price and giving up some occupancy is purely a tactic.","We will continue to work through that. If the tactic makes sense, we\u2019ll utilize it. But I think as I indicated just a moment ago, as part of our cost increase one of the things was higher occupancy relating to the variable cost of food and port charges, etcetera. So we\u2019re hopeful that as we move forward, part of that yield improvement is the higher occupancy for 2015.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays","","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joel Simkins with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Joel Simkins - Credit Suisse","","Good morning, everyone. Obviously, you guys are very positive on the Chinese market, and that\u2019s certainly been developing over a number of years here. I guess, can you sort of juxtapose what you\u2019re seeing perhaps in Macau, and does that give you any pause as it relates to sort of continuing to add capacity in and around China?","Arnold Donald","I think Macau is the destination for those who like gaming, and we are actually in a true cruise product. And so today, those selling on our cruises, actually our casino opportunities to date have not been strong on our ships, because they are really going for a cruise. They have families, etcetera. So I\u2019m not exactly sure we\u2019re referencing in Macau, but in terms of the cruise opportunity, the Chinese government has shown a lot of vision. They\u2019ve made developing the cruise industry a priority. And with their support, companies like ourselves have a tremendous opportunity to tap into what is a huge market possibly and we\u2019ve enjoyed early success and plan to build on it.","Joel Simkins - Credit Suisse","","And one quick follow-up if I may Arnold. I guess if you\u2019re to sort of peg a 1% of your yield improvement and sort of the improvement in booking activity for 2015 directly to some of the revitalization that you\u2019ve done over the last year or so, particularly on the Carnival brand, I mean what percentage you think is contributing towards that improvement?","Arnold Donald","","Yes, it would be very difficult to say, to isolate variables like that. What I can tell you is that we have definitely gained momentum across the brands in terms of best practices. We haven\u2019t finished our revenue management project, but already we\u2019ve had lift on isolated itineraries across brands as they collaborate appropriately. Also on onboard revenue, some of the onboard revenue lift we\u2019ve experienced has come from again great collaboration across the brands, identifying best practices. We see that continuing to build in even more dramatic fashion than we\u2019ve experienced to-date because we\u2019ve only touched the tip of the iceberg today.","Joel Simkins - Credit Suisse","","Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Mr. Kent, your line is open.","Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs","Yeah. A couple -- can you hear me?","Arnold Donald","","Yes, Steven, we can hear you.","Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs","","Okay. So I guess just on Joel\u2019s question. On the China opportunity, what has changed there do you think that you\u2019re willing -- more willing to commit ships and human capital to the market, especially putting COO and I am assuming some other management people there, because in the past China has been a little bit more difficult and that hasn\u2019t been a home run?","And then separately, Arnold, because you just mentioned this, the cross collaboration which has been a big focus of yours on that onboard spend, could there be more to go as you start to integrate some of those great ideas and maybe you could share some of the specific best practices that you\u2019ve seen? And then one final thing -- and I\u2019m sorry I ask this fairly frequently, why not set a more specific cost target for the next couple of years? You now sort of set an ROIC target of three to five years, why not set something more on the expense front? Thank you.","Arnold Donald","Okay. Thank you, Steven. So your first question concerning China, we began investing in China in 2006. The Costa brand, as I mentioned, in the introduction here was the first brand to do so in China. And things take time to develop and we have been successful in developing our business there and others have come in now as well. What\u2019s changed in addition to that, first was it just takes time to develop a market. But what\u2019s changing in addition to that is that the government has it as a priority now.","The Chinese government has a plan for development of a cruise industry in China and that means, you are getting tremendous support and opportunity to participate led by the various governments whether it\u2019s the Central Government or the provincial or the municipal governments like in Shanghai and Tianjin. And so all of that bodes well, we are beginning to gain momentum. Distribution system is learning how to market a product such as a cruise product. You are beginning to see players in China look at building the domestic brand, which we think will be real powerful at to developing that market.","So that\u2019s basically what is going on in China, and then getting enough scale that it does take cost, obviously, to build brands and to build the presence, and now, obviously, with the number of ships we have there now and the ones we are going to add, we are beginning to get scale so the opportunity for greater profitability is there. So that\u2019s the quick answer on China.","David Bernstein","Yeah. Let me just add one other point on that. Steve, we have talked about this before, historically, as Arnold said, we started in \u201906 and we were investing in China, which was a nice way of saying we were losing money, we broke even in \u201912, we made money in \u201913 and \u201914, we saw double-digit yield increases in China and the performance of our ships in China has been excellent and so we are very excited about the opportunity as we move forward. To your second question\u2026","Arnold Donald","No. Concerning onboard revenue, your second question, in terms of is there additional opportunity? Absolutely, we had a 5% lift in onboard revenues in this quarter to suggest that we will have a 5% lift every quarter from hereon on out, we will probably not be anywhere near the right thing to say. But, clearly, we see opportunity in specific areas. We had an area in casino, we had area in beverage upgrades and restaurants upgrade opportunities. There are host of others. But we are just at the tip of that in terms of really harvesting what is possible there. And then you last question.","David Bernstein","Was relating to the specific cost target heading back\u2026","Arnold Donald","Yeah. In terms of giving you a specific number on costs, as we mentioned, directionally, we see as offsetting inflation, that\u2019s a $75 million to $80 million number on to itself. We haven\u2019t finished all of the projects yet. We are in the middle with the airlines in terms of our airline RFPs. Obviously, we are not going to give a number on that because we are on negotiation with them as we speak that will be wrapping up soon. And I think we will have more to say in the fourth quarter.","But in terms of saying a specific target, the reality is, we are going to reinvest in the business too. So, I think, we will give you one-off as we determine them and we will share with you what we\u2019re reinvesting in at the appropriate time and whether or not we think we will pay it off. Thank you, Steve.","Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thank you.","David Bernstein","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Steve Wieczynski - Stifel","Yeah. Good morning, guys. So, David, going back to your cost guidance for 2015 and 2016, I guess. Is it fair to say, I mean, if we simplify this that basically in \u201915 and \u201916, if you stripped out your dry-dock costs, you are basically looking at flat over that two-year period?","David Bernstein","Roughly, speaking, that\u2019s a good estimate. But I will say, one other thing that we have to decide on for 2016 is whether we have additional product enhancements or investments. As Arnold said before, he is not afraid to make some good ROE investments to improve yield to improve the operating income because that\u2019s where we are most focused on. So absent that, yes, the math is similar to what you are describing, but yet, there are lot of decisions yet to be made.","Steve Wieczynski - Stifel","Okay. Got you. And then, Arnold, seems like the Carnival brand itself is started to get a little bit momentum here? Can you maybe help us think about the recovery in that brand and how you, is it moving quicker than you guys would have thought, is it lagging, maybe also and I don\u2019t know if you will give this, but where is the booking window for just the Carnival brand and maybe pricing relative to all the triumph -- the triumph incident?","Arnold Donald","Well, real quickly, in terms of the overall feeling about the brand. I would say that the recovery is probably the little faster than we had a right to believe it would be, but at the same time, it\u2019s not nearly fast enough for all of us and our brand people certainly deserve a tremendous amount of credit for their product innovations and both in terms of hardware product and soft product onboard and just an excellent delivery on restoring the confidence in the brand and having people appreciate the great experience that the Carnival brand is. So we\u2019re pleased with it but at the same time, we are not satisfied and we\u2019re going to continue to pursue aggressively building the Carnival brand and in getting back to the historical levels.","In terms of the specifics, we -- as you know, we are not going to give a lot of yield-by-yield or brand-by-brand detail. So just in general, I would say that the yields are showing some strength the Caribbean is we all know was very tough environment this year. We anticipated that in our original guidance for the year. So it was a difficult year overall in the Caribbean from a pricing environment. But the brand has navigated that well and has offset some of that with strong onboard revenue lift and we\u2019re feeling really good about it. But as you know, we don\u2019t give lot of brand-by-brand detail.","Steve Wieczynski - Stifel","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Harry Curtis - Nomura","Good morning. Can you hear me?","Arnold Donald","Yes.","Harry Curtis - Nomura","Very good. I wanted to touch on CapEx for a minute and make sure that we have an accurate estimate of your CapEx in 2015 and 2016. Now that you\u2019re going to be in probably increasing your dry dock days, David. Can you give us a sense of what your full CapEx is likely to look like in both \u201815 and \u201816?","David Bernstein","Yeah. CapEx, roughly speaking for 2014 is $3 billion. That\u2019s probably going to be similar to that level in 2015 and 2016. We\u2019re obviously still going through a lot of the detail for those years and we can give you better guidance as we make some more decisions down the road.","Harry Curtis - Nomura","So it sounds like there\u2019s going to be some incremental investment in these systems and based on our estimates, does that -- it looks to me to be an incremental maybe $600 million to $700 million a year. Is that in the right ballpark?","David Bernstein","I\u2019m not sure what numbers you\u2019re comparing but these are the numbers that I just quoted very close to the numbers that we have been talking about for the last six to nine months as far as my memory is concerned.","Beth Roberts","Yeah. But it does reflect the higher level of investment enhancement cost as well as scrubbers for this intervening period not just the scrubbers.","Harry Curtis - Nomura","Right. That\u2019s what I was after. And then the last question is you mentioned that by the end of \u201815 probably the low 40s, the number of ships will be complying with ICA. Ultimately how many will have to be touched within the system. Is it 70 ships, is it 75 ships. What is that number likely to be?","Arnold Donald","Directionally, the 70 numbers are our magnitude number that ultimately depends on future deployment plans and what have you but\u2026","David Bernstein","Through 2016.","Arnold Donald","Yeah, through 2016.","David Bernstein","And current requirements.","Harry Curtis - Nomura","Okay. So roughly 25 of your ships are newer and really don\u2019t have to be -- have to have much\u2026","Arnold Donald","No, no, we don\u2019t need scrubber. We don\u2019t need the EGCs on every vessel. It depends on where they are deployed. ICA is not a universal. So it depends where the ships are going and so some of the fleet doesn\u2019t hit ICA-impacted destinations.","Harry Curtis - Nomura","All right. So the bottomline is \u2026.","Arnold Donald","Haven\u2019t cleared that from a flexibility standpoint, most newbuilds will be equipped to handle the regulations just from our long-term planning standpoint.","Harry Curtis - Nomura","Okay.","David Bernstein","And when you get into future regulation\u2026","Arnold Donald","Yeah. Go ahead. Go ahead.","Harry Curtis - Nomura","Go ahead.","Arnold Donald","No, you go ahead.","Harry Curtis - Nomura","Yeah. I guess, I was after is in \u201816, you\u2019ll probably be doing another 20 to 25 ships and then you\u2019re pretty much be done.","Arnold Donald","I think if you are trying to get a feel for it, \u201815 over two-thirds that increase, I think as David mentioned on the cost side that directional increase we\u2019re sharing with you all right now was related to increased dry-dock days partly EGC related, partly the fuel-saving technology related. And when you go to \u201816, that will fall off and there will still be additional work to be done. So we won\u2019t recapture all of that, but say two thirds of the cost of those increase that peak in dry-dock days for next year. Two thirds of the cost related to that will probably disappear in \u201916. But we will continue the implementation, aggressive implementation of both EGCs, and the fuel-saving technologies because they have sharp payback periods.","Harry Curtis - Nomura","Thanks guys.","Arnold Donald","Did that help you? Okay. Good","Harry Curtis - Nomura","Yeah. Thanks very much.","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Jaime Katz - Morningstar","Good morning. I just had one quick question on China. I\u2019m curios about what sort of headwinds you guys have on expanding the infrastructure with I guess, just the people selling the cruises there and then maybe persuading some of the consumers that your products is different than some of the other products that have been out there in the past from other vendors like Star?","Arnold Donald","I think fundamentally, there are several issues in your question. First off all, just the consuming public out of the guests, helping them understand what a cruise is, is still a challenge there. Now, early on, there are so few ships and such latent demand that it\u2019s not a huge challenge because there are enough people there that have some familiarity that we can certainly fill the ships. The challenges as we -- as a growth suggest communicate what a cruise is and that is not just a, for in our case a gambling destination or gaming destination. So there is a challenge. Therefore, we are in the work of doing that along with our distributors there that work with us and we are beginning to have the success with that.","On the other side of the coin in terms of the challenges in developing a market is a host of things, and it includes port development that needs to be extensive port of people have to have a place to go and things to do when they get there. There has to be availability of international ports where the Chinese are sort of free to go in and have the opportunity to experience and enjoy. And then there has to be supply chain development locally there to provision and provide the infrastructure.","So there is a ton of work to be done, is to add an early stage which is very, very exciting and you can just see the potential and the possibility. And like I said, we are already experiencing good results and are excited. It will take time. It\u2019s not going to happen overnight and that\u2019s why we are sending Alan over there now because there have to be a number of areas sorted out and we\u2019d like to have one of our top people full time there, working it everyday to position it, for what should be in the not too distant future a tremendous opportunity for the entire cruise industry and especially for Carnival Corporation.","Jaime Katz - Morningstar","Are you guys finding that cruisers are acquiring, or purchasing the product more on their own or sell through to travel agent channel there? And if it is through the travel agent channel, how sizeable is that at this point?","Arnold Donald ","Yeah. It is definitely through distributors. Technically and mostly, it\u2019s the ships that are chartered and so the distributors charter the ship and then market it to the Chinese populous. That\u2019s the structure today, is working just fine. It\u2019s a good model. That model has existed in other places and eventually of course, they end up being probably direct selling the best ways off. So right now it is through a distribution network. The distribution network is well organized. There are some very large entities involved in that in China domestic companies of great scale and significant market capitalization, et cetera. So these are professional organizations that do a good job.","Jaime Katz - Morningstar","Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Assia Georgieva from Infinity Research. Please go ahead.","Assia Georgieva - Infinity Research","Good morning. This is Assia. Congratulations on the great Q3 results and I have another follow-up question to China. Do you see any improvement in terms of the relationship between China and Japan so that you can offer a more varied destination or experience for the Chinese passenger?","Arnold Donald","Obviously, we\u2019re very respectful of relationships wherever we operate, and that\u2019s outside of our scope. We do expect over time that there will be opportunities for easy exchange between those countries. And obviously we have ships all imported in Japan as well. And so we are optimistic about all that, but that\u2019s beyond our scope as a company to be involved in those types of relationship matters.","Assia Georgieva - Infinity Research","And Arnold now in Q1 that will be anniversarying the Caribbean capacity increase, do you think that in 2015 we can get back to kind of the historical yield increases of about 1.9% that we\u2019ve seen in the past, or is it still too early to say?","Arnold Donald","I think we are not really giving obviously any yield guidance at this point for 2015. But I think directionally I would say things should look better in the Caribbean beginning in the later second quarter. And through the third quarter, it should be very good, because there will be capacity reduction in the Caribbean next year versus this year. So I think directionally it looks a more positive. But at this time, I would have to stop there, because it would be little early to go beyond that.","Assia Georgieva - Infinity Research","Okay. Understand. Thank you so much.","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo Securities","Thank you. Let me wrap up one other one on China if I may. It appears that the functional currency is still the euro at this point given that everything is under Costa. Do you see that functional currency changing in the near future as China grows significantly? And then secondly, back to the cost comments, clearly the scrubbers matters somewhat of a unique item and something that you just have to do. And it sounds like -- and correct if I am wrong, you termed that more as a one-off, which we would agree with. Future investments though, do you see those as more the ongoing part of the business in redeploying some of those cost savings?","Arnold Donald","Okay. Thank you. First of all, on the China comment on the currency, obviously we do have Costa. We also have Princess in China as well. And then I really can\u2019t comment on the currency.","David Bernstein","If you are talking about, Tim, the accounting functional currency for these entities, at the moment because it is part of the Costa brand, we look at it collectively together. And you are right, it is a euro functional currency. But as that grows, we will evaluate it. Today, it\u2019s only two ships, we\u2019re writing third ship next year to the Costa Asia Group. And so as that grows, that might be something we will reevaluate. But at the moment, we are happy with the accounting for it.","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. Got it. And Princess?","David Bernstein","And Princes, the same thing, it\u2019s just -- it was a half a ship last year. And as that grows, it\u2019s U.S. dollar functional currency. And as that grows, if there is a good reason, we will reevaluate it.","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo Securities","Got it. Okay.","Arnold Donald","And then your question on the costs, could you repeat it please?","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo Securities","Yeah. I guess, it boils down to, it sounded like the scrubbers would be -- you are viewing that more as a one-off cost given the unique changes that you are seeing in the regulation. But the rest of the investments, would you view those as sort of one-off or would that just be forward in your cost savings? You said as it stands now, half the rates are basically flat with inflation would be fair, but then would those investments then be netted against that, or would you view those more as a one-off?","Arnold Donald","Got it. So first of all, the increase in dry-dock days that went planning for 2015 evolves both the EGCS as well as some fuel technologies, fuel saving technologies. Hopefully, we will find additional fuel saving technologies, but I think it\u2019s particular group that we are looking at is more one-off, and that\u2019s why we will have a reduction in \u201916 in the cost equivalent of the dry-dock days. A significant reduction in the cost from the peak you will see in \u201915. So in that sense, it is one-off.","In terms of other cost savings or other investments, we are making investments in multiple areas, whether it is a guest experience enhancement or whether it\u2019s related to creating demand, directly through advertise or promotions, especially those kinds of things.","So those we will look at on a case-by-case basis and as we see an opportunity for return, we will implement them and some are technology based enhance the guest experience are create leverage in generating demand, so it\u2019s a host of things.","So there will be some ongoing. We had a peak with that right now it\u2019s hard to say. But what we will tell you is that, we still have a focus on cost containment and so we are confidently harvesting opportunities to reduce our costs and then we decide whether those results will go to bottom line, whether they will be reinvested to drive revenue, because it gets to the double-digit return invested capital, in the timeframe we are talking, we will have to obviously drive revenue and that is our focus.","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo Securities","Great. Thank you, both.","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Please proceed.","Robin Farley - UBS","Great. Thanks. Two question, first on China. Have you looked at partnering maybe different kind of venture with local travel companies there or is that something you\u2019ve thought about and decided not to do or something that you\u2019re considering?","And then my other question is just on your expense guidance and I hate to focus so much on expense line, obviously the yields are -- the yield growth here is above expectations and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to drive so much of the return recovery, it\u2019s really yield story. But just one smaller sub-question and just your full year guidance, I know there was some timing shift between Q3 and Q4 for your full year guidance non-fuel expense up slightly instead of being flat to up slightly, just up slightly. Is that just kind of the reinvesting in the product that you talked about? Is there anything particular there or is that just for that general reinvesting you talked about?","Arnold Donald","Okay. Let\u2019s do the China question first. In terms of partnerships, obviously, anything we do will announce at the time. Clearly, it would be safe to presume that we\u2019re exploring all types of possibilities to see what makes the more sense and that\u2019s one of the reasons for having Alan relocate to Shanghai and be there full time.","So we\u2019re exploring on number of possibilities. We\u2019ll see what make sense. We\u2019ll work with the Chinese authorities and the various private and partially stand-on enterprises that that were there. And we\u2019ll sort it all out and we\u2019re in the process of doing that. But if we have anything specific to announce, we\u2019ll do it at the time. And on the expense side, go ahead David.","David Bernstein","Yeah. On the expense side, Robin, really you\u2019re right, we did narrow the range. With every forecast there are always some unexpected things, something positive, something negative. I guess, overall with our forecast that we gave last quarter, the trend is all generally been positive and we were very pleased with that as we raise the guidance. But there were couple of unexpected things on the cost side. We did have a pension expense that we had to take and put into the guidance in 2014. So there was couple of minor additional expenses and that\u2019s what narrowed the range up slightly.","Robin Farley - UBS","Okay. Great. Thanks. And maybe just one last question. You talked about in Q3 the strength in closing demand. Would you say that was more closing demand for Europe and China or was actually Caribbean closing showing some improvement too?","Arnold Donald","I would say the closing demand definitely included the Caribbean. There\u2019s no question about that. But also was global, not so much to China on closing demand, because as I mentioned that\u2019s a charter type business. But in terms of Europe and the Caribbean in particular, there were stronger closing demand.","Robin Farley - UBS","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Nick Thomas with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Nick Thomas - Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Hello there. Can you just talk a little more on these dry-dock cost and their reversal? Do I take from what you\u2019ve said so far that you have sort of initial thinking on unit costs in 2016 is that they would actually than be down year-on-year i.e. your strategic initiatives offsetting any inflation again, but then some of these, perhaps not quite all, but some of the 2% of dry-dock costs reversing to bring unit costs down? Those dry-dock costs, can you just talk a little bit about how they interact with CapEx? My understanding was that it was sort of already CapEx for this equipment within the guidance. Just sort of outline what things are capitalized and what things go through as OpEx? And then finally on the revenue side of things looking into next year, it sounds from what you\u2019ve said on early bookings is that the environment is actually switching around to being stronger beyond North American brands rather than your EAA brands for next year. Can you just clarify whether my read of that is accurate and provide any sort of further color as to what that\u2019s predominantly down to Carnival brand recovery or whether it\u2019s more granule than that? Thank you very much.","Arnold Donald","Okay. So, I\u2019ll take some because I heard some of them and I\u2019ve to maybe check some. So first of all, in terms of costs being down in \u201916, it would be premature at this point to give full clarity for \u201816, because we don\u2019t know we are going to learn from what we\u2019ve done this year. We\u2019ll learn from what we do in \u201815. And we\u2019ll make determinations on expenses going into \u201916, later in \u201915, in terms of what we may choose to invest in from a driving revenue and driving the business on a sustainable fashion standpoint.","So, I have no prediction on the absolute. What I can tell you though is that these costs that are occurring in \u201915 were related to the dry dock that two thirds of that increase at least will disappear in \u201916, will not be there. It just won\u2019t be necessary, would have made the enhancements and it just won\u2019t be necessary than that money. So that\u2019s what I can tell you on that part.","David Bernstein","And as far as the dry-dock costs themselves, during the dry dock period, we do both like expense type work as well as capital type work. So if you are installing an EGC on the ships or implementing some capital relating to fuel efficiency technology that might be some capital work. But you also have the actual cost of the dry-dock services, the dry-dock itself, the power, the water for the ship. You\u2019ve got to prove that generally stays with the ship that gets expensed and capital because you\u2019re not sending a thousand crew home for two weeks. So there\u2019s a number of capital as well as expense type items that occur during the dry-dock period. And from a cost perspective, the increase was relating to the P&L cost I\u2019m referring to.","Arnold Donald","And then with regards to your question about North America versus Europe, in terms of, is there more strength in North America and Europe or flip-flopping the strength of the markets. I would just say that we have seen the lengthening in the booking curve and higher prices in the first half of the year so far in North America. And while we\u2019ve seen somewhat latent of the booking curve for the first half of next year in Europe, the prices are comparable pricing, so that\u2019s probably what you are reacting to.","Having said that, I wouldn\u2019t describe that broadly as North America being stronger than Europe or vice versa. Some of it has to do with the comparisons year-to-year and just a mix. So we\u2019ll see how it goes. We are optimistic about both markets going into 2015.","Nick Thomas - Merrill Lynch","And just on that point, my comment in relation to brand within North America. Presumably given that the comps, you would be more optimistic once you are able to breakdown brand individually, would you be more optimistic specifically about the Carnival brand than the rest of the North American brands?","Arnold Donald","I think the North America brands broadly, if you lob it all together, clearly the comps will be somewhat easier weighted average because of the Caribbean situation and the Carnival situation coming off of the last couple of years, so the comps will be [come] (ph). But on the other hand, you have the Costa situation where Costa is still continuing to rebound and has some additional upside. So that\u2019s -- haven\u2019t look that quite that way, that would be a tough call to make off the curve.","Nick Thomas - Merrill Lynch","Sure. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Stuart Gordon with Berenberg. Please go ahead.","Stuart Gordon - Berenberg","Hi. Good morning. Couple of questions, please. Could you give us some feel for the fuel efficiency programs that will be in place for next year? And to what extent they may offset the $0.10 increase in fuel that you\u2019re expecting of the back of the changing regulation? And secondly, what fuel price you have assumed in assessing that and also on the fourth quarter guidance? Clearly, the onboard spend has been very good and you did point out not assume that every quarter. And putting together your guidance, will you more prudent in terms of thinking more along how you were looking at the third quarter, can you put out your view in the third quarter or with what you actually delivered this quarter? Thank you.","Arnold Donald","Thank you. Concerning the 10% eco impact on the higher fuel cost next year and whether some of the fuel saving technologies already in place, are that we would deploy next year doing early season dry-dock will offset that.","The reality is that that 10% obviously or $0.10, excuse me, what will be pretty much eliminated going into \u201916 and will be going by \u201917, because of the EGC installations that we are doing. So it will go away in that context.","But, obviously, we will continue to aggressively pursue not only through the Department of Technologies but also managing deployments and managing the ships on itineraries from a fuel consumption standpoint, as well as all the practices onboard.","And so we will continue pursue fuel savings as we have in the past. Is there some upside in that for next year, we will have to see as we manage through, but right now we would just try to give you guys a little color, something you might not have anticipated, which was this increase in dry-dock, so we could aggressively deploy the technologies, so we can have the benefits sooner rather than later for many years to come.","David Bernstein","Yeah. Just to give you some color on the math, given the amount of fuel, 2014 prices a 1% change in the -- in our fuel consumption or the price of fuel would be like $2.06. So we will take a 4% consumption reduction to offset the $0.10 eco that we talked about in 2015. Just and we have been talking about getting a 2% to 3% fuel consumption improvement as we move forward.","And as far as the fuel price is concerned, we always use basically the current fuel prices. We locked off late last week when fuel was close to $100 a barrel in terms of Brent and fuel moves around daily and the numbers do change accordingly.","As far as onboard for the fourth quarter is concerned, we did raise our onboard revenue guidance for the fourth quarter, in fact we raise both the ticket and the onboard, as I have mentioned in notes.","So we were conservative, I am not assuming a repeat of 5.5 percentage point yield increase on onboard in the fourth quarter. I would love to see it repeat itself. But that\u2019s not basic forward guidance something considerably lower in the more normalized level is baked in.","Stuart Gordon - Berenberg","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jamie Rollo with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Jamie Rollo - Morgan Stanley","Yes. Thanks. And first question is just on your 3% unit costs guidance for next year. Is that inclusive or exclusive of the costs savings that you refer to, I know, you talked about in December, I am just aware that just probably last year you guided a cost about 4% and you ending up just slightly up?","And then, the other question is, how worried are you about the industry order book? Clearly, we are back to about prior peak for \u201907 levels, a lot of new ships coming on, (indiscernible) your competitors, should be brought one about that? Thank you.","David Bernstein","Your second question was a little fuzzy, if you can repeat that Jamie, I\u2019d appreciate it.","Arnold Donald","Couldn\u2019t quite hear you, Jamie, on your second question, we couldn\u2019t hear you.","Jamie Rollo - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Sorry about that. How worried are you about the industry order book, the amount of new ships and order, particularly by competitors? I mean, it seems to be back just about prior some of \u201907 peak levels and most of it not from Carnival? Thank you.","Arnold Donald","Thank you. I will take the second one first. In terms of worried. We are not worried. We know the ships are coming as in the forecast we can see them. I think in general that still there is not a huge capacity expansion in the industry. Obviously, we are helping that by being very measured in the net capacity addition that we bring on.","But we -- deployment makes the difference, depends whether ships all get deployed in a cluster in a given destination market. But generally speaking, it\u2019s a big planet and we think that for the ships that we have -- we see coming that the market will be able to absorb and it will continue to be able to deliver results made to deliver. Go ahead David.","David Bernstein","Sure. Just one additional comment on the -- on Arnold was answering, keep in mind that we\u2019re expecting quite a bit of growth in the emerging markets particularly, Asia and China. So that should be able to profitably absorb a lot of that capacity and the other more established markets will see it more measured capacity increase.","As far as the costs are concern, the 3% increase, two-thirds of it was dry dock, another third was some product initiatives and enhancements and that reinvesting in the product. And I indicated that a line of sight at this time we see all the leveraging our scale completely offsetting inflation. So that\u2019s our best guess at this point in time but as I indicated in my notes, we are not going to rest. We\u2019ll keep working if we\u2019re able to accomplish more that would be great. We\u2019ll let you know but this is our best guess at this point.","Arnold Donald","And then one last comment, measured capacity growth overall would clearly be very a good thing. We are not counting on what other people do, we can only control ourselves but obviously that would be a good thing.","David Bernstein","And I guess\u2026","Jamie Rollo - Morgan Stanley","Okay.","David Bernstein","\u2026we are running over, I guess, operator will take one more question at this point.","Operator","Thank you. The last question comes from the line of Ian Rennardson with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ian Rennardson - Jefferies","Thank you. Two questions for you, number one, were you much -- to get much more to fill when you gave guidance back in June than normal because the bake on yields seems very surprising in terms of its magnitude given how far into Q3 when you gave that guidance. And secondly, if you could give us an idea of how much inventory you\u2019ve sold already for 2015 both for the U.S. and Europe? Thank you.","David Bernstein","Sure. Well, as far as the third quarter is concerned, you really have to break it apart into a number of different pieces because about half of the increase was relating to onboard which we don\u2019t have a lot of visibility into in advance. And we\u2019re very grateful. Everything worked well. All the things we\u2019re doing seem to pan out in the third quarter and we hope that that continues and we see a positive trend.","On the ticket side of things, half of the increase in ticket was relating to occupancy -- higher occupancy than we had expected and the other half was higher prices than we expected. So it was very nice to see forecast that everything go in one particular direction but it was a lot of pieces that came together to create that overall increase and total was $0.11 per share.","Beth Roberts","In terms of the visibility\u2026.","David Bernstein","And in terms of the visibility for 2015 is, I think, we\u2019ve said many times, for the next quarter out we are roughly in generally 85% to 95% booked. When you get into the first quarter of 2015, the second quarter out we are roughly half booked and then as you go out to the second quarter, the quarter booked. So that\u2019s how our historical number is in that where we\u2019re roughly speaking today.","Ian Rennardson - Jefferies","Okay. And that\u2019s great. Thank you.","Arnold Donald","Thank you. Thank you all. We really appreciate your interest and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be talking to some of you in the weeks to come. But thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Thank you and have a good day."],"4379":["Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call December 19, 2017 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Arnold Donald - President and Chief Executive Officer","Micky Arison - Chairman","David Bernstein - Chief Financial Officer","Beth Roberts - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations","Analysts","Robin Farley - UBS","Steve Wieczynski - Stifel","Harry Curtis - Nomura\/Instinet","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays","David Beckel - Bernstein Research","James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities","Greg Badishkanian - Citi","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo Securities","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust","Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Company","Arnold Donald","Good morning, everyone and welcome to our Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. I am Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation & Plc. Today, I am joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison, by David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer and by Beth Roberts, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you all for joining us this morning. And we sincerely wish each of you and those who love a faith and joyful holiday season.","Now, before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking. Therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today\u2019s press release. While fourth quarter adjusted earnings were $0.04 per share below the prior year\u2019s record levels, we experienced another quarter of strong revenue yield and excluding $0.11 per share drag due to the hurricane disruptions, a quarter of earnings improvement. In fact, we finished the year strong with adjusted earnings that exceeded the midpoint of guidance. This quarter, we exceeded guidance by $0.16 per share helping to produce the highest full year adjusted earnings in our company\u2019s history.","We achieved full year 2017 adjusted earnings of nearly $2.8 billion or $3.82 per share, that\u2019s $0.37 higher than last year\u2019s record results and well above the high-end of our original December guidance range of $3.30 to $3.60 and that\u2019s despite a $0.32 drag from fueling currency moving against the aforementioned hurricane disruptions; challenges in the China market, including itinerary disruptions involving Korea and elsewhere ongoing geopolitical concerns preventing port calls to popular higher yielding destinations like Turkey; strong operational improvement contributed $0.58 per share for the bottom line year-over-year, which when combined with the level of business accretion from our share repurchase program overcame the variety of significant headwinds this year to deliver another full year earnings record.","More importantly, we achieved return on invested capital of 9.4% keeping us on track to achieve double-digit return on invested capital in 2018 and beyond. These strong results affirm the efforts of our 120,000 team members whose commitment and passion enable us to exceed the expectations of nearly 12 million guests annually and also accredited to our tens of thousands of valued travel agent partners who support all our brands. It is true their collective efforts that we deliver such strong earnings and we embark upon 2018 with booking volumes and pricing both ahead of prior year.","It was reinforcing to see another year of constant currency revenue yield growth finishing the year up 4.5% demonstrating a consistent pattern of healthy revenue yield improvement. We drag revenue yield growth by creating relative scarcity through each of our brands to assess an increasing demand in excess of measured capacity growth via ongoing guest experience efforts coupled with our multiple brand marketing efforts and continuing public relations programs. In fact, this quarter we launched meaningful efforts on multiple fronts, which we expect will pay dividends in 2018 and beyond. On the guest experience side, last month, we debut the ocean experience platform featuring Ocean Medallion on Regal Princess. The ocean experience platform maybe the most ambitious and expensive IoT based innovation on the planet. We are having fun seeing the guest reactions. Our crew is ecstatic and we are experiencing net promoter scores among the highest in our fleet, but it is still early days and only a limited number of guests have experienced elements of Ocean Medallion so far. We are fine-tuning and enhancing the platform based on real-time learning as we prepare for full rollout of our Regal Princess in the first calendar quarter 2018.","This past quarter we also introduced PlayOcean, our proprietary mobile gaming portfolio. PlayOcean taps into the growing interest in mobile gaming by offering a collection of original games that can be played at home and onboard select chips. We have not just extended gaming authorship but we are making gaming more immersive on board and on the Public Relations front. Just yesterday, we announced a new partnership with Univision the first Ocean primetime series, La Gran Sorpresa, [indiscernible]. La Gran Sorpresa will be aired in early January well time to coincide the beginning of wave booking season. Univision is the country\u2019s most large Spanish-language TV network catering to the more than 54 million Americans who identify as Hispanic. The crew\u2019s collective vacation experience is La Gran Sorpresa aligned wonderfully with the core value for the Univision audience focusing on multigenerational family togetherness fun and passion for life.","Now, this announcement comes on the heels of our launch of OceanView, our own proprietary digital streaming network featuring compelling experiential content 24\/7 and currently available on major digital platforms, including Apple TV, Amazon Fire, Roku as well as onboard our ships. OceanView launched simultaneously with our two new proprietary original content digital productions, GO and Local Eyes and they build upon our three award winning television shows, The Voyager with Josh Garcia on NBC, Ocean Treks with Jeff Corwin on ABC and Vacation Creation with Tommy Davidson and Andrea Feczko also on ABC, all in their second season. Our network series are the most positive travel related shows on TV. Today, this increasingly popular roster of U.S. original content television programs has garnered over 100 hours of cumulative airtime and reached an audience of over 200 million viewers. Going forward, our portfolio of 7 OCEAN original series distributed across major networks, major digital streaming platforms, and on our ships ensures that over 4 million potential guests per week see that cruising is the best way to access the people, to access the places and to access the cultures of the world.","Other successful PR efforts include the premier earlier this month of the major motion picture, The Greatest Showman of Cunard\u2019s Queen Mary 2; Holland America\u2019s featured cruises in partnership with O Magazine, including Oprah\u2019s on-voyage on Eurodam in Alaska earlier this year and in Italy, another commercial for our Costa brand featuring Shakira will launch on Christmas Day continue at a highly successful marketing campaign and that\u2019s just to name a few. All of these efforts resulted in positive media coverage of 2017, for example, to U.S. that was 10% above 2016\u2019s record levels and our highest share of voice to-date with Carnival Corporation brands carrying three quarters of the industry\u2019s positive coverage. Again, these efforts are all engineered to reach audiences multiple times in multiple ways to help drive demand by our brands ultimately leading to higher yields. There have also been a number of significant developments in our strategic fleet enhancement plan, which is an important part of our measured capacity growth strategy and includes replacing less efficient ships with new more efficient vessels.","During the year, we introduced 3 state-of-the-art new ships signed agreements with Fincantieri to build 3 additional new ships. And as previously announced, our joint venture for the Chinese market with CSSC, the China State Shipbuilding Corporation ordered for delivery in 2023 the first ever cruise ship to be built in China. So, we remain on track with our strategic fleet enhancement program and look forward to the delivery of Carnival Horizon in March, Seabourn Ovation in April as well as AIDAnova and Nieuw Statendam both in November. At the same time, we signed agreements to sell 2 ships expected to leave the fleet next spring keeping us on pace with our historical average of removing 1 to 2 ships per year. Also we expect net capacity growth to be 1.9% in 2018 and in keeping within our philosophy of measured capacity growth around 5% compound annually through 2022 as new chips replace some existing capacity.","We also realized a number of other accomplishments that position us further along the path to sustain double-digit return on invested capital, including two of our brands operating cruises to Cuba, our contemporary Carnival Cruise Line sailing from Tampa and our premium Holland America brand sailing from Fort Lauderdale, the continued rollout of our new state-of-the-art revenue management system across 6 of our brands to approximately 90% of those brands\u2019 inventory by spring of 2018 to further facilitate yield uplift. We also accelerated progress on our cost containment efforts delivering more than $100 million of cost savings in 2017 and more than $75 million including our original 2017 guidance, which brings the cumulative savings to-date to approximately $300 million. We are planning another $80 million of savings in 2018.","Importantly, we continue to make meaningful progress on our 2020 sustainability goals focusing our environmental safety, labor and social performance. We have already reduced our unit fuel consumption by 29% since initiating the effort, we remain committed to ongoing reduction in air emissions with, during 2017, the delivery of AIDAperla, our second cruise ship to be powered in-port by environmentally friendly liquefied natural gas and the keeling of AIDAnova, the first of 7 all L&G ships on order. And in 2017, we joined pledges to support the advancement of women\u2019s leadership and diversity in the workplace drafted by Catalyst, the leading global nonprofit focused on expanding opportunities for women and to support and encourage diversity in the workplace drafted by the Executive Leadership Council, the leading global organization working to empower African-American corporate leaders.","We also launched our first dedicated sustainability report website to expand our sustainability reporting. Our commitment to continuous improvement in health environment, safety and security result in our being ranked in the top quartile of the 100 best corporate citizens by Corporate Responsibility Magazine as well as recognition for our sustainability report, which was ranked number one globally by Corporate Register. We delivered in 2017 over $5.3 billion of cash from operations, returned a significant portion to shareholders and an increase of quarterly dividend twice in the past year, we distributed a total of $1.1 billion through our annual dividend and invested another nearly $600 million in our ongoing buyback program bringing our cumulative repurchases to-date to $3.2 billion in just over 2 years. Of course, we were able to accomplish this while maintaining our high investment grade credit rating.","So in summary, in addition to our record results, we have many other great accomplishments this year to reinforce our journey to sustain double-digit return on invested capital. Looking forward, our book position is strong heading into 2018. Despite the disruption in bookings, the fundamental strength in demand enabled us to withstand the hurricane malaise, leaving us well positioned for continued revenue yield improvement in 2018 with both occupancy and price still ahead of the prior year.","On our last quarterly call, we indicated we could be patient as we waited for the recovery in bookings post hurricane and I believe this approach enabled us to maintain pricing integrity while at the same time aggressively stimulating demand through, among other efforts, our industry-wide campaign, the Caribbean is open, which created 5 billion positive media impressions. We are projecting revenue yields to be another 2.5% in 2018 on top of the tougher comparisons with this year\u2019s success based on our proven demand creation and yield management efforts. At the same time, we continue to contain costs. In 2018 at the midpoint of our guidance, despite an $0.08 per share negative drag from a combination of fuel and currency, we expect to deliver an improvement in earnings of $0.33 per share. We remain committed through achieving increased consideration for cruise vacations and continued investments in our guest experience to create additional consumer demand in excess of measured capacity growth, while at the same time continuing to return cash to shareholders. I am very proud of all the progress our teams have made in 2017 and I am genuinely excited by our prospects as we embarked on 2018. We are working very hard and we remain on track to deliver double-digit return on invested capital to shareholders in 2018.","With that, I will turn the call to David.","David Bernstein","Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin please note all of my references to revenue ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I\u2019ll start today with the summary of our 2017 fourth quarter results, then I\u2019ll provide an update on current booking trends for 2018 and finish up with some color on our 2018 December guidance.","Our adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.63, as Arnold indicated, this was $0.16 above the midpoint of our September guidance. The improvement was primarily revenue driven, $0.11 favorable and increase in net ticket yields benefited from stronger pricing on close in bookings on both sides of the Atlantic, while on-board and other yields continue to benefit from a variety of our ongoing initiatives, $0.04 was due to a combination of lower net cruise costs without fuel, fuel consumption and depreciation expense. We also benefited by attendees from the net impact of fuel price and currency.","Now let\u2019s turn to the fourth quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 1.5%. The North American brands were essentially flat, while the European Australia and Asian brands also known as our EAA brands were up over 3.5%. Our total net revenue yields were up 4.2%. Now let\u2019s break apart the 2 components of net revenue yields. Net ticket yields were also up 4.2%. This increase was driven by our North American brands deployment in the Caribbean, late season Alaska, and Europe, as well as our EAA brands deployment in Europe, the Caribbean and Australia. These increases were partially offset by decreases in our China deployment as previously indicated. Net on-board and other yields increased 4.1% with increases on both sides of the Atlantic. Net cruise costs per ALBD excluding fuel were up 6.1%, which was in line with our September guidance driven by higher dry dock days hurricane impact and the seasonlization of other expenses between the quarters.","In summary, our fourth quarter adjusted EPS was slightly less than last year\u2019s record fourth quarter with the strong 4.2% revenue yield improvement was $0.19 the more than offset by $0.20 of higher costs during the seasonalization of costs and the net unfavorable impact of fuel price and currency costing us $0.03.","Now let\u2019s turn to 2018 booking trends. Since November, booking volumes for 2018 have been running well ahead of last year at higher prices. At this point in time the cumulative booking positioned for 2018 we are ahead of the prior year on both occupancy and press.","Let\u2019s drill down into the cumulative book position. First, for North American brands the Caribbean program is behind the prior year and occupancy as a result of the disruption we saw in booking patterns for a number of weeks after the hurricane. However, these bookings are at higher prices. As expected, since November we have seen normalization in the Caribbean booking patterns. The seasonal European program is considerably ahead of the prior year on both occupancy and price Alaska is ahead of the prior year and occupancy albeit at lower prices primarily due to net. Second for our EAA brands, for European deployment, occupancy is nicely ahead at higher prices, but the Caribbean occupancy is in line with the prior year at slightly higher prices.","Finally, I want to provide you with some color on 2018. We are forecasting a capacity increase of 1.9%. As Arnold indicated, our book position is strong heading into 2018 despite hurricane disruptions which positions us well for continued growth in revenue yields. For 2018, we are projecting net revenue yields to be up approximately 2.5% on top of the tougher comparisons with our prior year success.","Now, turning to costs, net cruise costs without fuel per ALBD is expected to be up approximately 1% for 2018. Broadly speaking, there are three main drivers of the cost change. First, our forecast is for an average 2 points of inflation across all our cost categories globally. Second, we are planning for a slight increase in drydock days from 470 days in 2017 to 505 days in 2018 impacting cost metrics by two-tenths of a point. Partially offsetting these two items is about a point of cost saving benefit from further leveraging our scale. Fuel prices and FX rates are a different picture from what we saw just 3 months ago when the 2018 year-over-year net impact of fueling currency was a favorable $0.14. Given current fuel prices and FX rates, the 2018 year-over-year net impact of fueling currency is now an unfavorable $0.08. This is a $0.22 swing in just 3 months. In the end on a year-over-year basis, fuel prices moved against of $0.16 including the impact of fuel derivatives. This was partially offset by favorable impact of currency were $0.08. Putting all of these factors together, our adjusted EPS guidance for 2018 is $4 to $4.30 versus $3.82 for 2017 and we will finish up by sharing with you our current rules of thumb about the impact of currency and fuel prices on our 2018 results.","To start with, a 10% change in all relevant currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would impact our P&L by approximately $0.46 for the full year and $0.02 for the first quarter. For fuel price changes, a 10% change in the current stock price represents a $0.20 impact for the full year and $0.05 for the first quarter. Fuel expense in our guidance is $1.5 billion for the full year. The third rule of thumb relates to our fuel derivative portfolio, a 10% change in Brent would result in a $0.05 change in realized losses on fuel derivatives for the full year and just a $0.01 for the first quarter.","And now, I will turn the call back over to Arnold.","Arnold Donald","Thank you, David. Operator, please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Please proceed.","Robin Farley","Great. Thanks very much. Obviously a great quarter. I wonder if you could give us a little bit more color around what drove that close in upside in Q4 just as we think about your guidance for 2018, because when you last guided you are kind of well into the quarter. So, it seems like a lot of price uptick in that last kind of 10% to 20% of bookings, especially since it was at a period when we would have maybe expected Caribbean bookings to be disrupted. So I wonder if you could give us a little color on how much of it based your new reservation system, how much of it is maybe the FEMA charter that took supply out at the last minute or just kind of any color around what drove that? Thanks.","Arnold Donald","Good morning, Robin. Thank you. First of all, the FEMA charter is immaterial to yields. The ship was basically fully sold and we did it to support the recovery efforts and there is no big benefit on that one too as financially from where we would have been otherwise. But overall, we just had strong demand in all the markets including in the Caribbean outside of the direct hurricane impacted areas. So, we had strong pickup there. The revenue management system would evolve preceded all of that, but of course the fact that we were holding on prices and we are so well booked certainly contributed, but we just saw strength in a lot of markets.","David Bernstein","Yes, the only thing I will add to that is we also saw strength in the onboard. I indicated the onboard yields were up 4.1%, which was considerably more than we had guided to.","Robin Farley","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Arnold Donald","Thank you, Robin.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Please proceed.","Steve Wieczynski","Yes, hi, guys. Good morning and happy holidays to you all. So, I guess the first question is around your 2.5% yield outlook for 2018. It\u2019s the same exact guidance you started 2017 with and you finished the year kind of north of 4%, which was a nice split of ticket and onboard. So, I guess as we look to 2018 given how solid trends seem to be right now, is it fair to say that if the booking environment and the economy kind of stay in the same ballpark there should be upside to your yield assumption and maybe a better way of kind of asking that is if you look back to 2017 in your initial yield guidance, what was the biggest surprise to you guys in terms of how that 2.5% got to north of 4%?","Arnold Donald","Thanks, Steve. Happy holidays to you too. Look, we always give our best guidance as you know and we are projecting another year of strong yield on top of what is now a lot tougher comparisons, because as we had in 2017. It\u2019s really early in the booking process. Wave season hasn\u2019t even started yet. And like every year, we do try to factor in that there will be unforeseen future events, but overall, we standby the guidance, it is on top of tougher comparisons. I wouldn\u2019t say there were big surprises in 2017 it\u2019s just the way things flow we had a lot of headwinds in 2017 as you know and we were able to overcome them by increasing demand for the cruises and by having factored in anticipating there will be some unforeseen events.","Steve Wieczynski","Okay, got it. And then second question around supply growth and that really seems to be the biggest overhang out there right now with investors. I guess, how do you guys counter that concern and I know Arnold you said you think you are going to grow your capacity around 5% a year, which I would assume is on a gross basis, but that doesn\u2019t include things like possible retirements, which I think you said will be 1 to 2 per year and also the fact that a lot of certain parts of your capacity growth are really dedicated to a very specific audience or demographic like AIDA. So, I guess what I am getting here is if you kind of start stripping out all that stuff how do you actually view your core capacity growth going forward?","Arnold Donald","We are very comfortable with our capacity growth in the coming years. We have been consistent with our execution around measured capacity growth and we are going to stick with that. We are spreading that growth over a number of brands, increasing number of geographic regions and we are very careful where we add capacity. Of course we are going to try to drive yield increases at rates that we have recently achieved or even higher. In the end, that may or may not happen. We have a bit of a cushion as capacity itself is the driver for earnings growth and it\u2019s a driver for cost containment. So, we can achieve similar earnings growth rates at lower rates of increases in yields. Of course, our objective though is to get even greater earnings growth by driving both capacity and yields.","Steve Wieczynski","Okay, great. And then simple housekeeping question for Beth or David, can we just get your capacity by quarter for this year and also what \u2013 how you guys are thinking about \u201819 and \u201820 and then CapEx as well?","Beth Roberts","Q1 is up 2.2, Q2 is 1.3, Q3 is 1.7, Q4 is 2.6 that\u2019s a total year of 1.9 CapEx for 2018 it\u2019s 4.4 billion, 2019 it\u2019s 5.1 billion, 2020 it\u2019s 4.8 billion and 2021 it\u2019s 3.9 billion and I think I missed one of your questions.","Steve Wieczynski","\u201819 and \u201820 capacity outlook?","Beth Roberts","\u201819 is 5.5 for us and 7.4 for \u201820.","David Bernstein","Anecdotally, the industry managed to 13% industry-wide growth and 11% growth plus in the Caribbean in quarter three of 2017 and we still drove strong yield improvement. Yes, I just want to reinforce that we are totally focused on measured capacity growth and we are totally focused on achieving and sustaining double-digit return on invested capital. So for some reason, we fail in creating the demand then we are fully prepared to accelerate retirements and with our scale that matters and so we are focused on growing earnings and not just the number of ships.","Steve Wieczynski","Great. Thanks guys. Happy holidays.","David Bernstein","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura\/Instinet. Please proceed.","Harry Curtis","Hi, good morning everyone. I wanted to just follow-up on the last question particularly as we look into the somewhat higher growth in supply growth in 2019 and 2020. Are there segments that you have identified kind of demographic segments that are driving the new cruisers, because Arnold you had spent a decent amount of time discussing your global marketing campaigns and I am just wondering if there are some new segments that you are actually targeting?","Arnold Donald","We are under-penetrated in the industry as in every market in the world including the U.S., I will repeat something I have told you guys many times, if you add up all the cabins in the world, they add up less than the hotel rooms in the world. And so we are still very small. Cumulatively, the cruise industry sales over 25 million people a year, but dentists attracts 24 million towards the year. So, I mean, we are just small. And so yes, we are tapping every market segment and we sell in every generation, whether it\u2019s millennials, seniors, it doesn\u2019t matter, children. So, all of those are potential markets for us. We have 9 whirling and cruise line brands. They are all catered to a different psychographic mark. You asked about demographics. We are distributed around the world. We even distributed here in the United States with the Carnival brand, we see a lot of different markets around the U.S. And so we subgroup the markets demographically that way location wise, but primarily we are focused on the guest experience and the psychographic placement. So, we think there is opportunity and we have demonstrated so far to continue to grow demand for cruise at a faster rate than we can grow capacity and we do have constraints on capacity growth, a limited number of shipyards, which is a good thing in the end. And we take advantage of that to outpace demand with the capacity that\u2019s available.","David Bernstein","And keep in mind that the backdrop is that travel and tourism has been growing about 4% a year and is expected to continue to grow at that rate. So, we are in a very good position in a growing industry. And as Arnold said, we expect to do very well with and very comfortable with our capacity growth.","Harry Curtis","That\u2019s terrific. And just a quick follow-up turning to China, Arnold, do you see the market evolving into a growth market at some point in the next year or two as opposed to sort of being a shoppers\u2019 commuter market?","Arnold Donald","In China, the industry had a tough year in China this year, but I think the long-term prospects are outstanding. In 2018, there is going to be limited capacity growth in fact I think the industry is flat. We are expanding our distribution. I know others in the industry are doing the same. We are working very closely with our existing distributors there to connect that latent demand note with the few ships that are there. We are still very return focused. We have no hesitation to relocate a ship if necessary for it to overall have more accretive return for our business and just keep in mind it\u2019s still so small. Today, it represents only 5% of our capacity, maybe 1 million cruise tours out of 130 million outbound tours in China. So, everything is really tiny. To predict that although obviously everybody is more optimistic, I think we seem to be selling down a bit with expanded distribution, we factored in some improvement in our guidance, but we will just have to wait and see.","Harry Curtis","I guess what I am after is do you see a demand in the say next several years where the market evolves more towards tourism and less towards shopping?","Arnold Donald","I think absolutely the market is already there for tourism, you go anywhere in the world, you will find mainland Chinese, behaving like tourists from any other place in the world. So, yes the cruise business started out early with a few local destinations there, close in destinations which were very shopping oriented, but there\u2019s no question that mainland Chinese are showing up on ships all over the world now not just ships imported in China and the ships imported in China will see over time itineraries expanded to go to more distant places some for the purpose of tourism versus a good deal on merchandise item.","Harry Curtis","Very good. Thank you.","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Please proceed.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi, good morning and thank you. I\u2019m going to go at this maybe from a different angle, because people want to understand this. So you faced incredible challenges in the fourth quarter, you posted better-than-expected results. So a lot of people are just wondering why we might be seeing a large deceleration in net yield growth in the first quarter? Are you assuming any kind of hurricane impact in there, David you kind of talk about a bit about the Caribbean is behind in occupancy, but at higher prices and I\u2019m assuming that occupancy isn\u2019t super significant, but is the wondering if it\u2019s just being conservative or is there fundamental reason, why the first quarter should see that kind of deceleration?","Arnold Donald","Well, again, we got tougher comparisons year-to-year now and we\u2019re giving out our best guidance. In terms of the hurricane impact, clearly there has been some kind of impact, but frankly the markets have recovered, it\u2019s hard for us to really identify what impact, I\u2019m sure there is some individuals that are shying away from the Caribbean still despite. The industry efforts and our efforts and each the other cruise lines efforts to that people know the Caribbean is open and the Caribbean is for everyone. And but haven\u2019t said that we \u2013 we see continued strong bookings in the Caribbean. And we give you our best guidance and you guys those conservative, but again there \u2013 we always try to factoring things that can go wrong and obviously a lot of things happened this year, a lot of things happened every year and so we try to account for that.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then David, can you help us understand the quarterly cadence\u2019s net cruise cost ex-fuel for 18, we know 2.3%, I\u2019m sorry 2% to 3% for the first quarter and 1% for the full year fourth quarter I\u2019m assuming easier comps perhaps that could be negative growth rate. So just wondering if you could help us understand the cadence for yields quarterly beyond the first quarter?","David Bernstein","Sure. The increase in dry dock days is really driven in the second quarter. So it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if the second quarter was up probably double the first quarter on a per ALBD basis, but you will see a significant decline in net cruise costs in the back half of the year as a result of the lower dry dock days particularly in the fourth quarter.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then Beth just can you give us the D&A and interest expense guidance for the first quarter and the full year 2018?","Beth Roberts","D&A is 460 to 470 for the first quarter and 2.02 billion for the year, interest it\u2019s 40 to 50 for the quarter and 180 to 190 for the year.","Felicia Hendrix","Thank you.","Beth Roberts","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Beckel with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.","David Beckel","Hi, thanks a lot. I think I\u2019ll actually take a stab at Q1 for the third time here, just a slightly different way, but my question is an amalgamation of a couple of comments you made about bookings since November being quite a bit faster than last year and occupancy and the Caribbean being behind. I\u2019m wondering if the current pace does continue say indefinitely through Q1 at what point would you be caught up on occupancy in the Caribbean?","David Bernstein","As Felicia had dictated, I mean we are not talking about a significant difference in occupancy, we did say it was behind. We are getting good booking trends. They have returned to normal. And so we are just in very small range of differences here. And as I had indicated the prices are up. So, we feel very comfortable with our guidance for the first quarter. And as we have told everybody, it is our best guess and we will continue to work hard to do better.","Arnold Donald","We don\u2019t have any concerns at this point about the momentum or the bookings in the Caribbean. We are doing very well there and we are pacing things the way we want pacing then and we feel really good about it.","David Beckel","That\u2019s great. Thanks. And second question about the revenue management system, I can imagine it\u2019s probably impossible to try to quantify exactly the extent to which I hope your yields this year, but it does seem to be a nice source of potential upside that investors can think about for next year. Is there anyway you can try to dimensionalize the impact for us either on basis points or just conceptually how it will help you significant \u2013 the extent to which it will help you in 2018 versus 2017 outside of it just being rolled out on more quickly?","Arnold Donald","Well, I am sorry I don\u2019t mean to cut you off, finish what you are asking I am sorry.","David Beckel","No, I was done. Thanks.","Arnold Donald","Yes. Conceptually, we can answer we won\u2019t dimensionalize it with percentages anything, but conceptually we are going to go to 90% of the inventory for those 6 brands going through the process of utilizing it too in the spring. So, we are going to have a lot more inventory going forward being impacted in 2018 with the whole system, which includes the two, the new revenue management tool. So, we are expecting obviously that to be a positive contributor. And given the guidance for the years, but the bottom line is we are 4 to 5 in our beliefs of achieving what we have said because of the incremental amount of inventory that\u2019s now be moving through the system that includes that two.","Beth Roberts","I would like to add that in spite of the spring when it\u2019s rolled out a lot of 2018 will be behind us. So, to the extent that we have a bigger benefit in 2019 from the tool itself keep that in mind.","Arnold Donald","Thank you, Beth.","David Beckel","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed.","James Hardiman","Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. I am not sure if you have any more insight than we do in terms of South Korea maybe get an update there. And I guess what does it look like if South Korea opens up over the course of the year, are there going to be other cost associated with switching back over to some of those destinations if it assume that you would more than offset that with any yield benefit and I guess what if anything \u2013 how do you factor that into guidance if at all?","Arnold Donald","Yes, I think anything that allows more destinations and encourages travel is a positive clearly. Itinerary planning has been set. That doesn\u2019t mean that things wouldn\u2019t change if there were opportunities to do so. So, opening it up would only be a positive, how much of a positive, it\u2019s hard to say at this point, it will depend on a number of factors, but I\u2019d say about what I said before keep in mind overall 5% of our capacity we are planning. We accommodate a lot in the guidance and so something like that would just be a small incremental positive, probably wouldn\u2019t be able to measure it.","David Bernstein","And in the end I mean it\u2019s a forecast that we always get a bunch of small positives and a bunch of small negatives. We are not all knowing and we give you the best guidance we can. So, hopefully, it does open up and that materialized its course.","James Hardiman","But generally unlike taking South Korea offline which presumably was a hit to yield by changing existing itineraries, you are not going to take a yield hit if anything you should get a yield benefit, correct?","Arnold Donald","I don\u2019t think we change anything to take a yield hit that\u2019s not normally in our modus operandi. So, we would definitely expect an improvement.","David Bernstein","And we could do that relatively quickly as well change your itineraries and over time.","James Hardiman","Got it. And then as I look to the rest of the world, this is the first year in a while that established markets are getting all of the capacity. Is there anything that you\u2019re seeing that suggested any of these established markets are choking on the capacity that the guide looks pretty encouraging, but obviously that capacity doesn\u2019t, doesn\u2019t all come on at the same time. So as you look to maybe portions of the year, where new ships are coming online in the Caribbean or in Europe are we seeing any weakness in pricing trends as that happened?","Arnold Donald","We control our capacity increases as we mentioned we\u2019ve got 1.9% in 2018 and we, as you know, booked well out and well ahead. So, the quick answer to your question is no, we don\u2019t see any weakness or anything, but of course, we monitor very closely that\u2019s our mobile and we will do what we need to do, but at this point in time, absolutely, things are as we have indicated.","James Hardiman","Got it. Thanks guys and happy holidays.","Arnold Donald","Okay. Happy holidays. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citi. Please proceed.","Greg Badishkanian","Great. Thanks. When you reported third quarter results back in September you noted that cumulative bookings were well ahead year-over-year on price and occupancy for the first half of 2018. So, in this quarter, you mentioned that the full year 2018 was ahead of prior year at higher prices. So I am just wondering the different phrasing, is that just because of the different time periods that you are comparing or just not comparable? And also just how do you feel now about 2018 versus back in September, I am much more confident are you achieving or beating that 2.5 net yield?","David Bernstein","Yes. Keep in mind, we use additives to try to just give a relative sense of the things, but we have to have a point in which we cut the additive lost. So you can, you\u2019re talking about very small nuances and small changes from one period to the other. The difference being in September, I quoted the first half of the year this year I quoted the full year, but we\u2019re really dealing with very small changes in terms of our confidence in 2018 we were confident in 2018 back in September, we\u2019re even more confident now it\u2019s a quarter later, we\u2019ve got a lot more bookings on the books for 2018, prices are higher the booking momentum particularly in the Caribbean has normalized itself. So we feel very good about 2018. The only big difference between September and today was the \u2013 but I talked about fueling currency, there was a big swing in my comments, I indicated that between fueling currency from 3 months ago to today.","Greg Badishkanian","Okay.","Arnold Donald","Just follow-on a little bit we are in a better book position year-over-year and feel really good about that. When you have the additives and stuff relative rates of growth and all that come into play, but overall we are in a better book position, we definitely as David said, feel even better about the guidance now then we would have a quarter ago and looking forward to a great 2018.","Greg Badishkanian","Alright. Very helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.","Tim Conder","Thank you. Congrats on the year and Merry Christmas, happy holidays. A couple more and I think looking more to \u201819 because obviously lot of the itineraries are set for \u201818 barring any emergency need of change, but looking to \u201819 you started to rollout a few of these. What are your thoughts? We are seeing a little bit of hints, but what are your thoughts on returning portions to the Eastern med, which historically in the Eastern med has provided higher yield than the Western med? And then I guess just in general also what you are seeing for \u201818 on Southern European sourcing, how has that trended over the last year, because that had been one of the weakest areas from a source market perspective for the industry over the last couple of years?","Arnold Donald","Yes. Concerning the 2019 and returning to the Eastern med, you are right, I mean those are some of the higher yielding itineraries. We would love to have them back. At this point in time, we just have to monitor and see what happens the world is volatile and ever-changing place and in the end we take yes, where they are willing to go and they want to go and so we are cautiously optimistic, but don\u2019t feel comfortable predicting at this point.","David Bernstein","And as far as your second question is concerned in Southern Europe, remember that our Costa brand, their focus is on Southern Europe, Italy, France and Spain. We have talked about \u2013 we don\u2019t go into details by brands, but a number of times we have talked about seeing an improving economy in the southern part of Europe for a long time, we had talked about it bouncing along the bottom, but we have started to seeing some improvement and we have seen confidence Costa has done very well in 2017 and we expect it to do well in 2018 in addition. So, we are comfortable and very confident and happy to see the improvement in that part of the world.","Tim Conder","Okay. And along that line, David or Arnold whoever wants to take this, the booking curve, how was the booking curve on a year-over-year basis it sounds like given you booked at higher levels of occupancy globally. It sounds like its still stretching out, but just any color as to where that is? And then on fuel, it looks like your fuel collars that you have had in place for a few years or finding it to roll-off post \u201818 any update of internal thoughts as it relates to hedging, collaring, anything going forward with fuel that you can share?","Arnold Donald","Okay, thank you. Yes, concerning hedge and a collar, we have never hedged. We have done the collars, where as you point out we have through 2018. We will monitor it closely. We do it to protect against spikes and rises in fuel costs primarily from a cash management standpoint and what have you. So, we will look at our overall situation and make a determination about beyond 2018 and we look at it constantly. So, we will stay on that, but right now, we are covered through 2018 as you pointed out, but we have never hedged and at this point in time we have no intention to.","David Bernstein","So \u2013 and as far as the booking curve is concerned, I mean, we did say we were further ahead than last year, but again we keep on evaluating our book position. We are always looking for the optimal point in the booking curve and changes over time and so we will continue to push out the booking curve as long as it makes economic sense and we will continue to look at how to maximize revenue by balancing price versus occupancy at all points in the booking curve.","Tim Conder","Would you say it\u2019s optimized at this point, does it makes sense to push it out further?","Arnold Donald","I will take that one. It\u2019s never optimized. We are always trying to get through that. Hopefully asymptotically, we are approaching optimization, but we are not ahead yet, so we are not chasing it.","David Bernstein","We are in complete agreement on that. We will never get to an optimal point.","Tim Conder","I am glad I took an advanced math in school. Thank you, gentlemen.","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.","Jared Shojaian","Hi, good morning everyone. Merry Christmas and happy holidays to you. So, what EPS level do you need for double-digit ROIC is it the midpoint of your guidance, because I am kind of struggling to get there if the invested capital denominator is going up, which I would think it would be with over $4 billion in CapEx next year. So, can you help me think about that a little bit?","Arnold Donald","Yes. You are right the midpoint of the guidance will have a double-digit yield, the high end of the range was comfortably above and the low end of the range would cause us to scramble to get to the actual goal of double-digits.","David Bernstein","Given the $34 billion, $35 billion investment base we have, it takes about $350 million to add a point of ROIC or a 10th of the point is $35 million which is roughly $0.05 give or take so that\u2019s just some rules of thumb that you can go by, but I will caution you because our balance sheet does move with currency so all adjust as our P&L does. So, all of these numbers move over time and these calculations we made or the currency levels that we have included in our guidance in the press release.","Jared Shojaian","Okay, thank you. And can you \u2013 can you just confirm are you ahead on rate and occupancy for each quarter of 2018 and then can you just help us think about the yield cadence by quarter for next year?","David Bernstein","Yes, we are ahead for each quarter but at this point it is a little early to give guidance for each of the quarters, the guidance for the first quarter \u2013 the midpoint was 2% in comparison to the 2.5% for the full year. So, we are looking to do \u2013 our guidance includes better yields in the first quarter in the second, third and fourth, but it\u2019s a little early for us to try to break that down by quarter. Wave season hasn\u2019t even started yet and there is a lot left to go. So I am hesitant to give that kind of detailed guidance.","Jared Shojaian","Okay. And if I could just sneak one quick one in here, your 2018 guidance, the gap between the as reported and the constant cruise cost is larger than the gap between as reported in constant yield that\u2019s normally very unusual. So, can you just explain what\u2019s going on there?","David Bernstein","The one thing you will see differences there over time and a lot of it has to do with how much is on the books and what currency, because when we get the payments, the currency gets locked in. So, there are some differences there that can be reflected over time.","Jared Shojaian","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes with SunTrust. Please proceed.","Patrick Scholes","Hi, good morning. I am wondering if you can provide a little bit more on the recent trends in booking and pricing for China. I am wondering how that has \u2013 what the trajectory has been how that has been for you over the last 3 months as it relates to cruises in 2018? Thank you.","David Bernstein","So, we have been making lots of changes in China as Arnold discussed, we\u2019re talking about increasing the number of distributors. We\u2019ve moved away from charters and more towards group business. And so overall as Arnold had indicated with the lower capacity next year, we were looking to see improvements in China, we\u2019re seeing them in booking patterns and we expect to see hopefully that in the actual results as the year progresses.","Patrick Scholes","Okay. Second question here you talked on the prepared remarks about strength in onboard spending over the past quarter. Were there any particular promotions or programs that that drove it any new ones that we can see continuing over the next year?","David Bernstein","There were a variety of things in all areas, I mean beverage, casino shore excursions, I mean, lots of different things, retail shops where we\u2019ve done throughout the year and the way we\u2019re not stopping, I mean we\u2019ve got a lot of efforts going on, I don\u2019t if you saw the recent press release and Carnival Cruise Lines all the different things they\u2019re doing on the retail side. So our teams continue to focus on that and we believe there is a lot of opportunity in 2018 and beyond.","Arnold Donald","The 45 plus year history of the company, it\u2019s only been one year, where onboard revenues didn\u2019t increased year-over-year and I\u2019d say we\u2019ve number of initiatives on the way now should keep that trend going in the positive direction. Rate of increase has helped us that bounces around little bit, but will be growing onboard revenues.","Patrick Scholes","Okay. Thank you for that. That\u2019s all.","Arnold Donald","One more question please.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research Company. Please proceed.","Vince Ciepiel","Hi, you mentioned a return to normal in terms of booking demand. Can you help us better understand what the trajectory of that has been? Was it a bounce back in October or has it been a more linear build each month?","David Bernstein","Yes, it was \u2013 the hurricanes hit in early to mid September and we saw the disruptions and so basically the disruptions occurred in late September and October and it bounced back and by the time what we were indicating is by the time we got that to early November, we had seen a return to a normalized pattern.","Arnold Donald","I think the critical thing was being patient, obviously, with the hurricanes there was a disruption. We lost several weeks of what would have otherwise have been bookings and the trick was to stay patient and not overreact to it. And our teams did that and we are seeing the benefit of that now. So, I really appreciate any follow-up question on that. are you okay?","Vince Ciepiel","Yes, I do have. Just thinking longer term into \u201819 and \u201820 when capacity becomes a larger portion of the mix, can you remind us how to think about any potential yield benefit from new premium yielding hardware?","Arnold Donald","Yes, well, there is a lift for sure with because of the economies of scale and cabin mix and so on and so forth especially as we also retire out some of the less efficient vessels. So, there is absolutely a contribution to yield that, but obviously the bigger contribution is going to be creating the demand in excess to the supply and clearly you can hear from the comments in the call earlier we are very much focused on that and you can see it out in the marketplace everywhere. So, our goal is to keep cruise out in a positive way, touch people multiple times, multiple ways at least a week hopefully a day so that when it comes time for them to think about a holiday or a vacation that they consider cruise. We know we are helping the industry overall to do that, but because of opposition in the industry, we know we benefit disproportionately when we do that. And so that is focused along with cost containment and a smart capital management.","Arnold Donald","Okay. I want to thank you all for being with us. Sincere happy holidays to everyone. Thank you for your interest in the Carnival Corporation. We are focused on delivering double-digit return on invested capital in 2018 achieving or beating the guidance and we look forward to talking to you guys in between in the next quarter earning call. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines."],"4373":["Carnival Corporation PLC (NYSE:CCL) Q2 2016 Earnings Conference Call June 28, 2016 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Arnold Donald - President and CEO","Micky Arison - Chairman","David Bernstein - CFO","Beth Roberts - SVP, IR","Analysts","Robin Farley - UBS","Assia Georgieva - Infinity Research","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital","Greg Badishkanian - Citi","Jaime Katz - Morningstar","Harry Curtis - Nomura","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo Securities","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research","Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs","Jamie Rollo - Morgan Stanley","Stuart Gordon - Berenberg Bank","Dan McKenzie - Buckingham Research Group","Arnold Donald","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. I am Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation & plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning.","Today, I am joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison; David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Roberts, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Before I begin, as always, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking. Therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today\u2019s press release.","We delivered the strongest second quarter in the history of our Company with record adjusted earnings per share nearly double the prior year and well above the high-end of our March guidance range. The second quarter results combined with our strong book position has enabled us to maintain the midpoint of our full year guidance range despite a $0.17 drag from fuel and currency. Essentially, the strengthened underlying demand for our products saw us with greater ticket prices in both the quarter and in the remainder of the year offsetting the rise of fuel prices since the time of our last guidance as well as the very recent significant movement in currency exchange rates following the Brexit vote.","Our record results reflect our passionate 120,000-plus employees who in their efforts go above and beyond every day and who together with our hundreds of thousands of travel partners are the foundation of our sustained earnings improvement. This was among the most remarkable quarters in the history of the Company, not only because of our record-breaking financial results but because of a significant number of milestones which will contribute meaningfully to our future success. We introduced three new flagships including Carnival Vista, purposefully designed for our fun-loving Carnival Cruise Line guests with an onboard brewery experience, entertain IMAX Theater, and exhilarating sky ride experience.","Carnival Vista has already generated over 1 billion media impressions. Holland America Line\u2019s Koningsdam, christened in Rotterdam by Her Majesty, Queen M\u00e1xima of the Netherlands delivers a new premium experience where our guests can blend their own wine, enjoy high-end flights of scotch, or dance the night away in our carefully engineered Music Walk. And last but not least, the AIDAPrima made its debut with a spectacular lights show, fireworks, and memorable naming ceremony witnessed by over 1 million people gathered in Hamburg.","These well publicized introductions are certain to continue to stimulate increased consideration for cruising within our portfolio of the world\u2019s leading cruise lines. Moreover, we welcomed our tenth brand Fathom in April with inaugural impact sailing to the Dominican Republic to do good, followed by a historic first sailing to Cuba in May. Bar none, one of the most publicized events in the history of the cruise industry was our inaugural voyage to Cuba with over 20 billion media impressions, bringing the cumulative total media impressions for Carnival and Cuba to nearly 55 billion, to-date. We could not have been more proud than when our General Counsel, Arnie Perez and his wife Carmen, both Cuban born, were first to disembark when we made history as the first U.S. cruise line in more than 40 years to sail to Cuba.","Having sailed there myself, I can assure you, there is no better way to experience Cuba today than on our Fathom brand. We are working hard to enable more of our brands to bring guests to Cuba in the near future, a promising long-term driver of continued demand for our Caribbean itineraries. Indeed, we have had an eventful quarter.","Returning to the financials, China, which is destined to be the world\u2019s largest cruise market, continues to deliver accretive returns on invested capital. We again achieved significant earnings growth this quarter and continue to fully expect earnings growth for the full year directionally proportionate with our over 60% capacity increase. In China, our occupancy levels remain comparable to the high levels we have consistently achieved as we introduce hundreds of thousands of new to cruise to our brands. Yet, the penetration level for this sizable and rapidly expanding addressable market is well-below 1%, just a fraction of the more developed cruise markets. While these guests sail mostly within Asia today, over time, we have an opportunity to take them to all the great destinations our ships sail and they have not yet been, like the unique beauty of Venice and the amazing glaciers in Glacier Bay, Alaska.","We remain confident in the long-term development of the cruise industry in China with our capacity growth expected to be up over 30% in 2017. Now that\u2019s following over 60% increase absorbed in 2016. These large year-over-year percentage increases are on a very small base; so, these growth rates are the equivalent to adding about one 4,000-berth vessel each year. As a result, China represents less than 5% of our global capacity this year and will grow to just 6% next year after the entry of Majestic Princess, the first purpose built ship for Chinese guests, and AIDAbella, the first ship in China for our AIDA brand. Of course, the capacity shift to China helps create relative scarcity in our other markets, supporting global revenue yield growth. We remain confident in the outlook for measured supply growth. In 2017, our global supply growth is just 2.7%. Within that, we are rebalancing our portfolio to optimize the current demand environment. We expect a 5% capacity reduction in Europe, stemming from a capacity reduction in the Mediterranean region, which is down over 10%. We expect a modest 5% and 3% growth in capacity in the more robust Caribbean and Alaska deployments respectively. On the margin, these deployment changes should contribute to yield next year.","During the quarter, we continued to make progress on our cross-brand efforts to leverage our scale. On the revenue side, work on our revenue yield optimizing system continues, and as previously noted, will be rolled out on 30% of our inventory across six of our brands this summer. We are on track to begin prototype testing in July. Even their early stage of implementation will foster yield uplift as we refine our modeling techniques to contribute to enhance demand forecasting. Since most of this year\u2019s bookings will be behind us by the summer, we continue to expect a greater contribution from this effort in 2017.","And on the cost side, work in our procurement area continues. We remain on track for our stated $75 million of expected cost savings in 2016. Most recently, we announced a strategic coordination of our global media planning and buying for our seven brands in North America and the UK generating a significant double-digit savings on our $100 million annual media spend.","Our record quarterly results and our strong book position are a testament to the success of our ongoing strategy to drive demand well in excess of our measured capacity growth. All things considered, bookings for our ships sailing to Europe have held up well; and bookings in the Caribbean and Alaska for the remainder of the year are very strong for our brands enabling us to raise our revenue yield expectations and affirming our conviction to deliver over 20% earnings growth this year.","We are on track for the delivery of nearly 9% return on invested capital this year, and remain well on track in accelerating progress toward the double-digit threshold, again given our ongoing efforts to create demand in excess of supply coupled with our revenue management enhancements and opportunity to further leverage our scale. Despite the geopolitical events in Europe, including the Brexit vote, we remain confident in our long-term outlook given the attractive value proposition our strong and diversified brand portfolio offers, particularly in the UK where our local brands, P&O Cruises, and Cunard sold in British pounds have an increasingly competitive advantage to land-based vacation alternatives in Europe and abroad.","Our increasingly strong cash flow enables us to accelerate distributions to our shareholders. Since resuming our stock repurchase program late last year, we are nearing completion on our second $1 billion share repurchase authorization, bringing the cumulative total of repurchases to-date to approximately $1.9 billion and 38 million shares. In addition, recently, we announced our second dividend increase inside of a year, bringing our annual dividend distribution to over $1 billion. We plan to continue to return free cash flow and more to shareholders with our strong balance sheet and leverage ratios now comfortably at the better end of our targeted range. Our sustained earnings improvement coupled with our strong balance sheet has resulted in Moody\u2019s upgrading our credit rating from BAA1 to A3; and just yesterday, our Board of Directors authorizing our third $1 billion share repurchase program, all of which demonstrates continued confidence and realization of sustained double-digit return on invested capital which our Company is inherently capable of delivering.","And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to David.","David Bernstein","Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note all of my references to revenue, ticket prices, and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I\u2019ll start today with a summary of our 2016 second quarter results; then, I\u2019ll provide some insights on booking trends; and finish up with an update on our full year 2016 guidance.","Our record adjusted EPS for the second quarter was $0.49; this was $0.13 above the midpoint of our March guidance. The improvement was essentially driven by two things, $0.05 from net revenue yields which benefited from stronger pricing on closing bookings at our North American brands; and $0.06 from lower net cruise costs excluding fuel, as a result of timing of certain expenses between the quarters.","Now, let\u2019s look at our second quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 2%. The North American brands were flat while the European, Australia and Asian brands also known as our EAA brands, were up over 5%. Our total net revenue yields were up 3.6%.","Now, let\u2019s break apart the two components of net revenue yields. Net ticket yields were up 3.5%. The increase was driven by our North American brands deployment in the Caribbean and Alaska. Net onboard and other yields increased almost 4% with increases on both sides of the Atlantic, mainly related to bar and casino. Net cruise costs per ALBD excluding fuel were down almost 2%, which is about a 3-point improvement versus what was planned in our March guidance, but again, this was due to the timing of expenses between the quarters.","In summary, our record second quarter adjusted EPS was almost double the prior year or $0.24 higher, driven by operational improvements worth $0.18, the favorable net impact of lower fuel prices and currency worth $0.04, and share buyback accretion worth $0.02.","Now, let\u2019s turn to booking trends. Since March, bookings for the remainder of the year are at higher prices with less inventory remaining for sale than at the same time last year. At this point in time for the remaining two quarters of 2016, cumulative bookings are well-ahead at slightly higher prices. The fact that we are well-ahead on the book position with less inventory left to sell for the remainder of the year compared to last year, even with our capacity increase, bodes well for pricing over the next few months.","Now, let\u2019s drill down into the cumulative book position, first, for our North American brands. Caribbean occupancy is well-ahead of the prior year at nicely higher prices. For Alaska, occupancy is in line with the prior year, also at nicely higher prices. For the seasonal European program, occupancy is ahead of the prior year at lower prices, driven by geopolitical risk impacting the Mediterranean trade, as anticipated in our guidance. Secondly for our EAA brands, for Europe, occupancy is well-ahead of the prior year at higher prices. Australia and Asia are consistent with our previous guidance. As expected, we are behind on pricing, given our 60% increase in China capacity and our 15% increase in Australia capacity. For 2017, we continue to move out the booking curve. At this point in time, for the first three quarters of 2017, cumulative fleet wide bookings are well-ahead at prices that are in line with 2016, and recent trends have been very positive with robust booking activity at slightly higher prices. These are early indications for 2017. And I do caution you not to read too much into these trends.","Finally, I want to provide you with an update on our full year 2016 guidance. As Arnold indicated, our second quarter results combined with a strong book position enabled us to maintain the midpoint of our previous guidance range. This is actually a $0.17 improvement, offset by a $0.17 drag from fuel prices and currency. Our 2016 June guidance is $3.25 to $3.35. The $0.17 improvement compared to our March guidance was essentially driven by three things: One, improved net revenue yields were $0.10, $0.05 of which was achieved in the second quarter and an additional $0.05 we expect to achieve in net ticket revenues during the remainder of the year; Second, lower net cruise costs excluding fuel were $0.03; And third, the accretive impact from the additional shares we purchased since our March guidance call were $0.03.","Net cruise costs, without fuel per ALBD are now expected to be up approximately 1.5% for 2016, 0.5 point better than our March guidance. Remember that while the year is expected to be up approximately 1.5%, there are differences between the quarters. The first quarter was up about 1.5% while the second quarter was down almost 2%. However, as I mentioned during the last earnings call and taking into account the reseasonalization of our planned second quarter costs into the second half of the year, we expect third quarter net cruise costs without fuel for ALBD to be up 6% to 7%, driven by the timing of advertising expense and the re-mastering of Queen Mary 2 in dry-dock. The expectation for the fourth quarter is that costs will be flat.","At the midpoint of our June guidance, net cash provided by operating activities is approaching $5 billion. As Arnold indicated, with such strong cash flows, since late last year, we repurchased approximately 38 million of our shares, and our Board of Directors authorized a third $1 billion stock buyback program, yesterday. In addition, we still have about $100 million remaining on our second $1 billion stock buyback authorization. Our June guidance EPS calculations assume shares repurchased through last week. For the full year, the calculations assume approximately 750 million shares outstanding on a weighted average basis, while for the third quarter, the calculations assume 743 million shares outstanding.","On a final note, given the volatility of FX rates since the Brexit vote, we want to share with you our current rules of thumb about the impact that currency and fuel prices can have on our 2016 results. To start with, a 10% change in all relevant currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would impact our P&L by approximately $0.18 for the remainder of the year and $0.09 for the third quarter. For fuel price changes, a 10% change in the current spot price represents a $0.07 impact for the remainder of the year and $0.04 for the third quarter. Fuel expense in our guidance is about $920 million for the full year. The third rule of thumb relates to our fuel derivative portfolio. A 10% change in Brent would result in a $0.03 change in realized losses on fuel derivatives for the remainder of the year and $0.02 for the third quarter.","And now, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Arnold.","Arnold Donald","Thank you, David. Operator, please open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question is from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead.","Robin Farley","I wonder if you could give a little color. You are raising your full-year -- your guidance for the year. Is it China yields coming in line with expectations and Caribbean coming in better? I wonder if you could throw a little bit of color on how the different regions are coming in versus your previous expectations, and also a little bit of Eastern Med since some investors have a concern that Eastern Med may be worse than expected, but clearly, overall, things are coming in better than expected. So just wondering what areas are driving that more than others.","Arnold Donald","Yes, generally speaking, obviously, as we said, just said that Alaska and the Caribbean are strong. So, those, primarily North American sourced, and the markets definitely are providing a lot of the higher yield expectations. At the same time, we are continuing to show strong improvement in Europe from our EAA brands. The seasonal European business, so, the North America brands going to Europe have experienced more challenge as we previously communicated, but most of the drive is coming from the strength of the North American markets.","Robin Farley","And China is still in line with your previous expectations?","Arnold Donald","We are very pleased with China. China continues to be accretive to us, as we\u2019ve indicated before, a volume and return story, more than a yield story. Yields are down in China this year. But overall, our earnings are proportionate to our capacity growth. We see continued demand. And again, as we said just a few minutes ago, our capacity changes are -- they sound like big percentage increases, but in terms of the actual volume, we are going to go from 5% of our capacity to 6%, next year, but China is doing well for us and we continue to have great confidence in the business. And overall, the business is accretive, especially for the brands that are there.","Robin Farley","And then just lastly, did the Brexit vote -- has that changed your outlook for the remainder of the year; is there any sort of different view factored in from that? I mean obviously the FX impact that you\u2019ve updated today, but...?","Arnold Donald","Yes. At this point in time, the FX impact which obviously we\u2019ve calculated in. We\u2019ve taken a strong look at our business obviously in the UK and in Europe, and then everywhere else in the world to see what possible ramifications would be. But at this point, we have no reason to adjust anything.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Assia Georgieva with Infinity Research. Please go ahead.","Assia Georgieva","Congratulations on a great, great quarter, and I had one question. It seems that European pricing stabilized over the months of May and through the early part of June. Is that what you\u2019re seeing, and does that give you more confidence in terms of the Q3 and the fiscal year outlook?","Arnold Donald","Thank you for the acknowledgment on the quarter. We see in Europe overall that again the booking curve is getting a little further out; we ended up with less inventory to sell, which allows us obviously to improve closer in pricing, which contributes to the yield growth, and David may have a comment.","David Bernstein","Yes. Keep in mind that in our situation, 90% of the guests on our European itineraries are European; and so, this is a very different picture of the North Americans flying over. And I think as we had said a number of times earlier this year, the North Americans, while the pricing was down, we are filling the ships; and recently we have seen some very good demand for the European itineraries from the North Americans.","Assia Georgieva","Thank you so much, David and Arnold. That\u2019s what I was seeing, and just wanted to confirm that. Again, smooth sailing into Q3.","Arnold Donald","Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.","Felicia Hendrix","David, thank you for the color on next year; it looks like things are starting to shape up well, although it\u2019s early days. I just wanted to talk for a moment about the yield optimization or the revenue management optimization program that you are undergoing now. And, recognizing that we\u2019ll start to see the impact next year, just wondering if you could help us understand what kind of yield contribution you might be able to get from that, from having those six brands more on that program?","Arnold Donald","This is Arnold first. First of all, on the new revenue management tools, we are very excited about it. We feel the brands are collaborating exceptionally well on it. It is going to allow us many, many more capabilities in terms of more time and inquiries, smaller movements and price movements to optimize pricing, and therefore maximize on the yield results. And, as we said, we\u2019ll be pretty much booked by the end of the summer. So most of the impact of this initial phase, we\u2019ll see next year. And then into next year, we\u2019ll add some additional features, which will bring in the rest of the brands as well and we\u2019ll be able to max out going into 2018 from the tool itself and the better management skills that our people will develop from being able to utilize this tool and be able to see things in a more timely, and be able to respond in a more rapid fashion. I\u2019ll let David comment beyond that; but go ahead, David.","David Bernstein","No, I agree with Arnold; and it\u2019s really a multi-year process as we keep rolling out more of the inventory on the system, and we learn from it. It is a little early to try to give guidance for 2017 or the exact impact in 2017 from the system; we\u2019ll talk more about yields in December. But keep in mind overall, to achieve our double-digit ROIC goal, our expectation is that we will see solid yield improvement in 2017 and beyond to achieve those goals. And, we\u2019ll give you more color in coming December.","Felicia Hendrix","And for my next question, I apologize if this sounds like a repeat of something that you\u2019ve already said and answered, but I keep getting investor questions about this. So, I am going to ask or as a point of clarification. As you look at your second half of the year, given where you viewed second half of the year when you provided your guidance previously in the spring versus today, has anything changed?","David Bernstein","I guess overall, we took the ticket yield guidance, as I mentioned in my comments, up by $0.05. And so, I think as Arnold alluded to before, we are seeing strength in the North American market; and as a result of that, we took our yield guidance up for the back half of the year.","Arnold Donald","Yes, what\u2019s changed is obviously we have more clarity on line of sight and we\u2019re ahead on booking; we\u2019ve got less volume to sell; we are at higher prices. And so, we have affirmation for being positive.","Felicia Hendrix","So without putting words in your mouth, it sounds like you are more optimistic about the second half because you have better visibility than you were when you last -- when we last met in this forum?","Arnold Donald","Yes.","Felicia Hendrix","Great. David, just housekeeping; just given the uncertainty, given Brexit, given the volatility in the markets, the fact that everybody is trying to figure out which companies are most exposed to which currencies, I know in the past you haven\u2019t broken this out, but is there any way to give us any understanding or any kind of magnitude to how exposed you are to the British pound?","David Bernstein","The British pound represents about 30% of our currency exposure. So, we talk about a full-year impact of $0.27 for a 10% change in all currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. So, for the British pound, you are talking about roughly $0.08 on a full-year basis to net income.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citi. Please go ahead.","Greg Badishkanian","Just the first question; you mentioned that North American passengers going to Europe that that trend recently strengthened. And, I am wondering just with the volatility in Europe, the currency changes, would you expect North American sourced business to become a bigger portion of passengers sailing on European itineraries over the next several quarters? And, I think it\u2019s like 10% sourced goes to -- of the European itineraries, I think 10% are sourced from North America. Would you expect that to increase over the next three quarters?","David Bernstein","Really hard to say. You are talking a lot of itineraries, multiple brands. Our brands do a great job, looking at it itinerary by itinerary and sourcing based off of where they can get the maximum amount of yield. And so, there is a lot of factors to consider and a call like that in the short-term would be very difficult for us to opine on at this point.","Greg Badishkanian","And then just to even further clarify China, which I think we all know the answer, you\u2019re doing this different ways. But from your vantage point, you are not seeing any material drop off in the last let\u2019s say since you reported in March; you haven\u2019t seen a material drop off in pricing or booking trends either at the travel agent or the charter level or in terms of renegotiating at significantly lower prices with the charter companies that you have deals with for 2016 pricing. Is that the case or not?","Arnold Donald","For us, as I said, first of all, our occupancy on our sailings is very comparable, which is very strong to prior year; we see no major change in occupancy whatsoever. In terms of yields, of course, the yields are down, but on the other hand, our earnings are up proportionately. So, we are pricing at what we need to price for it to make sense for our business in China. We\u2019re achieving that pricing in our charters and our contracts and with our distributors. And obviously, they have to win as well. And they won\u2019t to be in the business if they\u2019re not winning, but they are in the business. So, I think that overall things again, in a market that is really so sizable and we\u2019re at such an early beginning, we have such low penetration for a market of that scale, I think we are in good shape going forward.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Jaime Katz","My first question is on the double-digit ROIC goals. And, I know in the past you guys have mentioned that the Carnival brand I think was already yielding double-digit. So, I am curious if most of the other brands are sort of catching up to speed or if the brands tend to be bifurcated someway and maybe it might take a little longer for some of the underperforming brands to catch up.","Arnold Donald","As we\u2019ve said in the past, we expect to achieve double-digit returns on invested capital. Earlier this year, we said in the next two to three years; at the end of this year, it will be the next one to two years. We are going to approach 9% return on invested capital this year. So, that\u2019s a good sign for what you can expect going forward. So, on balance we\u2019re going to get there. You are right, we did share that the Carnival brand itself was already at double-digit return on invested capital, we have other brands that are. And overall, we will be there across the base of our business in time.","David Bernstein","There are differences between the brands, but we generally don\u2019t provide detail by brand.","Jaime Katz","And then, do you guys want to offer any color on early reads on Fathom and how you guys are thinking about that brand going forward, whether maybe it can be a much more important part of the business down the road, just by the early demand you\u2019ve seen? I know it\u2019s only one ship, but just curious if you have any commentary.","Arnold Donald","It is only one ship. For the Dominican Republic part of the Fathom story, those that have gone have loved the experience and felt that they were personally transformed et cetera. It\u2019s different targeted segment. It\u2019s a travel segment more than a cruise segment. And, our ability to access that segment is challenging. We remain very optimistic about the brand, but the reality is we have to see the bookings from that segment. With regards to Cuba where we literally made history through the Fathom brand, our fall bookings are very strong for Cuba. We got a late approval; the summer has not been full, although the experience has been phenomenal. We do have opportunities remaining on some of the summer sailings into Cuba. And we will just have to let it play out. And the team\u2019s done a marvelous job with the on the ground product and the ship onboard product for DR. And obviously, we\u2019re honored and privileged and somewhat humbled to be the first going to Cuba.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Harry Curtis","I wanted to drill a little bit further into your bookings for the third and the fourth quarter in Europe, just to get a sense of the visibility but also the risk. How booked are you for the European brands in the third and the fourth quarters?","David Bernstein","Generally speaking, we don\u2019t give all the details by brand. But for the third quarter, we\u2019re generally 80% to 90% booked, has been the historic range. And for the quarter, the fourth quarter, which would be one quarter out, it\u2019d be 50% to 70% booked. Now, I think on the last call, I said we were sort of at the middle of those ranges -- or maybe that was the December call. I don\u2019t remember exactly. And the booking curve has continued to move out. So, we\u2019re a little bit higher than the midpoint of those ranges. Every brand has a slightly different booking curve, and that has to do with the nationalities and the people. So, there are differences between the brands all around the world. But it\u2019s more cultural than economic generally speaking. So, hopefully that gives you enough color to make some judgments.","Harry Curtis","And then recently, have you seen any deviations from those trends? Do you expect kind of the slope of the line to continue to trend in the same pattern that it\u2019s done recently?","David Bernstein","No significant deviations; I mean, generally speaking, the booking curve all around the globe has been moving out somewhat, and we feel very good about that situation for all the brands.","Harry Curtis","And, moving over to China for my second question, there seems to be a fair amount of debate over the relationships with the charter operators. Do you have any -- you mentioned that your earnings have grown in line with your capacity growth. Do you expect that to continue as you look into the capacity that you\u2019re introducing in 2017? And the reason that I ask the question is that there seems to be some pushback on from some investors in China that with another year of such large supply growth that there is going to be -- you are going to hit a demand wall.","Arnold Donald","Again, just to put things in perspective again, while the percentages sound so large, it\u2019s equivalent of moving one additional ship in, to a market that in time is going to be far larger than the North American market and could be as large proportionately as the entire global cruise market is, right now. So, while there may be some bumps in and temporary discontinuities as distributors ramp up with their own personnel to move the volume of cruise because a lot of those distributors sell other type of travel products obviously, and there might be some bumps along those ways -- along those lines. Overall, China remains a robust opportunity. We are still at the very, very beginning of it. So, I don\u2019t see that -- you are going to have some negotiations going on; everybody wants a better price; it is a B2B business almost now. And of course, there will be negotiations trying to get lower prices, if they can get better returns and what have you. But overall, things are very good; the cruise product that we offer is well-received and excellent. We are going to have our first purpose-built ship, the Majestic Princess going in next year. She is being met with very, very positive response by the distributors already. And we have our first ship, AIDA as I mentioned going in next year, and then we have our base for Costa and the rest of the Princess. But on balance, it\u2019s the equivalent of adding one ship. And so, we\u2019ll be going from 5% of our capacity to 6% of our capacity, which is not very large at all. Even with the industry moving in a few additional ships, it is stuff that can be managed and may be a bump here in road here or there. But over time, it\u2019s going to be great. And we do expect to see continued earnings improvement, directionally to capacity expansion.","David Bernstein","And keep in mind, we\u2019re also expanding the number of offices we have in China. We\u2019re now up to 12 offices and there are more to be opened. We\u2019re working with more and more travel agents and expanding that base, plus we continue to educate the travel agents on -- more about cruising and how to better sell cruises. So, we continue to expand the opportunity in marketplace as well as really as Arnold indicated, it\u2019s really just one additional four -- the equivalent of one additional 4,000-passenger ship, entering a huge market with tremendous opportunity.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Tim Conder","Again, congratulations on the quarter and thank you for the color so far. A couple of just clarification follow-on items, David, on the British pound, that 30% just to make sure that was on annual net income exposure basis?","David Bernstein","Correct.","Tim Conder","Any additional color you could give; I know you\u2019ve got borrowings and everything in euro, but any -- where does the pound, I guess euro, and maybe a couple other currencies rank annually on that net income exposure basis, maybe highest to lowest of the top three, four, five, whatever you want to feel comfortable in providing; and if so, the percentages?","David Bernstein","The Aussie dollar is probably about 35%. I think, historically I have told everybody that the British pound and the Aussie dollar represented two thirds of our currency exposure. The remaining exposure is you \u2018e got the Canadian dollar, the euro, and the Chinese renminbi. And those three are probably about 10% apiece. And this is of course all from a net income bottom-line exposure. We have a lot more than 10% of our business in euros but we also have a lot of expenses in euros, which net out the exposure when you get to the bottom line.","Tim Conder","And then, the other question, and we are getting it more frequently, is given some Asian based competitors adding, buying, and then therefore adding apparent capacity long-term, it would appear that if we go out \u201818, \u201819, you could see some years of 6% capacity growth on a gross basis for the industry. Arnold, any color on that, maybe how that would shake out net or it would appear that the majority of that capacity also would be in China; just any additional thoughts or color on that looking out \u201818 and beyond?","Arnold Donald","Our commitment is definitely to measure capacity growth, not just supply growth. And, as we are delivering double-digit return and as the ships we have do that, we will retain those ships in the fleet; as they don\u2019t do that, then obviously we would not. But we are totally committed to measured capacity growth. And, given the large number of ships we have in the base we represent, that influences overall the global capacity for the industry. So, yes, a lot of the capacity growth you\u2019re going to see as you have already identified, is targeted in China, which means the rest of the market -- the rest of the world, the other 95% of today\u2019s capacity is not seeing very much growth. And things change for whatever reasons, which we don\u2019t anticipate.","But if they were to change, we can easily modify and adapt, and change our replenishment strategy. We will always want the new ships because they\u2019re more efficient, more cost effective. So, you would always want the new ships you would look at the timing of moving out the ships that are less efficient and not generating returns.","Tim Conder","Would you anticipate that number for the industry to maybe come down or would you anticipate some higher scrappage rates going forward as the global\u2026 [Multiple speakers]","Arnold Donald","Right now, it depends on the demand in the market, right? So, for us, things are robust. Keep in mind that the industry overall is underpenetrated. In our case, with 10 brands, we have a huge base of people who have experienced cruise and love it. Cruise is still the best vacation value there is; there is a tremendous vacation experience. Onboard revenues have grown every year in the cruise industry except -- and for us, our onboard revenues have grown every year except one year in the whole history of the time we have been in business; and so that we can look back to and find, and that is in all kinds of environments, recessionary environments, crises environments, everything. So, underpenetrated, big base of people who already want to cruise, great dynamics; it\u2019s hard to say, but I don\u2019t anticipate acceleration of retirements of ships. But, the point is, we have mobile assets; we have a number of triggers we can pull; and we can do what we need to do because we are committed to double-digit return on invested capital and sustaining that.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research.","Jared Shojaian","Arnold, you talked about a 5% reduction in European capacity and 5% increase in the Caribbean. So, my question is, what are you seeing from competitors on global redeployment and what gives you confidence that we won\u2019t have a repeat of 2014 when the Caribbean became oversupplied?","Arnold Donald","Well, in the near-term, it\u2019s not going to happen because the deployments are mostly transparent at this point. So, the best indication is that we can see a lot of where the ships are going already. So, you won\u2019t see a 2014 explosion of Caribbean capacity; in 2017, you won\u2019t see that. So having said that there could still be additional capacity in the Caribbean because they\u2019re strong now for us and I\u2019m sure it is for others too and similarly to the extent possible up in Alaska as well. But we are anticipating that. Every year there is overcapacity somewhere and so on and so forth. And again, we have lots of different ways to manage our business to ensure that we deliver the results we are committed to delivering, which is a double-digit return on invested capital. But, we don\u2019t anticipate an explosion in the Caribbean, like you saw in 2014.","David Bernstein","Keep in mind that when we planned the 2014 deployments, our brands were not coordinating their own -- the deployment within our own Company. So, a number of individual brands each made what they thought were really good decisions. Now the deployment is well-coordinated within our Company and there\u2019s more visibility across the whole corporation, which is how we wound up with the 5%.","Beth Roberts","Right, the 5% for us compares to a 20% growth we had in 2014; so, it is considerably different.","Jared Shojaian","And then, I just want to follow up on some of that capacity commentary because it still -- I mean it feels like a lot of investors are still pretty concerned about the amount of industry growth over the next several years. So, what levers do you have to pull, if you need to? I mean, you talked about the retirements, but I mean why wouldn\u2019t reducing utilization work; I mean is that one opportunity; are there other areas that you see? I would just love to hear about any flexibility you think you have there.","Arnold Donald","Again, you want that new ships because they are more efficient; and inherently, they can give you a better return. So the new ships will come. The question is what do you do with the other ships? And as long as they are returning, you\u2019ll keep them. If the demand is there, there is growth in China; Cuba opens up; there is renewed interest in the Caribbean and so on, and growth prospects for the Caribbean, all those things are drivers that can help give you yields and returns on some of the existing fleet. So, the lever is pretty straightforward. You will be able to tell what ships are performing and which ones aren\u2019t. And if you don\u2019t have a good redeployment plan, then it would make sense to exit.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Steven Kent","Hi, a couple questions, one, you had some realized gains on fuel derivatives for 2016. I think you said it was $330 million in March. Can you tell us what it\u2019s running at now? And then, your marketing programs that were being shifted, what specifically was shifted and what was the rationale? And then, finally on the Queen Mary retrofit, are we going to see more Cunard and Queen ships follow up over the next couple of years?","David Bernstein","I\u2019ll take the first question, Steve. In terms of realized losses on fuel derivatives, it\u2019s $285 million that was built into our June guidance, as a result of the change in Brent, which moved up, the losses came down just a little bit. In terms of advertising built into the guidance, I mean it was -- these are small movements that the brands planned well-ahead and make decisions over time, based off of what they see happening in booking trends and other things, and they will reseasonalize. Keep in mind, every good plan has got to change, as you see movements. It\u2019s no different when we see strength in bookings, we raise prices; we make changes over time. So that\u2019s really essentially, it is not a big deal and it\u2019s just some seasonalization between the quarters.","Arnold Donald","We manage to yield; we don\u2019t manage to a timeframe. So, costs can move in and out quarters, but we are managing to yield and return.","David Bernstein","Queen Mary.","Arnold Donald","What was the question on Queen Mary 2?","David Bernstein","The Cunard, the Queens, and are we going to see more Cunard ships?","Arnold Donald","Are we going to see more ships in Cunard?","Steven Kent","Whether you\u2019re going to retrofit some more of them?","Arnold Donald","I am sorry?","Steven Kent","I asked whether you\u2019re going to retrofit more of the Queens.","Arnold Donald","Oh, retrofit. Basically, Queen Mary 2 went into a dry dock as the ships periodically do three to five years, depending on the class of ship. And the others are practically new, have gone through a dry dock recently. So, it\u2019s just part of dry dock. On the other hand, Queen Mary 2, there was a re-mastering. I mean, she is the only ocean liner out there, and we\u2019re very, very proud of her. And wherever she goes, she is still iconic. People gather by the thousands and tens of thousands to see her sail in and sail out. And so, we take great pride in her, and also we can generate the yields from the additional investment. So, we did do a re-mastering of the Queen Mary 2 versus just a traditional kind of dry dock where you refresh.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Jamie Rollo with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Jamie Rollo","Just a few questions on China Festival please. Could you give us a feeling for roughly how much your yields are down by year-on-year, just sort of directionally, and what the yield premium is to the rest of the Group now, please?","David Bernstein","We\u2019ve said all along, the yields are down. We had previously indicated that the ticket prices were higher than the fleet average. And at this point in time, the ticket prices are in line with the overall fleet average, but it\u2019s really an apples and oranges comparison, because in China you\u2019ve got a much higher percentage of the fleet is in the contemporary brands. And so, you\u2019re comparing apples and oranges when you\u2019re taking the average China ticket yield to the overall fleet average ticket yield. So, keep that in mind as you evaluate the numbers.","Jamie Rollo","Okay. So, it\u2019s fair to say, it\u2019s not yield accretive to move ships to China, if they match the existing brand type?","David Bernstein","They\u2019re yield accretive to the brands within the brand.","Arnold Donald","Within the brand, it\u2019s definitely yield accretive.","Jamie Rollo","Understood; and you also mentioned some negotiations with charterers for next year. Is that a bit more aggressive than usual because you\u2019ve got several new brands entering the market, Norwegian, MSC, Dream, or is that in line with what you saw last year?","Arnold Donald","I would say the negotiations are in line. I mean, there is always a negotiation. And, I don\u2019t want to overstate that. I mean, they are our partners; they need to win too, but of course they are going to try to get as great a return as they can possibly get. There are sub agents involved with distributors and so on and so forth. So, I don\u2019t see any greater intensity in the negotiations when you bake fundamental change in the tone or nature or anything like that. But there\u2019s always ongoing negotiation, as you look out into future years with the charters.","Jamie Rollo","And then, the other question is just on your yield guidance for the rest of the year. I think if my math is right, you need something like 3.5% to 4% in Q4. Is that sequential improvement just the mix of deployment; you\u2019ve got obviously more Caribbean and more Europe or is that a genuine underlying improvement for Q3?","David Bernstein","You do also have to remember you\u2019ve got slightly easier comparison in the prior year to Q4 versus Q3; that\u2019s part of it as well as mix of the ships and the deployments and a number of other things.","Arnold Donald","But fundamentally, it is improvement.","Jamie Rollo","And each quarter is still roughly 100 basis points all accounting benefit to revenue yield still?","David Bernstein","Correct.","Arnold Donald","Directionally, yes.","Jamie Rollo","Directionally?","Arnold Donald","Yes.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Stuart Gordon with Berenberg Bank. Please go ahead.","Stuart Gordon","Just a quick question just to break down a little bit on the $0.17 of headwind that you have now got. My back of the envelope suggests that that would be about $0.07 or $0.08 of fuel and around about $0.10 of currency; I was just hoping you could confirm that. And on the currency, just interested how you\u2019ve dealt with sterling, as we move into the third quarter, because obviously before the big move, most people will have paid for their holiday. So, have you already swept that into dollars, so the third quarter is not going to be such a big hit or was that sitting in sterling and therefore the repatriation cost still exists?","David Bernstein","As far as the split is concerned, the fuel price was roughly, including derivatives, $0.10 and currency was $0.07, which made up the $0.17 compared to our March guidance. In terms of the third quarter, the way it works from an accounting perspective is the exchange rate gets locked in for accounting when the people pay for their cruise. From an actual exchange of physical currencies from one to another, we do that, generally speaking, on a daily or a weekly basis, depending on what currencies we need. We do have bills in British pound; we retain those currencies; and the extra we do exchange into U.S. dollars or euros or whatever currency we\u2019re short.","Stuart Gordon","So, just to be clear, people will have paid for their holiday before the drop in sterling, so that will have been locked in at the better sterling rate for the third quarter?","David Bernstein","That is correct. And, in the 10% impact, we take those locked in rates into account when we get a currency impact on our P&L. So, I said that 10% movement would be $0.09 for the third quarter. I took into account that a big chunk of that revenue has been paid for and locked in.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research Group. Please go ahead.","Dan McKenzie","I am wondering if you can help us size the distribution opportunity in China in Carnival\u2019s presentation today. So, when you say China\u2019s a volume story, how big a lever is the distribution lever there?","Arnold Donald","What do you mean when you say how big a lever is the distribution?","Dan McKenzie","So, when you think about the number of travel -- you have 12 offices there; I appreciate the perspective. But, when you think about the volume of travel agencies, how many total travel agencies are licensed for outbound travel and how many relationships does Carnival have today with those travel agencies and the growth trajectory of those agencies?","Arnold Donald","Yes. So today, we are beginning to expand the number of distributors. Historically, we\u2019ve worked with principally a group of 10; we are starting to expand beyond that. We are starting of course in the -- near Shanghai, near Tianjin where the ships were, and we are starting to expand throughout the country. That\u2019s why we expanded the offices. Some of those distributors obviously have sub agents, sub distributors that they\u2019ve worked with in the past. So, our reach is a little bit more than what a lot of -- quite a bit more than the 10 we work with directly through that. But we are expanding the -- as we expand capacity, we are expanding the reach of distributors and going into not only further through the country but also more density where the ships are. So, it\u2019s a nascent market and we are building it as we go.","David Bernstein","Keep in mind, there is 26,000 travel agents in China; about 2,600 of them have outbound licenses. And so, what we\u2019re seeing happening is while there is a small group that tends to charter let\u2019s say the full ship, we\u2019re probably dealing with 250 to 300 agents who are doing large groups and chartering part of a ship at this point in time. But, those 250 or 300 travel agents are also selling through the other 24,000 travel agents around the country; that is what Arnold called sub agents, and they are selling into these groups and charters. So, it\u2019s a tremendous distribution system and it can be leveraged. And it\u2019s part of the reason why we are so optimistic about the growth in China, tremendous opportunity.","Dan McKenzie","That will do it for me. Thanks so much, guys.","David Bernstein","Operator, I guess, at this point we probably have time for one more question.","Operator","There are no other questions on the line.","Arnold Donald","Okay, everyone, thank you so much. I really appreciate it and look forward to seeing you guys during the quarter and to sharing with you next quarter\u2019s results. Thank you very much. Thank you.","Operator","You\u2019re welcome. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines."],"4380":["Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) Q2 2018 Results Earnings Conference Call June 25, 2018 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Arnold Donald - CEO, President","Micky Arison - Chairman","David Bernstein - CFO & CAO","Beth Roberts \u2013 SVP, IR","Analysts","Steve Wieczynski - Stifel","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays","Robin Farley - UBS","Jaime Katz - Morningstar","Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo","Assia Georgieva - Infinity","Greg Badishkanian - Citi","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust","Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Company","Operator","Arnold Donald","Good morning, everyone. And welcome to our Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation & plc. Today, I'm joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison, who is in Europe right now; as well as David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Roberts, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, both here in Miami.","Thank you all for joining us this morning, and thank you for joining us in what is known internationally as the Day of the Seafarer. Thanks to all those seafarers out there for the positive impact they have on our everyday quality of life the world over.","Now before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking. Therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release.","We delivered the strongest second quarter adjusted earnings in the history of our company, and that's on top of last year's record results. Adjusted earnings of $0.68 per share were more than $100 million higher. That's more than 30% higher than prior year as well as $0.10 above the midpoint of March guidance and $0.08 above the high end of our March guidance range.","These record results reflect the efforts of our passionate 120,000-plus employees, who go above and beyond every day as well as that of hundreds of thousands of travel professionals who support our brands.","Collectively, those efforts helped to mitigate a $0.19 drag for the year from fuel and currency, both moving against us since the time of our March guidance. While our full year guidance is now below March guidance in the range of $4.15 to $4.25, we continue to have strong operating performance.","Despite the impact of fuel and currency, the midpoint of our original December guidance of $4.15 has become the floor for our current full year guidance, reflecting continued strength in the business.","Essentially, strength in underlying demand for our cruise offerings fostered greater ticket prices year-to-date and more than offset the unfavorable impact of fuel and currency for the full year compared to our December guidance.","It was reinforcing to see constant currency revenue yield growth this quarter of roughly 4.8%. Now that's on top of the 5.1% improvement achieved in the second quarter last year.","We continue to drive revenue yield growth by increasing demand in excess of our measured capacity growth through our ongoing guest experience, marketing and public relations efforts.","By all accounts, this was a significant quarter for our company, not only because of our record-breaking financial results, but because of a number of milestones, which will contribute meaningfully to our future success. We introduced two spectacular new ships, an important part of our measured capacity growth strategy.","In March, we delivered Carnival Horizon, offering Carnival Cruise Line guests even more ways to choose fun, from a new Dr. Seuss themed WaterWorks aqua park; to Guy's Pig & Anchor Smokehouse | Brewhouse, serving up real-deal barbecue favorites by Guy Fieri as well as 4 new craft beers brewed onboard, a nice complement to Guy's hugely popular burger bar serving arguably the best burgers at sea. The ship also features the SkyRide aerial experience, an IMAX theater and Family Harbor featuring extra roomy accommodations.","Carnival garnered nearly 250 million media impressions around its creative naming ceremony in New York City, which included showcasing the talented young artist from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, reaffirming Carnival's long-standing strong support of St. Jude's.","Festivities included an entertaining lip sync battle between Horizon's godmother, Grammy-award winning artist and actress, Queen Latifah; and Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl Champion kicker, Jake Elliott.","Also during the quarter, our ultra-luxury brand, Seabourn, debuted the fifth all-suite ship in its fleet. Seabourn Ovation provides guests with a private veranda in every luxurious suite, sophisticated decor core fashioned by Adam Tihany and a new alfresco dining venue, Earth & Ocean at The Patio, as well as a number of innovative programs, including An Evening with Tim Rice, Spa and Wellness with Dr. Andrew Weil and The Grill by Thomas Keller. Select sailings will also include Ventures by Seabourn programs, which are expedition-style excursions featuring a team of world-class expedition experts with a focus on allowing guests to experience nature up close.","Seabourn Ovation launched on May 11 at a distinguished naming ceremony in Valletta, Malta, with highly acclaimed actress and singer, Elaine Page, serving as godmother during a ceremony that lit up the UNESCO World Heritage site.","Our measured capacity growth strategy also takes into consideration the replacement cycle of less-efficient ships. Over the last 12 years, we have sold 22 vessels into the secondary market, including the two ships that left the fleet this past quarter. We plan to continue removing ships from our fleet and remain on track to sell, on average, one to two ships annually with more announcements expected later this year.","Moreover, we achieved a number of milestones in our strategic core development efforts around the globe. In Alaska, Holland America Group recently announced a minority position in a joint venture to further strengthen our ties in Skagway, Alaska, the gateway to the legendary Gold Rush region and destination to 80% of our Alaskan cruises.","In Spain, we recently opened a second new state-of-the-art terminal in Barcelona. We bring over 1 million cruise guests a year to Barcelona. In Australia, where seven of our nine brands operate, we entered into an important long-term agreement with the Port of Brisbane. We'll have priority berthing rights at a new terminal to be completed by 2020, enabling our brands to add even more calls and take even larger ships to Brisbane.","At the same time, we are expanding and diversifying the home port we sail from in China while engaging in strategic port development throughout Asia, providing additional attractive ports of call for our Chinese guests. For example, we recently signed an agreement for preferential berthing for our brands in Sasebo in Japan.","We also announced a long-term preferential berthing agreement in Dubai and brought a strategic alliance for development of cruising in the region. Dubai will not only serve as an attractive port of call but will facilitate the development of source markets in the Arabian Gulf.","During the quarter, we also received meaningful recognition for our brands. Now while each year, we receive well over 500 awards, there are a few I would like to highlight, including Carnival Cruise Lines being named Most Trusted Cruise Line by Reader's Digest for the fourth year in a row; and Princess Cruises and the cast of The Love Boat being inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame.","Our Ocean Originals TV program, Ocean Treks with Jeff Corwin, The Voyager with Josh Garcia and Vacation Creation, have been honored in their second year with 14 Telly Awards. That's even more than last year. And in the U.K., reality based series, The Cruise, filmed onboard Princess, has ranked among the most watched factual programs on primetime television in Britain with 4 million viewers per episode.","Our CSMART, Center for Simulator Maritime Training, was recognized as the world's first Center for Safety Excellence by DNV GL, one of the leading maritime classification societies, citing CSMART's commitment to safety and ongoing training to our 7,000 bridge and engineering officers across our nine world leading cruise lines with the industry's most advanced simulating equipment technology and curriculum.","Also worth noting, our corporation earned a perfect score in Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index, was acknowledged by Forbes as one of the top 500 Best Large Employers, and by Corporate Responsibility Magazine as 1 of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens and ranking highest in the travel sector.","Progress continues on our new revenue management system, which is expected to be rolled out to approximately 90% of the inventory for six of our brands by the fall. We also remain on track to deliver nearly $80 million of cost savings in 2018 as we continue efforts to containing costs by leveraging our industry leading scale.","With strong and growing cash from operations, we remain committed to distributing cash to shareholders. During the quarter, we accelerated returns to shareholders by increasing our dividend of $0.50 per quarter, generating annual dividend distributions now exceeding $1.4 billion.","At the same time, we reauthorized our $1 billion share repurchase program. Since March, we invested more than $375 million in Carnival stock, bringing the cumulative total share repurchased to over $3.7 billion since late 2015.","In addition to all our efforts to drive operating performance, there are several structural advantages to our industry. We have a significant long-term opportunity to increase penetration levels in all of our existing markets. All told, the cruise industry represents less than 2% of all hotel rooms in the world, and we will continue to be under penetrated as we operate in an industry that is capacity constrained.","We also enjoy significantly higher satisfaction levels than land-based alternatives, yet we offer a greater value for money with a value gap that can range anywhere from 15% to 45% for comparable land-based resort vacations.","Of course, demographics are supporting the growth in cruising, benefiting from the millennial generation and the aging of the baby boomers. In North America alone, the number of people reaching retirement age goes from 48 million in 2015 to 56 million in 2020 and 74 million by 2030.","Now that's a target-rich environment for us as this segment has the time and the resources, given our value proposition, to sail multiple times per year. Factographic trends also support the growth in cruise as consumers invest more in collecting experiences rather than buying things. And at the same time, increasing wealth in emerging markets is yet another powerful driver.","To capitalize on these many structural advantages, we continue to proactively generate demand by increasing consideration for cruise globally through our marketing and public relations efforts, while at the same time, stepping up our already high guest experience levels to increase retention, frequency and propensity to recommend to others.","Our ongoing effort to generate demand build confidence in our continued ability to increase capacity and prices. All told, the strong execution in the quarter, the fundamental strength in demand, combined with many achievements realized already this year to sustain the momentum all bolster our conviction in delivering double-digit return on invested capital in 2018 and beyond.","With that, I'll turn the call to David.","David Bernstein","Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note all of my references to revenue, ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I'll start today with a summary of our 2018 second quarter results. Then I'll provide an update on current booking trends and finish up with some additional color on our 2018 June guidance.","As Arnold indicated, our adjusted EPS for the second quarter was $0.68. This was $0.10 above the midpoint of our March guidance. The improvement was driven by three things, $0.05 was from increased net ticket yield, which benefited from stronger pricing on closing bookings on both sides of the Atlantic for all our brands, $0.02 was from improved onboard and other yields, which continue to benefit from a variety of ongoing efforts, and $0.03 was from lower net cruise costs, excluding fuel, due to the seasonalization of costs between the quarters.","Now let's look at our second quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 1.4%. Our North America and Australia segment, more commonly known as our NAA brands, were up 2.1%, while our Europe and Asia segment, more commonly known as our EA brands, were flat. Our total net revenue yields were up 4.8%.","Now let's break apart the two components of net revenue yield. Net ticket yields were also up a strong 4.8%. Overall, the net ticket yield increase was comprised of first, a decrease in our NAA brands' itineraries in the Caribbean, which was included in our previous guidance as a result of last fall's hurricane impact.","Second, increases in our NAA brands' itineraries in Europe and Alaska, and third, increases in our EA brands' itineraries in Europe and China as well as various other programs, including World Cruises. I will add that we do expect to see an improving trend in the Caribbean over time. Net onboard and other yields likewise increased 4.8%, with similar increases on both sides of the Atlantic, with all the major categories showing solid growth.","In summary, our second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.16 higher than last year with a strong 4.8% revenue yield improvement worth $0.22 being partially offset by 3.6% higher net cruise costs, excluding fuel, costing $0.10, which was driven by more dry-dock days during the quarter, which we previously highlighted.","Now turning to 2018 booking trends. Booking volumes for the remaining two quarters of 2018 have been running ahead of last year at prices that are in line with the prior year. At this point in time, cumulative bookings for the remaining two quarters of 2018 are slightly ahead of the prior year at higher prices.","Now let's drill down into the cumulative booked position. First, for our NAA brand. The Caribbean is behind the prior year on occupancy at lower prices. Given the negative news flow from Puerto Rico, the hurricane impact continues to affect the Southern Caribbean itinerary.","As a result, the lower prices are driven principally by San Juan itinerary. This is consistent with the comments we made on our previous earnings call and the expectations we built into our guidance.","The seasonal European program is ahead of the prior year on occupancy at significantly higher prices. Alaska is in line with the prior year on occupancy at lower prices.","However, as I indicated on the last two conference calls, Alaska yields are impacted by mix. In the end, we expect that like-for-like itineraries in Alaska will have higher yields than last year's record levels.","Second, for our EA brands. For their European itineraries, occupancy is slightly ahead at higher prices. While it is early, and I caution you not to read too much into the numbers, I will provide our 2019 booked position. At this point in time, cumulative bookings are slightly ahead of the prior year at higher prices.","Finally, I want to provide you with some color on our 2018 June guidance. As Arnold said, while our full year guidance is now in the range of $4.15 to $4.25, we continue to have strong operational performance. The change in our guidance was driven by three things compared to our March guidance.","First, we flowed through the $0.07 of operational benefit from higher revenues in the second quarter. Second, we benefit from $0.02 of accretion relating to the shares we purchased in the second quarter that Arnold mentioned.","And third, higher fuel prices, net of fuel derivatives and the stronger dollar, is expected to unfavorably impact the year by $0.19. Higher fuel prices, net of fuel derivative, cost $0.11 while currency was an unfavorable $0.08.","While I'm on the topic of fuel and currency impact, for those of you who are modeling 2019 using June guidance fuel price and FX rates, the impacts of higher fuel prices and the stronger dollar would unfavorably impact 2019 by $0.14. Remember, we have no fuel derivative for 2019, so this calculation includes the year-over-year benefit from realized fuel derivative losses in 2018.","And now I'll turn the call back over to Arnold.","Arnold Donald","Thank you, David. Operator, please open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Steve Wieczynski","Hey, good morning, guys.","Arnold Donald","Morning, Steve.","Steve Wieczynski","Good morning. So I guess, the -- I guess the question's when we look at your yield outlook now for 3% for the year, and given the stronger yield - the yield beat that you had in the second quarter. I guess, your stock's up, you're selling out there, and I guess, the implied expectations for your yield in the back half of the year are probably a little bit lower, I think, than kind of where the typical investor's thoughts were.","So can you maybe help us think about the back half of the year in terms of, are there any markets out there where you guys are taking a little bit more of a conservative view at this point?","Arnold Donald","Well, let me open on that. Dave, add some color to it. First of all, we're very confident about the business going into the second half of the year. We're coming off a really fantastic last year. The back half comparisons obviously are tougher but we have confidence. The adjustment in our guidance, as we said on the call, as David pointed out, was strictly related to fuel and currency. And because we always factor in -- we got hurricane season coming, things can go wrong.","We think it's prudent to give the guidance we have for the back half, but we didn't modify our perception of the back half of the year. David, you want to make some comments?","David Bernstein","Sure, yes. As Arnold said, I mean, the back half yield expectation is the same as it was last quarter. I think what we saw was, if you're looking at the first half versus the back half, is keep in mind that there was some particularly strong markets, particularly in the second quarter, that more than offset what we had indicated was down yields in the Caribbean.","So it's really the extraordinary strength in the first half of the year in some of the other markets that drove it. But we are seeing, as Arnold said, great booking volumes and excellent business trends. And so overall, we feel very comfortable.","Steve Wieczynski","So if I heard you guys right, I guess when we look at the way you're kind of viewing the Caribbean here in - about the late 3Q and 4Q, it sounds like you are taking a pretty conservative view there. Is that the right way to think about it?","I mean, are you guys expecting that - your typical consumer to maybe book a little bit closer in this year just because of the fear around potential hurricanes?","Arnold Donald","First of all, booking curves are strong. Again, we had a great year last year, and we're doing even better in terms of occupancy and with significant capacity increases, so on and so forth. So booking's strong.","Having said that, there's no question that we got impacted originally by missing a booking period during the hurricane season. And now for portions of the Caribbean, and we keep referencing Puerto Rico and San Juan because it was so obvious there, there is a hurricane malaise.","But having said all that, the Caribbean is strong. We're talking about performing well against a very strong year last year and with significant additional growth.","David Bernstein","So building on what Arnold said, we are seeing, if you break the Caribbean into the three different segments, as we indicated, the down -- the pricing being behind the prior year was driven by the San Juan itineraries of the Southern Caribbean.","And I think last quarter, we had indicated that the Eastern Caribbean was also -- the cumulative booked position was down, and we have seen an improvement there, and now we're in line with the prior year, and the west continues to be up.","So we do expect to see an improving trend in the Caribbean. We - the second quarter was probably the biggest impact from the hurricane last year, and we expect to see an improving trend over time.","Steve Wieczynski","Okay, great. That\u2019s great color. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi. And thank you. I think that you really hit on a lot of the concerns in that last dialogue. Just wondering, can we just - the first two sentences of your 2018 outlook, where you talk about, at this time, cumulative advanced bookings for the next three quarters are in line with the year -- prior year's higher prices. And then you say since March, booking volumes for the next three quarters have been running slightly ahead of the prior year prices, that are in line with the prior year.","David, I know you went through this. But maybe perhaps for the people on the call who are aren't as familiar with your business and with the industry in general, can you just talk about that sentence [ph] since March and explain to us what that - what you're saying there?","David Bernstein","That since - that the booking volumes are slightly ahead in prices or in line.","Felicia Hendrix","Yes. So there - yes.","David Bernstein","So this is what was booked during the second quarter for cruises where we'll recognize revenue in the third, fourth and first quarter. So we're not including - when we say for the third and fourth and first quarter, we're not including the bookings that were made in the second quarter for the second quarter. We're only looking at the future periods because what's in the quarter for the second quarter is history, and that's in our actual results. So we're trying to give you a dynamic of what the future looks like.","Now if you break that apart, what you'll - the Caribbean impacted that booking volume. Because as I said, we are seeing overall, we - as I said, in the second quarter. And it is an improving trend in the Caribbean, but all the major markets were up. But the Caribbean is - was impacted, and that's why prices were in line.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. So - and again, I don't want to beat a dead horse. But like you said, the Caribbean is improving. And you kind of went through all the other itineraries, and there's no change in your kind of operational or yield outlook since you reported the last quarter?","David Bernstein","Correct.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. And when you talk about...","David Bernstein","Other than fuel and currency, so I wouldn't say...","Felicia Hendrix","Yeah, other than fuel and currency, which I always consider to be kind of exogenous. And when you talk about - just you gave us some color for 2019 fuel and FX. What fuel price are you using?","David Bernstein","So we use $75 for fuel. It has bounced around, but at some point late last week, we cut off at that price.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. And then - and just getting back to that March sentence as well, I think that some of the language that you used to have in your press release was like for all future periods. And now you're talking about the next three quarters. Is there any reason behind that?","David Bernstein","No. Generally, we actually have for the next 3 quarters in the press release. That has traditionally been what we've done. In the first quarter of this year, we saw our wave season -- because there was a lot of bookings for 2019 during wave season, we just chose to give you a broader picture. But if you look back, you'll see it's traditionally been three quarters.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. And final for me, throughout this conference call, you've been - throughout your answers to the last - my question and for Steve's, which I thought were pretty clear, your stock keeps going down. So Arnold or David, is there anything you'd like to say?","Arnold Donald","I think look, the reality of our business, I kind of say on the call, is we have large addressable markets around the world. They're all under penetrated. We have highly differentiated product offerings. I know people are concerned about capacity and so on. But overall, the industry is actually capacity constrained.","So when we build a ship for AIDA, and one for P&O in the UK, and one for Carnival and one for Seabourn, they don't even compete with each other, okay. What happens with the German source market versus the British source market, et cetera, versus the ultra luxury market, those things don't even overlap.","There are positive trends in population growth and in travel in general. And whether it's millennials or - who over-index in cruise, or whether it's retirees, the retirees are going increase dramatically here in North America, but elsewhere as well. That's people with time on their hands and with some assets. And we're very affordable, from mass contemporary brands to those who have more assets, to ultra-luxury brands. And people have time, and we're better vacation value than land-based vacation.","So we have a lot of fundamental things going. We don't have a problem right now in terms of looking ahead with booking curves or yields or any of that. So we know they're concerned about capacity. There's actually not even an empirical evidence to show a correlation between capacity and yield., that doesn't exist.","And more importantly, we're here to grow earnings and further improve our return on invested capital. And that's exactly what we've been doing and is what we're going to do. There've always been pocketed markets in any given year, where appears there's a capacity problem. Usually, that's complicated by something else like hurricane malaise or other things. But that exist, has always existed every year in the business. But our assets are mobile, and so we can move. And for us, we intend to create the demand for our capacity. And if we don't, we'll moderate our supply.","So that's all I have to say. I think the business is super strong. We just had a record quarter. We look ahead. Things look very good. There's little dynamics in one market or another. Last year, people were very concerned about China and so on. We had a bit of a mess in China and a bad hurricane season, and we still performed well.","This year, our guidance is to grow earnings double-digit and to achieve the long standing promise we made about return on investing capital getting to double-digit. That's going to happen. And we have multiple pathways to keep that going in the future. So that's what I have to say. Okay, next question.","Beth Roberts","I would just add something on the hurricane - on the booking patterns. When you look at the booking patterns, please keep in mind the context that booking patterns today are post-hurricane. And we're comparing to very strong pre-hurricane booking patterns.","And also, keep in mind that a lot of the beginning part of this year was booked -- were booked at the time the hurricanes occurred. So really seeing that impact more later in this year, as David said, starting with the second quarter.","Felicia Hendrix","Thank you.","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead.","Robin Farley","Hi. I have two questions, and I just want to make sure I understand the kind of subtlety of what you're saying. David, you mentioned the - a sort of a difference in bookings that came in during the second quarter for the second half versus kind of everything booked for the second half, including prior to the second quarter.","And I think what you said was the second - during Q2, bookings are ahead of last year at prices in line. But cumulatively, they're slightly -- you're slightly ahead at higher prices.","So does that mean that prices in the second half of the year have decelerated during Q2? And I - and perhaps, the premise of my question is wrong. I might have misheard. But that's what I wanted to clarify.","David Bernstein","Yes. No, you repeated what I said, which is essentially correct. But you have to keep in mind that when you're looking at the very - you have to look at - if you break it apart market by market, so the fact that prices were in line, the booking volume was in line during the second quarter. As I indicated, throughout the other major markets, except the Caribbean, the prices were up, and the in-line was impacted by the Caribbean.","So as Arnold was indicating before, and as Beth said, we have not lapped the Caribbean, the hurricane last year. The booking situation won't lap the Caribbean from a booking perspective until we get to September and October, which is during our fourth quarter.","So we're just seeing the impact of the hurricane affecting our bookings. But we're in great shape as far as booking volumes are concerned. We're being patient on the Caribbean and managing to the highest yield. Does that answer your question?","Robin Farley","I think so. I think some of the - I guess, biggest point is the idea that you're comparing pre-hurricane to post-hurricane, so that the year-over-year is not. But then, I guess, maybe also if I could ask about your guidance commentary versus a quarter ago. Because there is - the outlook a quarter ago, we had that same sort of post- and pre-hurricane issue.","You said price is in line for the next three quarters. And in March, the commentary was price is ahead for all future periods. And I know you mentioned sort of the subtlety, but you thought you'd just give a wider view on the - because there were some 2019 in wave.","But is there anything else with the comparability that would make the pricing today -- or the pricing guidance that you're saying now be in line, and a quarter ago, it was ahead if we were comparing the same periods like next three quarters versus next 3 quarters or all future periods versus all future periods to three months ago? I'm just trying to think about apples-to-apples, what's happened to price on a year-over-year basis?","David Bernstein","Yes. The comment on the three quarters would be similar if we included all future years. There isn't a significant difference overall because the majority of the bookings coming in - that the majority of the bookings coming in are for the next three quarters.","And the - remember that the second quarter rolled off. And we did have, as you saw, the 4.8% ticket yield in the second quarter. So that was a very strong period that we saw bookings in the first quarter for the second quarter. And that was in our March commentary.","Robin Farley","Okay, then that makes sense. The Q2, where obviously the strong upsides from Q2 rolling off. That makes sense. And then maybe just last sort of clarification. It seems like your close-in bookings are very strong in Q2. Or possibly, that you were just very conservative going into Q2. But either way, the close-in seemed to be very strong.","Is there - should we - is there anything we should be thinking about with mix of itineraries or things that was not - where the close-in would not be maybe as good in the second half? I mean, Caribbean's actually sort of lower weighting in Q3, I guess, a little more in Q4. But just thinking about second half cumulatively, that it was you've beaten your close-in guidance very nicely the last few quarters.","And so obviously, being conservative is all good as well. But just is there anything we should be keeping - is there anything - any reason why close-in wouldn't continue to maybe have more upside than what you see further in advance?","David Bernstein","Yes. We try to give you our best guess each quarter in terms of the guidance, and we include an expectation for close-in bookings. As Arnold indicated, we also - we got a hurricane season coming, and so we build in an expectation. It's very difficult. There's always something, and so we build that into our guidance as well.","Depending on how things go, the one thing I will say about forecast is we're always wrong. We just never know by how much and in which direction. We give you our best guess.","Robin Farley","Okay. And again, it's - I think that that's appreciated that you're conservative with the guidance. And I guess, I just wanted to stress test it to see if there's anything else other than your conservative approach. That's very helpful.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Jaime Katz","Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So in our model, it looks like expenses in the fourth quarter trail off a little bit. And I'm curious if there are any timing things that we should be thinking of that are maybe being pushed into 2019.","And then on the heels of that, how do we think about long-term cost growth in this business? I know historically, you guys have said maybe flattish to half of inflation. But has that changed at all? Thanks.","David Bernstein","Sure. So we did talk about the quarterly season - seasonalization cost on previous calls. The seasonalization this year has to do with the timing of dry docks. And I mentioned that costs were up in the second quarter, and that had to do with the large number of dry-dock days. Well, the fourth quarter is the exact opposite.","So with the lower dry-dock days, you will see a reduction in net cruise cost per ALBD, excluding fuel, in the fourth quarter, and we mentioned that on previous calls. So it's not a - some sort of delay of expenses. Our cost guidance for the year has not changed since December. We're still estimating up approximately 1%.","As far as the future is concerned, we have been leveraging our scale on the sourcing side, and we - Arnold mentioned that we're on track for $80 million of cost savings. This year, we see opportunity to do similar things in the next couple of years, so there's a lot of opportunity there.","And also in 2019, on a - right now, our capacity increase is 5.6%. So we will have the opportunity to leverage our scale there as well, both with larger ships that we're bringing in, on the ship's expenses as well as shore side. So there are good opportunities for us to keep costs under control. But it is premature for us to give some specific guidance as to costs for 2019.","Jaime Katz","Understood. And then on a housekeeping note, you had touched on the Alaska tourist business in the prepared commentary. And I'm curious what the scale of that business is, if it's meaningful. Obviously, some part of that's going to be consolidated in the income statement.","So I just - I don't have a good sense for what the size of that business is. If you could help us think about that, that would be great.","David Bernstein","Okay. So the - I mean, the business that we purchased, it's a -- it isn't going to be consolidated because we're taking a minority interest, 45%, and our partner will have 55%. The deal will close hopefully sometime this summer, and so it will have a positive impact in the long run on our net income.","However, for 2018, the impact will be very minor because we'll be well through most of the season before we take ownership. So I don't expect it to have much of an impact on our 2018 numbers.","Jaime Katz","Okay. And that'll flow through other income as a solid number, right?","David Bernstein","Yes.","Jaime Katz","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.","Harry Curtis","Thanks very much. And good morning. Going back to David's comment about building in an expectation for hurricanes. David, can you comment on to what degree your guidance factors that in for the third quarter?","David Bernstein","You know, Harry, it's - we take an educated guess based off all the things we've seen over time. I hate to try to give a specific number at this point because it's - we know things are going to happen, and we try to factor it in for both third and fourth quarter.","Arnold Donald","We don't necessarily do hurricane-specific. There are things that happen every year around the world. And markets get taken away from us, high-yielding itineraries for geopolitical reasons. There's disease scares. I mean, all these different things happen.","And so we put - look at historical stuff that's happened and level of impact, and we come up with a general rule of thumb, and then we put judgment on it based on the climate at the time - so the global climate. And that's how we do it. But it's just a matter of trying to be practical because realistically, every year, something happens and usually more than one thing.","Harry Curtis","And then as a follow-up to the projections for 2019, given that 2018 is being impacted by the Caribbean negatively, can you give us a sense of whether or not your - the pricing so far that you're seeing in the Caribbean for next year is encouraging?","Arnold Donald","Can I say one thing? When you say negatively, I just want to emphasize to everyone, we're growing in the Caribbean, okay. We're generating more earnings in the Caribbean, and we're growing generally more earnings everywhere else in the world, too.","So on a relative growth basis, yes, the Caribbean might be weaker on yield than some other markets. But overall, we're growing earnings, and there's no weakness in the business. But go ahead, David.","David Bernstein","Yeah. So if you look at the first quarter, which is probably the most meaningful because after that, it's -- not that much are on the books. The occupancy is in line in the Caribbean, and pricing is slightly ahead. So again, just like I said before, we are continuing to see an improving trend in the Caribbean.","Arnold Donald","We may be a victim of our own conservatism. But the reality is that it's not conservatism. It's for us, it's just trying to be practical. But just to reinforce, all that's happened with our guidance is we offset a lot of the fuel and currency. But we aren't -- we haven't put in the guidings completely offsetting all of what the current fuel and currency is. And that, of course, can change.","Harry Curtis","Very good. And then just a quick -- one quick one. Can you talk about your performance recently and looking into the second half by brand? Are you seeing any brands generating more pricing versus less pricing? And if so, does that give you any indication as to customer health, the health of their wallet by segment?","Arnold Donald","I would say always, certain brands in any given year, one brand may have significant increase relative to others. And so that's just the common practice when you have a portfolio of brands. Is there some systemic, long-term, underlying trend in terms of appetite by source market for the brands?","No, we don't see any intrinsic patterns that would suggest certain brands are going to be much stronger for the next five to seven years versus some others. But sure, in any given year, one brand has a big increase relative to other brands. And as a portfolio, that happens.","Harry Curtis","Thanks everyone.","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Jared Shojaian","Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. So I wanted to ask about the 2019 booked position. I think you said slightly ahead at higher prices. And I think last quarter, you said ahead at higher prices. So can you just elaborate on that? Has the 2019 booked position changed at all since last quarter?","David Bernstein","So last quarter, I hadn't gone through the detail of 2019 at all. It was -- so I'm not sure what you previously are referring to. But remember, I also have mentioned, sometimes, when you're talking about the difference between ahead and slightly ahead, you're talking about decimal points here. There is a point where we have to -- where we change our adjectives. So try not -- I mean, I wouldn't read too much into that.","Jared Shojaian","Okay, got it. And then I'll ask another question about your stock. I'll ask this a little differently. If I look at your leverage today, you're at a low point historically at 1.7 times net debt-to-EBITDA. So if you guys really aren't concerned about the supply growth that's coming online, and you think the market has it wrong on your stock, what prevents you from getting more aggressive on the buyback right now? And is there a leverage level that you'd be willing to go to in order to get more aggressive on the buyback in the near term?","Arnold Donald","Two quick comments. One is, we obviously have a strong credit rating. We don't feel the need to have it be even stronger. We can go up to 2.5 pretty comfortably, we feel, from a leverage standpoint. As you say, we have 1.8, 1.9 now.","So from that vantage point, and of course, in a situation like this, I'm not going to make any comments other than to say our strategy on stock buyback is optimistically return cash to shareholders through stock buyback.","David Bernstein","And then actually, we did buy more stock in the second quarter than we did buy in the first quarter, again being opportunistic. And so as you point out, we actually, just so you understand, we look at the leverage going forward and do look at where we expect to be at the end of the year.","We're not 1.7 at the end of the year. We're more like 1.9. And so as Arnold indicated, we do have an opportunity there to continue to borrow and to use those funds to buy back shares throughout the remainder of the year. And as I'll mention, we don't include those share buybacks in our guidance. Traditionally, we've just done share buybacks to date.","Jared Shojaian","Okay, that's helpful. And just to confirm, you'd be willing to go up to as high as 2.5 times, I guess, by the end of the year the way you look at it?","Arnold Donald","No, I wouldn't say that. That's the range within we can operate and maintain a strong credit rating. But we don't have a plan or anything. I don't want to -- you to misinterpret we'll go to 2.5.","David Bernstein","Yes. We've talked. In many cases, what we said previously is that we're looking broadly at a range of 2 to 2.5. And in good times, we would be at the better end of the range. And we'd allow the leverage to increase at other times. So that's obviously something that we'll have conversations on and will take a look at as a management team going forward.","Jared Shojaian","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Stephen Grambling","Hi. Thanks for taking for question. I guess, changing gears a little bit to fuel. Can -- I guess, when we look at the relationship between Brent and your fuel prices, there's been a bit of a shift and certainly more volatility. I guess, what are you expecting in that relationship between Brent as you talked about that $75, given the forward curve, as in backwardation, there's even a wider gap in Brent and fuel oil as we look further out? And maybe as part of that, just remind us of your thought process on hedging.","Arnold Donald","I'll do the hedging. We never hedge. We've done the collars. We did them before to protect against spikes in fuel prices that could compromise us in the capital markets when we have commitments for capital. We didn't want to have to go into the capital markets not knowing what the capital markets would be at the time. And so we did collars to protect ourselves in that regard. Since then, things are a lot different obviously.","Our ratio's much better. We have a lot more cash than we have been. So we're in a much better position to weather any type of fuel spike or whatever. And so fundamentally, we've never believed in hedges. The board hasn't. The management hasn't.","And so we continually look at that situation. Because number one, we want to maintain our freedom to operate and make sure we're doing it in an advantageous way for the shareholders. But we never try to play the fuel game, because even oil companies don't know where fuel prices are going. So that's not the business we're in.","David Bernstein","So Steve, when we do our guidance, I think we've said this many times before. We basically take the spot price of fuel today as we see it, and we use that price going forward through the balance of the year and in any forecast. We're not trying to make a projection for the fuel price, as Arnold said. We don't know where it's going, but we try to just use the current existing fuel price.","Stephen Grambling","And I guess, just two related follow-ups. One, given some of the airlines have started to implement changes to their fuel surcharges, what are your thoughts on potentially implementing something like that? And then I guess, just to be clear, as we look out to 2020, there's a pretty wide gap in the Brent versus heavy fuel curves. So is there any reason why you wouldn't be able to purchase the lower-cost fuel amidst the IMO implementation?","Arnold Donald","Got it. First of all, in terms of forward purchasing of Brent, we -- again, we try not to play the fuel game for obvious reasons. And the variability there is crazy. You just never know where you're going to be. So we tend not to do that. And then first part of your question, what's it again?","David Bernstein","The fuel surcharge.","Arnold Donald","Oh, the fuel surcharge, yes. So yes, in the past, we've implemented fuel surcharge when there was a rapid spike in fuel prices, et cetera. That's always something that we could take a look at. So far, we have not done that and considered doing that. And at this point right now, I don't think we would. But if prices were to continue to spike, obviously, that's something we have to look at.","Stephen Grambling","Thanks. I\u2019ll get back in queue.","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Tim Conder","Thank you. A couple of questions here. One, related to Alaska, and David or Arnold, whoever wants to take this. You've commented a couple of times in the last couple of calls regarding the mix in Alaska. And just to clarify that, the mix that's somewhat restraining your yield growth there this year is, one, a limited capacity on the shore excursion side, correct? You still have very strong demand, but your...","Arnold Donald","Correct.","Tim Conder","Okay, okay. And the recent transaction...","David Bernstein","Purely the tour business.","Arnold Donald","Tour business.","David Bernstein","Yes\u2026","Tim Conder","Okay. And do you see -- how do you see addressing that here? Will the recent transaction make -- help address that going forward? Or is there other things you need to do?","Arnold Donald","No, the recent transaction would not, because it really is a hotel base because we have properties there. And so it's just -- it's purely just a mix issue. So Alaska's doing great. Earnings are growing. The capacity's there. We're making really good money. It's a very popular destination. It's just that we don't have more hotel rooms.","And so some of the bookings have that with them and then others don't. And the ones that don't are at a lower price. And as that volume increases, it makes it look like a yield impact. But it's not a yield on cruise or anything.","David Bernstein","Yes. And Tim, as you can imagine, we plan our itineraries to optimize revenue for the company. So while within the context of just Alaska, it's a mix issue that we commented on. But we believe that the way we plan the itineraries, with the incremental Inside Passage to Alaska, will have a positive impact on the overall company's yields. So it's not flowing through negatively to the company. It's just a mix within Alaska.","Tim Conder","Okay. And then again, it's been talked a lot about here on this call, but within the Caribbean, you cited Puerto Rico last call; this call, also the San Juan in particular. Is there something in your Eastern Caribbean itinerary mix relative to the industry that's maybe giving you a little bit more difficulty than the broader industry in the Eastern Caribbean?","Arnold Donald","We homeport in San Juan, and so that's one thing that's different. I'm not sure that we're that different than the industry. I think you'd have to talk to the other. I guess, Norwegian changed their itineraries or something and went to a different part of Caribbean for the year. But frankly, we don't see it as anything particularly unique, but we do homeport.","David Bernstein","But Tim, we talked -- as I mentioned before, I said the Eastern Caribbean, we had been behind on price. And now we were in line on price. So we are seeing an improving trend on the Eastern Caribbean from what we saw last quarter. And it's the San Juan itineraries, mostly the Southern Caribbean, that were impacted to a great degree, as Arnold said, because we homeport there. And San Juan was a source market for us in those itineraries as well.","Tim Conder","Okay. And then lastly, China. Just any specific color there, what you've seen over the last 90 days? Are there -- in the year, appeared to be, Q1 was pretty good for you guys even though you really did not have the easy comparisons yet. And then Q2 onward appeared to have easier comparisons. So just any update there. And for the industry as a whole, including yourselves, obviously, it would appear that there's really pretty low risk on anything related to sanction going on with the tariffs and so forth also.","Arnold Donald","Yes. My usual contextualization of China, a small part of our capacity, embryonic market, basically still a B2B market, et cetera. It's all those qualifiers. And the bottom line is things are stronger for sure than they were last year at this time. And so it looks positive for the year on a relative basis so far. But China's China, and we have to see how things play out for the full year.","But right now, conditionally, things definitely look stronger. In terms of sanctions, we haven't heard of any sanctions on either side that would directly impact the cruise industry. Obviously, there's still -- the Chinese are still not going to Korea at this point in time. If that changes, that could open up the possibility on some itinerary planning and maybe help the situation there even more.","But in terms of additional sanctions or new sanctions, given what's going on, we've heard nothing. I just happened to be in China last week and had the opportunity to participate in some high government-level stuff. And nothing was talked about in those.","Tim Conder","Great. Gentlemen, thank you for the color.","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Assia Georgieva with Infinity. Please go ahead.","Assia Georgieva","Good morning, guys. This is Assia. If I am to summarize, basically, the Caribbean outlook for the next -- for Q4 and Q1 specifically, at this time last year, we had very strong close-in demand. And because of the hurricanes in September, we're not seeing quite as much of that. So because we are in a deferred comp mode as opposed to specifically, a slowdown in terms of bookings for Q4 and Q1, it seems to me that things are starting to normalize quite a bit. And we saw pretty much most of the impact during Q1 and Q2 of this year, and we're starting to get normal. Is that a fair read?","David Bernstein","I think I would rather say that we saw most of the impact from the hurricane in Q2 and Q3 as opposed to Q1 and Q2. Because by the time the hurricane came last September, we were very well booked for Q4 and Q1. So it was really Q2 where you started seeing it. And then it gets better over time.","Assia Georgieva","And as we enter Q4, basically, early September when we saw the hurricanes last year, isn't it fair to assume that bookings, barring another active hurricane season, that the comparisons will ease significantly? So at this point, we're looking at timing year-on-year as opposed to necessarily poor trends for the Q4, Q1 period.","David Bernstein","There's no doubt we'll have easier comparisons, as I mentioned before, in the fourth quarter when we lap the hurricane.","Assia Georgieva","And we just haven't gotten there yet. We need to wait 3 months before we get there.","David Bernstein","Correct, which is why I was indicating that's baked into the current booking volumes. All the other markets were higher.","Assia Georgieva","Great. Thank you, David. I appreciate that.","Operator","So our next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citi. Please go ahead.","Greg Badishkanian","Great. Thanks. And just in terms of Europe, I know that's been strong for you. The -- to the differences that you're seeing in the consumer of the North American going to Europe versus the European sourced. And just how sustainable you think that the strength in that market will be?","David Bernstein","So overall, keep in mind, Greg, that 90% of the guests on our ships in Europe are Europeans. And that has to do with the fact that we have all of our European brands. And so overall, I mean, Europe for us has been a very strong market.","I did comment in the second quarter, both for our NAA and our EA brands, that we saw really good yield increases that drove the yield. And when I talked about the booking commentary, I talked about, for the seasonal European program, we were ahead at significantly higher prices for the NAA brands.","And for Europe, I had said that occupancy was slightly ahead at higher prices. So we are seeing it's a great market for us and things continue to move forward. And I won't repeat all the comments that Arnold made about the overall market for the sake of time. But we believe this will continue to be an excellent market for us.","Greg Badishkanian","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Patrick Scholes","Real quick question here. You noted that the booking curve continued to be strong. Would you say that has gotten, since you last reported earnings, would you say that booking curve has gotten stronger, stayed the same, strong or gotten slightly less stronger? I'd just like some -- since last time.","Arnold Donald","It was very strong, and it remains very strong.","Patrick Scholes","Okay. So, all right. I'll leave it at that. Thank you.","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research Company. Please go ahead.","Vince Ciepiel","Thanks. I wanted to come back to China. You recently introduced the Princess Majestic [ph]. You have the Costa Venezia arriving in that market next year. Curious your thinking on sending kind of new premium purpose-built hardware to that market, the returns you're seeing there, and if it makes sense to continue to send new capacity into that market.","And then secondarily, can you just give us an update on how the distribution system with the charters has been evolving? And do you think it's making progress? And is there maybe a time line for the progress you'd like to see it make?","Arnold Donald","Excellent. Okay. Yes, so first of all, again, we believe eventually, China is going to be our largest cruise market in the world. So right now, we're teeny tiny, and it's embryonic. So absolutely it makes sense putting hardware there and new hardware. So Shanngsh\u00c3 Gong Zhu Hao [ph], which is Majestic Princess there, is ideally suited for Chinese. It's home port some of the year in China. The rest of the time, it's sailing elsewhere in Asia, but filled with lots of Chinese cruise goers.","The Costa Venezia, as you mentioned, will be introduced in 2019 in China. The Costa brand, has several ships homeported there. It will be a great addition to their fleet. It's purpose-built again for the Chinese cruise goer. The market there is very large in terms of overall travel, both from cities in China and, of course, as a huge potential source market for fly\/cruise all over the world.","And so we will continue to have a presence. And as I mentioned, I was just over there recently. We definitely are excited about our joint venture with CSSC and moving that forward and establishing a brand in China. That's a partnership with [Stanley Enterprises] there to drive cruise, as they've mandated in their 5-year plan. So all of that stuff's very positive.","In terms of the distribution system itself, yes, we've moved from full-ship charters primarily now to group sales and partial ship charters, et cetera. We've added a large number of additional distributors. All of that kind of de-risks things a bit from being overly concentrated and what, in effect, today is still pretty much a B2B market. The direct sales component is slowly growing a bit there. There's opportunity to grow that over time. But a time line in China, we'll see. It's a small market.","I don't see today, for us and for the industry, I don't see a dramatic increase in percent of total capacity in the short term there. And the reason is not so much because of China, but because of the demand everywhere else in the world. And then as I mentioned, there's large addressable markets everywhere in the world that are under penetrated, including the United States.","And so the ships are needed to continue to grow and serve the market demand that we've been creating over the past several years. But China, long term, is going to have a cruise market. But it's China. There'll be starts and stops and fits and turns and so on. And it's the nature of the animal, but our assets are mobile. And as long as it's accretive, we'll participate. And when it's not, we'll move the ships elsewhere. Thank you for your question.","Arnold Donald","Thank you, everyone. We really appreciate your participation on the call. We always do our best to give you the best guidance that we can. And I just want to leave you with the thought that our business is strong. The guidance we've given is reflecting some changes in fuel and currency. But beyond that, the business is strong. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call.

Welcome to the Carnival Corporation Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, September 24, 2013.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Frank, Vice Chairman and COO. Please go ahead, sir.","Howard S. Frank","Thank you, Len. And good morning, everyone. This is Howard Frank. And with me today is Arnold Donald, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Micky Arison, our Chairman; and David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Roberts, our Vice President of Investor Relations. We are all gathered in London, actually, for the -- today, we announce the naming of a new P&O ship, the Britannia. And there was a tremendous amount of press there and we got some great coverage. So that was a quite a nice morning for us. And later on this week, we start our business reviews, starting with the P&O brand and Cunard in the U.K.","So we'll follow the usual procedures, and David Bernstein will give you some color on the third quarter. David?","David Bernstein","Thank you, Howard.","Before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this conference call will be forward-looking. I will refer you to the cautionary statements in today's press release. Also, all of my references to revenue and cost metrics will be in local currencies, unless otherwise noted, as this is the more useful measure of business trends.","Our non-GAAP EPS for the third quarter was $1.38. The third quarter came in $0.09 above the midpoint of our June guidance, driven by lower net cruise costs, excluding fuel. I will speak to the full year cost later, but in summary, we expect $0.05 of the $0.09 to flow through favorably as cost savings for the year; the remaining $0.04, from the timing of expenses between the third and fourth quarter, primarily for advertising, as a number of brands decided to delay some of their advertising spend from the summer months to the fall season.","Our GAAP EPS for the third quarter was $1.20, which is $0.18 below our non-GAAP EPS. The GAAP EPS included $203 million or $0.26 per share of impairment charges, partially offset by $64 million or $0.08 per share of unrealized gains for our fuel derivatives program as the price of Brent increased this quarter. The impairment charges included $176 million related to 2 smaller Costa ships, 1 of which will leave service this November; as well as $27 million for Ibero's remaining trademarks and other small items.","In the earnings release, you will notice that we have further refined our definition of non-GAAP earnings. Non-GAAP earnings now excludes gains and losses on ship sales and related impairments, which are classified in other ship operating expenses on our P&L. In connection with this change, net cruise cost, which is also a non-GAAP measure, will exclude these cruise-related items as well. The excluded items are clearly identified in the non-GAAP financial measure reconciliations of net cruise costs, net income and EPS located towards the back of the earnings release. It should be noted that all of the excluded items are noncash.","In addition, you will see that prior-period actuals and previous guidance for non-GAAP measures have been changed to be consistent with the new definition. For example, 2012 non-GAAP EPS for the 9 months ended August 31 increased to $1.80 from $1.75. We believe it is the more meaningful -- it's more meaningful for these items to be excluded from our non-GAAP measures since gains and losses on ship sales, as well as any impairment charges, are not part of our core operating business and therefore are not an indication of our future performance.","Now let's look at the third quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 3.4%. The North America brands were up 4%. The European, Australia and Asian brands, known as our EAA brands, were up 2.5%. Our total net revenue yields in the third quarter declined almost 4%, in line with our June guidance.","Now let's look at the 2 components of net revenue yields. Net ticket yields declined 4.6%. The North American brands were down 5.4%, primarily driven by promotional discounting at Carnival Cruise Line. Our EAA brands were down 3%, driven by declines in our Northern European brands, partially offset by increases at Costa and P&O Cruises Australia, a pattern similar to last quarter. Net onboard and other yields decreased slightly just under 1%, a trend we had anticipated in our previous guidance. Our EAA brands experienced a slight increase, which was more than offset by declines in the North American brands across most onboard categories.","Net cruise costs for the quarter per ALBD, excluding fuel and now excluding the impairments under our new definition, were up 4.6% versus the prior year. This increase was better than we expected in our June guidance, as I previously mentioned. As a result of our ongoing efforts to reduce fuel usage, our consumption per ALBD declined 5% this quarter and saved us $0.04 per share versus the prior year.","In summary, the third quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.15 lower than the prior year, driven by lower net revenue yields and higher cruise costs, without fuel, partially offset by capacity increases, improved fuel consumptions and currency.","Now turning to our 2013 outlook. I will skip net revenue yields, as Howard will discuss that shortly. For the full year, net cruise costs, excluding fuel per ALBD, are forecasted to be up 4% versus the prior year. This is at the lower end of our previous guidance range as a result of the cost savings experienced in the third quarter that I expect to flow through to the full year.","On a final note, I wanted to share with you preliminary cost guidance for next year, as there are several areas in the business we plan to invest in to improve our return on invested capital. For 2014, we expect net cruise costs, excluding fuel per ALBD, to be up in a range similar to 2013. This increase is driven by more marketing activity; investments in onboard products such as food and entertainment; higher dry-dock costs, including vessel enhancements; and various other costs and inflation, partially offset by our ongoing efforts to reduce costs. Please keep in mind that this is very preliminary. Over the next few weeks, we will be visiting each of the operating companies to review their 2014 annual plans and we'll have a much clearer picture on 2014 costs after those meetings, and we will provide detailed guidance on the December call.","At this point, I will turn the call back over to Howard.","Howard S. Frank","Thank you, David.","As in our last call, I will comment separately about the continuing progress we've made at Carnival Cruise Lines and Costa Cruises. But first, let me bring you up-to-date on the last 12 weeks of bookings since the end of March. In this discussion, I've taken Carnival Cruise Lines booking information out of the mix, which I will comment on separately. As a reminder, all of the pricing information I will be discussing is using constant currency.","Fleet-wide booking volume during the last 12 weeks from the end of June, covering the sale and build of the next 3 quarters, are at the same levels -- about the same levels as last year. These bookings have been at higher prices versus last year, and as I said, this excludes Carnival. For North American brands, booking volumes during this 12-week period are higher year-over-year at lower prices. And for EAA brands, booking volumes are lower at nicely higher prices. We see the EAA booking pattern as an encouraging sign, especially given the continued softness in European economies. The last 6 weeks of the 12-week period, we've seen a nice uptick in booking volumes in North America and EAA, which is also an encouraging sign.","For Carnival Cruise Lines, booking volumes and pricing over the last 12 weeks are both lower year-over-year in low-single-digits and double -- and mid-double-digits range, respectively. Carnival booking volumes have also shown recent improvement and, during the last 6 weeks, are running higher year-over-year. As Carnival booking volumes steadily increase, we are expecting their cruise pricing to gradually improve over the longer term.","Now I'll move to the cumulative booking status for each of the fourth quarter of 2013 and the first and second quarters of 2014. For the fourth quarter of 2013, on a fleet-wide basis, and this excludes Carnival, cumulative occupancies are lower at the same pricing levels as last year. For North American brands, excluding Carnival again, occupancies are slightly lower at slightly lower prices. Carnival Cruise Lines occupancies for the fourth quarter are lower at lower prices.","For EAA brands, occupancies are lower year-over-year at slightly higher prices, reflecting the positive patterns we have experienced during the last 12 weeks. Costa brand occupancies and pricing for the fourth quarter are nicely higher.","As we indicated in the press release, on a fleet-wide basis, including Carnival Cruise Lines, we are expecting fleet-wide revenue yields in the fourth quarter to be 3% or 4% lower year-over-year. North American brand revenue yields in the fourth quarter, excluding Carnival, are expected to be down slightly. Carnival Cruise Lines yields in the fourth quarter are expected to be lower in the double-digits range, and fourth quarter EAA pricing revenue yields are expected to be higher year-over-year.","Turning now to the fourth -- to the first quarter of 2014. On a fleet-wide basis, pricing on bookings taken to date is higher year-over-year, with lower occupancies. For North American brands, excluding Carnival, pricing is higher on lower occupancies. Carnival Cruise Lines pricing is lower on lower occupancies. For EAA brands, pricing on bookings taken to date is flat year-over-year, at lower occupancies.","Second quarter of 2014 bookings taken to date, which is still in the early stages of development. On a fleet-wide basis, excluding Carnival, pricing is slightly higher year-over-year, at lower occupancies. North American brands pricing is slightly higher, at lower occupancies. At this stage, Carnival's pricing is also higher, at lower occupancies. For EAA brands, pricing is slightly higher, at lower occupancies.","As to the yield outlook for the first half of 2014, although pricing on bookings taken to date for the first half of 2014 is higher, because we are running behind on occupancies, we are expecting revenue yields will follow the usual pattern of coming down as we close out the first and second quarters. As a result, on a fleet-wide basis, for the first half of the year, we are estimating a low-single-digits decrease in revenue yields in a similar range to the lower yields we experienced in the third and fourth quarters of 2013. This expectation includes the Carnival Cruise Lines yields.","North American brand yields in the first half of 2014 are expected to be lower year-over-year, and EAA brand yields are expected to be higher. We are ramping up our -- in the efforts in both North America and Europe this fall and winter and are expecting that revenue yields will turn positive in the second half of the year.","Now let me just turn to the Carnival Cruise Lines. The Carnival Cruise Lines brand continues to demonstrate such resilient in the market, maintaining high occupancies albeit at lower prices. The perception and consideration survey to the Carnival brand continue to show improving trends at a faster pace than originally projected, so we are greatly encouraged by these positive signs. Yesterday, Carnival began its fall marketing with a new national and consumer advertising campaign on the back of the announcement of its new Carnival Great Vacation Guarantee program. This is one of the largest fourth quarter national marketing expense for Carnival in recent years and is designed to further accelerate the improvements we are seeing in brand perception and consideration. The increase in Carnival's consumer advertising is also expected to drive more consumers to our travel agent partners.","Also as a result of recent travel agent surveys and its travel agent outreach program Carnival Conversations, Carnival has made a number of changes and improvements to its travel agent programs. This includes adding more in-house traveled -- travel in-house call center agents, new bonus commission plans, providing complimentary cabins and a variety of other changes to make it easier for travel agents to book Carnival. Also a new and simplified cabin pricing plan, also to make it easier to book Carnival is expected to be announced shortly. The response to these changes by travel agents has been very positive and we have seen a significant improvement in travel agent bookings with the introduction of these programs. So we again thank the travel agent community for their continuing support of Carnival Cruise Lines during these past year. Carnival will continue to reach out to travel agents to ensure that we maintain a strong partnership with this critically important distribution channel.","Although Carnival Cruise Lines' pricing is lower than we would like, with the new national advertising campaign and the increase in marketing spend this fall and winter, we do expect to see a recovery of pricing as we cycle into the second half of 2014. Recently, Carnival got to the strategy of holding firm on pricing even if its ships sale at slightly lower occupancies. We believe this will make Carnival's pricing recovery more achievable as we move through 2014.","Now turning to Costa Cruises. As most of you know, the critical phase of the Costa Concordia removal was completed last week and the present plan is to take the ship to the scrapyard next spring. We believe this is a start of a new chapter for Costa, and we expect the company's performance to continue to strengthen over the remainder of this year and throughout 2014. Brand perception surveys for Costa continue to show improvement, particularly in Italy and France, its 2 most important markets.","Costa revenue yields show a nice improvement in 2013. And we are forecasting continued revenue yield increases in 2014 for Costa despite what is still a very challenging European economic environment, especially in [indiscernible]. So congratulations to Michael Thamm and the Costa management team for managing through a very, very difficult period.","Let me make some concluding comments by saying while 2013 has been a challenging year for Carnival Corporation, there were many positive developments for the company that bode well for our future. We continue to be encouraged by the growth of our business in Asia. Beginning in 2014, we will have 2 fully dedicated Costa ships in the China and Southeast Asian markets, and Princess will have 1 fully dedicated ship in these markets. Princess will also have 2 ships in the Japanese market during the 2014 spring and summer season in Japan. We believe these emerging new markets for Costa and Princess offer significant growth opportunities for our business in the future.","In Australia, our P&O Australia, Princess and Carnival brands are the 2 -- are the major year-round operators in Australia. P&O Australia is a market leader, and our combined brands are by far the leading cruise line companies in Australia.","We are also pleased to see the turnaround for Costa in Europe, and we expect to see solid revenue growth and improved profitability for Costa in 2014. Our well-established European cruise brands Costa and AIDA in Continental Europe; P&O Cruises and Cunard in the U.K., are great franchises, and we expect the performance of our European companies to improve as the European economies begin to emerge from several years of slow or negative growth. Our European cruise companies are the market leaders in their respective countries and have maintained their presence in these markets during the difficult economic period. We believe this will position them to grow their profits more quickly as these markets emerge from recession.","And coming back to the U.S. We do expect the Carnival Cruise Lines brand to begin to see a recovery in the second half of 2014 as we cycle through the events of 2013. Our 2 premium brands, Holland America and Princess, are all expected to have a solid performance in 2014. Our Seabourn brand, although small, is performing extremely well.","So to sum it all up, we have a great -- we have great cruise brands all over the world, and we are excited about our future.","And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Arnold. Arnold?","Arnold W. Donald","Thank you, Howard. And hello, everyone.","I have, I guess, nearly 3 months under my belt with the on-boarding process, so that process is well underway. We've just completed in-depth reviews with each of our leadership teams to look back over the past 5 years in each of our businesses and key corporate departments. I've also visited with our leadership teams in each of their own markets, including Australia; U.K.; Continental Europe; as well as our U.S.-based operations, both on the West Coast and, of course, in Miami. As well, I visited China to see our emerging market opportunity there first hand, and I can say I am very impressed with the commitment, the dedication and hard work that has been accomplished and can affirm that we have solid leadership talent in place. This process of on-boarding has also included spending some time with our travel agent partners to better understand how they see us relative to our peers and how we can support them in their very important role engaging with the media to provide proper context. And we're confident that -- when armed with more information and more personal experiences with cruising, that we can gain more balance in the press over time. I've been spending time with our shoreside and shipboard employees, gaining an understanding of the challenges our team members face in delivering that great guest experience. And importantly, our valued guests, I've spent time with, which has allowed me a practical feel for the guest experience to complement the quantitative data and market research to gain deeper insight.","Having gained these perspectives, I believe we have an opportunity to stimulate demand and drive yield improvements, starting with gaining a better understanding of the consumer by further investing in research to better identify vacation purchase decisions, sharpening the focus on product attributes consumers are willing to pay for, differentiating our brands to better attract our targeted guests and, once onboard, taking the exceptional vacation that we deliver to our guests today to the next level. And in doing so, we can generate the word of mouth that is most significant -- is the most significant driver of attracting first-time cruisers.","On the cost side, I believe we have tremendous opportunities to use our scale more effectively through collaboration across our brands, these add synergies, some of which we've already have achieved, but there's plenty more opportunities ahead. I cruise, myself. I have for years, even before I joined the board. I love the product and I have no doubt we will be able to generate better returns than we do today. I feel much better positioned now to be effective in our upcoming plan meetings beginning later this week and expect to be fully up to speed by December and begin to make some meaningful contributions toward any shareholder value.","Thank you, all. And with that, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix from Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Howard, starting with you, just if we could just talk about your -- the outlook for next year. You gave us good color for the first half, appreciate that, and also appreciate kind of your comments on the second half. What I'm wondering, where you said that the yields would turn positive. I'm just wondering if, overall, do you think you could report a 2014 yield increase that's better than flat year-over-year? And I know it's early, but I am asking.","Howard S. Frank","It's early. I feel that -- at some risk, I think we kind of gave first half yield outlook because it was going to be down. We do expect to see a turn in the third and fourth quarters to a positive yield, but I would hesitate to put any kind of numbers on it right now. I think we need to go through the next couple of months, go through the business plans, and we'll have a much better feel for it -- this is based on -- as David said at the start of his comments, it's based on very, very early information from the brands. So we need to refine it and get it better. But we wanted to get the guidance on the first half now at least from a yield standpoint because we were concerned that people didn't understand what was happening in the business.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","In the first half lower yields -- the first half yields which are going to be lower year-over-year, similar to the second half of '13, I mean, is that mainly just driven by still Carnival? Or is there anything else that's driving that?","Howard S. Frank","Well, it's definitely driven largely by Carnival, yes. I mean, I -- we expect positive yields on the EAA side. So the other 2 brands are solid, so we expect most of it to be a Carnival challenge, maybe a little bit. I can't recall exactly, but I think maybe a little bit on some of the other brand, but not much.","David Bernstein","I think one of the things, when you look at the first half of 2014 versus the back half of 2013, while we say as they're similar declines, they are made up a little bit different. Both Carnival and Costa are improving, but what you'll see happening is Costa is not improving as much as it did in the back half of '13, and therefore, you're kind of coming out at a similar amount. Although both Costa and Carnival are improving, Carnival is not down as much and Costa is not up as much as it was in the back half.","Arnold W. Donald","And actually, Carnival compared to the first half of this year, 2013, is a tough comparison because the events happen subtly [ph] so we'll be comparing first half next year of Carnival to first half this year. And that's a tough comparison given the fact, Carnival, we're not yet fully recovered there...","Howard S. Frank","And then we did -- when we said they're improving, they're improving from the prior quarters.","Micky M. Arison","On the prior quarters.","Arnold W. Donald","Yes.","Micky M. Arison","And it's also consistent with what we said last quarter. It didn't seem like anybody was -- took it hard. But it is consistent with what we said last quarter.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. David, just a quick cost question. Thank you for the color you gave us on why it's going to increase next year probably more than we expected. But if we back out all of the initiatives and the dry docks and the things that you talked about, does the underlying cost profile look similar to how you have typically fund the business?","David Bernstein","Well, I think next year is a little bit unique. The things that we were talking about, there were some onetime costs this year that -- relating to the Carnival tribe that don't repeat themselves next year. But we do have quite a few dry docks next year. They're longer in length because of the vessel enhancements. That is costing us something. And we talked about the increased advertising expense, which is an investment that we hope will wind up with better yields in the back half of next year. There are other investments that we're making in the food and entertainment and the product. There are a few other things, insurance premiums, crew air costs, investments in sales forces and other things that we think are worthwhile that we're looking at. But again, these are all very preliminary. And we've got a lot of discussions to do with the operating companies before we can give you a final number. But these are some of the things that they're proposing.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of clarifications. I'm just thinking about rate of recovery and things for more than just the Costa brand, but I'm curious for Costa in the third quarter. Was the yield increase just in occupancy recovery, or was there also ticket price improvement for the Costa brand in Q3? That's one question. And then the commentary you gave about first half, I -- you said North American yields would be down in the first half, and I just wanted to clarify, was that including or excluding the Carnival brand for first half yields?","Howard S. Frank","I think the cost -- do you want to go first?","Micky M. Arison","The Costa yields.","Beth Roberts","The Costa brand's in the third quarter was mostly occupancy led. We are projecting that the fourth quarter will be a combination of occupancy and pricing.","Howard S. Frank","And the North American yield outlook that I provided was -- includes Carnival.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And if you excluded the Carnival brand in the -- would North American yields in the first half be up excluding Carnival?","Howard S. Frank","I didn't give that information.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And it's not something, I guess, that's, I guess, you would want to give [ph].","David Bernstein","It's a little early.","Arnold W. Donald","[indiscernible]","Howard S. Frank","It's too early, Robin. We try to give a -- based on preliminary information both on a yield and cost side, we're trying to give some directional information out. We'll go through the numbers in the next couple of months with the business guys and get a better sense. And they'll have a better sense of it as well, and then it will [indiscernible].","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And I can appreciate that you're trying to give guidance and want to give it as much but not give more than you have visibility for. I guess the reason I was asking for the clarification is I'm trying to think about whether it's mostly the Carnival brand issues that are hurting North American yields. And so, I guess, would you say that the -- if it's still a question mark for sort of the North American brands, excluding Carnival? Is it still primarily related to, like, the Carnival brand's issues that affecting the others? Or I'm just trying to get a sense of if there's some other factor that we're not thinking of that may be impacting those other brands. Or would you say, even if it's not the Carnival brand itself, it's still the impact of those issues affecting the other brands?","Howard S. Frank","Well, what I've said is that both Princess and Holland America are going to have solid performances in 2014. What we don't know -- when we all focus on yields, you may get the wrong piece of information because there's so much mix elements in terms of moving itineraries around, making investments in new markets and so on, that can be affecting it. So I -- we can give you much better guidance on this in the December call, but we don't really have that information right now.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So just a couple of questions for Arnold. One is, when do you expect to finalize your contract? What kind of metrics might you be looking for in your own contract? And when can we look for some sense of where that's all going? And then secondly, you mentioned that there might be some opportunities for expense reduction. While well aware that, with almost 100 ships, that can take some time, do you think about that as a multiyear process? Or are there immediate expense reductions that you might be able to talk about in December?","Arnold W. Donald","Okay, Steve, concerning the contract, I suspect that will be finalized at the upcoming board meeting in October. And then at that time, we can -- coming out of that, we can talk about metrics for next year. This year, the metrics are well established in the compensation plans. And I own those, along with the rest of the leadership team, for this year. I think they've been publicly discussed before. Concerning -- what was your second question?","Howard S. Frank","Expense reduction.","Arnold W. Donald","Oh, the expense reduction, yes. I think, certainly, there are opportunities immediately that, under Howard's direction and Micky's, people are already working on. And so we have been realizing cost savings for some time and will continue to do so in terms of immediate opportunities. And then as we look at it and look at our total spend and the opportunity to leverage across the brands, I think there will be opportunities, additional opportunities, for cost savings. But that's what we're going to review in these plans coming up and, then subsequent to me hearing all of those and meeting with the rest of the leadership team, to identify some targets. And we'll be in a better position to talk about that in the coming months.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So I was interested in your effort to sell or lay-up a couple of Costa ships. Is there a broader plan here to at least begin reducing capacity?","Micky M. Arison","Yes, I think that we've said for some time that, part of the plan that the new building capacity that we'd contracted for, part of it was replacement capacity, and that it was our intention to sell off older smaller ships, less-efficient ships. In this particular case, though, it got to the point where, because the second-hand market is so weak, that we now considered laying ships up or selling them at very low price, or even scrap. And so because of that, we took the decision. In fact, one of the Costa ships that we've written down is being laid up this fall. And the other one, a final decision hasn't been taken, but she's clearly on the market for sale. So we're trying to move more aggressively to move out this older tonnage.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Can you give us a sense of what percentage of your fleet could be considered for moving it out?","Micky M. Arison","Well, the -- one of the problems we have is, except for these 2 ships, all the rest contributes. So -- but obviously, we're taking a hard look at everything. But no, I can't -- yes, one of the problems is, of course, because it's smaller capacity, in the overall scheme things, 1 new building is 3x or 4x or 5x the size of 1 ship that we scrap or sell.","Howard S. Frank","Harry, keep in mind, these 2 ships were ships that we never -- we didn't build. These are ships that came through the acquisition of Costa or another brand that we probably wouldn't have built there -- which we would not have built because of their sizes. So they were smaller ships, and during low-yielding periods, like we're in right now for Costa, they don't, they're not generating positive cash flows, so we've decided to either write them down or sell them, scrap them.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And my second question is -- goes back to Steve's question, but it's perhaps a little bit broader. For Arnold, what -- I'm just wondering, what are some of the broader initiatives that you're considering? There has been some discussion about the centralization of resources, which could be an interesting source of cost savings. And then the second question is, and this is really for Micky, do you -- is it -- what is your perspective on giving Arnold enough of a rein to actually execute some of these changes?","Micky M. Arison","Well, I know, I think that...","Arnold W. Donald","Yes, go ahead.","Micky M. Arison","[indiscernible] going first. Arnold has full authority, for being in the board, to do and to recommend to the board whatever he feels is the right way to go. And while I'm happy to assist him and give him whatever advice he needs, my focus is only to do whatever I can to make him mutually successful. So if he feels strongly that he wants to go in any particular direction, I will support him 100%. So to him, it's a clean slate, and I'm sure he's looking at it that way. And I'm as interested as you are to see where we go from here.","Arnold W. Donald","Yes, first of all, Micky has given me total freedom of flexibility and he's been extremely supportive. I'd be foolish not to take advantage of all of his experience and time in the business, and certainly we'll continue to do that, but I feel no constraint whatsoever at an operating level. He's an outstanding delegator and he definitely stands behind his people, and so I'm very, very comfortable in doing what we need to do. But it is still premature. And so we have upcoming plan meetings and has the rest of the process here for me. And then I'll meet with the leadership team and we'll align around the best way forward. I don't imagine any big, dramatic changes, but obviously, there'll be some changes and we'll discover those together as we finish up through the plan process and then meet with the leadership team right after that. In terms of the overall opportunity, though, it's not so much centralization or decentralization and all of that. The reality is obviously we have scale. Today, if you rolled up -- the other publicly traded cruise companies and perhaps if you roll them all up, their net income would not equal what ours is even in this period. And so we have a tremendous advantage of scale with 10 very powerful brands. And leveraging that in all ways, both from a revenue-generating way as well as cost management way, bodes well for our future. And we have opportunity to do that and we will find the most effective ways to do that.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of clarifications. You said that you've seen trends improve in both the Costa and the Carnival brands. So just again to clarify, you're -- the Carnival brand pricing has stabilized, you're saying, but obviously at lower year-over-year levels. That would be question one. And then I think you made a statement that you've made a decision with the Carnival brand to hold price with the willingness to sacrifice some occupancy. Can you kind of comment the decision to do that? Because I think, post the Costa Concordia accident, you may -- you wanted to do that and then you said, \"Wait, that's not the right -- what we need to be doing.\" And you've reversed course and dropped price to gain occupancy. So just maybe compare and contrast those 2 decisions with those brands.","Howard S. Frank","Okay, Tim, I'll -- what I -- on the Carnival comments, with our Carnival brand and Costa, indeed a very -- their improvements are very, very different because Costa is well on its way, 18 months later from their incident, to start to show year-over-year improvements in yield, which we experienced in 2013. We'll continue to experience for the yield improvements in 2014. Carnival is much more in the formative stages of recovery. So early stages of recovery. So what we're seeing in the Carnival brand is continuing increases in volumes. They fell considerably behind on occupancy, so in order to stimulate -- as you know, in order to stimulate demand, we put lower prices out there to get the booking volumes up. And we've seen a good response to that, especially in the last 12 weeks and the last 6 weeks and so on. But there's still considerable catch-up to do. So when you're thinking of catch-up, you're not quite sure, \"Are things are -- is pricing stable?\" It's hard exactly to say because pricing is so dynamic day to day. But I wouldn't -- I don't know that I have an answer to that, but clearly, we're seeing significant improvement in demand recently. And I think, with the new marketing going out right now, plus the outreach program for the travel agents, we've seen some nice upticks on our various distribution channels, so -- and the number of hits we're getting on our websites and so on. So it's a very -- we're seeing very positive trending right now. That will -- it will take time for that to translate into improved pricing, and hopefully we'll start to see that in the second half of the year of 2014. I'll let Carnival (sic) [Arnold] comment on the pricing occupancy on Carnival.","Arnold W. Donald","Yes, in terms of the holding price, that's -- we're open-minded about different pricing approaches and the world constantly changes and evolves. And so we are doing some testing in Carnival now to see if holding the price on certain itineraries can break a cycle of some of our repeat guests from waiting till the last minute to book thinking they're going to get a better price. When these issues happen, like at Triumph, or whatever, the real pressure is on the new to cruise. Most of those people who have cruise extensively, they continue to cruise, they're not taken aback by these events. And certainly, there are a lot of brand loyalists because there's actually not as much overlap between the brands with repeat guests as some people might think. So the real issue is the new to cruise, and then there's pressure there. And so we're now going to experiment a bit and see if there's ways we can accelerate the full pricing recovery. And that's one of the things the Carnival brand opted for in the fourth quarter, it was on certain itineraries, to test that.","Micky M. Arison","Can I just add? Because I believe the question was inaccurate. The decision at Costa was to hold price and not buy and filling [ph] the ships for a couple of quarters. And we did that for a few quarters. And then as the perception of the brand started to improve, this strategy started to change. So it's not that we changed at all. But certainly, we did go a couple of quarters, with significant below full occupancy at Costa. And the fact is, right now, Carnival's talking about going a quarter or 2 or whatever and leaving some cabins if necessary. The good thing, by the way, as part of their Carnival Conversations program, they've been able to use these cabins for travel agents, which is fantastic because the agents get to see the upgraded Fun Ship 2.0 product and hopefully encourages them to sell more in the future. So that could be a win-win as well.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And one last question related to the Caribbean. Granted there are different dynamics between what the Carnival brand and what your competitors are doing, but collectively, Caribbean capacity from the whole industry is increasing. How do you see -- I guess, a better way to ask the question is, how do you see the Caribbean pricing with what your competitors are doing relative to the non-Carnival brands in your fleet?","Micky M. Arison","They did increase in Caribbean as in the second half, is there?","Beth Roberts","[indiscernible] in the quarter, which we don't have much visibility [indiscernible] at this time.","Micky M. Arison","It's just too early.","Howard S. Frank","It's too early to say, Tim.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Assia Georgieva from Infinity Research.","Assia Georgieva","Congratulations on the [indiscernible] project. That was quite fantastic to watch, and I'm happy that it turned out well. One quick question on Caribbean pricing and one follow on Tim's line of questioning. It seems that, during Q3, the Carnival brand had recovered somewhat. Do you expect to see any last-minute improvement in pricing? Or do you expect to actually lower pricing?","Howard S. Frank","I guess, when you say the Carnival brand recovered, you mean in terms of volumes, higher demand. Is that...","Arnold W. Donald","Pricing.","Assia Georgieva","In terms of pricing, because I can't crack your database so I can't know volume.","Howard S. Frank","No, I don't know the exact answer, but I would say, generally, there's quite a bit of catch-up to do on getting back to historically higher occupancies for Carnival before they can start to move the pricing. So I think that's going to take a while. Exactly the difference between Q3 and Q4 and Q1 of 2014, it's hard to say right now, other than on an absolute basis. But clearly, if we continue -- if they continue to run these large volumes, and we're very encouraged by with everything else that's going on in the marketplace for them right now, it's a very positive sign. But likely, we don't expect to see positive yield year-over-year improvement until the third and fourth quarter of...","Micky M. Arison","We you do have a natural third quarter phenomenon that, families, a pre-school family that haven't made vacation plans have postponed it because of the economy or whatever, come into the market very often late. And so there tends to be, in the third quarter, this natural push for vacations and particularly family vacations. And so Carnival being a very, very big family brand, we'll see a natural push. But that disappears once school's back in, and -- in the fall and the demographics changes in the fall. So you could see it, something in the third quarter that may not translate to the fourth.","Assia Georgieva","And Micky, that is very helpful. And basically, I was asking the question whether that can translate into Q4 or Q1 given how important the Caribbean is in those 2 quarters.","Micky M. Arison","Well, in Q1, we have a different phenomenon. In Q1, it starts getting cold, November, December, and you start getting the snow hurdles. And so you do have certain demand criteria in Q1 that might help you last minute. That doesn't tend to be there in Q4. Q4 is always the most -- historically for 40 years, it's been the toughest quarter of the year. And it is in good times and bad times. Even in good times, Q4 tends to be tough. But Q1, the challenge, of course, is all the capacity that comes from Alaska and from Europe to the Med to -- sorry, to the Caribbean. There's a massive increase in capacity every year, but there isn't that massive increase in demand from the cold weather. And hopefully, we'll get a nice cold snap early this year and helps our Caribbean first quarter.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Can you guys remind us what percentage of capacity is booked at this point for the first and second quarter, just so we could think about what sort of improvement you might get from your advertising exposure in the rest of the year? And then can you also talk about what sort of advertising channels you might be thinking of using if you're targeting more travel agents or consumers, and how that's split up?","David Bernstein","As far as the percentage that are booked, the numbers, the ranges that we generally talk about are, for the next quarter which would be the fourth quarter, will be 85% to 95% booked; the second quarter out, which is the first quarter, 50% to 70%; and then the second quarter, which is 3 quarters out, 30% to 50% booked. And we have indicated recently that we're at the lower end of those ranges as far as booking patterns are concerned.","Howard S. Frank","On the advertising channels, I mean, we use all -- right now, we're using all our advertising to -- we're on national TV with the Carnival -- with the new Carnival campaign, but we're also going to do more consumer print. We do -- we're now back into trade magazines. We're doing radio as well. We're doing local TV, we're doing local radio. I mean, it -- we're all over the...","David Bernstein","Princess recently started a new program where they're advertising on the mall directories as well. They think that's a good spot for them. So as Howard said, we're all over.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, so it's pretty much as it has been in the past. I thought maybe there was just a change in -- getting in front of people, maybe.","Micky M. Arison","No, there has been significant changes. We haven't been on national TV in a long time. I don't know how many years, but many, many years we haven't been on national TV, and never been in this kind of levels in the fall. We have been out of trade advertising for a while, and we're back in trades. So -- and I don't recall that we did that much radio. So our focus the last few years has really been Internet search, direct mail, email, that kind of advertising. Now we're back in virtually all media.","David Bernstein","And I think [indiscernible] we had also upped the amount of investment in advertising as well from the fourth quarter. So the total spend and the total level of activity has increased.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Jamie Rollo with Morgan Stanley.","Jamie Rollo - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was just wondering how temporary some of these cost increases are for next year. You talked about a step up in marketing and advertising, more agents for dry docks. Could any of those actually reverse in 2015 so we can sort of think about next year as like a sort of transition year in terms of costs?","David Bernstein","It's very early to say. I mean, there are some possibilities. The dry docks are significantly longer because of the vessel enhancement. But as I mentioned, and the advertising is a function of the effectiveness of the ads and the yield increases that we get from it. There are some things, like insurance premiums which, hopefully over time, maybe we can work our way back down, but the investments in the products and a few of the other things are very possible that they're more permanent. So it's a mixed bag, but it's very early to say at this point which -- how much of the total increase would be permanent.","Jamie Rollo - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then the other question, just in terms of the shape of the yields in the first half, just to give us a feeling for the trajectory. I think, Arnold, you said, given the tougher comps for Carnival, it sounds like Q1 is going to be worse than Q2. Is that sort of fair? And can you give us a sort of rough flavor of the difference, please?","David Bernstein","I think he said the...","Howard S. Frank","Are you talking about yields, Jamie?","David Bernstein","Yields...","Jamie Rollo - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes.","Arnold W. Donald","Yes, yes. He's talking perhaps [ph] directionally.","[indiscernible] is correct, yes.","Jamie Rollo - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And for Q2, it would still be negative, as well as Q1?","David Bernstein","That is correct.","Arnold W. Donald","Most --- more than likely, yes.","David Bernstein","The -- keep in mind that we -- the Triumph occurred last February. And then we had the Carnival Dream in March. And so it's really, most of the second quarter was booked. And as a result, it's more difficult comparisons in the first act -- or the second quarter than the back half of next year. So [indiscernible].","Operator","Mr. Frank, it appears that there are no further questions at this time.","Howard S. Frank","Okay, thank you, all, very much for listening in. Beth will be available for follow-on calls after we hang up. We wish everybody a good day. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude the conference call for today.

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].","I would now like to turn the conference over to Arnold Donald. Please go ahead, sir.","Arnold Donald","Hi everyone, this is Arnold Donald, CEO of Carnival Corporation and Plc and Happy Holidays. Thank you all for joining us for our fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Today with me are Chairman, Micky Arison; our CFO, David Bernstein; and Beth Roberts, our Vice President of Investor Relations. Before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking. I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release.","We finished our fiscal year with a strong fourth quarter, exceeding guidance even before factoring in the benefits of lower fuels, and leading to 2014 full year cash from operations of nearly $3.5 billion. Earnings growth of almost 25% over 2013 and well above our full year guidance. That performance is a credit to our outstanding 120,000 team members and associates across the globe. In 2014, we enjoyed some early wins on our cross-brand collaboration efforts, and we had a number of significant achievements. Importantly, the groundwork for continued progress is laid for 2015 and beyond, as we aggressively move towards double digit return on invested capital.","Overcoming a number of obstacles as is often the case, including the loss of higher yielding itineraries due to geopolitical concerns, dramatic capacity increases on the Caribbean, and capacity absorption issues in Japan, as well as some other one-off impacts, we were still able to deliver very strong results.","Despite the aforementioned competitive Caribbean impact in fact, the team effort at the Carnival brand delivered a mid-single digit improvement in yield last quarter and a solid profit improvement for the year, exceeding our internal plans.","We made consistent progress in Europe, as Costa and AIDA continue to improve yields, and contain costs through the benefit of cross collaboration efforts among our European brands. In addition, the formation of the HAL Group, the Holland America Line Group, under signed [ph] cruise, has helped to accelerate cross-brand collaboration, and streamline non-customer facing functions on the West Coast.","In China, operating profit more than tripled, due to a combination of capacity growth and yield improvement. On having personally made several trips to China, I am confident in our positioning and the market's potential. Clearly, we have established a solid foothold in this very important region as the largest player home porting in China, and our development strategy is accelerating. Our Chief Operations Officer Buckelew is doing a great job, having recently relocated to Shanghai.","As previously announced, we have signed a Memorandum of Understanding with CSSC to explore the possibility of shipbuilding, as well as other strategic partnerships to foster growth of the industry in China. Additionally, we entered into an agreement with Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri to join us in the exploration of shipbuilding with CSSC.","This year, we also reduced fuel consumption by another 5% or $0.14 per share, bringing the cumulative reduction at 25% since 2007. We are committed to reducing consumption and the technology that we are rolling out next year will continue to improve the fuel efficiency of our fleet. At the same time, by developing and installing exhaust gas cleaning technology, we will greatly mitigate the impact of ECA coming into effect in January.","Importantly, we made continued progress towards enhancing our fleet, while maintaining our commitment to measured capacity growth. We delivered two spectacular, and considerably more efficient ships, the Regal Princess, and the Costa Diadema. We celebrated their delivery with two highly publicized naming ceremonies this past [indiscernible], that was the star-studded Love Boat being guest lift [ph] board the Regal Princess in North America, and shortly thereafter, it was followed by the stunning Diadema two days later in fact, christened by one of our own value travel agent partners, Carolina Micheli in Italy, and supported by Maids of Honors, also travel agent partners, from Germany, France, Spain and China.","We are very excited about our new ship deliveries, which combined with the ship's exits results in only a 2% of that capacity increase next year. In early 2015, we will welcome the new flagship for the P&O fleet, the Britannia, specifically built for our U.K. guests, and the first to feature the striking rendition of the Union Jack across our hull, as well as a host of new entertainment options.","Then later in the year, we will welcome AIDAprima to Germany, featuring an energy efficient new hull design; and just this month, we signed orders for three ships, Seabourn, Holland America Lines, and the Carnival Line, for delivering in 2018, which brings the total order book to 10 vessels, now that's an average of roughly one ship per brand in total, over a four year period, reflecting our commitment to measured capacity growth.","This past quarter, we reached an agreements to sell three less efficient ships, bringing the total sales agreements reached this year to four, also reinforcing our commitment to measured capacity growth, and at the same time, we are striving to create relative scarcity, by driving additional demand. We have a number of demand creating initiatives that we have already or will be rolled out soon. Beginning with the significant public relations effort across all brands to get our message to the vacationing public on what a great experience, and of course value, cruising represents. Our brands share of voice and positive mentions in the media were up significantly in 2014.","Ongoing guest experience initiatives have continued to increase our already high satisfaction levels and drive advocacy among our established base of repeaters. Maintaining our focus on training demand, we have also further stepped up our marketing efforts with planned advertising spend higher than our already elevated spend in the past two years. In total, our planned spend is nearly 25% higher for 2015 versus 2012.","Our 2015 marketing program is designed to reach the new to cruise market, including directing them to the experience that best resonates with their vacation preferences. Setting them on a journey of being lifelong advocates for cruising on our brands.","As we head into the important 2015 wave season, we are gearing up these efforts. Yesterday, we announced we will air a commercial on Super Bowl Sundays, the world's biggest marketing stage. The commercial is part of a multi-platform marketing initiative, that has already begun, and will extend well beyond the Super Bowl itself. And as you may have read, we are working with Academy Award winner Wally Pfister, known for his work on the movies Inception, Transcendence, the Dark Knight Trilogy, and dozens of other films, to direct four full production creative concepts.","As part of our initiatives, we are asking potential guests to provide their inputs on rough cuts of these concepts, and as an incentive to participate, one lucky person will win a cruise a year for life. Potential guests can check out the concept by visiting our marketing challenge on the web site, worldleadingcruiselines.com. The focus of all these efforts is to create relative scarcity by driving demand for our brands, that far outpace the supply, ultimately leading to higher yields. At the same time, we have embarked on a number of strategic initiatives, designed to move our company forward, and improve our top and bottom lines.","Beginning with our segmentation study in North America, the first, we have done a cross-brands and the largest ever done in our industry, and its nearing completion, enabling us to gain insight on what guest value, to increase our share of wallet both in ticket and on board. We conducted extensive interviews with over 40,000 respondents and then we data mined our 30 million past guest database, for insights to help grow demand. The biggest opportunity for our industry is to increase our consideration in the overall vacation market, and at the Carnival Corporation, we are currently identifying the key areas to strengthen and improve our brands, based on the segment that resonate most with each brand.","We have elevated our level of cross-brands, global deployment planning, and our objective in enhancing coordination of deployment across our brands is to drive greater penetration, more effective capacity management, and ultimately yields. Our burns [ph] passed deep dive examination of our revenue management practices has been completed, that effort was the first time we have looked at this important function across all brands to share best practices, and identify gaps, new practices and the best tools to use across the brand. To facilitate our ongoing effort, we recently hired a new Vice President of Group Revenue Performance, and what internally we call All-Brands, to sustain collaboration and rapid adoption of improved revenue management approaches.","In core markets, where strong brands overlap, price decisions have already started to be coordinated across the brands. The brands have shared cutting edge tools, and are now aligning among revenue management improvement roadmaps, leading to more efficient and more effective efforts to increase yield.","On-board, we have made continued progress on our strategy in the shops to improve retail, beginning with the midst of short term initiatives and longer term efforts, including new partnerships and store redesigns. Pilot ships are seeing double digit improvement in sales from our short term initiatives.","Concerning cost containment, we made progress leveraging our scale, some early wins already contributed, not including inflation avoidance, $20 million in 2014. We anticipate another $70 million to $80 million in actual year-to-year cost reductions to benefit 2015 from our savings on multiple procurement initiatives, including protein produce and of course, air. Now that will be a total of $100 million in cumulative cost reductions by the end of 2015.","We currently have further opportunity in the areas of ports, shore excursions, and technical purchasing. Over time, these leveraging initiatives will help offset inflation in the broader base of non-fuel purchases.","We believe we are executing along a clear path to our double digit return on invested capital. We improved return on invested capital by nearly one point in 2014, and we expect another point of improvement in 2015. Clearly, we cannot save our way to 10% plus return on invested capital, we need to drive yield growth. We need to drive it in the low to mid single digit range, through higher ticket and on-board revenues. We are committed to driving relative scarcity by creating even more demand for our brands that outpace this capacity. We are focused on measured capacity growth, by delivering innovative and significantly more efficient ships, while at the same time, removing from service, less efficient ships.","This ongoing rotation will enhance the return potential of our fleet over time. And clearly, we need to contain cost increases through our initiatives to leverage scale. Despite the higher hurdle on cost containment that measure capacity growth in producers, [ph] we expect our initiatives to offset inflation over the next few years, before reinvestment opportunities. But of course, we will continue to explore investment opportunities that provide attractive returns and drive yield improvement.","So in summary again, we believe we are affirming on our path to achieving double digit return on invested capital in the next three to four years, and before I turn it over to David, we are very excited to announce that Christine Duffy, former Cruise Lines International Association President, will join the company and lead the Carnival Cruise Lines brand. In addition, Orlando Ashford, has been appointed head of our Holland America Brand. Christine brings over 30 years of experience in the travel industry, complementing with her [indiscernible] skill set, the great operational team we have on board already in Carnival. And Orlando Ashford, has a great history and track record of high performance culture change, that is done in a number of organizations through his previous responsibility, and adds a high complement to the team overall, that we have at the leadership team and the skillsets we have on our overall management team.","So overall, we are very confident in our path forward, and I would now like to turn it over to David for comments.","David Bernstein","Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note, all of my references to revenue and cost metrics will be in constant dollars, as this is a much more meaningful measure of our business trends. I will start today with a summary of our guidance topping fourth quarter and full year results, then I will provide some insight into our current bookings, and finish up with some color on our 2015 December guidance.","Our non-GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.27. I am excited to report that this was $0.10 above the midpoint of our September guidance, and would have been above the high end of the September guidance range, even without the benefit of lower fuel prices. The improvement was essentially driven by two things, $0.05, the majority of which we benefited from higher onboard and other yields, as the improvement we saw in the third quarter was repeated again in the fourth quarter, and $0.05 from lower fuel prices.","Now let's look at our fourth quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 2%. The North American brands were up 2.5%, while our European, Australia and Asian brands, also known as our EAA brands, were up 1%. Our total net revenue yields in the fourth quarter were up almost 3%.","Now let's break apart the two components of net revenue yields. Net ticket yields were up over 2%, and this was driven by 2% plus increases on both sides of the Atlantic. Improvements in the North American brands were driven by seasonal European programs, and late season Alaskan sailings. Improvement in the EAA brands were driven by net itineraries and Australia. Net onboard and other yields increased over 4%, with increases on both sides of the Atlantic as well, and across the world in almost all onboard categories. This increase was considerably more positive than our September guidance, it was another great quarter for onboard revenue.","Net cruise cost per ALBD, excluding fuel, was down almost 2%, which was in line with the September guidance, and driven by the timing of expenses between the quarters, as the full year was up slightly. Fuel prices this quarter were down 13% versus the prior year, which saved us $0.09 per share.","In summary, fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.23 higher than the prior year, driven by improved net revenue yields worth $0.11, lower net cruise costs, excluding fuel were $0.04, and lower fuel prices were $0.09.","During the fourth quarter, there were a number of items that were included in our U.S. GAAP results, but excluded from our non-GAAP results, such as an $80 million restructuring charge, as we further leveraged to scale. All of these items are detailed in the reconciliation table in our press release.","Looking back at the full year, we turned the corner in 2014 with improved earnings and positive yields. Our non-GAAP EPS was $1.96 versus $1.58 for the prior year, roughly a 25% increase. Our non-GAAP EPS exceeded the high end of our December guidance range of $1.40 to $1.80. The improvement over last year's December guidance was essentially driven by two things, $0.31 primarily from improved net revenue yields. This resulted from better than expected net ticket yields at our continental European brands, and better than expected onboarding other yields in the back half of the year and finally $0.05 from lower fuel prices.","Turning to our cash flows for 2014, cash provided by operations was nearly $3.5 billion, 21% higher than last year, and capital expenditures, net of asset sales were roughly $2.5 billion, leaving us nearly $1 billion of free cash flow, most of which was returned to shareholders, via a regular quarterly dividend.","Looking forward to 2015, as always, we will have a much better indication of demand, once we get into wave season, which is still a few weeks away. But the early indications are positive. For 2015, we are expecting net revenue yields in constant dollars to grow by approximately 2%. As we indicated in the press release, we are forecasting net revenue yields in the first quarter, to be up only slightly, which is impacting the full year average. We expect the remaining three quarters of 2015 collectively to be up 2.5% in constant dollars, and if you normalize for the transactional currency impact, the yields for the remaining $3 combined would be up 3%.","Our forecasted net revenue yields are prepared based on constant dollars. The constant dollar calculation normalizes for the impact of currency translation for those entities, whose functional currency is different from the U.S. dollar. What is not taken into consideration in the constant dollar calculation, is the transactional impact relating to changes in exchange rates on revenues, that are in a currency other than the brand's functional currency.","Historically, the transactional impact of currency on net revenue yields has been de minimis. However, we will continue to monitor transactional currency impacts, and highlight them when it makes sense.","So in summary, our constant dollar full year net revenue yield guidance of approximately 2% is impacted both by the first quarter yield guidance, which is a couple of percentage points lower than the rest of the year collectively, and transactional currency impacts.","The first quarter continues to be impacted by capacity in the Caribbean, which represents almost half of our first quarter capacity, but for the subsequent three quarters of the year, the Caribbean only represents on average, less than 30% of our capacity. For the full year, we are expecting to see yield improvements in almost all itineraries, including the Caribbean. However, we are being cautious in Australia, where the industry capacity is expected to increase by 20% this year.","Now let's turn to bookings; at this point, for the first three quarters of 2015, cumulative fleet wide bookings are nicely ahead at slightly higher prices for both of our two major business segments. Drilling down into the booking patterns, first, for our North American brands; the Caribbean pricing is currently in line with the prior year at nicely higher occupancy, which bodes well for pricing on future bookings.","Booking values during the last quarter are down, but that's because we are ahead, and we are still ahead at the moment. Remember, it is a zero sum game. Prices on these bookings are down slightly, which is reflected in our first quarter yield guidance. All other North American brand appointments combined, which includes the seasonal European program and Alaska, are nicely ahead on both price and occupancy. Booking volumes during the last quarter have been good, ahead of the prior year, but at lower prices, driven by transactional currency impacts.","Secondly, our EAA brands; Europe itineraries are nicely ahead on occupancy at better prices. Booking volumes for these itineraries during the last quarter are also nicely higher than the prior year at better prices.","Now turning to costs; net cruise costs without fuel per ALBD are expected to be up approximately 3% for 2015. As I mentioned on the September conference call, the majority of the increase is due to significantly higher drydock days in 2015, as we are working hard to accomplish a number of things.","First, installing exhaust gas cleaning systems or more commonly known as scrubbers, which will reduce the impact of the new 2015 ECA requirements. Second, installing new fuel efficiency technology to further reduce fuel consumption, and third progressing the vessel enhancements we announced last year. We expect the majority of the higher drydock costs in 2015 will be reversed, since we currently anticipate a lower level of drydock days in 2016. Of the remaining one percentage increase, the majority is driven by higher advertising expense and product enhancements.","For 2015, even after the impact of the new ECA requirements, which we expect to cost about $0.10, we are forecasting to benefit from lower price of fuel, net of realized losses on fuel derivatives by $0.61. Partially offsetting this -- or unfavorable currency exchange rate movements, including both translational and transactional currency impact, costing us $0.20. Putting all these factors together, our non-GAAP EPS guidance for 2015 is $2.30 to $2.60 versus $1.96 for 2014.","On a final note, I want to share with you our current rules of thumb about the impact that currency and fuel prices can have on our results. To start with, a 10% change in all [indiscernible] currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would impact our P&L by approximately $0.30 per share for the full year, and $0.04 for the first quarter. This includes both translational and transactional currency impacts. The fuel price changes, as our fuel insurance program uses zero cost collars to protect against fuel price spikes, every 10% change in the price of fuel has a different impact, once the price of Brent moves outside the collars. Therefore, we laid out a sensitivity table in the press release, that chose the full year non-GAAP EPS impact, if the price of Brent moves up or down from the $63 used to determine our December guidance earlier this week.","At the moment, we have collars for roughly half of our consumption for 2015, with four starting at $80. So essentially, we benefit from a 100% of the fuel price drop to $80, and roughly speaking, we still enjoyed 50% of the benefit of any fuel price drop below $80. I say roughly speaking, because in these calculations, we assume a static relationship between the price of Brent and the price of bunker, as each moves up and down. We all know the relationship has a tendency to move over time, but the correlation is recently good over the longer term. In the press release, we also included a table of the fuel derivatives we currently have for 2015 through 2018.","And now operator, we are ready to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Please proceed.","Robin Farley","I think that may be me, this is Robin Farley. Two questions, first is, I wonder if you could give us any kind of cumulative sense, how the Costa brand and the Carnival brand -- and at this point, through the end of this year versus peak pricing, going back to 2007. Just to get a sense of sort of how much recovery is left in each of those brands, in whatever way you might quantify for that? And then secondly, your ship announcement this morning, didn't have the cost per berth, and I wonder if we should assume both of them are sister ships to 2016 deliveries, how different is the cost on 2018 delivery? Thanks.","Arnold Donald","Hey, happy holidays to your Robin. First of all, concerning your question on Costa and Carnival, obviously we typically don't provide brand specific guidance; but through a lot of hard work, both brands are working their way back and we have been impacted, and the Costa brand by a significant economic downturn a year, but we are definitely on pace for a three to four year recovery, we just had a very good year with Costa, and we expect another one; Michael Thamm and his team are doing a great job over there. And hopefully, the moderately improving European economic situation is going to help us.","In regards to Carnival, we did a really good job, offsetting the revenue shortfall that they experienced in the first half, and then we are working really hard to accelerate that. The profit improvement in 2014 was good, and we see things pointing up, especially as we get into the second and third quarters next year, when the Caribbean capacity decreases.","And then concerning your second question on the fleet, the ships that we announced today, things are tightening up a bit, there is inflation and so on. But we are very pleased with the ships that we have announced, in terms of the deals we have constructed for those, that gives a shipyard lots of incentive to do high quality work, and give us an excellent opportunity for very high return on invested capital, given the ship's designs and the department plans going ahead. I hope I answered your questions Robin?","Robin Farley","Not as specifically as I hoped, maybe if you could just talk one last one and then --","Arnold Donald","Sure. By all means.","Stuart Gordon","I don't know if you have any initial thoughts on the potential for Cuba, and how you think that could affect kind of -- itineraries you get out to, when you look at your Caribbean mix thing, you know 35% or so of your fleet, and just sort of any initial thoughts, I realize its quite early?","Arnold Donald","There is no question, the legislative embargo was lifted, Cuba is a tremendous opportunity. There is a lot of pent-up demand to visit Cuba. It would allow us some very fuel efficient itineraries, also just new itineraries for those who love to go to Caribbean. There is about 11 ports, that are able today to accommodate our ships. There are some size restrictions, and those particularly in Havana. So we have a variety of ships and different sizes that can go to multiple ports. The Havana port specifically has a relatively shallow drafts, that will take some smaller ships that can't be drenched because of some of them over there -- the tunnels that is there. But there will be investment in ports and all the infrastructure required all the time, should the legislative embargo be lifted. But we are excited about the prospects for Cuba, and it would definitely create the demand that we need to have the relative scarcity to drive yields.","Robin Farley","Great. Thank you.","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Hendrix with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi, Felicia Hendrix and good morning and happy holidays. David, wondering if you could just walk us through how you get to the high end of your earnings guidance range, given the metrics that you gave us in the release?","David Bernstein","We're talking about a range that is $0.30 wide, which is essentially two points of yield, and so at the high end of the range, from the midpoint you're probably either talking about a point additional yield, or something less than a point of additional yield, and something at a slightly less costs. Those are the types of things in terms of the guidance range that we are looking at.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. That's helpful, because when you gave us the yields and the costs, those weren't ranges. But what I am hearing from you is that implicit in your EPS guidance is some kind of yields and cost range?","David Bernstein","Yes, and basically the approximately 2% and approximately 3% was the midpoint of the range.","Felicia Hendrix","Right, okay. And then also David, keeping you in the hot seat here, regarding your overall net yield forecast, thank you for the color. You mentioned Australia as being an area of caution, given the capacity growth that's there. Just wondering if you could give us some more color on your thoughts, on what you're seeing and thinking about Europe next year, because capacity is growing there, while its mid-single digits, and its not an onerous number, it is up a lot versus a steep decline in 2014. So are you baking in any kind of conservatism for Europe, and then also maybe regarding the economy there, or how are you thinking about that?","David Bernstein","Overall, we are looking at yields in Europe to be up, we are looking it both for the seasonal European program for our North American brands, as well as our EAA brands. So we have positive yields included in the forecast for both, and we feel very good about that. We give you our best guess all the time, and so up approximately 2% is our best guess, given what we are seeing. But remember, wave season is a few weeks, and we will have a much better indication of demand, when we get into January-February timeframe.","Felicia Hendrix","Perfect. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Steven Kent","Hi, two questions; just to follow-up on Robin's question on cost; the reason why are so focused in on it, is that it sounded like you're still in recovery mode for the brand, and that would be a lot longer than I would have thought for the brand to come back. If costs are now trending more along with the other European brands, or if there is still something unique about it? And then just one other thing, we noticed in the back of the press release, there was a restructuring charge of $18 million, trademark and other impairment charges in Q4? I just wanted to know what that was, and whether it was related to a specific brand or something like that? Thank you.","Arnold Donald","I will answer the second part first, $80 million refers to actions in both the Costa Group and the Holland America Group, where we set up reserves, as they effect the cross brand collaboration coordination, some redundancies widened, and we set up some reserves accommodate that, and the savings from that are reflected in the guidance, in the range that we have given for 2015. And what was the first part of your question again?","David Bernstein","Let me answer on the loss, Steve, the losses on the ship sales and ship impairments. What was included in the fourth quarter, was relating to the three ships that we talked about, that will be leaving the fleet, and that was the $70 million in the fourth quarter. The impairments relate to prior periods, which are also included in the table.","Arnold Donald","Okay. And then your first question was back on Costa again; look, the reality is, we have moved on, and we are focused now on driving yields and containing costs. But as you guys asked the questions about previous points in time and performance; clearly, we feel the cost of recovery was impaired by the environment and economic environment in Europe. But we had a good year in Costa; we had excellent improvement in profitability and expect to grow again next year.","Steven Kent","So then just sticking on that -- but I guess what we are asking is, is like Costa, AIDA, Cunard, just as European brands; are those three brands all moving together, or is Costa still not showing the same kind of momentum, both the upside and to the downside, as the other --","Arnold Donald","Europe is not one market, so you have the U.K., you have the Baltic, the Mediterranean, and so on. The brand sorts differently, in terms of their source markets, the countries people come from that, the weight of all that. So those are very three different brands; AIDA, the German brand, almost exclusively sourced in the German market, serves Germans almost exclusively, so that brand is not very-very well and continues to do so. The U.K. is heavily sourced, obviously with U.K. folks, and whatever happens in the U.K. and [indiscernible].","But Cunard is a global brand; Cunard sources from the U.K., North America, Asia, everywhere. So you are talking about apples, oranges and apricots kind of a thing. So we would not expect them to move in unison, because Europe is not one place, and even those brands, not all source exclusively from Europe.","But Costa is doing well, Cunard is doing well, its just P&O, which I did mention and AIDA is doing very well.","Steven Kent","Okay. Thank you.","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Please proceed.","Steve Wieczynski","Hey, good morning guys. So David, you specifically called out Australia; and I know capacity there is up somewhere between 15% and 20% for the industry next year; but is that something that you are currently seeing right now in terms of pressure, or is that something you're saying further down the road, you think that could be something, that that market could come under pressure?","David Bernstein","I wasn't talking about pressure; Australia has seen double digit capacity increases, it absorbed it very well. All I was trying to do, as I was indicating that all the different programs were going to be up next year, including the Caribbean; but I was just cautioning you that Australia may not be up as much as some of the others, because of the larger capacity increase in that market.","Steve Wieczynski","Okay, got you. And then second question, it\u2019s a question we get a lot from investors, but given where oil is today, and I know you guys have never hedged in the past, and you have your field insurance [ph] out there, but is there any discussion going on at this point, in terms of doing something more to the extreme in terms of, basically trying to lock in more fuel at today's prices?","David Bernstein","Our practice has been to use collars to mitigate against spikes, and the prices, and that will be our practice going forward.","Steve Wieczynski","Okay. And then last -- David, can I just ask one housekeeping question; do you have the capacity increases for all of Carnival by quarter?","David Bernstein","We do --","Beth Roberts","For first quarter, we are up 2.5%; second quarter is up 3%; third quarter is up 1.3%; fourth quarter is up 4%, for a total of 2.7 on the year.","Steve Wieczynski","Okay, thanks guys. Happy Holidays.","David Bernstein","Sounds a little high, above the ship --","Beth Roberts","Let me just double check the number.","David Bernstein","I think that number is a little high. We will get the right number back to you. Beth will give it to you.","Beth Roberts","Let's go to the next question, I will go back to that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura. Please proceed.","Harry Curtis","Hey, good morning. Going back to that last question, Arnold, you mentioned that your practice is to use collars, that's not been set in stone for a long period of time, and you've seen an unprecedented move in the price of crude. And just the lift in crude between sort of 2006 and 2012, devastated the company's return on invested capital; so I am just wondering, you sound committed to the collars, but is there any flexibility to moving to hedges, because if we do see a move back in crude, its going to have a negative impact on your strategy of lifting your return on invested capital?","Arnold Donald","Well first of all, with regards to return on invested capital, our plan has always been -- we weren't counting on fuel to drop, and we don't know what fuel is going to do in the future. So we need to get double digit return on invested capital regardless. Now clearly, if fuel continues where it is or drops further, that would accelerate the timeline, to get to the double digit return on invested capital. But we need to get there, regardless, so that's number one.","And number two is that, we are protecting against spikes, so we want to protect against the downside, and there is all kinds of debate around hedging, and any cost of money to hedging, and you have to decided whether its worth it. In our case right now, we didn't hedge, and so we have been able to benefit in the recent drops in fuel prices that we had hedged. Before this, we wouldn't be enjoying quite as much benefit as we are today.","Harry Curtis","Right. But I am just if there is some flexibility at the board level on changing your strategy?","Arnold Donald","We will review it consistently. Our current recommendation is to maintain the color, practice that we have. But I am sure that that will be a conversation going forward.","Harry Curtis","Okay. And my other question is, can you give me a sense of the actual drydock days that are budgeted for 2015, and how that's different from 2014? What I am trying to get at is, when you think of how many ships in your fleet you really need to touch, whether its scrubber technology or vessel enhancement, are you -- is the implication that really by the end of 2015, all of that incremental investment and drydock days will be done by the end of 2015?","Arnold Donald","I think the way to look at it is, first of all we have got 550 drydock days in plan for 2015, that's a 50% increase over what occurred in 2014. There is no normal for drydock days, but if you want a number on average to think about over time, that would average out as probably in the 400 to 450 day type of range.","In terms of the technologies, the fuel consumption saving technologies, as well as the exhaust cleaning systems; that's peaking for certain this year, in 2015. A lot of that will be done by 2016, and we should be pretty much done with that, completely by 2017. But there will be a major tailwind for 2016, from the reduced number of drydock days, 2016 compared to 2015.","Harry Curtis","So you would expect it to go back down to that average of 400 to 450 perhaps?","Arnold Donald","Yes, it will be in that range. We have to plan -- there is also other enhancements that we may put onboard, to drive revenue and so on. But directionally, you're absolutely right.","Beth Roberts","I am going to correct the capacity growth from earlier. The latest figures to cancel [ph] the ship sales for next year are 1.7% in the first quarter, 2.3% in the second, 0.6% in the third quarter, 3.3% in the fourth quarter, for a total of 2% flat on the year.","Arnold Donald","Right.","Harry Curtis","Okay. That does it for me. Thanks guys.","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar. Please proceed.","Jaime Katz","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk a little bit about how the marketing has evolved in China, as you guys have learned more about the consumer there, and how you are better targeting the consumer base in the region?","Arnold Donald","Well first of all, it continues to evolve obviously, and in reality, if there is pent-up demand. What we have done is, based on the experience of Costa, which has been there since 2006, we have gone with Italy's finest as the theme for the Costa brand, and that's marketed through the various distributors in China, who market directly to the Chinese public, as well as there is general marketing effort through internet and through TV.","On Princess side of things, they were offering international experience from an American type perspective. We have catered a number of the features on the ships to the Chinese consuming public. But we are all fortunate whether its ourselves or others in the industry that are participating in that market. It\u2019s a very large market. There is pent-up demand, and we will continue to learn, to perfect both the guest experience onboard, as well as how to reach out to the Chinese public, that is eligible for cruising.","Jaime Katz","And then, do you guys have just forward CapEx estimates, so we can think about how those new ships might impact spend?","David Bernstein","Sure. We are looking at $3 billion, and this includes newbuilds as well for 2015 and a little bit higher, probably about $3.3 billion for 2016, and roughly $2 billion for 2017.","Jaime Katz","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Richard Carter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Richard Carter","Hi. Good morning everybody. Is it possible to just give us a flavor of thinking about the vessel enhancements you have done so far on Carnival Cruise Lines? What sort of impacts you've seen in terms of revenues post enhancements, versus pre-enhancements? And then second, you obviously talked --","Arnold Donald","I am sorry go ahead.","Richard Carter","Then just second question, just on the pent-up demand in Asia, there is obviously a lot of capacity coming into Asia forecast over the next few years. So do you see any risk at all in terms of yield growth coming under pressure, or do you think the demand far outweighs the supply?","Arnold Donald","First of all, concerning the Fun Ship 2.0 enhancements for Carnival, there is not question that it contributed with one of the contributors to the strong performance of our Carnival brand this year, and the overall lift in the profitability of that brand, that we saw. It also shows us guest satisfaction scores onboard, and it certainly helped to further invigorate that brand, and keep it very relevant for the guests and gradually in a power way, and it has positioned us well going into next year.","With regard to China, your question again?","Richard Carter","I am just wondering about -- obviously you talk about this, there is a lot of pent-up demand, but there is also a lot of capacity of all the major lines going -- just your advice?","Arnold Donald","Right now, we are seeing yield improvements. But over time, depending on how things evolve there, there could be periods of out of sync capacity introductions to demand. But right now for 2015, where we have line of sight, demand is strong, and we are anticipating yield improvement and continued progress in China.","Richard Carter","Can you try and quantify a little bit in terms of onboard spend, sort of percentage changes on the vessels that have the enhancement investment? Is there any way of just giving us a flavor --","Arnold Donald","Well of course, how it has been [ph] in terms of Carnival, you mean?","Richard Carter","Yeah, post the investments on Carnival Cruise Lines?","Arnold Donald","Again a little more complicated than that. Its not just the Fun Ship 2.0 investment that would drive onboard revenues. But onboard revenue lift was strong, as we indicated in 5% in the fourth quarter. We don't see that as an ongoing run-rate of improvement, but we certainly see strong improvement and have that in our plan, to the guidance we have given you going forward. Some of that comes from not so much Fun Ship 2.0, but some different things we have done and we have learned through the brand collaboration and coordination and seeing all other things, and clearly some of it does come directly from the Fun Ship 2.0.","Richard Carter","Okay. Thanks.","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.","Tim Conder","Thank you and happy holidays, Merry Christmas to everyone. A couple here, just returning to the several questions you have had on Costa. You said that Costa is improving, I think maybe if you could give some color, it would be greatly appreciated I think by everyone. If you strip out China, which obviously you're using Princess and Costa in China led by Costa, how is Costa doing ex-China, I guess is maybe the question I'd like to drill in on? And then the FX going forward, can you give us a color, how much is U.S. dollar and then the major other currencies, the Euro, Pound and Aussie on a revenue and EBIT basis, looking to 2015?","Arnold Donald","Okay, with regard to Costa, China and then the European context, Costa is doing very well, but obviously as you move ships out, you have got less capacity in Europe. But in terms of the capacity out there, is higher performing [indiscernible]. We just don't give details by brand, but the reality is Costa has had a very nice recovery in Europe, and has set a strong performance in Asia. I will let David answer your exchange question.","David Bernstein","Yeah, as far as the various currencies, if you look at our revenue, roughly speaking, 50% is in U.S. dollars, something around a quarter of our revenue is in Euros. GBP is probably 12%, Aussie dollar 10%, and then everything else is just a few percentage -- should add up to the total. Tim, I don't have the EBITDA by currency, but you can always call Beth and she can give you some more detail after the call.","Tim Conder","Okay, great. And one last one David for you, on FX and the net cruise costs. You indicated that still you are looking at costs to be up roughly 3% with all the vessel enhancements, drydocks and scrubbers and everything. That's the guidance you guys gave 90 days ago, and with some of your costs denominated in foreign currencies, we would expect that to come down. Again, not to maybe lead the question here, but are we talking -- is that within the approximate 3%, and then you said 3% to a midpoint range, or is there -- have you all decided for 2015 to maybe spend a little bit more, the Super Bowl ad, or something else?","Arnold Donald","Let me make a quick comment before David answers; first of all, we have made progress against that 3%, we lost some of that progress when we sold the ship. But we got net positives from the sale of the ship, but the reality is, it was a drag on the cost side that David had added.","David Bernstein","There was a lot of changes in September and today, as Arnold indicated. And believe it or not, the sale of the Costa Celebration had an impact on 0.3 on the overall cost on a per ALBD basis. So that offset the total dollars and the savings flowed to the bottom line, but on a per ALBD calculation, we had less ALBDs, which made the percentage go up -- back up to the 3%.","Tim Conder","Okay, okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Assia Georgieva with Infinity Research. Please proceed.","Assia Georgieva","Good morning guys. Happy Holidays to you as well. I had one quick question on the Carnival brand. We have seen the recovery in the second half of the year, a lot of that was onboard and I think Arnold, you mentioned that we shouldn't be counting on that to continue indefinitely. Were there any other specific initiatives, or was it more demand and market related?","Arnold Donald","First of all, in terms of the onboard, we expect it to continue, I just don't want you guys locked in on a 5% run rate. We will work hard to do that in better, but we are not forecasting that kind of a run rate going forward. But we absolutely expect it to do better going forward, and the improvement is included in the plan. In terms of overall though, Carnival is on a very good track, and we are very pleased with that. I do want to answer your question specifically though so, if you want to restate part of it, I will.","Assia Georgieva","I guess my question is whether demand market -- while demand has improved in the back half of the year, or was it something that relates more specifically to the efforts you have made at this brand?","Arnold Donald","Well it\u2019s a combination too, if you ask an industry demand, certainly, because there was so much capacity in the Caribbean. Overall, the industry saw more people failing, and therefore by definition, there was increased demand. Our take of [ph] yield was up in that period, and we are forecasting it to be up certainly in the second, third and fourth quarters next year, helped by the fact that there will be significant capacity reduction late in the second quarter, going into the third quarter, but also helped by the performance of the brand itself, and then the overall efforts we have on the way, to create demand.","Assia Georgieva","Thank you, Arnold. That was helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Edward Stanford with Lazarus. Please proceed.","Edward Stanford","Good afternoon everybody. Good morning. Just a quick question please, on the impact of the additional fuel costs relating to ECA. Has that guidance changed at all, since you last update the market, or is it the same as it was before? Thank you.","Arnold Donald","The guidance is the same. We have mitigated what would have been a $0.35 a share impact, down to $0.10 for next year; and overtime that will disappear, that will be reduced in 2016 and all but gone in 2017.","Edward Stanford","Thank you very much.","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stuart Gordon with Berenberg. Please proceed.","Stuart Gordon","Yes good morning. I apologize. We actually have about five [indiscernible] from across the lake. Two questions please; the first one is, you spoke earlier, but you know one thing as to forecast onboard going at the same pace as it has done. Could you give us a better color and what kind of difference it would make to your guidance as it did? And the second question is, is on the returns, obviously we have seen the improvement this year, you're guiding for 1% improvement in 2015. But it appears if we take what you said at the third quarter, that without the change to fuel, actually returns into 2015 would have gone down. Was that your thinking at the third quarter, or has your outlook for 2015 tempered slightly since?","Arnold Donald","Okay. First of all, I hope that's really test, because you are still on the phone with us. For the second part, David go ahead.","David Bernstein","As far as the onboard is concerned, every percentage point increase in onboard revenue yields, is worth about $0.04 in 2015. So we were forecasting something in the range, we have included in the guidance of 2%. If it turns out to be 3%, then we got to pick up $0.04. And as far as the return on invested capital is concerned, I mean overall if you looked at the full year increase on the midpoint versus 2013, the midpoint of 2.45 you're talking about, a $0.49 or a $0.50 increase overall. Fuel and currency, net of both the transactional and translational impact was about a $0.41 increase. So we did have some operational increase, and that's the result of the 2% yields offset by the 3% costs. So there was other increases, putting aside the operational increase, which would have drove return on invested capital up.","Stuart Gordon","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And there are no questions at this time. I will turn the call back to you sir.","End of Q&A","Arnold Donald","Okay everyone, thank you very much. Happy Holidays, we are clearly excited about what we have going on here and we look forward to seeing you throughout the new year.","David Bernstein","Happy Holidays. Take a look at the commercials.","Arnold Donald","Yeah. Take a look at worldleadingcruiselines.com, look at the spots and get ready for the Super Bowl.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Investor Relations Officer.","Before David's comments, which we typically start the call with, Micky would like to make a few comments first. Micky?","Micky M. Arison","Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us today. As you can imagine, this has been a most difficult and challenging time for our corporation. We've all been deeply saddened by the Costa Concordia accident, and our thoughts and prayers are with the passengers, crew and family of those who were lost in this tragic accident. We are grateful to the Italian authorities and rescue workers who acted heroically following the accident and who continue to assist in the recovery process. We would also like to express our deepest appreciation to the local population of the island of Giglio and thank them for their generosity to those in need.","As to the Costa Concordia crew, I'd like to thank and recognize them for their tireless efforts to evacuate more than 4,000 passengers and crew from the ship that night. Not enough can be said about the work that the crew did to help our guests in the most challenging of conditions.","Before we walk through the financial impact to Costa Cruises and Carnival Corporation, I'd like to offer a couple of observations based on my experience. First, that the cruise industry remains incredibly safe and maintains one of the best safety records of any form of recreational travel in the world. The safety and security of our guests are job one, and we learn from everything we can from this incident and apply all lessons learned.","Thank you. And David will take you through the numbers. David?","David Bernstein","Thank you, Micky. Before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking. I will refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release. Also, all of my references to revenue and cost metrics will be in local currencies, unless otherwise noted, as this is a more useful measure of business trends.","Our non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter was $0.02. The first quarter came in $0.06 below the midpoint of our December guidance. The $0.06 shortfall from our December guidance was driven by $0.04 from the Costa Concordia incident expenses not covered by insurance and $0.04 from the impairment charge related to the Costa Allegra. All the other items netted out to a favorable $0.02 per share as higher-than-expected revenue yields and cost savings, including lower advertising expenses, more than offset $0.06 of higher fuel prices.","Now let's look at our first quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased almost 4%. Our North American brands grew over 4%, while our Europe, Australia and Asia brands or, as we call them, our EAA brands, grew almost 3%. Our total net revenue yields increased 2.9% in the first quarter, with net ticket revenue yields up 2.6% and net on board and other revenue yields up 3.7%.","With respect to our net ticket yields, the North American brands were up almost 5% as yields rebounded in the Caribbean, benefiting from the continuing recovery in the U.S. economy after absorbing a significant capacity increase last year. During the first quarter, the Caribbean represented 2\/3 of the North American brands' capacity.","Our EAA brands' net ticket yields were in line with the prior year, with their ships cruising in numerous regions throughout the world during the first quarter. For net on board and other yields, the 3.7% increase was also driven by our North American brands. While consistent with our expectations, our EAA brands were down, principally due to the challenging economic environment in Europe.","On the cost side, net cruise costs excluding fuel per available lower berth day were up over 6% versus the prior year. More than 1\/2 the increase was driven by the Costa Concordia incident expenses not covered by insurance and the impairment charge related to the Costa Allegra. The remaining increase was due to the higher number of dry-dock days and related costs in the first quarter, which we discussed on the December call.","As a result of our ongoing efforts to reduce fuel usage, our consumption per ALBD declined 2.5% this quarter, continuing our multiple-year savings trend. Fuel prices in the quarter were up 30%, which cost us an additional $0.18 per share.","In summary, the first quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.17 lower than 2011 earnings of $0.19 per share as increased yields were more than offset by higher dry-dock costs, higher fuel prices, the Costa Concordia incident expenses and the Costa Allegra impairment charge.","Excluded from our non-GAAP EPS but included in our GAAP loss per share were impairment charges of $173 million or $0.22 per share, relating to all of Ibero's goodwill and 60% of their trademarks. We believe it's more meaningful to exclude these non-cash charges from our non-GAAP EPS, given their non-recurring nature and the fact that we believe they are not an indication of our future earnings performance.","As we disclosed since 2010, we have been closely monitoring Ibero's intangibles, given the small amount of headroom in excess of its carrying value. At this time, given the state of Spain's economy, we slowed down the projected pace of Ibero's capacity growth in our discounted cash flow projections that are used to estimate Ibero's fair value, which primarily resulted in the impairment charge.","Now turning to our 2012 outlook. I will skip the net revenue yield outlook as Howard will discuss that shortly. On the cost side, for the full year, net cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD are forecasted to be flat versus the prior year. This is consistent with our December guidance, despite the $45 million of Costa Concordia incident expenses and the $34 million of Costa Allegra impairment charge, which increased the year-over-year cost metrics by 1.1 percentage points. Our operating companies identified opportunities in a number of areas to reduce costs, offsetting these items.","At this point, I will turn the call over to Howard.","Howard S. Frank","Thank you, David, and good morning again to everyone. I'm going to comment -- to make some comments on the outlook for 2012, talk a little bit more about the Costa situation.","While the Costa Concordia event has had a profound effect on our business and, indeed, the business of the entire cruise industry, as time passes, we are confident that our business will improve. Indeed, as I will comment on later, our North American brand booking patterns have improved during the last 7 weeks since the event in mid-January.","In Continental Europe, the impact of the event on the European market and our European businesses has been greater, and it seems that it will take more time for those markets to return to normal booking levels. We have, however, recently seen some positive trends in our European business, so we are hopeful that booking patterns will return to normal levels sooner than we might have originally expected.","As I comment on the business outlook for the remainder of 2012, for purposes of having more meaningful comparisons of booking trends fleet-wide and for the EAA markets, I will be excluding the Costa metrics. As we indicated in the press release, after the Concordia incident, Costa curtailed its marketing. In most markets, Costa has still not reestablished its marketing, although plans are underway to start these efforts over the next several weeks. I will comment separately on the Costa business later on in my talk as a separate matter.","On a fleet-wide basis excluding Costa, constant dollar revenue yield guidance is being lowered from December guidance by approximately 1.5% for 2012. As a result, revenue yields in 2012, excluding Costa, are now expected to be in line with 2011 yields.","As to the current status of bookings, on a fleet-wide basis, again, keep in mind I'm excluding Costa, occupancies for the remaining 3 quarters are lower than a year ago due to slightly higher prices. All my comments on pricing will be on a constant dollar basis as I go through my presentation this morning.","For North American brands, occupancies are slightly lower at slightly higher prices. And for EAA brands, occupancies are lower at higher prices again.","With respect to recent booking trends beginning in January, for the first 2 weeks of wave season, bookings were quite strong on a fleet-wide basis, driven by our North American brands, which experienced higher booking volumes and higher pricing year-over-year. EAA bookings were also higher year-over-year during the first 2 weeks of January at lower pricing. So even before the Costa incident, we continued to experience softer European pricing, which we attributed to the slowing Europe economies, together with the government austerity programs being implemented or expected to be implemented in many of the countries in Europe in which we market.","Since the Costa grounding incident in mid-January, the booking patterns for North America and for EAA brands have slowed significantly. On a fleet-wide basis, bookings for the last 7 weeks -- and, of course, this excludes Costa -- through March 4 are running lower year-over-year in the mid- to high-single digits at slightly lower pricing.","The week-to-week patterns have been uneven, with some weeks being stronger than others, partly resulting from the timing of marketing efforts by the brands.","For North American brands, booking volumes during the 7-week period have been lower in the mid-single digits range on a year-over-year basis at slightly lower prices. The weakest itineraries for the North American brands have been their European programs, which is a trend we began to see beginning last year, starting with the European sovereign debt and banking crisis and the problems in Greece. Higher airfares between North America and Europe have also been a challenge. North American brands also source a significant portion of their European cruise programs from the Europe market, so the economic slowdown in Europe has also affected the North American-brand European cruises.","For EAA brands, excluding Costa, booking volumes during the 7-week period on a year-over-year basis have been running lower in the mid-teens range and at lower prices. Our AIDA brand in Germany and our Ibero brand in Spain have felt the greatest impact during this period. Our U.K. brands are holding up relatively well as compared to our Continental European brands. We have recently seen trends in Germany so we are -- we have recently seen improving trends in Germany, so we are hopeful that we have finally turned the corner there as well.","Now let me turn to Costa. As most of you know, Costa has a worldwide sales and marketing network, with its primary source markets in Continental Europe, South America, North America and Asia. In recent years, it has also developed new markets in Eastern Europe. Since the grounding on January 13, Costa has not been marketing its cruises. Indeed, Costa offered the opportunity for passes booked on any Costa ship to cancel their cruise through February 7. There were, in fact, relatively few cancellations, which we consider to be a very positive sign. Where possible, passengers booked on future Concordia cruises were rebooked on other Costa Cruises. As a result, there was a considerable number of cancellations and rebookings in the Costa booking pattern, so it was difficult to get a clear picture of booking trends post the grounding.","Without any marketing, Costa's bookings during the first 4 weeks after the grounding ran approximately 80% to 90% lower on a year-over-year basis. More recently during the last 3 weeks to March 4, bookings ran 40% to 50% lower year-over-year. So with virtually no marketing, the booking picture is improving. As Costa begins to implement its marketing programs, which is already starting in certain markets, we expect their booking trends to gradually improve.","While certain of Costa's markets may take longer to come back, because of its broad marketing reach, Costa has the ability to source passengers from its other markets. However, estimates are that it will take up to a year before the booking trends start to normalize in some of its markets.","During this period, Costa has adopted a strategy in its primary markets to hold its pricing, even at the expense of lower occupancies in order to maintain an orderly market. For 2012, Costa is forecasting a loss for the year of approximately $100 million or a swing of $500 million from its previous earnings forecast. Most of this swing relates to reduced revenues, including the lost capacity from the Costa Concordia. It also includes approximately $27 million of one-time Concordia-related costs and $34 million relating to the Allegra incident, including the write-down of the value of the ship, which David mentioned before.","Having said all this, Costa is beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel, but it will take some time to get there. So there should be no doubt, we view Costa as a great company and a great brand, with a terrific management team and with a great future. Micky and I take this opportunity to thank Pier Foschi and the entire Costa management team for their most extraordinary efforts during this most difficult period.","Now let me turn to revised guidance. The midpoint of our revised non-GAAP guidance for the year of $1.55 per share is a reduction of $1.15 from our December guidance of $2.70. That was the midpoint of our guidance. Included in the $1.15 of guidance reduction is $0.65, which represents the decline in Costa's earnings, of which I mentioned before, of which $0.08 is one-time cost.","The reduction of our other North American and Europe EAA brand revenue yield forecast amounts to $0.19. Higher fuel prices for all these other brands net of currency from that used in the December guidance is forecasted to reduce earnings by $0.40. And there is a net benefit from other items, mostly reduced cost of approximately $0.09 a share, which gets us to the $1.15. So apart from the increase in fuel prices, our other brands' earnings are lower by approximately $0.10 per share from the December guidance.","Now I'll move on to give you some colors by each of the quarters. Turning to the second quarter -- and when I give you this data, it is now x Costa -- fleet-wide capacity for the second quarter is up 2.7%, 2.9% for North America brands and 2.2% for EAA brands. At the present time, on a fleet-wide basis, pricing is slightly higher than a year ago at slightly lower occupancies versus last year.","North American brand fleet-wide pricing is higher than a year ago at flat occupancies. North American brands are 56% in the Caribbean, approximately the same as last year, with the balance in various other itineraries. Caribbean pricing is nicely higher than a year ago at approximately the same occupancy levels as last year. Pricing for all other itineraries taken together is higher than a year ago at slightly lower occupancies.","EAA brand fleet-wide pricing, excluding Costa, is slightly lower than a year ago on lower occupancies. EAA brands are 50% in Europe, slightly up from 47% last year, with the balance in various other itineraries. EAA brand European pricing is up slightly versus a year ago on lower occupancies. EAA pricing on all other itineraries taken together is lower than last year, also at lower occupancies.","On an overall basis, we are currently forecasting that constant dollar revenue yields will be flat to down slightly for the second quarter, slightly higher in North America, slightly lower for EAA.","For the second quarter guidance, we are guiding earnings in the range of $0.05 to $0.09, or a midpoint of $0.07. This is versus $0.26 in the second quarter of 2011. Swing in earnings for the second quarter of -- from the second quarter of 2011 is primarily due to the Costa impact of about $0.12 a share and higher fuel costs of about $0.10 a share.","Now turning to the third quarter. Capacity is expected to be up in the 2.9% range, 3.4% in North America, 2.2% in EAA. On a fleet-wide basis, third quarter pricing is higher than a year ago on lower occupancies. North American brand pricing is slightly higher than a year ago at lower occupancies. North American brand capacity in the third quarter is 38% in the Caribbean, slightly higher than a year ago; 24% in Alaska, the same, slightly higher; and 25% in Europe, which was about the same as last year.","Pricing for Caribbean itineraries is higher than a year ago, with pricing for Alaska and Europe cruises flat with last year. Occupancies for the Caribbean and Alaska cruises are slightly lower versus last year, and occupancies for Europe cruises are lower than last year.","For EAA brands, pricing is nicely higher than a year ago at lower occupancies. EAA brand capacity is 85% in Europe itineraries, which is slightly up from 82% the prior year. EAA brand constant dollar pricing for European and all other itineraries is higher than a year ago on lower occupancies.","Now turning to the fourth quarter. Fleet-wide capacity in the fourth quarter is expected to be 2.9% higher than last year, 3.7% for North America brands, 1.7% for EAA brands. This, of course, excludes Costa. Fleet-wide pricing is slightly higher than a year ago at lower occupancies. Much business remains to be booked for the fourth quarter, so I caution not to read too much into this information.","North American brand pricing in the fourth quarter is flat versus last year at lower occupancies. North American brands are 43% in the Caribbean, slightly higher than a year ago, 13% in Europe, which is about the same as the past year, with the balance in various other itineraries. Caribbean pricing is higher than a year ago at higher occupancies. Europe pricing is also higher versus last year at lower occupancies, and pricing for all other itineraries taken together is higher than a year ago on lower occupancies.","Turning to EAA. EAA pricing, which is the EAA brands of 61% in Europe itineraries, is nicely higher versus the year ago at lower occupancies. So that kind of wraps up the current status of the booking picture for 2012. And I think, with that, Kayla, I think we can open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays Capital.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","In the release -- and I guess this should be directed to Micky but also, Howard -- your comment on price discounting was interesting, especially since occupancies are lagging in almost every quarter. I'm just wondering, are you actually seeing improvement fast enough to make you comfortable that customers won't need a little nudge, especially in Europe, given how that's also lagging?","Micky M. Arison","I don't know what you mean by a little nudge. But I think...","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well, I guess what I mean is a little stimulation.","Micky M. Arison","I'm kidding, Felicia. I guess what we're saying is that our brands -- and we're obviously comfortable with what we're saying here. And the reality is, all we're saying is that marketing efforts, discounting, et cetera, to achieve our yields forecast will not be greater than last year or shouldn't be greater than last year. But that's not to say there wasn't incentive for booking last year as well. So it's not that marketing activities won't continue. It's not that -- but we're very comfortable with this forecast based on the information we have to date, and we believe that they're very achievable. And we'll do what marketing efforts we need to do to get it done. Clearly, the pattern is -- has been positive as we get further away from the incident.","Howard S. Frank","I think as we've emerged from this period, and based on a lot of the surveys we've done in different markets, not in all markets, certainly not in certain European markets, the issue of the Concordia incident has really fallen away as a major obstacle for selling cruises. So it's come back to great value, great vacations. And our guys, really apart from the Costa situation, feel that things are getting better. So that -- the close-in patterns are good, which is not necessarily always good for us. We like to see further out booking patterns, and I think that's going to start to happen as business gets stronger closer in, then bookings get pushed out and pricing gets -- becomes more sustainable. So I think they're feeling pretty good about the situation, and we're not totally out of the woods. I don't want to suggest that. But certainly, the trending seems to be quite positive right now.","Micky M. Arison","I think Howard's point is a good point. We've done consumer surveys now in all our major markets, and all our brands are doing them. And by far, the #1 reason why people are holding out is not safety. Safety is way down the list. There is a clear recognition that this is a very, very safe industry. The #1, consistently across-the-board, is that expectation that prices are getting lower. And at this point, there's no reason to believe that's going to be the case versus last year. And hopefully, as people realize it, they'll come off the fence and book their vacations.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's actually very, very helpful color. I appreciate that. And then just on Europe and kind of in line with your answer there, obviously, there's weakness coming from North American-sourced consumer. You mentioned airfare among some other things, but what can you do to offset that airfare issue as a gating factor for the North American consumer who might want a cruise in Europe but who's kind of getting some sticker shock?","Micky M. Arison","Well, they can take Queen Mary 2.","Howard S. Frank","No. I mean, they're -- look, our guys are pretty creative when it comes to the marketing side, and they are taking actions to strengthen the booking pattern for European cruises, and they're doing it in various ways. Each brand does it uniquely different than the other. They don't like -- they don't copy each other necessarily. So we're seeing bookings in Europe. It's just -- it has been slow, and it's going to be -- it's probably not going to be our best year in Europe and -- but I think that they will be creative. We haven't added a huge amount of capacity, North American brands to the European programs this year. It is up some, but not a whole lot.","Beth Roberts","5%.","Howard S. Frank","5%.","Micky M. Arison","By the way, I was only partially kidding. Because as airfares across the Atlantic get higher, Queen Mary 2 gets to be a greater and greater value. And it's the best way to go to Europe or back.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Then you'd have to take 2 cruises.","Howard S. Frank","Absolutely.","Micky M. Arison","And you need...","Howard S. Frank","Nothing wrong with that, but the food is so much better.","Operator","Our next question comes on the line of Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I wonder, given that it's kind of a departure to have occupancy down, and obviously, it's to protect the brand, does it make sense at some point to take some Costa ships out of service to eliminate the operating expense while the occupancy is down?","Micky M. Arison","Yes. I want to at least have the opportunity to clarify that comment about occupancy with Costa. It's clearly a short-term tactic based on present information and the fact that Costa, in many of its markets, still is not doing any advertising. So it's the reality of the situation. It's a tactic. As soon as that changes, as soon as they are comfortable from a PR point of view to start marketing, they will do that and hopefully bring this occupancy up. But our forecasts are built on the concept that the majority of their yield deterioration will be occupancy.","Howard S. Frank","Right. And just let me comment further that a lot of the occupancy loss is occurring now. So on a shorter time frame, we'll see a greater proportion of the occupancy loss. Longer term, further out, we shouldn't have much occupancy loss on any of the brands. And then just one more point on the issue of looking at other possibilities, I mean, clearly, the company -- because it has a unique ability to source in so many different markets, it is looking further out and into 2013 at their itineraries, currently, and will make some adjustments indeed, I think, for this winter. This coming winter, they're moving another ship to the South American market, to the Brazil and Argentina zones.","Micky M. Arison","Brazil.","David Bernstein","We did, by the way, think about and look at laying up ships. But because of the disruptive nature and the short-term nature of the occupancy decline, we don't believe that, that would make sense for the long-term strength of the brand.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. And then I wonder if you can give a little bit of color. You talked about some of the sequential year-over-year changes for the Costa brand, seeing how that had improved from the initial weeks. Can you give a little bit of color on the change for North American brands or company-wide x Costa? You mentioned down mid- to high-single digits, and that sounded like a cumulative change over the 7 weeks, but just to get some sense of how that trended from week 1 through week 7.","Howard S. Frank","Yes. I think for North America, what we're seeing is actually a little bit of surprise. The contemporary brand Carnival seems to be performing stronger than their premium brands and -- but I think part of the premium brand issue as we read through it is also these European cruises this spring, summer and fall. But Carnival, we thought there would be more of a first-timer issue. They seem to have come through this quite nicely right now. And first timers appear to be, from everything they can see because their bookings have been up recently, that first timers -- we don't have the data specifically on first timers. It's too early, but it looks like Carnival Cruise Lines will not have any kind of a problem. For Holland America, Princess and even Seabourn, they're doing fine, except for these European cruises, and they're doing all they can to try to shore that up right now. But Alaska seems to be okay. Their Caribbean programs are fine. All their other long-term programs are fine. So I think that's sort of the North America situation. And it has gotten stronger each week. As I say, it's a little bit uneven, depending on how much marketing they're doing. But each week, the pattern is getting stronger and stronger.","Micky M. Arison","It's interesting because the perception out there was that Carnival Cruise Lines, because they have more first timers and more North America and because of the name recognition, vis-\u00e0-vis Costa, would be most impacted. But in reality, they've been the least impacted. And in fact, their business is up year-over-year. And they're our best performing brand right now on a year-over-year basis.","David Bernstein","Looking at the North American brand specifically, I mean, shortly after the incident, they started down in the double-digits, and they improved considerably. As Howard mentioned in his notes, it varies week by week, depending on the marketing activities of each brand. But it is, overall, a general positive trend into the low-single digits.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So in other words -- that\u2019s what I was trying to clarify. If the down mid- to high-single digits is cumulative, and it was initially down double-digits, are the last sort of 2 weeks or so down -- it sounds like you're saying it\u2019s down less than 5% year-over-year?","Howard S. Frank","It's really -- I'd rather give you overall -- you\u2019re really looking at it on a rolling basis because the weeks can be very uneven. But they are getting positive, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can we just talk a little bit about the $173 million charge related to Ibero goodwill and trademark? I guess I don't completely understand it because by taking the charge, and you're saying slower-than-anticipated capacity growth due to the current state of the Spanish economy, does that essentially assume that you think the Spanish economy will be weak forever? That's the way I read that write-off and how you're able to do it. And then...","Micky M. Arison","Can I answer that question first?","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sure guys. Sure.","Micky M. Arison","The reality is the way this is done -- and maybe David can explain it better than I can. It's a long-term model, and in that long-term model, we had projections of moving ships into the brand and growing the brand over time. In reality, over the last 12 months, we have reduced capacity by moving the Grand Voyager out of the brand, and our competitors, Pullmantur, have also pulled capacity out of the marketplace. So was it realistic to continue to assume that we're just going to add capacity when we're actually reducing capacity? And so when we pulled that capacity out of the model, it required this write-off. David...","David Bernstein","Correct. Yes. We just basically slowed down the future growth of capacity. We still believe in the Spanish market longer term. But at the moment, I think we've said a number of times that Ibero was struggling as a result of the economy. I think the unemployment rate is still like 20% in Spain. And as a result of that, we felt this was the right thing to do.","Howard S. Frank","Yes. I mean, I think, Steve, it's going to take longer. I think we felt it's going to take longer for the Spanish economy to return to reasonable levels of strength so that -- it was hard to justify today, that 3 or 5 years, whenever we're adding a ship, would happen. We just -- with a marginal call on the goodwill for a while, we were covered with this additional capacity 3, 5 years out. But once we took that capacity out of the model and it was difficult for us to support it internally, we just felt uncomfortable with it, that let's just take it out and take the charge so we don't have to deal with it later on. It doesn't mean we wouldn't add that capacity later on if the market supported it. And clearly, we think the Spanish market will come back, but it may take a few more years than we originally thought. That's clearly seems to be what people are saying.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess I just -- if you did add capacity back on, then what's the accounting for it? I mean, if you decided to do that in 2 years?","David Bernstein","There's no change. You can't write back up goodwill.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's what I thought. Okay. So then the second issue is, just on Costa, I think it was you, Howard, who had said that you thought it would come back in 1 year or -- that was your number. What was -- or your time frame. What's giving you the confidence that it's 1 year and not 6 months or 3 years?","Howard S. Frank","Well, there's been a lot of -- when I said -- let me get into that. When I said come back, I said, for most markets, the pattern should start to -- they expect the patterns should start to normalize in about a year. Now what -- all the work and research have been -- huge amount of research done over in Europe by Costa on the process by which -- how this is going to happen, using benchmarks from other companies had in crisis situations. I think that -- while there's nothing that says that this pattern's going to follow those patterns, there is a feeling that on many of the major -- and by the way, we're starting to see -- many of Costa's markets are coming back already and starting to show some normalization, but they're not the major markets. The major markets for Costa will be Germany, Italy of course, France and Spain. We're seeing evidence in France and Spain, actually, of their business coming back already, less so in Italy and Germany. But we need Italy and Germany. Italy for sure, and...","Micky M. Arison","Actually, Germany had a good week last week, but 1 week is not...","Howard S. Frank","Yes. Italy, for sure, is going to be the major challenge. But I think the feeling is that 1 year from now, based on these very smart people who seem to have been through this before and the sense of the positive trending we're starting to see now without any marketing out there, that we should get back to more normal booking levels. Where the pricing -- I think -- I'm not sure pricing will come back to the same levels, but we'll see. But I think we'll gradually come out of this in '13. I think '13 should -- obviously will show an improvement over '12, but it may take 1 year or 2 to get back to the kind of profitability that we expected to have in 2012.","Micky M. Arison","And obviously -- it's blatantly obvious, but from 1 year ago, Costa's capacity now will be down 3 ships with -- they sold the Costa Marina, the Concordia and, now, the Allegra. So their capacity is 3 ships less than we would have expected in '13.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura.","Harry Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just a clarification and then a bigger-picture question. So in your comments, you mentioned that Costa has swung about $500 million in profitability to a loss of $100 million. About how much of that -- how much is that on an earnings basis? And is that -- that's embedded in your 2012 guidance?","Howard S. Frank","Yes. I mean -- yes, that's all in -- what I was trying to do was explain the major reduction in guidance, and that represented $0.65 of the $1.15 in lower guidance, Harry.","Harry Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then just a 30,000-foot question. In the hotel industry, there's an adage that the industry doesn't really know if it's overbuilt until it builds one room too many, and that's a topic that probably applies to the cruise industry as well. And my question is, is it overbuilt? Should the industry really be adding any capacity here?","Micky M. Arison","We're still -- you can go back to the normal stuff. We're still a very, very small piece of the vacation market. And the reality of the growth potential in many of our markets is still very big. And we've said that we're growing at a much, much slower pace, 2 to 3 ships a year, and we've also said that the 2 or 3 ships a year will not be all incremental capacity because some of the older ships will be sold and taken out of the fleet. And in fact, the Allegra was for sale, and we had anticipated taking her out of the fleet as soon as we had a buyer. So the growth rate will be coming down, but I still think there's plenty of growth potential in this industry. Remember, unlike the hotel industry, we operate at full occupancy. Hotel industry operates at 70% or 75% occupancy.","David Bernstein","And with 2 to 3 ships a year, if you net out some sales as Micky mentioned, you're really probably only talking about a 3% or 4% capacity growth, which was really in line with the population growth in many of the markets and where we operate. And actually, it is less than the growth of the, let's say, the 45-plus age population growth in many of the markets we're operating. So we feel that we have slowed down the capacity growth in line with our overall marketplace.","Harry Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","But as a practical matter, the industry through the cycle has really only averaged maybe just over 1% yield growth, and that's not going to drive your return on invested capital. I think you've got to get your pricing higher to do that. And so has there been any consideration that the 2 to 3 ships a year should really be a lower number?","David Bernstein","But keep in mind, Harry, the 1% you're talking about is in a period of time where you're talking about a high-single digit, and in many cases, double-digit capacity growth. And so now, we're talking about low-single-digit capacity growth. And the reason we changed the strategy was for the very point you mentioned, in the hopes that we wouldn't necessarily have to discount the cruises as much compared to other vacation alternatives. We could begin to close the gap, get a little bit more pricing power and improve our return on investments.","Howard S. Frank","There's no question, we agree with you, that the product deserves much higher yield growth and, hopefully, in the future, we'll see it. But we have gone through a financial crisis, and I won't go through the whole litany of stuff. But the reality is that we believe, with the slower capacity growth, that in a normalized period of time, we can get significantly higher yield growth. And historically, we haven't had cost growth so that the returns could return.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","As you look out to 2013, I'm assuming, if you kind of even exclude the Costa line, that things will be normalized by then. And if that's the case, would you actually expect maybe even a greater bump up in terms of the growth rate, in terms of whether it's bookings or net yields, just because you face really easy comparisons from -- you'll face easy comparisons from 2012?","Howard S. Frank","Greg, the one thing I will agree with you on is the comparisons will be easier for 2012. I hate to get into talking about 2013 just yet. I think it's still early. But clearly, the comparisons will be easier. I think we like -- look, I think we've got a great business. I think we like -- we got our strong brand positionings in each of the major markets. When we started the year, this year, the first 2 weeks of January, where I mentioned our business was quite strong, our bookings were up, our pricing was up, especially in North America, we were feeling that this could be a very, very strong year, and then this event came along. So yes, I think 2013, absent exogenous events that -- and the European economy going into a real tailspin, we're doing okay. Even the U.K. market -- North America looks fine to us, actually. U.K. market, even with all this noise out there, is coming right -- it's coming through very nicely right now and with very little sign that the incident is affecting their business at all right now. And so we feel good about that, and we know Germany's going to come back. The AIDA brand is an amazing brand with an amazing management team, very talented people running it and the strongest position in the German market. And Costa, we think it's going to go through a little bit of pain this year and a little bit less pain in 2013, but it clearly will be better. And so I think the future is bright for us. I really feel good about the business right now.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just kind of keeping on the theme -- I mean -- so when you look at your price versus occupancy, how do you look at that? Because, I guess, in -- next year, it's a lot harder to recover if you start discounting now. So are you thinking maybe even give up a little bit of occupancy because then it's easier to kind of work off the pricing base that you'll have in 2012?","Micky M. Arison","Our long-term strategy on occupancy and price has not changed. Our discussion about giving occupancy in Costa is a short-term tactical situation based on present events. But you should expect that our long-term strategy, which we believe is the way to maximize profitability, has not changed.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","First of all, just a clarification. The $30 million, roughly, deductible, or right about that amount for the ship, where is that included in relation to the whole comments regarding Costa? So just a clarification from that standpoint. And I guess the other one also, if you would have the capacity by quarters, inclusive of Costa? And then I guess more of a real question here too. Given that Costa, the Carnival brand and AIDA appear to be your most profitable brands, and the Carnival brand, you've already commented on, what it's doing; and then AIDA, as AIDA starts to come back, how much of a recovery, I guess, have you built into your expectations for this year for the AIDA brand in 2012 from the present levels?","David Bernstein","Okay. Well, let me start with the $30 million deductible relating to the Costa Concordia. At the time we put that into the 10-K, it wasn't clear what the end result of the ship would be. Now that it's been declared a constructive total loss, the deductible no longer applies. It's just a part of the overall policy. And therefore, that $30 million disappeared from the financial analysis. As far as the capacity by quarter, let's see. The total capacity, we\u2019re up 3.7% in the first quarter; 2.7%, second; 2.9%, third; 2.9%, fourth; and 3.0% for the full year.","Howard S. Frank","That includes Costa.","David Bernstein","And that includes Costa, yes.","Howard S. Frank","On the AIDA question, Tim, I think they've taken down their revenue yields as a result of these -- this hit. This interim hit. But they see the business coming back so their -- but they have -- for purposes of our forecast, they have taken down their revenue yields as a result of the incident. But I think that they're starting to see business come back. But there will be some level of hit because they've taken -- in order to fill close-in, they've had to take pricing down a little bit.","Micky M. Arison","I think last week, they were up year-over-year for the first time. So that was very encouraging.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","On the bookings, Micky?","Micky M. Arison","Yes, yes.","Howard S. Frank","Correct.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then I guess my other question is back to more, let's call it, normal state of affairs, one of the prior questions related to the slower capacity and so forth. Yes, you've had some good cost leverage and a good history of doing that. Do you still feel comfortable of maintaining that -- I guess you'd said before roughly 1\/2 the rate of inflation or so, with the lower capacity growth as you look out into '13, '14 and '15 at this point.","David Bernstein","We've consistently said flat to 1\/2 of inflation. And the reason we're comfortable with that is because we are working on quite a number of things. We have a corporate group. We\u2019ve got a profit improvement program. They've got lots of different things going on. The gold mine of opportunity for us is the continuation of the brands working together to leverage our size, to work through collectively in order to save money. And we've been working on that extensively over the last couple of years, and that gold mine of opportunity is far from completely harvested at this point.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And if I may, one...","David Bernstein","Short answer is yes.","Howard S. Frank","Answer is yes.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay. One last clarification. The Allegra, at this point, scrap? Or can it be recovered and then eventually sold as you were originally planning?","Micky M. Arison","Yes. I mean, we've written her down because it was our intent to -- it is not our intent to put her back into service, and we believe that the repair cost will be more than we'd want to spend to put her back in service. Whether we sell her or scrap her, that decision hasn't been made yet. We have to get a full cost of what it will take to repair her. She's on the market for sale, she has been, but we're going to have to obviously reduce the price of the ship for sale, and we\u2019ll see what happens.","Howard S. Frank","In the last year or so, there have been a couple of different groups expressing an interest in that ship.","Micky M. Arison","We've written her down to a level that we feel comfortable that we'll be able to get at least that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski with Stifel.","Steven M. Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered, but just going back to the expense question, David, I guess when we look at your expense forecast now, I'm pretty surprised it's essentially still flat from where it was back in December. And you talked about that you guys identified some expenses that you can cut out. Can you just walk us through just where those are coming from or maybe what buckets those are coming out of? And then does your expense forecast include anything in terms of higher cost for whether it's safety standards or insurance deductibles or anything like that?","David Bernstein","Yes. We looked at every single line item. To start with, on the advertising front, I mean, we had talked about the fact that advertising was down in the first quarter because all the brands essentially stopped advertising for some period of time after the event. We do expect to spend most of that money in the remainder of the year, but probably not all of it. So some of it came in the form of advertising. We looked through the G&A expenses, travel, training, cutting back in all areas that weren't essential. All of the operating companies' CEOs talked to their people and identified numerous items relating to ship operating expenses that could be saved without impacting the product. And one other item is we built our forecast early in the year on inflation assumptions. And what we noticed was, in the first 3 months of the year, our inflation assumptions were a little high, so we brought them down for the back half of the year. And as a result of the lower expectations, we were able to reduce costs in the remaining 3 quarters to cover some of those one-time expenses we talked about.","Howard S. Frank","I guess just a clarification, just probably because I'm more sensitive to it than some other people. But when David talks about saving on training, the focus is on hotel training, not safety training, not emergency training. Just hotel and that sort of stuff.","David Bernstein","Mostly shore and shore-side training.","Micky M. Arison","Just to finish up on the issue of potential regulations, clearly, this is something that, with the safety group that we have, both internally and with CLIA, those recommendations, when found, would go to the IMO. And if they think that we can institute immediately, we would obviously do that like we did with the muster drill change that we did with CLIA. But anything that was more structural or anything like that, that would be costly would have to go through the IMO process that would take quite some time. So it's not something that would be in our '13 expectations -- our '12 expectations, sorry.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Assia Georgieva with Infinity Research.","Assia Georgieva","Howard, I wanted to ask for a clarification. When you gave Q3 and Q4 outlooks, those were without Costa. Is that correct?","Howard S. Frank","Yes. And I didn't give -- actually, it wasn't the outlook. It was really the current status of bookings, and it was without Costa, x Costa.","Assia Georgieva","Would you be able to give us that type of color on Costa only?","Howard S. Frank","I think the issue with Costa is that since it's -- everything related to what that company is going to do this year is going to be such a one-off situation that to try to -- and even speculating on the situation or giving you data points, I don't think is worthwhile information. Let's just look at it for this year as a very challenging year, a rebuilding process, a retooling process, a remarketing process. So when you're not looking -- when you don't have marketing out there, your websites aren't doing any marketing. Even your basic website is difficult to market on today. Giving you information like that, I think, wouldn\u2019t enable you to get a sense as to what the real business is doing. That's why I chose to say -- look, this is what the profit we expected it to be, this is what the profit loss is going to be, this is the swing, and let's look forward to 2013.","Assia Georgieva","Okay, fair enough. Going back to the state of affairs for Q3, and again, I guess, excluding Costa at this point, do you -- have you built any upside on a year-on-year basis, given that in April and May we are entering much easier comparisons when we had the Arab Spring and the Japan earthquake events impacting bookings in the year-ago period? Is that built into your Q3 forecast? Or are you waiting to anniversary it and then see how it goes?","Micky M. Arison","Our forecast is built on what our brand's booking patterns are now and what they perceive they will wind up with at the end of the year. And then we look at it for reasonability. And I think, based on everything that's happened, everybody's a bit conservative. But obviously, it's our best shot at where we're going to wind up. And historically, we've done a pretty good job of that. Obviously, this is the unique set of circumstances, and that's why the ranges are a little broader. But I don't think it has anything to do with last year. I think it's based on what we're seeing right now and what the perception is going forward and where we're going to wind up.","Howard S. Frank","And remember, the MENA effect last year was mostly within Costa. A large portion of the cost of MENA was actually in the Costa brand. So most of the other brands, I think, are marginally affected by MENA, but not to a great degree.","Micky M. Arison","Yes. The 300 itinerary changes that were made last year because of MENA were virtually all Costa.","Howard S. Frank","And maybe that's why you were interested in Costa, Assia. I mean, I don't know, but yes.","Assia Georgieva","Well, partly because of that, and also just to get more of a sense as to how you expect their booking patterns to recover over time, since you gave us the breakdown the first 4 weeks -- the most recent 3 weeks. I thought that would be interesting. And again, one last question. Any update on the time frame for the removal of the Concordia hull at this point? Or are you still waiting on bids to actually finalize plans?","Howard S. Frank","Well, one of the challenges, I think, is going to be the salvage of that ship. Salvage bids just came in earlier this month, and they\u2019re being evaluated right now. Realistically though, I mean -- and that's one of the challenges Costa's going to have -- we don't expect -- it's going to be a unique salvage. It's never been done in this order of magnitude. So there's a lot of planning and engineering that needs to go into it and probably building some unique tools to do it with. And it's realistic to think that the process -- what they're saying right now is we shouldn't expect the salvage process to begin until after the summer. So it could be there for quite some time, the hull of the ship.","Assia Georgieva","And I imagine winter -- yes, go ahead David.","David Bernstein","Yes. No, Costa did indicate in a press release this morning that because of the complexity, they do expect the duration to be 10 to 12 months overall.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Can you guys talk a little bit about how the incentives have changed, the level of them year-over-year, and maybe how that might impact onboard spending in the next quarter or 2? And then also if you have any more color on Alaska, that would be really helpful. I think -- I'm not sure if I recall correctly, but I think it sounded a little bit more positive on last quarter's call.","David Bernstein","Jaime, when you say -- you said the level of incentives, you're talking about the pricing?","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Well, yes, the pricing and what you guys are using to get people onboard, whether that's onboard credits or some sort of program like that to incentivize them.","David Bernstein","Well, overall, I mean, all our brands, depending on the marketplace and the itinerary, in some cases, it's pricing. In some cases, it's an upgrade. In some cases, it's an onboard credit. Our brands are very creative, and they do what works in each situation. So there's a little bit of everything thrown in across all of the brands around the world. As far as the onboard spend is concerned, Howard did indicate that excluding Costa, he expected the prices overall for the year to be in line with the prior year. So taking a look at that, we weren't necessarily expecting a significant change, and we built into our onboard revenue forecast an increase. We actually had -- excluding Costa, we probably had about 1.5 points of yield increase on the onboard side in the December guidance. The first quarter came in much more than we had anticipated, and so we did build in a little bit of an increase in those numbers for the remainder of the year. So we are seeing some good onboard spend increases. All of the categories are up, all the major categories, including casino in the first quarter. I was quite pleased by that.","Howard S. Frank","On the Alaska question, Jaime, I don\u2019t remember what actually -- what we actually said on Alaska. I think Alaska's been pretty consistent and solid. Not spectacular. But I think -- if anything, I think it may -- the picture maybe look a little bit better, maybe at the expense of Europe for all I know. But I mean -- people doing more Alaska cruises than Europe cruises because of the cost of Europe cruises going up. But Alaska seems to be doing okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Rollo with Morgan Stanley.","Jamie Rollo - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I've got a couple of questions on yields. First of all, on Costa, you're saying it has a 2- to 4-percentage-point impact on group yield, which applies Costa yields down 15% to 25% or so. But then you also said bookings are down, I think you said, 40% to 50% of the last 4 weeks. That seems to imply quite a sharp recovery over the next few months. And then the other question was -- I'm just interested in trying to strip out the sort of noise post-Concordia and what sort of trajectory you were on. In ways, you said it started well. Your onboards are better. Royal was guiding originally to 2% to 4% underlying. I'm just wondering whether you would have increased your original yield guidance of 1% to 2%.","David Bernstein","Okay. Well, as far as Costa's concerned, Jamie -- I mean, you're right. The math -- the way the math works since it's 15% of our capacity, that 15% to 25% range makes sense. One thing to keep in mind that we talked about is the majority of that is going to come in the form of occupancy when you're talking about yield decline. So at the moment, Costa's behind in terms of bookings in the high-single digits. So they can continue to be behind on a year-over-year basis considerably to wind up with a 15% to 25% occupancy decline -- or yield decline, most of it coming from occupancy. This isn't a situation where Costa has to catch up. It's not a zero-sum game. They don't have to exceed last year's booking patterns in order to make this guidance. So it's a little bit different from that perspective. As far as the full year guidance is concerned, we did exceed the guidance in the first quarter. It was 1.5% to 2.5%. We came in at 2.9%. So the year was starting off strongly. We're very pleased. I think Micky indicated that before. So I'd like to believe we might have increased it, but it's very hard to say at this point what would have happened.","Howard S. Frank","I'm not sure if I said this, but [indiscernible] is asking me this question. But North America brands for that first 2 weeks of January were up in the mid-teens levels in terms of bookings. So it was off to -- we were off to a very, very positive start for North America.","Micky M. Arison","Even the booking period over the holidays, which is normally extremely quiet, was very strong this year. So we were very encouraged up until January 13.","Jamie Rollo - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And if I could just follow up on Costa. Are you absolutely confident in the future of the brand? Is there any risk it does need a sort of rebranding or anything like that? And also, what's the goodwill for Costa please?","Howard S. Frank","We are totally confident in the brand. I mean, it's a global brand. All the surveys we've done so far, whether they're in Continental Europe or other markets, indicate that the issue, certainly in other markets, is becoming less and less of an issue, the incident itself. Business has picked up in these other markets, and we're forecasting that it will take time in the Central European markets or primary European markets to get back to normal. But there's no reason -- I think people, even in Italy, are seeing this as a one-time freak event and don't see it as a fundamental issue with the company or the brand or the management or the safety of the ships. It's just a very unfortunate incident, and most of the polls seem to support that notion, so -- and are getting better and better on the issue. So we think it's going to come back fairly -- take 1 year, 2 to come back, but it's going to come back.","David Bernstein","Jamie, we don't have the goodwill for Costa with us, but you can call Beth after the call. I'm sure she can fill you in on some of the details. I will say that when we last did the Costa goodwill test, which we did -- we do every July, there was a considerable amount of headroom. And our expectation is that the brand will be rebuilt, and it will perform, and so we're not concerned about a goodwill impairment in relation to Costa.","Micky M. Arison","One of the encouraging things is -- obviously, Italy is the biggest issue. And our surveys -- we've done extensive surveys in Italy. And the encouraging thing is that the Italian consumer continues to view Costa as a great vacation option and a terrific vacation value. When the majority of the population feels that way, you feel very strongly that once we get past this, they're going to want to experience the product because that's the way they feel right now. So wherever -- there's no question that Costa's going to come back and come back stronger than ever over the long term.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","On the comment about the $3.3 billion of free cash flow, which includes, I guess, $0.5 billion of insurance proceeds, that just about covers the capital investment and the quarterly dividend as it currently is. Are you signaling you're unlikely to return additional cash to shareholders this year, please?","Micky M. Arison","We're not trying to signal anything. We're just trying to give the facts as they are. We weren't trying to signal anything.","Howard S. Frank","Just that [ph] there would be no need to go to the markets to borrow any money in the banks. And our cash flows will cover our dividend, as well as our capital cost for the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Edward Stanford with Oriel Securities.","Edward Stanford - Oriel Securities Ltd., Research Division","Just one question, if I may, picking up on your comments just now on the dividend. Should we read anything into your declaration of the dividend post the Concordia incident? And how does that fit relative to guidance in your 30% to 40% payout ratio plans, please?","David Bernstein","I think, overall, we said in the long term the 30% to 40% was our target. But the reason we chose the 30% to 40% was because we believe that, that was sustainable through all cycles. This is a cycle, and therefore, we're -- we believe the dividend is sustainable until the earnings comes back.","Micky M. Arison","And that was kind of -- I mean, that's what we have pointed out in the press release, that the cash flow is sufficient to cover all our CapEx and the dividend.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ian Rennardson with Jefferies & Company.","Ian Rennardson - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","It's Ian Rennardson of Jefferies. I just have one final question. Are you comfortable that your insurance will cover all eventualities?","Howard S. Frank","Yes, we're comfortable.","David Bernstein","Yes.","Micky M. Arison","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Liebowitz with Horizon Kinetics.","David Liebowitz - Horizon Kinetics LLC","First, when will the Italian Naval Board issue their report?","Micky M. Arison","We have no idea. No. Italy is Italy, and they're going through their process. We're cooperating in every way we can.","Howard S. Frank","You mean the Coast Guard or Naval? Or Coast Guard?","David Liebowitz - Horizon Kinetics LLC","Well, whatever the point of inquiry is, are we talking then something, let's say, by June or October? I mean do you have...","Howard S. Frank","No, I suspect that -- look, I don't know which particular -- there are a number of different organizations regulatory-wise looking at the incident and probably will do some -- their own evaluations. There's also a prosecution -- ongoing question of prosecution for the -- against certain people or potentially the company. But we don't think that's going to happen relative to the event. That could go on for quite some time in Italy, as Micky indicates.","David Liebowitz - Horizon Kinetics LLC","Well, second, how are we doing with our -- if not hedging whatever contractual arrangements we're making for fuel for the balance of this year?","Micky M. Arison","I think David went over that. You want to...","David Bernstein","Yes. It's in the press release. We've got the table for the back half of 2012, as well as '13, '14, and '15 where 20% of our consumption is collared.","Micky M. Arison","Is collared, yes.","David Bernstein","So nothing for the second quarter, but 20% in the third and fourth.","David Liebowitz - Horizon Kinetics LLC","And given the collars, et cetera, how low would the price of fuel have to go for you to foreshorten the Q1, Q2 crossings so you could get an extra selling or 2?","Micky M. Arison","We'll never do that if the fuel consumption is just too large. The likelihood is we'd lengthen it rather than shorten it. When we lengthened it from 6 to 7 days, the fuel savings was high enough that we didn't need any additional revenue to make the profitability increase. And in fact, we did get some additional revenue. So it was the correct decision, and we're actually studying lengthening it again to reduce the speed again. I mean, we have a huge focus on reducing consumption.","Howard S. Frank","And the passenger response on the ship has been terrific. They don't have a problem taking the additional day at sea.","David Liebowitz - Horizon Kinetics LLC","And lastly, the amount or quantity of bookings you are receiving from onboard passengers, has that been continuing to go up as it was the last few years? Or is there some sort of ceiling it may have hit?","Micky M. Arison","I\u2019m sorry. I don't know the answer there.","Howard S. Frank","I really don't know the answer. That will vary, by the way, by brand, David, in terms of how much marketing. Certain brands do a lot more marketing onboard than others for future cruises. So it really varies by brand. But I don't -- we don't have any across-the-board answer for you on that. Sorry.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Manis Menarils [ph] with Exane [ph].","Unknown Analyst","I just have 2 quick questions, please. Did I hear you correctly when you said that you would expect 1 to 2 years to come back to the expected profits for the group? So would that read -- would I have understood well? And the second point, on the operating cash flow of $3.3 billion, given the CapEx you've guided for and your dividend expectations, would that mean that you would operate on a broadly stable net debt in FY '12 versus 2011?","Micky M. Arison","The first part of your question, I would say that -- we said 1 to 2 years for the Costa brand. I think we believe the other brands will recover much more quickly. And as I think we've said, Carnival Cruise Lines is actually booking up year-over-year. So we think the recovery will be much more quick for the non-Costa business. It's hard to tell on Costa. There is feeling that it's going to be 1 year or 2. Actually, I have to say that although the consensus is that, I believe it will come back faster than that. So we'll see. Second part of your question?","David Bernstein","As far as the net debt, it will be -- essentially, that does imply it will be flat. We do have some maturities this year, but we also have a couple of export credits associated with the ship deliveries. So it should be essentially flat for the year.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And can I just have a follow-up on CapEx? After the Allegra, do you have any expectations for boosting your CapEx or revisiting some of your ship engines or safety or whatever that you should book this year?","Micky M. Arison","We have a very extensive refit program going on at a number of our brands, and that is already in our CapEx expectation prior to this quarter. We also, based on lessons learned from a prior but similar event, we have had extensive refits to a number of our ships to improve the safety of the fire prevention systems in the engine rooms. And we've spent many millions of dollars over the last 12 months refitting the ships with additional safety equipment in those areas.","Beth Roberts","The CapEx requirement for this year is expected to be $2.6 billion, dropping down to $1.9 billion for 2013. Included in those numbers is an investment of $700 million to $750 million for other CapEx for the existing fleet.","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time.","Howard S. Frank","Okay. Well, I thank you all for calling in. And if you have any further questions or details, Beth will be available for the rest of the day. Thanks so much. Have a great day, everyone.","Micky M. Arison","Thank you very much.","David Bernstein","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

We overcame numerous headwinds including ongoing macroeconomic malaise in Europe, global geopolitical disruptions, public health scares like MERS, and even ship construction delays.","Concerning construction delays, in the end, our cash position is essentially unchanged, but due to accounting treatment cash flow is transferred from the income statement reducing our earnings to the balance sheet. Again, this was another strong quarter for our Company, significantly exceeding the high end of our guidance at $0.17 per share above the midpoint. In fact, our non-GAAP performance year-over-year improved by $0.17 also, despite a slight drag from fuel and currency \u2013 by any measure, another quarter of strong operational execution.","The strong demand environment that we have worked hard to cultivate enabled us to fill more close-end business at higher prices and higher occupancy levels. Constant currency net yield increased 5% in our seasonally strong summer season. We enjoyed strong performance on both sides of the Atlantic, particularly in North America, again led by the Carnival brand. Carnival Cruise Line achieved another double-digit improvement in revenue yield this quarter and is now expected to eclipse 2008 yield this year.","The higher occupancy level combined with the continued rollout of onboard revenue initiative, leveraging our scale, helped to drive an improvement in onboard revenues despite the more difficult year-over-year comparisons that resulted from our prior year's success.","China has clearly made world news in recent weeks but continues to be an aggressive growth region for us. In fact, we will grow to a six ship fleet next year from a base of four, strengthening our position as industry leader, yet still representing only 5% of our global capacity next year. Given the low penetration levels for cruise and the pent-up demand for travel, we remain very confident in the long-term potential for this expansive market.","As importantly with less capacity growth in the rest of the world, only 2% in fact by our Company, we have an improved supply\/demand balance in our core markets. During the quarter, we made progress on multiple initiatives designed to further out journeys toward consistent yield improvement by creating demand in excess of supply.","Our public relations effort continues to outperform. We generated positive media impressions in the first half of this year that almost equalled our positive impressions for all of 2014, which were already well above the historical highs. In the first half, our brands generated 75% of the entire cruise industry's positive coverage, and as that even includes the recent announcement regarding Cuba, another industry first by our Company.","As you know, last month we received a historic approval from the U.S. government to offer cruises to Cuba by our Fathom brand, which is still pending approval from the UN government. And the environment for travel to Cuba has just gotten even better with the recent changes proposed by the U.S. government. Fathom and Cuba are clearly garnering a lot of attention, generating over 18 billion media impressions from our Corporation since the brand launched.","Clearly a combination of our efforts to increase demand not only built yield improvement this year but helped to build a solid base of bookings for 2016. We have continued to drive a significant lengthening in the booking curve and have less remaining to book for the first half than last year. That along with the continued optimization of our yield management practices increases confidence in our ability to drive yield improvement next year. We are moving forward on our initiative to leverage our scale and yield management. We have made the decision to invest and begun the initial implementation of a joint yield management system initially to be rolled out across six of our brands.","We've also made progress with onboard revenue initiatives to leverage our scale. It's just one example in the area of beverage we concluded a cross-brand bar pricing exercise for Spirit that we are currently testing and rolling out, soon to be followed by similar exercises for soft drinks and [health wine]. We remain focused on exceeding guest expectations and customer feedback indicates that we continue to deliver on our guest experience. Intent to repeat is currently very strong across all our brands.","We continue to heighten the guest experience not just aboard our vessels but through enhanced experiences at our port destinations, including our newest destination Amber Cove. Amber Cove, which is in Dominican Republic North Coast, will open next month. This strategically important port introduces an innovative new itinerary option in the Caribbean. The seven-day central Caribbean now joins our current seven-day Eastern and Western locations and will be our most fuel-efficient seven day Caribbean deployment.","It will also bring new appeal to the Caribbean by showcasing the Amber Coast of the Dominican Republic where they mine for amber and there are over 27 waterfalls. This winter, six of our brands will feature Amber Cove in combination with other premier developments. Princess Cay, Half Moon Cay, and Grand Turk, all of which we own and operate. This allows an improved guest experience in keeping with our effort to consistently exceed guest expectations, and it's yet another powerful way we can leverage our scale and our balance sheet.","All of these initiatives are building blocks for capturing the multi-year yield growth needed to deliver double-digit return on invested capital in the next three to four years. We continue to look for opportunities to invest to drive yield in 2016 and beyond. At the same time, we remain focused on our initiative to contain costs by leveraging our scale.","Good progress has been made delivering savings for 2015 in a variety of procurement areas, including air-travel, food, particularly produce, and hotel supplies like mattresses. We have further opportunities to leverage our scale to reduce costs, while maintaining and in many instances even enhancing the guest experiences in 2016 and beyond, including projects targeted at the areas of technical, ports, and shore experiences. These projects will be rolled out over a multi-year periods and help to offset inflation.","Concerning sustainability, just last week we published our sustainability goals. We continue to reduce our environmental footprint as evidenced by our 2% fuel consumption reduction in the third quarter and remain on track for a 2% consumption reduction this year.","In the area of talent development, we have made further talent development in China by relocating to Shanghai seasoned cruise executive, Michael Ungerer, to the newly created position of Chief Operations Officer for Asia. Long time executive and a rising talent, Felix Eichhorn, replaces Michael as President of AIDA Cruises.","We remain focused on measured capacity growth by delivering innovative and significantly more efficient ships while at the same time removing from service less efficient capacity. During the quarter we announced Costa Cruises will build two new cruise ships to be delivered in 2019 and 2020 as part of our previously announced agreement with Meyer to construct four next-generation cruise ships, having previously announced the other two ships will be dedicated to AIDA Cruises in the German market.","These ships will be the most efficient in our fleet and have the largest guest capacity in the world through innovative design comfortably accommodating up to 6,600 guests. They will also be the first in the industry to be powered by LNG, both at sea and at portfolio, and in addition we have a host of guest experience innovations yet to be announced.","Our newbuild program continues to be self-funded through our strong cash flow which will exceed $4 billion in 2015, still with cash remaining. We remain committed to returning this cash to shareholders as demonstrated in our most recent quarter with a 20% increase in our recurring annual dividend to $1.20 per share. Dividend distributions now exceed $900 million annually. Along our path for double-digit return on invested capital, our already strong cash flow will continue to build. We look forward to further enhancing total shareholder returns by distributing even more cash to shareholders over time.","The path to double-digit return on invested capital may not always be a straight line. Obviously in any given year we may be ahead of pace or more challenged to keep the pace. Be assured regardless, we continue to have a clear line of sight on delivering double-digit return on invested capital in the next three to four years. And with that, I would now like to turn it over to David.","David Bernstein","Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note all of my references to revenue and cost metrics will be in constant currency, unless otherwise stated. I\u2019ll start today with a summary of our record third quarter non-GAAP results and then provide an update on our full year 2015 guidance. I'll continue with some insights into booking trends for the first half of 2016 and I'll finish up with some preliminary color on the full year 2016.","Our non-GAAP EPS for the third quarter was $1.75. As Arnold indicated, it was $0.17 above the midpoint of our June guidance. The improvement was driven by three things. First, $0.10 from net revenue yields due to better than anticipated ticket and onboard yields. Second, $0.04 for the lowering net cruise cost without fuel due to the timing of expenses between the third and fourth quarters. Lastly, $0.03 from the favorable impact of fuel price and currency.","Now, turning to the third quarter operating results versus the prior year, our net ticket yields were up almost 5%. The increase in net ticket yields was driven by our North American brands with double-digit yield improvements in the Caribbean and mid-single-digit yield improvements in Alaska. Onboard and other yields increased over 5% with both sides of the Atlantic up.","Net cruise cost per ALBD excluding fuel was up 2%. This was driven in part by the previously discussed increase in dry dock days for the year. During the third quarter, we did benefit from the impact of lower fuel prices which were more than offset by the stronger dollar. The net impact of fuel and currency was just $0.02 unfavorable versus the prior year as these two items acted as a hedge of each other.","In summary, third quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.17 higher than the prior year, mainly driven by improved net revenue yields worth $0.26, partially offset by higher net cruise cost without fuel costing $0.05.","Now looking at our full year 2015 guidance, as Arnold indicated, we now expect net revenue yields to be up approximately 4% versus the prior year, which is at the higher end of our June guidance range of 3% to 4%. Net cruise costs without fuel per ALBD are now expected to be up approximately 3.5%, essentially the same as our June guidance. For 2015, we are now forecasting the benefit from the net impact of fuel and currency by $0.25.","Taking all these factors into consideration, I'm pleased to say that we have increased our non-GAAP EPS guidance for the full year 2015 to a range of $2.56 to $2.60 versus $1.93 for 2014. The midpoint of our full year guidance range increased $0.16 while we beat the midpoint of our June guidance in the third quarter by $0.17. However, $0.04 of the third quarter's $0.17 was due to the timing of expenses between the third and fourth quarters, so only $0.13 from the third quarter flows through to the full year.","For the fourth quarter, we increased our revenue forecast by $0.04 and we expect an additional $0.03 benefit from the net impact of fuel and currency. All of this is partially offset by the delayed delivery of the AIDAprima which we are forecasting to have a $0.04 impact versus our previous guidance. While we will be compensated by the shipyard in 2016 for the late delivery, the accounting rules require that the compensation be treated as a reduction to the cost of the ship on the balance sheet and not flow through to the P&L, which essentially transfers the benefit from the P&L to the balance sheet in the near-term. Since we have been made hold from a cash flow perspective, there is no change in the enterprise value.","Let's turn to booking trends for 2016. Bookings for the first half of 2016 taken during the last quarter have been very strong, up nearly 20% at lower constant dollar prices. At this point in time, cumulative fleet-wide bookings for the first half of 2016 are also nicely ahead at lower constant dollar prices.","As Arnold indicated, we have continued to drive a significant lengthening of the booking curve. Despite the almost 3% capacity increase in the first half of 2016, we have less remaining inventory to sell than last year and this gives us increased confidence in our ability to drive yield improvement as we continue to optimize our yield management practices.","Now let's drill into the cumulative bookings position for the first half of 2016. For our North American brands, the pattern is the same as fleet-wide, bookings are nicely ahead at lower constant dollar prices. The lower constant dollar prices are driven by unfavorable transactional currency impacts and our strategy to [build] [ph] earlier and mitigate discounting closer to the sale base. For our European, Australia and Asia brand, also known as our EAA brand, bookings are in line with the prior year at lower constant dollar prices driven by the continuing economic challenges these brands faced throughout 2015.","Finally, I want to provide you with some color on 2016. Although it's early, 2016 appears to be shaping up to be another good year. We are forecasting capacity to increase 3.7%. For 2016, we are expecting to see constant currency net revenue yield improvement. I will provide guidance on the December call when we have more visibility.","On the cost side, net cruise cost without fuel per ALBD could be up slightly next year. While we expect a year-over-year benefit from fewer dry dock days and additional savings from leveraging our scale, these cost reductions could be offset by inflation in certain areas of our business and investments to drive yield improvements and develop new markets, both of which are under evaluation. We are working through our planning process now and we'll be meeting with the brands next month and expect the finalized decision shortly thereafter.","As we discussed on previous conference calls, we increased our capital expenditures for a variety of vessel enhancement projects and exhaust gas cleaning systems to meet the eco requirements without having to utilize a more expensive fuel grade. We have made excellent progress on both these areas and most aspects of these investments are expected to be completed by the end of 2016.","With the increase in using capital investments as well as new ship deliveries, we expect depreciation expense to be $1.8 billion in 2016, approximately $0.20 higher than 2015. We experienced a similar trend in 2015 but was ultimately masked by currency movements.","As I previously mentioned, the delay in delivery of the AIDAprima had an impact on our 2015 guidance. We are currently anticipating that this delay will also likely impact 2016. We will be compensated by the shipyard for the 2016 impact as well, but like I mentioned earlier, it will reduce the cost of the ship on the balance sheet and not flow through the P&L in 2016. Although AIDAprima will be delivered late, we are expecting her to be a fantastic ship which will provide an incredible experience for our German guests for many years to come.","Despite the lower price of fuel, we remain committed to continuing fuel consumption reduction. Given the timing of our investments in this area, we expect fuel consumption on a unit basis to decline 1% to 2% for 2016. Lastly, at the current spot prices for fuel, we expect a $0.20 benefit in 2016. However, we do expect this will be partially offset by the stronger U.S. dollar which will cost us approximately $0.10 based on current FX rates, most of which will impact the first half of 2016.","And now I'll turn it back to Arnold.","Arnold W. Donald","Thank you, David. We're now happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura. Please proceed.","Harry Curtis","I'm hoping to drill down into the somewhat more conservative than expected outlook for both yields and cost in the fourth quarter. In your guidance, it would imply that there's been a sequential decline in your pricing power in the fourth quarter, and so my first question is if you could address whether or not there has been a sequential decline?","Arnold W. Donald","So there are a couple of factors involved. We have first of all more difficult comparisons in the fourth quarter than the earlier quarters. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2014, we were up 2.8% whereas in the quarters prior we were up 1.8%, actually now 2.2% in the third quarter. And so, it's a tougher comparison. That's one aspect. And in addition, we are still facing some continued headwinds in Europe that can affect yield. But overall, we are very pleased with the yield result for this year, and we have increased our overall guidance for the year in terms of results and are looking to finish the year strong, and with the lengthening in the booking curve going to next year, well-positioned for continued yield improvement.","Harry Curtis","How much space do you still have to fill for the fourth quarter, is there still some opportunity there to see some stronger pricing in these quarter-end bookings?","David Bernstein","Typically, we say for the current quarter, we're at 85% plus booked. I mean so we are very strongly booked. We gave our best guess. And given the strong close in bookings that we saw in the third quarter is part of the reason why we took up the yield guidance for the fourth quarter. And by the way, we took it up both on the ticket and the onboard side. And so that was the $0.04 improvement that I was talking about in revenue yield for the fourth quarter. So there might be some more upside, but basically we gave you our best shot at the overall yield for the fourth quarter.","Beth Roberts","And on the cost side, could you comment on the fourth quarter cost?","David Bernstein","Sure. Harry, on the fourth quarter costs, remember as I commented on the third quarter, what we had indicated was that there was a seasonalization of cost between the third and fourth quarters, so there's about $0.04 of cost that we do still expect to spend for the full year, but we flow it into the fourth quarter, which drove that number up. A lot of that was advertising, and it just has to do with the timing between the quarters.","Arnold W. Donald","And the decision to invest to drive revenue and yields next year. Go ahead, Harry.","Harry Curtis","Okay. And just the last piece of it, on the timing of the delay, and did I read this correctly that that should also impact the fourth quarter by $0.04?","David Bernstein","Yes. And remember, Harry, we've said this many times in the call before, it's very hard to get the timing of expenses between the quarters correct and you really have to kind of judge us on the full year, and we didn't make any change in the overall cost for the full year, it's just a flip-flop between the quarters.","Harry Curtis","The reason I'm drilling down into it, and I appreciate that is that we've gotten a number of questions on why the yields are so sequentially or apparently weaker and then the cost apparently higher, so I'm just trying to drill into that a bit more, but thanks for the color.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Steve Kent","Just to follow up, just quickly on what Harry just said about this is once again a beat and raise quarter, and then the guide seems to be once again a little bit lighter than people expected. Besides the stock implications, I just wanted to know from an operating environment, how do you focus your organization on goals if you seem to be not getting to them quarter to quarter? And then separately, the yield management system which is interesting that you're going to integrate all of them, at least integrate six brands together, are you using an outside consultant and are there potential for integration or any other issues, which sometimes seen that with other companies and I just wanted to see how that process is going to work?","Arnold W. Donald","First of all, I'll take the second part first, on the yield management, revenue management system, it\u2019s just a system, so it's a platform and it involves the [indiscernible] modeling and inquiry systems and what have you, we'll just go to a common platform that six brands will initially adopt and over time the other brands may migrate to it as well. Each of the brands have their own revenue management system today, very different platforms, some are more sophisticated than others. So, this will be an overall enhancement, so two. And obviously we are using outside resources to help us develop to and implementation has already begun. So, it's part of work that we have undertaken over the last couple of years.","In terms of setting goals and whatnot, first of all we think about it over the long-term as well as annually, and we manage the business to double-digit return on invested capital in the next three to four years. To do that, we have to have solid yield growth, we have to contain costs, and we have to be disciplined in capital management. Our teams have performed very well. This year, we just had record earnings, we feel very good about it, we just increased guidance for the year, and we are marching forward. In fact, we are ahead of pace based on this year and that's why I put in the caution that we don't expect always to be ahead of pace, but this year we are ahead of pace. We are going to grow earnings 35% and that's despite drag of a few pennies net of fuel and currency compared to prior year.","Beth Roberts","I'd just like to add on the fourth quarter that the comparison for transactional currency is greater in the fourth quarter, so on a constant currency basis the fourth quarter yields are up 3% relative to the third quarter which was up 5%. And again, the sequential from last year had much more difficult comps in the fourth quarter of last year.","Steve Kent","Okay, so thank you for that color both of you. Just, Arnold, on the yield management system, because I think it is very interesting and I think it shows the integration that you have started to put through within the different brands, is it really just so that they can see some of the trends that one brand is seeing, so it's really more informational or are you going to start to link some of the pricing and mechanisms together, or is that sort of step two at some point?","Arnold W. Donald","The reality is again is the behavior of communicating, coordinating and collaborating. So the yield, the revenue management instrument itself is a combined ideation of best practices across the brands and then new ideas from the outside and inside. So it's an elevation of capabilities that we are going to introduce, and six of the brands can adopt it at once. The other brands already have more sophisticated revenue management tools and will migrate over time as we make the enhancements and refinements to the basic system once it's in place.","So the reality here is, our brands are very different from each other, they compete in different typographic markets, but they can learn from each other and common itineraries and common regions of the world and intelligence in terms of what's happening with booking curves and reactions, especially since they all tend to extend chasing newer cruise than chasing different newer cruise individuals because of the typographic profile, but they are all chasing newer cruise. So we've had benefit to date which is why we have had some of the outstanding operating results we've had and this too will allow us to capture even more benefit, regardless of the environment.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Please proceed.","Felicia Hendrix","David, in the release and then also in your prepared remarks, you gave us some color on the booking curve and on pricing next year. I'm wondering when you all talk about the pricing being at lower constant dollar prices for next year relative to better bookings, can you give us that color in constant currency? Is it also down year-over-year in constant currency?","David Bernstein","We don't have all the details in constant currency in bookings, which is why I gave it to you in constant dollar, but we can clearly see a portion of it, as I indicated in my remarks, for the North American brands was attributed to the transactional currency impact. So that's part of it.","Felicia Hendrix","Yes and I recall you saying that, so that's why I was wondering, it was kind of begging the question, if it were just for the transactional currency or the pricing, is the pricing up?","David Bernstein","The pricing would still be down, but less. But overall when you look at this, Felicia, when you look at the whole position, you got to keep in mind that it's not about where we are today, it's about where our goals and what do we want to be at the end of the day when we closeout the first, second, third and fourth quarter of 2016, and we are driving the booking curve ahead, we're well positioned, we said we have less to sell. And so what we are looking to do is to mitigate the discounting that's closer into the sale and to drive yields up for 2016, and we feel very good with all the things that Arnold talked about relative to yield management practices and other things and we feel very confident we'll be able to do that in 2016.","Felicia Hendrix","That's great to hear because we're just getting a lot of questions from investors about the pricing power of your brands because it seems like you are in a very good position, and Arnold, you said earlier that Carnival was booked at better pricing than you have seen since 2008, so just questions on why the pricing, why you wouldn't have more pricing power now?","David Bernstein","Keep in mind though, when you start putting all this together, keep in mind that we don't necessarily have to raise prices from where we are to finish-up up. If we discount less as we go forward, which is something we have been talking about for quite a while now, that we will finish the year 2016 with increased yields, as I indicated in my prepared remarks.","Arnold W. Donald","I think the simplest statement we can make is for those who are considering cruising next year is, better to book now, because this is the best time for them to book.","Felicia Hendrix","That's very helpful, thank you. And Arnold, you've been consistent with your outlook for getting to double-digit ROIC, consistently staying up three to four years. Just wondering if you could help us understand what the starting point or the potential ending point is in terms of year?","Arnold W. Donald","In the next three or four years.","Felicia Hendrix","So are we starting from today or starting from\u2026?","Arnold W. Donald","No, that's three or four years from today, yes. So if fuel stays low and currency improves for us, meaning the dollar weakens [indiscernible] gets stronger, then we get there sooner. If not, we'll get there in that timeframe or at the tail end of it, dependent on what happens with all those dynamics, but fundamentally we started out four to five years last year, we are down to three to four, next year we'll be down to two to three.","David Bernstein","Just as a point of reference, at the midpoint of our September guidance, we'll be about 7% ROIC for 2015.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Please proceed.","Steven M. Wieczynski","Going back to David, in 2016, I understand when you talk about pricing being down, it makes sense, especially in North America, given your pricing strategy, but when you look at the EAA markets, I guess that's the one that's a little bit more surprising. So what I'm trying to get at is, as you look at the EAA markets, are there any markets that would particularly stand out to you that are a little bit more challenging at this point?","David Bernstein","Overall, Continental Europe is probably more challenging. When you think about all of the economic difficulties and the geopolitical issues and the growing refugee concerns, that's the area that has had the most challenges in terms of pricing for 2016, but we've had these challenges all year in 2015 to some extent and we are forecasting that we are going to get yield improvement for our EAA brands for 2015. So hopefully despite all these challenges, we'll be able to do that in 2016 as well.","And one of the things to keep in mind as well is we are also seeing a transfer, we have announced the Costa Fortuna will be going to Asia in 2016. So Costa will have reduced capacity, which also helps play in less supply in this type of environment which should help yields for 2016.","Arnold W. Donald","The other comment too is to just keep in mind, and I know why you guys focused on yield and we do too, but there is another aspect to this, we can be return accretive and drive return on invested capital in certain markets across certain brands, even with some challenging yield, and that results from just capacity additions and overall improvement in total mix and onboard revenues, et cetera. So while yield is definitely a key metric and we totally focus on it as well, slower than you might expect yield growth does not necessarily equals slower than you might expect return accretion.","Steven M. Wieczynski","And just to follow up on that, the Asian component of that EAA, you guys are still pretty encouraged about what you are seeing so far for 2016?","Arnold W. Donald","Absolutely. Asia, again that will be a good case in point, China yields may come down a bit but they're going to be return accretive because of the significant increase in capacity. Now at the same time, with that capacity increase, they are still going to represent 5% of our total capacity, and by having the capacity there, it actually reduces our capacity growth in the rest of the world. And so we won't be happy even though we have 3.7% capacity growth for next year. Only 2% of it is outside of the Asian market. And so 2% capacity growth in the rest of the world is reasonably conservative growth for us in the current environment, which is also good.","Steven M. Wieczynski","David, can I ask you one more question in terms of the NCC, I know you talked about next year that that being slightly up or that's what you guys are seeing right now, I guess maybe what is driving, what potentially would drive that up next year, and is there anything, are there any levers that you guys can pull, especially on the marketing side given where the Carnival brand is in terms of their pricing now relative to where it was back in 2008?","Arnold W. Donald","Just real quickly before David comments, and we will give you guys full guidance in December, we are about to go through our planning meetings that David mentioned, we are evaluating all the reviews from the brands in terms of investment spending they may want to make in digital media, broadcast media, events and PR, promotions and other things to drive demand. So we'll take a hard look at all that. Our plan is to deliver the double-digit return on invested capital and we're not going to save our way there but we also have a focus on cost containment.","And as I've mentioned to you in previous calls, we are focused on cost containment for two reasons, one is the drag on earnings, but the other one is it creates the dollars to invest to drive revenue. And so we are achieving the cost savings that we set out to do, and then the question is, whether that will flow through the bottom line, are we going to invest them to drive yield. The investments we have made to date appear to have paid off because of the significant improvements and the business and we'll be taking a hard look at that going forward.","David Bernstein","And I went through some of the areas, I mean Arnold just talked about the investments that we could potentially make and we'll evaluate, but the other things that I had mentioned in my notes are the fact that while headline inflation is zero, because of commodity prices there is inflation in certain areas of our business and we built that into our 2016 numbers as well. But offsetting all of that, we are looking at leveraging our scale. We had talked about the fact that we saved $70 million to $80 million in 2015 and we're working hard to do something similar for 2016 and we also have some benefit from the reduced drydock days as well. So it's a combination of all those things which let me to give you guidance that cost could be up slightly next year.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Please proceed.","Robin Farley","So I do have a question that I was in line for already, but first I just wanted to clarify, Arnold, you just said something about Asia yield, I'm just wondering was that a theoretical comment, you said something about Asia yields may come down next year but it would still be return accretive, was that kind of theoretical or is that describing what you're seeing with yields?","Arnold W. Donald","It's too early to delve on that but it's plausible and it's possible, but it's too early to conclude that at this point in time. But what would not be too early to conclude is that if the yields come down, it will still be return accretive. Robin, I'm surprised you're this deep into the call. If I heard a question from you, so normally\u2026","Robin Farley","I tried to get in line earlier. So I just wanted to clarify, so that was, you weren't giving that as a guidance, you were just sort of saying as theoretical\u2026","Arnold W. Donald","No, that was for example.","Robin Farley","Okay, great. And then so my original question was this, I think the comments about expenses shifting between quarters and your yields going up for this year, I think that's pretty straightforward that it's a better outlook than the year started. My question was really on 2016, and I know that David you mentioned that certain things about the base of comparison getting better means that your prices wouldn't necessarily have to change, but I guess I just wanted to clarify, in your June release you talked about 2016 prices being lower due to FX, and then in this release you said prices are lower in constant currency, and so I understand that lower prices but higher volume means that you can raise prices as you get closer, but can you just kind of clarify if we were talking about apples to apples, what you are seeing now versus what you were seeing in June, just because the commentary and the release is kind of on a different basis, so just sort of what happened with pricing for 2016 just since June?","David Bernstein","It's really an apples and oranges comparison because in June the comments that we were making related to the back half of 2015, the last two quarters, and the first quarter of 2016, whereas the comments I made here related to the first half of 2016. So because the prior year comparisons are different, it's hard to read in and these are apples and oranges comparison because they are different time periods.","Robin Farley","So if you were talking about just the 2016, what would you have seen just incrementally since June on just the 2016?","David Bernstein","As we had indicated in the third quarter, I mean we had seen a 20% increase in volume. I mean we were very pleased with the volume but we did say it was at lower prices, so we are driving the booking curve ahead, and overall we believe we'll get yield improvement for 2016.","Arnold W. Donald","I will just add to David's comment to December, it's too early to give yield guidance for 2016, but if you're saying what's the feeling compared to June, I would just say that we remain very confident in our ability to drive directionally towards the double-digit return on invested capital in next three or four years. To do that, we have to have solid yield improvement and we feel very confident, probably even more confident than we did in June, that we can deliver on solid yield improvement next year, and that's despite some of the headwinds that today exist in Europe, and by the time we get to December maybe those things won't be the same, but today with some of the headwinds in Europe, geopolitical, macroeconomic malaise, the intense tension over there around the refugee situation, that has affected all travel, not just cruise but all travel. So those things may still be present or they may wane between now and when we get to December, but we will give you full guidance then.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed.","James Hardiman","A couple of quick follow-ups here. So sort of going back to handicapping the yield guide for the fourth quarter, remind us what the mix of business is between the Caribbean and Europe 3Q versus 4Q? I don't know if you have those numbers in front of you but it seems to me that your mix of European business goes down, your mix of Caribbean business goes way up, European business is trending not quite as well as or not nearly as well as your Caribbean business, it sounds like. So it seems like there is a pretty nice sequential yield benefit just from mix. Help us dimentionalize that, am I thinking about that the right way?","Beth Roberts","I think I'll just start with a general comment. From a deployment standpoint, I think that's a fair statement, and David will certainly comment on those numbers, but I think the comment we are making from a source market perspective, we are still sourcing a substantial amount of consumers in the third and fourth quarter and that doesn't change from quarter to quarter. On the deployment, in terms of whether ships are sailing, David?","David Bernstein","In the third quarter, it's about a quarter of our capacity is in the Caribbean and 45% in Europe, and that goes up to 30% in the Caribbean in the fourth quarter and Europe goes down to 30%. So you are right, there are more ships in the Caribbean and less in Europe in total in the fourth quarter than the third, but I think you have to remember that on a year-over-year basis it was a similar trend in 2014. And so when you are comparing year-over-year, you are comparing then apples and apples, and as Arnold indicated, we saw some pretty good yield improvement in the fourth quarter of 2014, and so as a result of that yield improvement, we are guiding to 3% constant currency yield increase in the fourth quarter, which may be down slightly from the third, but remember the fourth quarter last year was higher than the third quarter last year in improvement. So it is a more difficult comparison.","James Hardiman","Got it, that makes sense. And then maybe this is slicing the information a little bit too finely, but obviously at the end of your quarter, at the end of August, stock market was in freefall. Could you see any discernible change in demand over that period of time, and if so, has that then recovered so far during the month of September?","Arnold W. Donald","We did not see any falloff in demand related to stock market or general economic fluctuations, none whatsoever.","James Hardiman","Okay. And then just last question for me, sort of going back to this lengthening of the booking curve, basically it seems like, David, what you are saying here is that we should very much expect bookings to be up and prices maybe to be flat to down just based on how you are doing your pricing strategy. I guess the question is, A, is that right, is that what we should expect going forward, and B, does that have any impact on your guidance in that a lot of the pricing strength that you are going to get is ultimately going to be close in? I guess the other way to put it is, are you assuming that close-in pricing is better in your guidance or are you sticking to a wait-and-see approach with respect to the close-in numbers in light of the new pricing strategy?","David Bernstein","By moving the booking, driving the booking curve further out, we are actually hoping to have a lot less to sell closer in overall and we are looking at it as a situation where as we have said before, what we want to do is have people book early, it is the best time to book because the pricing will only go up and there won't be last-minute deep discounting to fill those cabins. That's the strategy we've been talking about for about two years now. And so as a result of that, I think we're on the right path towards good yield improvement for 2016.","Arnold W. Donald","There are other factors in addition to transactional currency and stuff that influence the appearance of early pricing and yields. We have targeted affinity groups that some of the brands target. They book earlier that kind of make the yield look lower, but in fact it's just coming sooner then it's spread over time with those affinity groups. Those affinity groups have big onboard spend patterns and overall we yield in total very nicely on those. Of course we don't have the onboard revenue yield factored in to this at this point in time. So there are a lot of dynamics that can influence what it looks like early. Some of it is just pricing philosophy of a brand and some is just booking patterns and charters and all that can come into play as well as affinity groups to fill out cabin to drive onboard revenue.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar. Please proceed.","Jaime M. Katz","Most of my questions have been answered but I'm curious if you guys have changed your hedging strategy at all now that energy prices are pretty low and they look like they're going to be sustained at low levels for some time going ahead?","Arnold W. Donald","Our policy has been to use the cash flow as collars. We have already I believe 48% of 2016 already collared and the future pricing which is what you have to establish the collars on, is not the same of course as the spot pricing. At this point in time we have seen no advantage to unwinding those collars or anything to that effect. When we looked at it once earlier this year, we would take them and then if we had done it, we would have lost on both ends, unwinding and then setting new collars. And so at this point wouldn't have any particular plans to change but we review it constantly.","David Bernstein","And we also, as you can see in our filings, we have got the cash flow collars for 2017 and 2018 as well, and so we are well positioned and well hedged at this point in time, but we continually re-evaluate it as Arnold indicated. Arnold and Mickey and I and Josh Weinstein, our Treasurer, frequently get together and talk about it and take a look at it and review input from other sources as well.","Jaime M. Katz","Okay. And then for Europe, you guys had discussed a couple of areas that were struggling. Was there any geography that came in really well ahead of expectations overseas?","Arnold W. Donald","First comment I'd like to make is that our European brands have performed well. So I don't want to leave an impression like they are stumbling and bumbling or anything, they performed well, and as David mentioned, EAA [indiscernible] despite all the stuff we've been talking about, and that has occurred this year, we have seen yield improvement and have seen return improvement. So that's the first comment.","The second comment is that Continental Europe has been hit hardest. We have seen, we have the 175th anniversary year for Cunard, that was a very successful year for the Cunard brand. We had the spectacular launch of the Britannia which helped elevate the entire P&O brand. So the U.K. did well, very well this year.","And again, AIDA continues to perform in Germany despite capacity introduction from competitors as well as just also the impact of sailings related to geopolitical tensions and so on and so forth. But the brands continue to do well and are doing better collectively than they have in the past and we expect that to continue into next year despite the challenges.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.","Tim Conder","Just a couple of things here on the booking curve, you mentioned several times that you'll continue to push to lengthen that or being successful in doing so. Historically, if we go back pre lot of incidents and the financial crisis from that, the industry was running about a six-month window on bookings. Could you tell us specifically where you're at right now and sort of where do you consider the sweet nirvana spot to balance that, don't give away too much upside on remaining bookings versus give enough all into persuade the consumer that they will understand and get the best price the earlier they book?","David Bernstein","The sweet spot will vary over time as you would expect, as people change, environments change and those types of things. So I don't think there is a nirvana. That's something that we continue to look at over time and will evaluate that. But where we stand today, as I talked about in my notes, the North American brands were well ahead. So the North American brands are at a higher end of the historical booking curve whereas the EAA brands, which I said were in line with the prior year, while they are still within the historical booking curves, they are at the lower half of the historical booking curve. So it's a mix of two worlds. As we have talked before, the strength of the economy in North America clearly has helped shape the booking curves in the two segments of our business.","Tim Conder","And, David, is there a specific number where you are on a global blended basis or a specific, those ranges of historical booking curve ranges that you are referring to?","David Bernstein","We've given you the ranges before, and as I said, North America is in the higher half and EAA is in the lower half, and for competitive reasons that's all the detail I want to share.","Tim Conder","Okay, fair. Regarding the 2016 cost that you said would be up slightly at this point, on that cruise cost, should we think about that you are winding down the accelerated dry docks in the first half of 2016, and therefore from a cadence standpoint all else being equal, and assuming that you are increased marketing or other investments would be spread evenly, would we expect the first half of the year to have a little more skew of that higher cost versus the back half?","David Bernstein","It's very early to tell, so it's very hard. We have not gone through, we have a difficult time and uptime analyzing it quarter by quarter within 2015, as you saw the timing of expenses between the third and fourth quarters that I referred to. So it's very difficult to tell this early in the year where we are. The one thing that I did mention relating to the first quarter or the first half is that there is a significant transactional currency impact, particularly in the first quarter. And so as you think about next year, keep that in mind.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Assia Georgieva with Infinity Research. Please proceed.","Assia Georgieva","This is Assia. I will just ask one question. Given that last year Europe was surprisingly a strong performer, was [indiscernible] this year the Caribbean seems to be the star performer. So it seems that especially for Q4 and Q1, when we have a lot more of the ships being deployed in the Caribbean and the Bahamas, there probably is a lot of upside especially given your good booked position at this point. Would you, Arnold and David and Beth, agree with this?","Arnold W. Donald","I would say again, we're not going to give any more guidance for 2016, it's too early for us. But the reality is that Carnival outperformed late last year as well and they continue to outperform throughout this year, the Carnival brand, which is primarily in the Caribbean. They have had an outstanding year with strong demand and strong yield, as reflected in everything we said to this point and reflected on the fact we've raised guidance for the full year. So we have a lot of momentum there and we feel very good about it, but at this point it's too early to give firm yield guidance on anything for 2016.","Assia Georgieva","And Arnold, it seems that the Carnival brand was very helpful in terms of the excellent Q3 results?","Arnold W. Donald","Absolutely, yes. All the brands [indiscernible]. We had growth in both sides of the Atlantic, as David pointed out, but the Carnival brand definitely outperformed again, yes.","Assia Georgieva","Okay. Thank you, Arnold, for taking my questions. Again congratulations on a great Q3.","David Bernstein","We'll take one more call, operator.","Operator","The last question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia","So two quick questions, I guess capacity growth, did that change for the fourth quarter given the AIDA delay and what are you expecting for capacity now?","Beth Roberts","Yes, it did change a little bit. For the year, our capacity growth came down to 1.7% and for the fourth quarter it's 2.3%.","Sharon Zackfia","Okay, perfect. And then I think you changed some commission structure elements at the Carnival brand. Can you talk about that and kind of what the travel agent response has been and whether that's something you are assessing within the other brands?","Arnold W. Donald","Fundamentally for the Carnival brand, to get everyone up to speed, we basically allow people to achieve a certain payout at a lower tier level in the commission structure. That was a combination of one acknowledgment to travel professional partners for the great work and contributions they have made to our success this year, and also just the recognition for the brand and their Carnival conversations discussing the travel professionals, changes that the travel professionals thought would really make a difference and would balance things from their perspective. So it's in response to input from the travel professional partners and the acknowledgment of their contributions and what we thought it would take to help them help us sustain the momentum.","Each brand does their own evaluation. The brands have some overlap in travel professional partners. There is also [indiscernible] because the guests are different, and each brand makes its own evaluation, and Carnival brand was starting from a different point, just some of the other brands were so that all of the brands will make independently their decision.","Sharon Zackfia","Okay, great. Thank you.","Arnold W. Donald","Everyone, thank you very much again. We appreciate your interest. We feel great about the quarter. We have increased guidance for the year. We feel strongly looking ahead that we are on a good path to deliver the double-digit return on invested capital in the next three to four years. We see solid yield improvements for next year. We'll give you actual yield guidance and stuff in December as well as tighter cost guidance for the future, but we feel very good about the business and the momentum and we thank you for your interest.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

I am Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation & plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning and a heartfelt Happy Holidays everyone.","Today, I am joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison; by David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and by Beth Roberts, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking. Therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today\u2019s press release.","We finished the year with another record quarter of adjusted earnings, which were $0.17 share, or 34% higher than our prior year, exceeding the midpoint of guidance by $0.10 per share and leading to the highest full year earnings in our company's history.","We achieved full year 2016 adjusted earnings of $2.6 billion or $3.45 per share, that's $500 million, or 28% per share higher than last year and more than double 2013 earnings of $1.55.","More importantly, we achieved return on invested capital of 9% and doubled our 2013 return on invested capital of 4.5%. We are pleased to have delivered by our shareholders doubled earnings and doubled return on invested capital in just three short years.","Strong operational improvement contributed $0.55 per share to the bottom-line year-over-year, which when combined with $0.14 of accretion from our share repurchase program, enabled us to exceed the high end of our original December guidance range of $3.10 to $3.40 per share. And that's despite an $0.18 drag from fuel and currency, both moving against us.","The strong results are a credit to the commitment and to the passion of our 120,000 team members, which when coupled with the support from our valued travel agent partners enabled us to overcome the significant obstacles encountered this past year, including the rare occurrence of a simultaneous negative from fuel and currency.","A series of global geopolitical events in Turkey, Paris, and Brussels, as well as concerns around Zika and Brexit. It is through their collective efforts that we delivered records earnings in 2016 and are gaining momentum as we embark on 2017 with booking volumes and pricing both well ahead of the prior year.","It was reinforcing to see constant currency revenue yield growth this year of roughly 4% inclusive of the previously disclosed 1% accounting change on top of the over 4% improvement achieved last year.","We enjoyed ticket price improvements for both our North American and our EAA brands, with particularly robust ticket price improvements again in our core Caribbean deployment.","We drove revenue yield growth by creating relative scarcity through our brand team success in increasing demand in excess of our measured capacity growth via ongoing guest experience efforts coupled with our continuing public relations efforts.","In fact we recently created three original TV programs that are airing on major U.S. networks, having already reached more than 40 million viewers during the large family-oriented programming blocks.","They are designed to entertain, to educate, and to engage viewers by showcasing exciting adventures, exotic cultures, beautiful ships, and popular global destinations with almost 80 original episodes. The new experiential series use compelling and authentic storytelling to share the powerful way traveled by sea connect people, places and cultures around the world, while prominently featuring each of our brands.","Not only are we experiencing very high viewer ratings at number one or number two in their respective time slot. But we're also achieving even more favorable consumer perception of our brands.","This successful programming comes on the heels of many impactful shows earlier this year. In the U.K. a reality-based TV series onboard Regal Princess, the cruise and P&O Cruise's [ph] battleships onboard Britannia.","In Italy, Bravo Chef, onboard our Costa ships and Costa Fortuna, a major motion picture, Holidays in the Caribbean. In North America, Carnival Cruise Lines was featured on Wheel of Fortune for a full week and featured on the Ellen Degeneres Show.","We have many more opportunities already in the pipeline for next year to keep cruising in the forefront of vacationers' mind including the new Celebrity Apprentice airing on NBC in February during wait season our peak booking period.","All of these efforts from all consideration around the globe by primarily featuring amazing cruise experiences in our world-leading cruise lines. In fact, our brands accounted for over 70% of the industry's positive media coverage. This includes our historic voyage to Cuba where we became the first U.S. cruise operator in over 40 years to bring U.S. cruise guest directly from the U.S. to Cuba with over 55 billion very positive media impressions and paving the way for others in our industry to follow.","At this time, we are proud to have more sailing scheduled to Cuba than any other major U.S. operator. Moreover our phenomenal guest experience just gets better and better each year as we continue to deliver on consumer expectations, achieving further improvement in our net promotor scores.","We also introduced three new flagships in 2016, including Carnival Vista. We celebrated its U.S. arrival in November with an onboard concert by country music superstar, Carrie Underwood, supporting operation home front and witness USA herself military as the Godmother and including 700,000 military families invited as guest of honor.","Carnival Vista was designed specifically for our fun loving Carnival Cruise Line guest with an onboard brewery experience, entertaining IMAX Theater and exhilarating SkyRide experience.","However, America's Koningsdam christened in Rotterdam by her Majesty Queen M\u00e1xima of the Netherlands delivered the new premium experience where our guest can blend their own wine or dance the night away in our carefully engineered Music Walk showcasing Lincoln Center Stage, Billboard Onboard and B.B. King\u2019s Blues Club. AIDAprima the first of our next generation platform resonates with AIDA newly exclusively German guest combining leading-edge environmental attributes with exceptional guest experiences, including racing waterslides, a lazy river, climbing wall, an expansive German spa, an ice rink for skating, for hockey, for curling and even a traditional Christmas market.","Newbuild will provide additional demand creation opportunities in 2017 as well. Beginning with the recent delivery of Encore, for ultra-luxury brand Seabourn designed by Adam Tihany in keeping with the feel of the luxury yacht Seabourn Encore sets the new standard in ultra-luxury cruising featuring 300 elegant suites, the grill our new restaurant by three-star Michelin chef Thomas Keller and the debut of our new mindful living program with Dr. Andrew Weil.","Later next year, we will welcome AIDAperla in Germany and of course, majestic Princess the first ship purpose built for Chinese cruisers demonstrating our commitment to grow the cruise industry in China which remains an embryonic market with vast untapped potential. We expect to continue to profitably grow our presence in China and throughout Asia for many years to come. When it comes to ships, newbuilds are not the only way to stimulate demand creation. We continue to invest in our existing fleets to further enhance guest experiences including the recent remastering of Cunard's Queen Mary 2 and the continual rollout of Carnival Cruise Line Fun Ship 2.0, so now over 60% of our Carnival Cruise Line fleet.","On January 5th, we will kick off the year by unveiling our latest guest experience innovation at the consumer electronics show in Las Vegas. We are privileged to be the first travel company ever to be invited to provide the opening keynote address at CEF, but we will showcase using our leading edge technology offering a new option for our guest for a true breakthrough in unobtrusive high-touch and personalized travel at scale.","Furthermore, we launched our new sales the odd revenue management system this next past year positioned us well to drive economic revenue yield growth all the time. The rollout of system across six of our brands and is expected to be completed by early 2018. We are already benefited from the sharing of best practices and we expect this new yield management tool to begin to facilitate yield uplift in in 2017 and even more till 2018.","We continue to accelerate progress on our cost containment efforts, delivering $95 million cost savings in 2016. That\u2019s $20 more than the $75 million included in our original 2016 guidance and bringing the cumulative savings to-date to over $190 million. We will continue on our cost containment efforts that we believe present a multiyear opportunity to further leverage our scale, including another over $75 million of savings plans 2017.","In addition, we continue to make meaningful progress on our 2020 sustainability goals focusing on our environmental, safety, labor and social performance. Having already reduced our unit fuel consumption by 28% since initiating the effort. We remained committed to onboard a reduction air emission and just this year, AIDAprima became the first cruise ship in the world to be powered by environment friendly liquefied natural gas.","We are committed to continue improvement in health, environmental, safety and security which is not only so critical to operate, but also for our future success. This year we introduced industry-leading short side technology to monitor real-time navigational performance and energy use across our fleet and we open our significantly expanded Arison Maritime in Netherlands delivering state-of-the-art maritime training to cutting-edge bridge and engine room simulators and curriculum.","In 2016 we delivered over $5 billion of cash from operations and returned more than half to shareholders having distributed $1 billion through our annual dividend and investing our $2 billion in our ongoing share repurchase program. As the testament to the strength of our operating performance, we were able to accomplish this while also getting back our A minus and AAA credit ratings from S&P and Moody and we plans to continue to return excess cash and more to shareholders in 2017 with our credit metric at the better end of our targeted range.","Now looking forward, they are large addressable market with low penetration all over the world including North America and new markets in Asia where economic growth is very discretionary income levels fueling increased demand for vacations. We are focused on growing our topline and have enormous innovations underway to faster cruise demand in the years ahead. ","Our booking trends are strong heading into 2017, positioned us well for continuing growth in revenues yields. In 2017, we are projecting revenue yields up another 2.5% on top of the proper comparisons with prior year success based on our approval demand creation and yield management efforts. At the same time, we will continue to containing cost. In 2017 at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect to deliver an improvement in earnings of $0.43 per share. However, our current rate that is offset by $0.43 per share impact from fuel and currency.","We remained committed to achieving increased consideration for cruise vacations and continue to invest in guest experience to create additional consumer demand and excess of measured capacity growth. We remained committed to responsibly containing cost. We remained committed to returning value to shareholders and despite the unusual current of both fuel and currency working against us at the same time we remained committed to achieving sustained double-digit return on invested capital within two years.","With that I'll turn the call over to David.","David Bernstein","Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin please note all of my references to revenue ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated.","I will start today with a summary of our 2016 fourth quarter results. Then I'll provide some insights on current booking trends and finish up with some color on our 2017 December guidance.","Our adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.67; this was $0.10 above the midpoint of our September guidance. The improvement was almost all operational driven by a number of factors $0.04 came from net ticket revenue yields which benefited from stronger pricing on closing bookings on both sides of the Atlantic, while the remaining $0.06 was an accumulation of a variety of items such as improved fuel consumption and lower depreciation expense.","Now let's turn to the fourth quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased over 4%. In North American brands were up almost 3%, while the European Australia and Asian brands also known as our EAA brands were up over 6%. Our total net revenue yields were up 4.1%.","Now let's break apart the two components of net revenue yields, net ticket yields were up 5.2 %, this increase was driven by North American brands deployment in the Caribbean and Alaska as well as our EAA brands deployments in Europe. That Onboard and other yields increased 1.3% in line with our guidance as our currency initiatives continue to pay dividends while our brands develop new initiatives for 2017 and beyond. Net cruise costs per ALBD excluding fuel were up 1% which was in line with our September guidance.","In summary, our fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.17 higher than the prior year driven by higher net revenue yields worth $0.17 and the accretive impact of this factory repurchase program worth $0.04 both of which were partially offset by the unfavorable net impact of lower fuel prices and currency workforce.","Now let's turn to 2017 booking trends. Since September both booking volumes and prices for the first three quarters of 2017 have been running well ahead of the prior year. At this point in time for the first three quarters of 2017, cumulative advance bookings are well ahead at considerably higher prices.","Now, let's drill down into the cumulative book position. First, for our North American brand, Caribbean occupancy is ahead of the prior year at nicely higher prices. For Alaska, both occupancy and prices are well ahead of the prior year.","If you want to go to Alaska next summer, I suggest you book early as the remaining inventory is going fast. For the seasonal Europe program, occupancy is in line with the prior year at nicely higher prices.","Secondly, for our EAA brands. For European deployments, occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at nicely higher prices. For the Caribbean deployment for our EAA brands, occupancy is lower than the prior year at prices that are in line. However, prices on bookings over the last quarter are well ahead of the prior year, clearly an improving trend.","Finally, I want to provide you with some color on 2017. We are forecasting a capacity increase of 2.6%. As Arnold indicated, our booking trends are strong heading into 2017 positioning us well for continued growth in revenue yields.","For 2017, we are projecting net revenue yields up approximately 2.5% on top of the tougher comparison from our prior year success. For the full year, we're expecting to see yield improvement in almost all itineraries.","Now turning to cost. Net cruise cost without fuel per ALBD are expected to be up approximately 1% for 2017. Broadly speaking there are three major drivers of the cost change. First, our forecasted for 1.5 points of inflation across all of our categories globally. Second, we are planning for an increase of dry dock days from 366 days in 2016 to nearly 450 in 2017, impacting our cost metrics by a 0.5 point.","As we have indicated on previous conference calls, the dry dock days will vary each year, but probably average around 450 to 475 days given the current size of our fleet. Partially offsetting these two items, we are forecasting about a point of cost saving benefit as we further leverage our scale.","Given the volatility of fuel prices and FX rates over the past year, the 2017 year-over-year impact is an unfavorable $0.43 with both fuel and currency moving against us; $0.27 for fuel prices including the impact of fuel derivative and $0.16 for currency.","Putting all these factors together, our adjusted EPS guidance for 2017 is $3.30 to $3.60 versus the $3.45 we did in 2016.","I'll finish up by sharing with you our current rules of thumb about the impact that currency and fuel prices can have on our 2017 results. To start with a 10% change in all relevant currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would impact our P&L by approximately $0.34 for the full year and $0.04 for the first quarter, fuel price changes a 10% change in the current spot price represent a $0.17 impact for the full year and $0.04 for the first quarter. Fuel expense in our guidance is $1.2 billion for the full-year.","The third rule of thumb relates to our fuel derivative portfolio. A 10% change in rent would result in a $0.06 change in realized losses on fuel derivatives for the full year and $0.01 for the first quarter.","And now I'll turn the call back over to Arnold.","Arnold Donald","Thank you, David. And now operator let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from the Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Please proceed.","Steve Wieczynski","Hey, good morning guys. So, could you -- if you look at your yield guidance for next year of basically 2.5%, could you give a little more color and break that down in terms of what you guys are looking for both on the price and the -- the new onboard side as well?","Arnold Donald","Directionally, onboard with the comparable in terms of percent change year-to-year and comparable to prior year.","Steve Wieczynski","Okay. And then second question around the -- your booked position, you said you're in a better position at this point for 2017 than you were for this point in -- for 2016. Can you give a little more color on that? and maybe give a little bit more color into some of your geographies as well next year specifically talk about what you're seeing with some China even though it is a pretty short booking window?","Arnold Donald","Yes, I'd say with China, things are looking great, but as you know it\u2019s a B2B business. And -- but we feel very comfortable in China. We obviously, ended up with good returns this year. We're expecting good returns again next year.","But things are very positive. But it is B2B, so we feel we have additional charters and sub-charters to complete and we have this -- see the year through.","Dave you want to add?","David Bernstein","Yes, overall, Steve I went through in my notes all the different areas of the globe, both for the North American brands as well as the EAA brands. Arnold touched on China. Remember China is a late booking market and as a result of that it is early, and Australia which I didn't mention, we are in good shape in Australia as well. It is a small piece of our business, not nearly as large as the other piece that I mentioned. So, overall booking trends are good and we're very encouraged.","Arnold Donald","And that's across the Board Steve.","Steve Wieczynski","Okay. So, have you looked at your booked position for the full company right now versus where it was last year, it's -- would you use the word significantly ahead?","David Bernstein","What we said the overall book position and our is well ahead at considerably higher prices.","Steve Wieczynski","Okay, got you. Thanks a lot guys.","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Please proceed.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So, just to kind of stay and how you are thinking about the globe and your -- and how you are going to -- how you could perform next year. Obviously, the outlook on the Caribbean is positive, but we -- despite you and some of your competitors and travel agents, also talking about the Caribbean looking positive for next year, there still seems to be concern about some of the supply increases particularly in the second and third quarter. So I was just wondering if you could address the demand that you're seeing in the Caribbean despite the increased supply and why you're so confident that you'll see growth there next year.","Arnold Donald","Sure. Good morning Felicia.","Felicia Hendrix","Morning.","Arnold Donald","Yes, I guess the industry capacity of all is going to be up 6% next year in the Caribbean and we're going to be up 5% roughly. But again, we actually have less inventory to book now than we did this point in time last year. So, we feel very strong at this point. We still have to get through wave season, it's still early. But things are looking very positive.","And all of our indicators -- our brands have done a great job of creating demand, especially on Carnival brand continue to outperform the Caribbean and did again this year.","For us, we have added some new capacity, primarily in the form the Carnival Vista. The ship is spectacular. She is going to command premium yields and premium booking position and have demonstrated that already.","So, we are very confidence. The other good news is we have a large base, especially in Carnival brand. Previous cruise scores that will introduce our new ship because we don't tend to it every year. We have a large base of previous cruisers set to book with us. So, our the pendent on cruise while we still need new recruits is not over-weighted.","So, we feel very confident at this point based on what we see in the Caribbean.","Felicia Hendrix","Thanks. And Arnold while I have you, I thought your comment and you're committed to returning double-digit ROIC within the next two years despite the current FX and fuel headwinds was impressive. So, just wondering if you could help us understand maybe somethings that you would be doing beyond your already identified cost savings to ensure that goal?","Arnold Donald","Yes. No, absolutely. I think first of all, it is a headwind that have obviously currency and few -- both move against U.S. at the same time which has rarely have ever happened before. And it's happening with a pretty significant impact obviously.","But said that we also have a lot of momentum on a number of fronts. Not just in cost and payment, but in driving yield and then with some small capacity addition that helps us as well.","But we had multiple pass all along. When we declared double-digit, fuel prices were much higher than they were the last few years and we are now looking at next year at basically being on balance net of fuel in currency where we were when we declared double-digit returns as capital.","So, we have no reason to back off from that goal. We have multiple pathways including obviously increased yields, but also in terms of managing more efficiently. Then all the tools we have in place. We have new management tool in place that will begin to kick-in and we'll see the full effect on about half of our brands by 2018. We've done a lot of work and the brands have in creating additional demand. We have a lot more cruise scores in our base of previous cruise scores.","We have much more collaboration and coordination communication across our brands to not only contain cost, to help us manage cost as you see reflected in the cost guidance, but also frankly to share best practices and drive yield further.","So, we have a number of things in place. We have a lot of momentum and we are committed and we will deliver.","Felicia Hendrix","Thanks. And then just finally housekeeping, Beth, I was just -- Beth, can you give us the D&A and interest expense guidance for the first quarter and -- of 2017 and the full year of 2017 and the quarterly capacity increases?","Beth Roberts","Interest is running about $50 million a quarter, $200 million for the year that's net of capitalized, net of income. Depreciation is running $450 million in the first quarter, $1.850 billion for the year. And quarterly derivative are running $47 million in first quarter, $185 million for the year, that's the realized derivative. And the quarterly capacity projections are 4% for the first quarter, 3.6% for the second, 1.2% for the third, 2.5% -- 2% even for the fourth quarter for 2.5% on the year.","Felicia Hendrix","Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.","Tim Conder","Thank you. A couple of here Beth, first of all, a little more color backing -- it's been hit on the first two questions here, the geographic color. David you talked about the European occupancy for the EAA brands as well ahead at nicely higher prices that. Can you break that down a little bit between med and X-Men and then and then just -- again sort of recap in your and your thought process on the EAA brands looking into the Caribbean?","David Bernstein","Yes. The -- hang on one second; let me get the details for the EAA brands.","Arnold Donald","While he is looking the overall position next year and Med for the industry, it's going to be pretty good, because basically there will be a probably half of the reduction in Med next year. Go ahead David.","David Bernstein","Yes. Overall, the comment, did you break it down. It's very similar for both markets as I mentioned for the year occupancy is well ahead and the prices are nicely higher for both Med as well as North American for the EAA brands.","Tim Conder","Okay. It sounded fairly similar year-over-year the north.","David Bernstein","The EAA and the Caribbean I had indicated was I could see was lower than the prior year, prices that are in line.","Tim Conder","Okay. And it sounded similar also some more breakdown color for the North American brands, both Med and outside of the Med.","David Bernstein","At this point in time for the North American brands, the Med with the reduced occupancy in the Med, the pricing in the Med seems to be doing much better into Northern Europe in terms of being up more than Northern Europe.","Tim Conder","Okay. And then gentlemen just given your overall commentary about that the higher booked occupancy and pricing, would -- should we anticipate -- grant the wave is important, but should we anticipate that you obviously won't need as much bookings during wave on a year-over-year basis all else equal in the same trajectory at this point?","David Bernstein","We have less to sell, as Arnold indicated, than we did at this time last year despite the capacity increase. So, clearly, it's a zero-sum game and we can only book so much, we only have so much capacity, so we do need less during wave and the remainder of the year for 2017 and we'll be looking to push pricing up and try to continue to do better than our guidance.","Tim Conder","Okay. And then lastly I know it's less than 24 hours, but it's been kind of quiet thankfully on the terrorist incidents front, but the incident yesterday in Germany, less than 24 hours, just any very early feedback indications from that? I know kind of ebbs and flows for a week after an event, but any thoughts there?","Arnold Donald","Just general comments. We had a couple of incidents I guess, the German situation and the situation in Turkey. But the reality is that we weathered those storms for the past several years and as long as the world continues in the general state it is, people have chosen to continue to travel and long as people travel, we're going to be in good shape.","If things were ever to obviously get exacerbated and people were afraid to travel than we'll have a challenge, but that has not happened recent times with all the various incidents that have occurred and so we have no reason at this point in time to have a higher level of concern.","Tim Conder","Thank you all. Happy Holidays and congratulations again on a great 2016.","Arnold Donald","Okay. Thank you. Happy Holidays to you too.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Harry Curtis, Nomura Instinet. Please proceed.","Harry Curtis","Hi, good morning everyone. I wanted to focus on next year's free cash flow. The first question is, is there any repurchase of shares baked into your 2017 earnings guidance? And is there any -- or to what degree have you built in any uplift from your new revenue management system into the 2017 guidance?","Arnold Donald","Okay. Concerning stock repurchase, right know we have about $400 million remaining on the current amount we have designated for that. We will continue to buy back on optimistic basis. And we'll see if we get through that amount over the next period of time and the Board will revisit and see what will be the next step investment because this is clearly the Board decision. So, that's the basic story on that. We do it optimistically, so we don't have a plan per se in terms of factored into guidance.","What was the second part of your question?","Harry Curtis","Well, I wanted to see if the revenue management system was also baked into your yield guidance for next year.","Arnold Donald","It is. We only have about 30% of the inventory for the six brands that have the new tool. Currently we manage because obviously we're well ahead on booking, so it's only effect so much of 2017, but by 2018, we'll have the full impact for the inventory in those six brands.","But we already benefited somewhat from the sharing the best practices across the brands and the development of the two and the sharing of what they do. So, the answer is yes, it is factored in as one of many factors that contribute yield.","David Bernstein","And Harry -- go ahead.","Harry Curtis","And my -- yes, go ahead, sorry David.","David Bernstein","You asked about cash flow for 2017, at the midpoint of our guidance, the cash flow from operation should be close to the $5 billion mark. We do have about $3 billion in CapEx for 2017. So, we do have roughly $2 billion of free cash flow. Our existing dividend is close to $1 billion, so we do have some extra money over and above the dividend to return to shareholders as well as we have some room in our credit metrics to continue to potentially increase that and return free cash flow more to shareholders.","Arnold Donald","You know\u2026","Harry Curtis","For 2017, go ahead.","Arnold Donald","No, you go ahead.","Harry Curtis","Just where I was going with this is I'm just trying to get a sense of if your share repurchase appetite in 2017 could be as strong as it was in 2016?","Arnold Donald","That's going to be board decision as I mentioned we have above $400 million left and we will continue to buy as we have in the past.","Harry Curtis","Okay, I will keep trying.","Arnold Donald","What I can tell you Harry little color on your other question on the revenue management system is obviously we just put in place and there will be continuous learning so we think overtime contribution from another team absolutely love working with the two.","Harry Curtis","Very good. Thanks.","Arnold Donald","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed.","James Hardiman","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. I hope you can give us a little bit more color on the Cuba you had made the announcement that the fathom is transitioning back to P&O, I guess what does that mean for the impact travel experiment and then I guess what happens next, I don\u2019t think, we've gotten an official announcement in terms of the other Brand and when and how many will be going to Cuba, but we are hoping to get an update there?","Arnold Donald","Good morning, James. Happy Holidays. So first of all, we\u2019re going to Cuba again we are really privileged that we were the first in doing -- pave the way for the rest of the industry we still as I mention in the opening remarks or have more calls to Cuba than any other major U.S. Cruise Company.","So we feel very good about our position in Cuba. Along with everyone else, we submitted our request for additional sailing through beginning of June period and thereafter as just the planning cycle in Cuba and we are in a process of receiving the authorizations from Cuba as we speak here now about that. But we have every intention of cruising to Cuba we have expectation one or more of our brands will be approved from June time period on until May s I mentioned we have more sailing team than anyone else.","In terms of the Fathom, Adonia was basically a sort of internal charter on the brand charter to just average to concept and so obviously its position us to introduce in Cuba and we are going to probably \u2013 we are going to go with larger ships and multiple brands in Cuba with regard to the DR we are also going with multiple brands for Fathom, so Fathom is being expanded across the number of brands in DR.","The only ground experienced have resonated greatly with the guest and we will take some of the onboard supplement don't you and travel on to the other brands but emphasis of course is the on the ground experiences in DR and continue to have the opportunity for travelers they have that travel experience and for DR to reap the benefits of the impact of having those travels working alongside impact clear as already in the DR they are doing great work.","James Hardiman","Great. And one of the same lines remind us why the first quarter trend looks to be short of the fiscal full year trend fiscal 2017 trend, I think its 1.5% to 2.5% for the first quarter versus 2.5% for the year, I don\u2019t know if that has anything to do with Cuba or even if Cuba is factored into your yield guidance in any way?","Arnold Donald","It\u2019s nothing to do with Cuba, go ahead David.","David Bernstein","Yes, it\u2019s just mid-point for the first quarter is 2% versus 2.5% approximately for the year. The first quarter had tougher comparisons in the prior year but keep in mind were only talking about a 0.5% here and so we give your best guess for each and every member.","James Hardiman","Great. And I guess just lastly just want to still go back to China obviously you made it pretty clear that China is more about generating positive returns and yields but it's early, maybe just directionally do you think the yields are going to be down again for 2017, is there even a chance that they could grow? And I guess what are the contributing factors there are obviously capacity in China is to be much more manageable in 2017 versus 2016. Seems that you guys are pretty bullish about the improvement in your distribution, but how should I think about that?","Arnold Donald","Well, First of all, you touched on couple of other points there. We have expanded distribution that improves the B2B aspect of what we are doing there. But we're going to have tougher comparisons in the first half of the year in China with yields and so based on what happened in the last half of the year, you might expect yields to be down in the first half of the year comparison basis, but then your expectations are that it will be up in the second half of the year.","So, on balance will see wetlands but China for us is a volume growth story, it\u2019s a return story. The yield that we have experienced this past year are certainly still generating good returns we see possibility for increasing yields, but our focus again is continuing high-level occupancy that we have, continue delivering a great experience the Chinese guests to be in positions to expand.","James Hardiman","Great. Thanks, guys and Happy Holidays.","Arnold Donald","Happy Holidays.","David Bernstein","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar. Please proceed.","Jaime Katz","Hi good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So it seems like you guys are about to launch some sort of new technology initiative at CES and I'm curious given on that CapEx is a little bit higher than we originally anticipated next year, is there is there any sort of level of CapEx associated with whatever new initiatives you guys are going to launch or is there any sort of multiyear costs that we should be thinking about going forward?","Arnold Donald","Yes. Thanks, Jamie for the question. First of all, the capital is been employed in that initiative is kind of part of low level 3% to 5% of our total capital spending that we look at basically research and development innovation. And so we have invested along the way all this time, as we delivered the earnings we delivered in that manner to position us and have the opportunity to introduce this particular -- truly it\u2019s a guest experience it\u2019s driven by technology, but the technology obviously to the guest will be invisible and we're excited about the potential.","The guest ultimately will decide and we're prepared, but fundamentally for your planning purpose, we look at 3% to 5% level of innovation and research and development investment in capital and we feel that is appropriate for company of our scale and it gives us plenty of dollars to try to create breakthroughs which we think obviously this current introduction that will be reviewed -- revealed on January 5th.","Jaime Katz","Okay. And then I think yesterday you guys put out press release saying that new ship in 2019 would be going to Carnival was originally planned to go to maybe P&O Cruises Australia, I am recalling correctly, so I'm curious if there are any new conclusions surrounding the Australian market on given that you're moving the new hardware back to that Caribbean which has clearly been performing very well?","Arnold Donald","Australia remains a big growth market for our cruise growing 20% so I don\u2019t know how many years 10 years plus. So, it was a very strong cruise market. When we make decisions like that, you just have to keep in mind, it's very holistic. There are a gazillion variables that go into play. One obviously Carnival Brand is doing very, very well here in this States, but also we have multiple home ports in the U.S. We distribute fleet around U.S. for Carnival and certain places takes certain ships, certain places kind of certain size ships and so on. And balancing all that out makes the difference.","And similarly to in Australia, certain size ships can fit and when we look at the destinations, but we've had so much success with Carnival, we're looking at expanding the opportunity for Carnival brand while at the same time, still giving really guest-ready and guest-preferred hard well in Australia market. So, there's only so many shipyards, we've only built so many ships a year and we have to allocate things and we're always trying to optimize. But it's holistic decision involving a lot of variables, deployment, itinerary, relative yield contribution, a number of things.","Jaime Katz","Thanks.","David Bernstein","And the second part we announced was the Carnival Splendor moving to P&O Australia. So, we are continuing to grow that brand within Australia.","Jaime Katz","Thank you guys. Happy holidays.","Arnold Donald","Hey, Happy Holidays.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup. Please proceed.","Greg Badishkanian","Great. Thanks. So, just to kind of follow-on to James' question on China. It kind of sounded like net yields for full year 2017 would maybe around flattish year-over-year, at least not far off from flat year-over-year either way. Is that correct? And then also how much of the China business is locked in at this point for 2017?","Arnold Donald","Yes. So, just remember that China represents even with increased next an introduction of the Majestic Princess first built ship for China and our Princess line will introduce, will represent less than 6% of our capacity. So, just keep that in mind.","We'll see where yields end up, okay. Again, it\u2019s a B2B business and in terms of guidance, of course, we put it in, we don't give brand-by-brand and total geography-by-geography yield. So, I won't do it for China either. But we're giving you good description I think of once you kind of get that.","The message we like you guys to hear clearly is that is return under the business and with all the concerns we expressed this year on China as well as concerns expressed in lots of other areas and whatnot. You can see what we're able to deliver and ultimate results.","We're very, very bullish on China long-term. We have great partners and CSSC and we -- our relationship there is growing stronger and stronger. We're moving forward together to help build longstanding sustainable cruise industry in China, which has been declared in the five-year plan by the Chinese government.","So, we're bullish, but it\u2019s a slow walk. We can only send so many ships and so on and so we feel really confident overall.","David Bernstein","And the second part of the question, you had asked about where we stand in China. Given the historical averages where we booked and give or take generally speaking we start the year roughly about half book, but I did indicate before that China is a much later booking market, every country is different. And so they are closer in booking market less than that overall.","Greg Badishkanian","Right. All right. And then that all makes sense, thank you. And then the North American passengers going to Europe, I know that's still small part of your overall mix in Europe for itineraries in Europe its only about 10% that you source from North America but with the broad strength that we've seen, could that have a significant impact and benefit for you if that continues and I understand that the attack in Germany may have a negative impact, but it does seem like that the trend is -- has been pretty strong recently?","Arnold Donald","The trends have been positive overall, but we have to redo a number of itineraries along the way that has cost us in terms of opportunity in 2016. But that is all part of our business and so again on balance, we give guidance the numbers we feel are reasonable. We know the world is a volatile place and so we factor that into everything we do. But sure, anything that's positive, in end obviously helps us and the North American brands have a number of itineraries plan in Europe and our guests are looking forward to them and we're looking forward to get capturing the value for them.","Greg Badishkanian","Yes, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Please proceed.","Robin Farley","Great. Most of my questions have been asked, just kind of one or two follow-ups. Just wanted to clarify on Cuba, what is in your yield guidance your EPS guidance for the year in terms of Cuba, is it just an expectation that one ship not yet specified will continue to operate there from May till the end of the year or does that include perhaps more than that?","Arnold Donald","Yes, so Robin, first of all good morning to you and I'm a little surprised, you're usually much earlier in the calls on your questions.","Robin Farley","I don't know what happened. I'm not sure what happened either.","Arnold Donald","But I'm concerned in Cuba, look, today we have down years 700 passenger ship. So, the reality is you can barely find the numbers. But even though the ship is getting a premium price and is selling out and so on.","And so as you look at it, again, Cuba will be slow expansion and so we'll have additional itineraries going there, so will have more than one brand once we get the final approvals from the Cuban authorities. But they have constraints in the number of birds and the size of the birds and what size ships you can get and so on.","So, financially, to be candid with you is important and the margin is certainly important for the brands. But the most important thing is positioning for the longer haul and positioning to lift overall demand and interest in the Caribbean and ultimately because of that create additional opportunity for capturing more of the value through increase on yields.","And so Cuba is a longer term play, but you have to build it today and that's what we're doing. But in terms of the financial impact on the corporation, you couldn\u2019t find it probably.","Robin Farley","Okay, that's helpful. And then on China and I know that obviously its early to -- and you don't want to give a specific yield guidance for the market, but just on your comment that it's -- the returns will continue to be positive, I don't know what you indicated whether returns would grow or just that they would be positive or more -- other brands. Because my questions with the Majestic going there, I think that's your first newbuild for that market and so would be a higher investment per person than the other tonnage that you have there.","So, it's fair to assume right that that ship is getting a price premium to your other capacity in China. So, I guess that's why I'm surprised that that you wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable same positive yields for the years just given that if returns would to continue to be what they are given that new ship?","Arnold Donald","Well, again, you got to look at the holistic, there is a lot going on there. You got first of all, different course, different seasons. We're one of the few companies that commit a year around, so the Tianjin market is different, the Shanghai market so on and so forth.","So, there's a lots of things that moving that, but here is the real answer fundamental, I don't know I answer your question. Yes, we expect returns overall to be better in 2017 than they were in 2016 and returns have grown reasonably consistently in China.","The most important thing for us is the way we do deployment. We know that the returns are better than what the deployments would have generate for us and that's the key for us and operating, so overall we're lifting our overall performance.","But it does represent 5% of our capacity. So, it did in 2016 and little bit less than 6% in 2017. So, as we move forward, we're looking at building that market, but we're doing in a way where as we grow it, we're seeing higher returns than we would have seen otherwise.","And there's a natural constraint on the pace of growth because we have large addressable markets everywhere in the world that are underpenetrated, everywhere in the world, including in North America. And so we can't send all the ships to China and we need new additional capacity in the other places in the world to optimize the ultimate yield and bottom-line return.","David Bernstein","And remember Robin Majestic gets to China in July, so that's consistent with the comments made -- Arnold made about the first half versus the second half.","Robin Farley","Okay, great. No, that's helpful. Thanks. I mean our channel check show a really nice -- strong premium for Majestic. But I understand that you don't want to commit to anything but, thank you.","Arnold Donald","Thank you, Robin.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.","Jared Shojaian","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. David you indicated that about half of your 2017 capacity is booked at this point. So, my question is what kind of pricing do you need to see on the other half that's not yet booked in order to hit your 2.5% yield guidance? Is it possible that pricing could be down to get to 2.5%, is that your expectation?","David Bernstein","First of all, I didn\u2019t say that exactly half was booked; I said generally speaking that the historical average give or take we enter the year approximately half booked. I wasn\u2019t trying to give you an exact number. I was just trying to do that relative to China being less than that.","So, our pricing is up at this point and we do continue to expect to see pricing continue to be up in the rest of the year and finished the year on an overall basis as we say approximately 2.5%.","Jared Shojaian","Okay. And then just ask that a little bit differently, I mean you've indicated that you're in a better booked position today than you were at this time last year and then you also get the mixed benefit on yield from Seabourn Encore and maybe even get some benefit on -- from the yield management system. So, I guess why is your yield guidance 2.5% when you did 3% this year if you take out the accounting re-class. Are there -- just any headwinds that maybe I'm not appreciating or -- you just looking at this for more of a conservative approach given some of the issues that we felt throughout 2016 for the industry?","Arnold Donald","If you were to take the accounting re-class out as you referenced and looked at the guidance we gave this time last year, you'll see our guidance is actually stronger this year at this time than it was last year.","Keep in mind, we haven\u2019t gotten away season yet. We know the world is a volatile place; we just talked about it and -- even things that happened yesterday. So, we give you our best guidance realizing that the world is full of things - it's full of typhoons and cyclones and hurricane and is filled with unexpected things like Brexit or Zika or whatever. And so we give you the guidance as we did last year and if you look at it, you would say okay they are giving stronger guidance this year at this point time than they did last year, which reflects the difference and the difference is last year were hit on booking as lower price this point in time, now we're had bookings with higher prices at this time.","And so you'll see us give a little strong yield guidance. Now, keep in mind also, you're coming off a higher base. The comparisons are getting tougher and tougher as we grow yields. In the end people take money to the bank not percentages, right. And so the absolute dollar increase I guess so you have to look at all that too. But bottom-line is we're confident, we -- at this point in time with the qualifiers that we haven't gotten away. The world is a strange and mysterious place and it's volatile, but factoring that in and it's been volatile the last many years and we've been delivering and that's our intention for 2017 as well.","Jared Shojaian","Great. Thank you. And if I can just squeeze one more quick one in, would you characterize the demand environment today as being better than what it was two, three months ago?","Arnold Donald","The demand environment, you mean from consumers and general or from potential guests. I would say that two or three months ago, that's a good question. I would say this. Our brands continue to do an outstanding job of exceeding guest expectations when the guests are onboard and they continue to do an outstanding job of creating more demand for their particular targeted segments.","And our public relations more broadly has done a good job of providing an umbrella effect of getting people to increasingly consider cruise when they are thinking about vacation holidays.","The last two to three months were global business. Every year there is a recession somewhere or this or that or whatever and if you would talk in globally for our business, I could not say that the last two or three months I see a change in global consumer attitudes or anything like that consistently. What I can say is we definitely see strength and we've seen strength for a while that we're building on that and taking advantage of it.","Jared Shojaian","Great. Thank you very much.","Arnold Donald","Thank you.","David Bernstein","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of [Indiscernible] with Infiniti Research. Please proceed.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. I'm the lucky one. Congratulations on yet another great quarter. I have kind of lost track of all the sequential beads quarter versus guidance. And that I had one quick question given that comparisons get little bit for in Q2 of next year and now for Q4 2017 given the great result that you just reported, could you qualitatively discuss the cadence of yield that you expect? You discussed China, but again, that's a small piece of the overall puzzle. So, Arnold or David, if you could just give us some sort of a direction as to the curve?","David Bernstein","That's a very hard. There's so many moving parts and so many moving pieces particularly when you get out to the fourth quarter where we have a very small -- relatively a very small percentage book. So, we give you our best guess for the year, we give you our best guess for the next quarter. It's fair to say that given the two numbers, the remaining three quarters of the year is above the 2.5% because we have 2% for the first quarter. And at this point in time that is about as much information as we can give.","Unidentified Analyst","It's just difficult for the rest of us and we have even less information than you guys. So, I was sneaking that maybe it\u2019s a bell curve that's all I was hoping for. Arnold, since you're laughing can you say yes?","Arnold Donald","I can't say yes to a bell curve. I wish things were that orderly, but they are not. But thank you for your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, I appreciate that. Thank you again for taking my call.","Arnold Donald","As you say. Thank you.","Arnold Donald","Hey everyone, a sincere Happy Holidays. Thanks for your continued interest. We will obviously as always -- our people will work very hard to exceed the expectations we put in place and we hope everyone has a safe and wonderful holiday. And I hope some of you are taking a cruise.","David Bernstein","Happy Holidays.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a great day everyone."],"4372":["Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) Q1 2016 Earnings Conference Call March 30, 2016 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Arnold Donald - President and Chief Executive Officer","Micky Arison - Chairman of the Board","David Bernstein - Chief Financial Officer","Beth Roberts - Vice President, Investor Relations","Analysts","Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs","Robin Farley - UBS","Harry Curtis - Nomura","James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays","Jaime Katz - Morningstar","Greg Badishkanian - Citigroup","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo Securities","Kevin Milota - JPMorgan","Ian Rennardson - Jefferies","Stuart Gordon - Berenberg","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research","Dan McKenzie - Buckingham Research","Arnold Donald","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. This is Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation & plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning.","Today I am joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison, via phone from Italy; as well as David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Roberts, who heads up our Investor Relations, here with me in Miami.","Before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking. Therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release.","Our company is off to a strong start this year, with first quarter adjusted earnings nearly double the prior year and well above the high-end of our December guidance range. The first quarter results combined with our strong book position has enabled us to increase the midpoint of our previous guidance range by $0.05 and raise the floor on our full year earnings expectations.","I am proud to acknowledge all of our employees globally for the industry-leading guest experience efforts that are essential to our sustained earnings improvement. I especially thank our travel agent partners for the critical role they play in connecting guests with our great brand experiences.","It was reinforcing to see revenue yield growth of 5.7% in constant currency, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of mid single-digit yield improvement. We enjoyed ticket price improvements for both our North American and our EAA brands, with particularly robust ticket price improvements in our core Caribbean itinerary, which represent 47% of our first quarter deployment.","We drove revenue yield growth at Costa by creating relative scarcity through our brand team success and increasing demand via ongoing guest experience efforts, coupled with new impactful creative featuring Shakira. While at the same time we reduced supplies in more challenging trading environment in Southern Europe by transferring Costa capacity to China.","As you'll recall, our Costa brand was the first global cruise lines to homeport in China back in 2006. Today we are the largest in China and the first global cruise company with six ships based there across two of our brands, Costa and Princess, representing nearly half of the Chinese cruise industry.","While it represents less than 5% of our global capacity, for us China continues to be a promising unit growth opportunity. China has quickly become the world's largest outbound travel market at an estimated 135 million strong, yet just over 1 million cruise today. We expect to continue to grow over time, and have further plans for AIDA and Carnival Cruise Line to enter China in the near future.","China contributed to our strong quarterly results. We absorbed over 60% more capacity there and enjoyed strong profit improvements and return on invested capital accretion. At the same time, the capacity shift to China help create relative scarcity in our other markets, supporting global revenue yield growth.","Beyond China, during the quarter, we made further progress globally in creating demand for all our brands in excess of measured capacity growth. Part of that demand creation is the excitement around the much anticipated deliveries of AIDAprima, and I can tell you, she is well worth the wait. The ship is absolutely fantastic. The first of a next-generation platform for AIDA that combines leading-edge environmental attributes and well designed features that foster an exceptional guest experience.","All of her features, whether racing waterslides, a lazy river, multiple climbing wall, an expansive German spa, an ice rink for skating for hockey, for curling, and even a traditional Christmas market, together create an experience that truly resonates with AIDA's nearly exclusively German guests.","And we have additional opportunity for demand creation in just a few short days with the delivery of Holland America's new flagship, Koningsdam. Koningsdam was designed with our Holland America guest in mind, and to reintroduce Holland America to those who have yet to experience our award-winning service, our five-star dining, our expensive enrichment programs and compelling worldwide itineraries.","Our new flagship will offer fine dining in several alternative restaurants, including a new French seafood brasserie and a new immersive farm-to-table dinner experience in the Culinary Arts Center.","Part of enhancing an already great Holland America guest experience, includes taking onboard entertainment to a whole new level. We have carefully engineered a Music Walk area, which showcases different genres by offering chamber music in Lincoln Center Stage, rocking the crowd with chart-topping instant Billboard Onboard and bringing the best of Memphis music to sea and our popular B.B. King's Blues Club. Responding to our guest, our new flagship will feature Holland America Lines first ever purpose-built staterooms for families as well as single staterooms.","Newbuilds will also provide additional demand creation opportunities later this year as well, with the delivery of Carnival Vista followed by Seabourn Encore. When it comes to ships, newbuilds are not the only way to stimulate demand creation.","We continue to invest in our existing fleet to further enhance guest experiences, including the recent recreation of Holland America's Eurodam, incorporating many of the same experiences onboard as Koningsdam. In addition, we are undergoing an expensive remastering of Cunard's Queen Mary 2 later this year.","Destinations are often a powerful tool for demand creation as well, especially when combined with effective public relation. Last week, we made history, when we became the first U.S. cruise operator in over 50 years to receive Cuban approval to bring U.S. cruise guest directly from the U.S. to Cuba. We made worldwide news, showcasing cruise in a very positive light, with nearly 5 billion media impressions and still counting.","We very much look forward to launching our historic Cuba inaugural season in May with Fathom, initially with itineraries including Havana, Cienfuegos and Santiago de Cuba. We believe there is no better way to experience so much of Cuba in seven days than with the enriching guest experience on our premium Fathom brand.","As the Adonia carries just 700 guests per sailing, if you have any interest in seeing Cuba, do an extraordinary travel experience, I sincerely recommend you book now. Concerning the future of cruises in Cuba, we have already begun the process for approval for other brands to sail for Cuba in the months and years ahead.","Now, beyond ships and destinations, our ongoing marketing and promotional efforts are also a part of demand creation. As part of our effort to keep cruise in the forefront of vacationers' minds, Princess is airing a new reality based show on primetime U.K. television entitled, The Cruise.","The documentary follow the lives of our amazing crew and guest onboard, Regal Princess, through a six-week series. In fact, we've already seen a 40% increase in web traffic for Princess in the U.K. since the show began airing. Also airing in the U.K., P&O cruise's Battlechefs, a new cookery contest set at sea onboard Britannia, featuring five celebrities testing their culinary skills and judged by celebrity chef Marco Pierre White.","In Italy, Costa Fortuna was to set up a major motion picture, Vacanze ai Caraibi, holidays in the Caribbean, launched early in the quarter, partially cast with Costa crew members. More recently an episode on Italian reality TV I colori dell'amore, the colors of love, was based on the love story between two young Costa crew members, who met onboard.","In North America, just last week, Carnival Cruise Line was featured nightly on the ever-popular television show, Wheel of Fortune. While early in the quarter, Carnival announced an exceptional partnership with Grammy Award winning country music superstar Carrie Underwood and Operation Homefront, supporting now U.S. Military personnel. Media coverage from that announcement alone generated more than 1 billion media impressions and our Carnival brand continues to outperform.","Also in North America, we partnered with AT&T and Samsung to create a virtual reality experience that showcased in nearly 1,200 AT&T stores, promoting consideration for cruise, while allowing new to cruise to virtually experience a cruise vacation. We estimate nearly 400,000 people have already had the virtual reality experience, showcasing our portfolio of leading brands. All of these efforts heighten global awareness and consideration for our [ph] world leading cruise line, as we continue to capture a greater share of the vacation suitcase.","During the quarter, we continue to make progress on cross-brand efforts to leverage our scale. On the revenue side, work on our revenue yield optimizing system continues, and the summer of 2016 will be rolled out on 30% of our inventory. The prototype will cost the yield uplift as well as inspire improvements for final system development.","So as most of this year's bookings will be behind us by the summer, we look forward to a greater contribution on this effort in 2017. And on the cost side, work in our procurement area continues. We have negotiations underway on 16 separate purchasing categories with 22 more RFPs outstanding. All of which will contribute to our stated $75 million of expected cost savings in 2016.","Our ongoing operational improvement is a testament to the success of our combined efforts to create demand in excess of measured capacity growth and to leverage our scale. The strong first quarter we have enjoyed, affirms our conviction to deliver this year's earnings forecast and accelerates progress to our double-digit return on invested capital. We remain well on track for the delivery of over 8.5% return on invested capital this year and crossing the double-digit threshold in the next two to three years.","At the same time, we have accelerated our return of capital to shareholders. Since resuming our stock repurchase program late last year, we have completed our first $1 billion share repurchase authorization and are well into our second billion, bringing the cumulative total of purchase to date to $1.3 billion and approximately 27 million shares. We plan to continue to return free cash flow to shareholders, with our strong balance sheet and leverage ratios now comfortably at the better end of our targeted range.","And now, I will turn the call over to David.","David Bernstein","Thank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note, all of my references to revenue ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 first quarter results. Then I'll provide some insights on booking trends and finish up with an update on our full year 2016 guidance.","Our adjusted EPS for the first quarter was $0.39. This was $0.09 above the midpoint of our December guidance, despite $0.01 drag from fuel and currency. The improvement was essentially driven by two things; $0.07 from net ticket revenue yields, which benefited from stronger pricing on closing bookings on both sides of the Atlantic; and $0.03 from lower net cruise cost, excluding fuel, as a result of timing of certain expenses between the quarters.","Now, let's turn to the first quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased almost 4%. Our total net revenue yields were up 5.7%.","Let's break apart the two components of net revenue yields. Net ticket yields were up almost 7%. As Arnold indicated, we enjoy ticket price improvements on both sides of the Atlantic. The increase was driven by the strength of pricing in the Caribbean, which represented 47% of our capacity in the quarter.","In addition, our European, Australian and Asian brands, also known as our EAA brand, showed solid price improvements on the year round European program. Onboard and other yields increased almost 3%, in line with December guidance. The increase was mainly related to bar, casino and communications, as our efforts in these areas continue to pay dividend.","Net cruise cost per ALBD, excluding fuel, were up about 1.5%, which was less than planned in our December guidance, again due to the timing of expenses between the quarters. In summary, first quarter adjusted EPS was $0.19 higher than the prior year, driven by operational improvements worth $0.15 and favorable net impact of lower fuel prices and currency worth $0.03.","Now, let's turn to booking trends for 2016. Bookings during this year's wave season were strong. Volumes are ahead of last year's historically high level at higher prices. At this point in time, for the remaining three quarters of 2016, cumulative fleet-wide bookings are well ahead at slightly higher prices. The fact that we are well ahead on the book position with less inventory left to sell for the remainder of the year compared to last year, bodes well for pricing over the next few months.","Now, let's drill down into the cumulative fleet-wide book position. First, for our North American brand. Caribbean occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at nicely higher prices. For Alaska, occupancy is in line with the prior year, also at nicely higher prices.","2015 was a great Alaskan season, and I'm happy to say 2016 is shaping up to be even better. For the seasonal European program, occupancy is nicely ahead of the prior year at lower prices, driven by the geopolitical risk impacting the Mediterranean trade as anticipated in our guidance.","Secondly, for our EAA brand. For Europe, occupancy is ahead of the prior year at slightly higher prices. Australia and Asia are consistent with our prior guidance. While we are behind on pricing and not surprisingly behind on percentage occupancy, given our over 60% increase in China capacity and our significant increase in Australia capacity, remember, Asia and particularly China is the unit growth opportunity and we are achieving strong unit profits and returns that exceed our corporate average.","Finally, I want to provide you with an update on our full year 2016 guidance. As Arnold indicated, our first quarter results combined with strong book position enables us to increase the midpoint of our previous guidance range by $0.05 and raise the floor on our earnings expectations for the year.","Our 2016 March guidance is now $3.20 to $3.40. The $0.05 improvement was driven by improved net revenue yields worth $0.04 and the accretive impact from the additional shares we repurchased since our December call worth $0.05. These improvements were partially offset by $0.04 drag from fuel and currency.","Net cruise cost without fuel per ALBD are still expected to be up approximately 2%. No change from our December guidance. While we were favorable to the guidance for the first quarter, as I previously indicated, the favorability was due to the timing of expenses between the quarters.","Remember that while the year is expected to be up approximately 2%, there are differences between the quarters. The first quarter was up about 1.5%, while the guidance for the second quarter is expected to be up only 0.5% to 1.5%.","However, for the third quarter, we expect net cruise cost without fuel per ALBD to be up 5% to 6%, driven by the remastering of Queen Mary 2 in dry dock and higher advertising expense. Offsetting that, however, is the expectation that cost will be down slightly in the fourth quarter.","So far this fiscal year, we have repurchased over 21 million of our shares, and we still have almost 700 million left under the second $1 billion share repurchases authorization that was approved by the Board of Directors just two months ago. Our March guidance EPS calculations assume approximately 760 million shares outstanding on a weighted average basis.","On a final note, for your planning purposes, I wanted to let you know that we expect our June conference call to be a little later in June than usual to allow some extra time for quarter-end reconciliation and analysis, given that we are currently in the process of implementing a significant upgrade to our Oracle enterprise reporting platform, which includes moving to a single instance of the general ledger as we further leverage our scale.","And now, I'll turn the call back over to Arnold.","Arnold Donald","Thank you, David. Operator, please open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.","Steven Kent","A couple of questions. One, first can you just -- I think it was David, you just made some comments on China and I want to understand them. Are you saying that pricing is still higher in China than the rest of the world? You're adding capacity in China and that this is a unit growth story? I wanted to understand those two things.","So to me it sounds like almost like you're simply adding more capacity at a higher price relative to the rest of the fleet, but that the pricing maybe is not as high as it was maybe last year, is that what you're saying? And then, one other thing on this China opportunity, which I think it's outsize attention, because it really is a huge opportunity and is a big pricing opportunity too is, how were the travel agent doing in that market? Is there anything we can read from them and their reaction to the capacity that is coming in?","Arnold Donald","I'll answer the travel agent, or who we call the distributors in China, questions first. We don't have direct line of sight into their profitability, but what I can tell you is that our relationships are strong, they continue to book with us. Our actual occupancies on sailings are the same and we're seeing great results. And we see no easing of interest or demand or anything from the distributors. And the best line of sight we have is that the relationship is working for us and for them, and is definitely working for us.","You had a question, I'll let David answer directly the question you asked of him.","David Bernstein","Steve the yields are higher than the group average on the ticket prices, but that's not really our key metric. I mean, operating income per ALBD is really the key metric and there too deals are higher. So that is what we're looking at as a metric in terms of overall for China.","But one other thing I will add, keep in mind, is since mid last year, the Renminbi is also devalued by 7%. So when you're looking at an apples-to-apples comparison on a current dollar basis, that does affect the overall ticket yield and the overall yields for our China business.","Arnold Donald","I think, Steve, the main point is China is a very positive story for us, it's strong, it's a contributor, it only represents 5% of our capacity today. So we were well-positioned from that regard as well. But it's definitely a nice add and we certainly have benefited from it and see continued strength.","David Bernstein","And let's not forget the benefit that we see in the rest of the world, as a result of the growth in China and the more measured capacity growth in the established market, which is 95% of our business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin Farley","I have two questions, one is, I'm just curious, there is no change in your full year yield guidance, but Q1 obviously came in quite a bit stronger. That sort of implies that your next three quarters guidance is lower from where you thought it was, which I think is not the case, and you're probably just being conservative. So I wonder if you could -- if anything I would think, the strength of the close in bookings in Q1 would lead you to feel better about the next three quarters. So I wondered if you can just sort of address that.","David Bernstein","Well, Robin, as I indicated in my comments, the first quarter our revenue yield was worth $0.07, it beat on the guidance. So $0.07, keep in mind, is 0.4 for us in total in terms of the full year yield. And when you take a look at it our yield guidance for the year was approximately 3%. So depending on where you are, if you're 2\/10 of a percent below that, and now you're 2\/10 a percent above that, so essentially it's still approximately 3%, and the rest of the year it didn't change.","Robin Farley","And to the strength of the close in is not changing your view on the next three quarters?","Arnold Donald","Well, obviously, we're going to strive to do better, but what we experienced so far, it gives us conviction to maintain our guidance, and actually we've increase guidance by a nickel. And we feel very positive about our booking situation, so obviously we're going to strive to do even better. But at this point, with all the dynamics around the rest of the world, and the fact that the Caribbean, which has been very strong for us becomes a smaller percent of the total in the subsequent quarters, we think it's prudent to stick with the guidance we've given.","Robin Farley","And then my other question was just on China, and you talked about the tremendous potential for unit growth there. Can you just put a little color around, the Carnival brand originally was going to send a ship there for the first time in '17, it sounds like that is now going to be '18. Is that just sort of taking time to market a new brand that you wanted to give a little more lead time to, or just given -- obviously, the volume growth in China?","Arnold Donald","The CCL decision, the Carnival brand decision in China, when they originally gave their estimate, it was a preliminary thing. As they got into the detailed deployment planning, we have a number of home ports here in the U.S. serviced by the brand. And as they looked at moving ships, ships fit in certain ports, not in other, so on and so forth, it just became prudent for them to look at launching in '18 rather than in '17, but it's strictly around deployment planning, they had nothing to do with the environment in China.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura.","Harry Curtis","A follow up question on the booking and yield strength. Just turning to Europe for a second, can you give us a sense of the recent incident in Brussels and whether or not that's had any impact? And, David, I think that I didn't catch fully your outlook for Europe based on your current booking strength. I think you said, it was slightly higher, but I didn't catch the occupancy?","Arnold Donald","First of all, obviously our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their families in the Brussels situations. It's really too early for us to know the exact impact of that. Historically, there has been some temporary impact from events like this and the level of the impact depends on a lot of different factors.","But historically, eventually people adapt. We don't know exactly where we're in the process at this point, but right now we see no reason to change guidance. And as you know, our philosophy is, things happen every year, and we anticipate that without knowing exactly where or what things will happen and we factor that in to an extent, so it's too early to see the full fallout of that, but at this point in time, we're comfortable with the guidance that we've given and see no reason to change it.","David Bernstein","And far as the booking position, for our EAA brands, which really is the majority of our European program, we said that for Europe, occupancy is ahead of the prior year, at slightly higher prices. And for the seasonal programs for our North American brand, which is really just like 5% of our overall capacity for the company, we said that occupancy was nicely ahead, but the pricing was a little bit lower because of the geopolitical risk and the things that Arnold had indicated.","Harry Curtis","And then my follow-up question speaks to the share count assumption. David, you mentioned, but I'm not sure I caught this right that the guidance for the balance of the year assumed a fully diluted share count of 760 million shares. Is that correct?","David Bernstein","That was for the whole year. And as I think I had indicated in the December call, the way we do our guidance is we include the shares that we purchased to date, because as we've always said, our share repurchase program is opportunistic, so built into our guidance, does not include any future share repurchases. And as I mentioned, we do have almost $700 million left on that second $1 billion, so we do have the opportunity to continue to repurchase.","Harry Curtis","You anticipated my last question, thanks very much, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Wedbush Securities.","James Hardiman","So just a real quick clarification on some of what's been going on in Southern Mediterranean based on some of the terrorist attacks. Have you had to move any itineraries around at all? And if so, does not have any impact on your numbers?","Arnold Donald","There is always in every year some itinerary adjustments. And we go where people want to go. So if we see there is a heavy reaction from guests about going to particular itinerary we have previously planned, obliviously we will choose to alter that. So yes, there have been some changes in some of the ports in Turkey, for example, this year.","We still have a number of brands going to Turkey. And we are in constant contact with every intelligence agency in the world and all the various security and enforcement agencies as well. Safety to our guests is number one. But frankly, right now, we see more just, it was driving our decision making is the desire of guests to go to locations, and that's where we are right now.","James Hardiman","And then just maybe walk us through the changes in fuel and currency, since the last time you guys reported. The constant currency numbers for both yields and costs look to be unchanged, but the current currency numbers look to be slightly better for both. Now this might just be a rounding thing and these are all approximate estimates or maybe it's a function of the repositioning of ships.","But normally sort of things get better for yields and worse for cost or vice versa. It seems like they got a little bit better with respect to FX. And then, with the fuel, certainly the crude oil prices that we look at have gotten a little bit worse, although your guidance for the year seems to have gotten a tad better. Just walk us through some of the puts and takes there.","David Bernstein","I'll start with fuel. You probably noticed that overall, for the year, our guidance is $2 per metric ton better. At the moment in time that we did the December call versus our March guidance, I mean Brent was within $1. The crack spread was virtually the same. So the numbers moved very little on the fuel side. Of course, we have a little benefit there. We had offsetting that with some additional derivative losses. So the overall fuel number was negligible in terms of a change from our December guidance.","Currency did move against us. And remember, we have a basket of currencies, so it depends on the movement. The one currency from December through March that moved the most was the British pound. And if you look back, we were using $1.51 as the rate for the British pound back in December. The rate now, I think in our press release in the second quarter was like $1.43, so there was like a 5% movement. So depending on what you're looking at because of the different basket in currencies and the movements, the British pound is the biggest impact. And that was a negative impact on our bottomline. And that's what drove the majority of the currency drag.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix","David, just I wanted to clarify some commentary that was in the release in the outlook section, please. When you were talking about the cumulative advance bookings for the first three quarters of 2016, in the release, it said that they're well ahead of the prior year at slightly higher constant currency prices. And then in the December release, you talked about 2016 in the context of slightly higher prices. So I was just wondering is there any difference in the two outlooks?","Beth Roberts","No, they're both constant currencies.","Felicia Hendrix","And then also, Arnold, on the last call you had talked about the high end of the guidance range, the net yield guidance range for the year is being 4%. I know you reiterated the 3%, but just wondering, if you are looking at the high end simply.","David Bernstein","Yes, I think, Robin, the reason we had said -- ","Beth Roberts","Felicia.","David Bernstein","Felicia, sorry, I apologize. The reason why we had said the high end of the range was 4%, it related to the $3.40. And when you start looking at the midpoint of our guidance, it was a $0.30 range and a point of yield is $0.15. So we had said, the $3.40 related to a 1% higher yield or 4%. So obviously, time has gone on and we narrowed the range down to a $0.20 range. But we're giving you the best estimate that we can. It's still relatively close to approximately 4% at the high end.","Felicia Hendrix","And then can you just refresh us in terms of how much of that is ticket and onboard? Has that changed?","David Bernstein","It really hasn't change significantly from the December guidance, the ticket and onboard. The December guidance, we used about 2% for onboard. And it was a little over 3% for ticket, and it [ph] did round into approximately 3%.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar.","Jamie Katz","My first question is on this revenue management yield system that you guys are using across your brands. And I think the commentary you guys indicated that about 30% of the inventory would be up over the course of the year. And I am curious, first, when that might be completed if all the brands will eventually be on it? And there was a comment that there would be some yield uplift, so I guess I'm am curious what your expectations for benefit there are?","Arnold Donald","So on the revenue management tool, that we're implementing we have six of our brands that initially will be on the new tool. When it's implemented this summer, we'll only have about 30% of their collective inventory going through the tool. Obviously, that will ramp up over time and we'll have more inventory that goes through it.","By the time is up and running, '16 will be pretty much booked, and so the real impact we won't see until '17. But I have to tell you, we are enjoying some benefits now just from the brands collaborating and working on the tool together, sharing lots of information. There is improved decision making going on, on revenue management all along the way, and is definitely contributing to some of the yield improvements that we have enjoyed the past few quarters, including us this past quarter.","So overtime, when we go to the next phase of the tool, which will be implemented next year, pretty much all the brands will be using the tool. We have some brands that have already more sophisticated tools than others. And this to, both base flow that will be at one level of sophistication, we put the next layer on top, it will be at a whole another level of sophistication, so we'll have a build of impact over the next few years from having the tool. And it will make a difference.","Jaime Katz","And then I have sort of an esoteric question for you guys. How do you think about differentiating the brands that are going into the China market versus the competitors? Obviously, Costa has been there for some time, there is a lot more brand awareness than maybe some of the other brands. But I think the messaging going through the travel agents, the way that the distribution network there works might be a little skewed. So I am curious if there is an easy way to articulate how Carnival's brands in the region are different and maybe a better value to those consumers?","Arnold Donald","The easiest way to do it is to actually have the distributors experience the brands, because once they go on to ships and experience the brands, the difference is dramatic and very much get a very different feel from one brand to the next in terms of what type of cruise experience it is.","And because those brands resonate around the world across different, what we call, psychographic segment, with 1.3 billion people, China is very capable absorbing lots of different brand. And so we see it, at this stage, as we just have a toe in the water. There is an 135 million estimated outbound Chinese tourist today already. And less than 1 million of them or maybe roughly 1 million of them are cruising today. So we haven't even begun to touch the surface hardly, so there's plenty of room and capacity.","Our belief is that at the consuming level, at the guest level, that in the price ranges we're in, the guest today are relatively price inelastic, whether I'm in Australia -- I was in Cuba last week, Mainland Chinese filled the paladar that I was in the private restaurant in Havana, I was in. And so they have money, they're able to travel. They're not exactly shopping for price. They fill up the retail outlet and spend several levels higher than the typical tourist would from other places in the world.","So we don't see any major barriers at this point except, as you just referred, good communication, execution, training the distribution system, giving them the exposure they need, so they can represent the various brands well. We think there is plenty of room for everybody, for several of our brands, and we're going to bring AIDA in, in '17, and the Carnival brand right now is scheduled to go in, in '18.","Jaime Katz","And then lastly, just a housekeeping question. With so much capacity coming on can you guys offer your outlook for D&A in the current year?","Beth Roberts","$1.716 billion to $1.780 is the range for the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.","Greg Badishkanian","Just to put the Brussels impact in perspective, kind of comparing it to the Paris attacks, any change in behavior that you have seen that were different than the initial 10 days or so with North American sourced passengers versus European sourced, as well as cancellation rates?","Arnold Donald","That again, it's early. In Paris, there was impact on bookings, which faded pretty quickly. May have had some net minor impact on results, but again, it's one of many things affecting us in Europe, and we factor that into our guidance, but its still early for Brussels. We haven't seen anything dramatic yet. The question is how things build and so on. But frankly, again, we've kind of have it in our guidance, barring some major dramatic shift in reactions.","Greg Badishkanian","So nothing dramatic, that's [multiple speakers].","Arnold Donald","Nothing dramatic, no.","Greg Badishkanian","And then moving just to Cuba, and kind of thinking about the opportunity. And congratulations, by the way, in getting your ship there. How quickly before you think that you'll be able to ramp up capacity in Cuban? I know there is a regulatory perspective and then there is just a logistical perspective?","Arnold Donald","You nailed it, both. First of all regulatory first, so we already are talking to Cuba obviously about the other brands and when might they come, and which ports, and so on and so forth. We're looking forward to working with Cuba to help develop the cruise industry there. We think, again, it's is a different story than china, but it's similar and that there's room for everybody. And we're looking it as a refresher for the Caribbean.","We think it's going to help us. It's going to help the industry. It's going to help the Caribbean. And it is certainly going to help Cuba. So we're excited. We're very honored and privileged to have been given the honor of being first for approval by Cuba. And we're really enjoying the working relationship and looking forward to working with them.","In terms of timing of all this, the logistics do matter too, because our ships, we just talked about, the brands being booked by the summer for '16 pretty much. And so itineraries have been established, guests are planning on going places. As we get additional brands approved by Cuba, those will have to adapt to their current itinerary planning schedule. So practically speaking, while we may have some additional itineraries in 2016, you're probably looking at 2017 for any kind of significant impact.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities.","Tim Conder","Just a couple clarification questions. One, on your yield guidance, the basically 1% difference due to the change in accounting that you called out in December, is that built into the guidance now or not? I just want to clarify that? And then secondly, David, I think you -- or Arnold, when you were commenting on China relative to one of the earlier questions, just to clarify, did you say at this point yields were up, down, as they are looking for the year?","Arnold Donald","First of all in China, again, it's a unit growth story. We want to keep emphasizing that. But to answer your question, yes, ticket yields are higher than the average for the fleet, and they're forecasted to be that for the year. So that's the truth. But we don't want you guys over focusing on yield, because the real story is the great accretion and earnings that we're getting from China and it is going to be a volume growth story for a while, because at the very beginning, we're nascent in that market, and there is just so much potential in that market. In terms of [multiple speakers].","David Bernstein","The other question was about the counting reclassification, which yes, we built into the guidance in December and we built that into the guidance in March. There is no change in the methodology there. And it is about 1%.","Tim Conder","And, Arnold, I apologize, it was just my question and clarification on China was just more -- I totally understand it's a unit growth story and that they're the highest in the world, and it's a positive mix as things continue to grow. But just more on a year-over-year comparison, flat, slightly down?","Arnold Donald","We've never given a range on yields in China, but yields are down on just a year-to-year basis, but we've never given a range and wouldn't do so now.","Tim Conder","And then to stay kind of on that versus the rest of the world, any color for the industry that you could comment on as to how maybe the tiny yields combined are different relative to say North America or Europe?","Arnold Donald","No, I don't have color for you on that.","Tim Conder","And then two other things on yield and that will be it. The implied net yields in your guidance for the year, just by major geographic region, Europe, Asia, North America? And then specifically related to the Brits and onboard spending, anything that you're seeing given the pound depreciation that you have seen here since the beginning of the year or over the last six months in onboard spending trends by Brits in particular?","Arnold Donald","Just onboard in general, onboard revenues for us has increased increase ever year over the last, I don't know, 10 to 12 years, except one. And so onboard revenues tend to increase every year and your question is how much. Last year, we had a large percentage increase on onboard revenues overall. And this year, we've seen again a increase on top of that, not necessarily at the same level as last year, but a nice increase.","And so the correlation to economies and all that tend not to -- we have difficulty tracking that and correlating in any specific way even the degree of increase in onboard revenue isn't always correlated to particular economic conditions in a given destination market or given source market. And so there's just so many variables that come into that, not the least of which is us constantly giving guests more of what they want.","And if you do that, the guests onboard will spend more. And that's really, the issue for us is always tweaking that and figuring out exactly what do guests want, so we give it to them in the way they want it, what they want in the way they want it. And we continue to grow. So to be honest with you, we haven't seen -- we've tried it every which way and we just haven't seen tight correlations to general economic trends.","David Bernstein","And also keep in mind, that the overwhelming majority of our British guests sail on P&O Cruises, which is the British pound onboard, so as far as they're concerned, there really is no change. Of course, it does affect on a translation basis, those onboard revenues into U.S. dollars, but it doesn't change their spending patterns onboard.","And as far as the overall cruise revenue yields are concerned, we have talked in December, between our North America brands and our EAA brands. We were expecting increases in both segments of our business. The increases were slightly better in the North American brands than the EAA brands. Once you net out the accounting reclassification, which I had mentioned, affected the EAA brands in December.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Milota with JPMorgan.","Kevin Milota","Just have two quick ones here. First, obviously, China fairly small right now in terms of total capacity at 5%. With your capacity introductions in '17 and '18, could you give us a sense for where your total -- where those capacity stats will be in those years? And then secondly, I guess, for David on fuel. At current fuel levels could you give us a sense for what's baked into the $3.20 to $3.40 guidance as it relates to the unrealized losses from your derivatives?","Arnold Donald","First of all on China, as you know the industry, believe it or not, is capacity constrained because of the limited number of shipyards to build ships. And obviously, we've got partnerships with both, Fincantieri, and with Meyer in Germany, in terms of securing slots to enhance our fleet.","Having said that, in China, we can't grow too fast, because just the limited availability of ships, so we'll probably be by 2020 somewhere in the 8% to 9% range of our fleet, which means, most of the growth in capacity we have will actually be going to China. And that means, that we'll be growing at a much slower rate in the rest of the world markets, 1% to 2% there, while big percentage increases in China, but in terms of absolute number of ships still relatively small compared to the latent demand that exists in the country.","So to answer your question by 2020, depending on how things go, and that's the beauty of this, we have flexibility. Depending on how things go we could be 8% and 9% of our capacity in China. And that means, therefore, that we didn't grow a lot in the rest of the world, but that fits with our measured capacity growth overall plan to help create relative scarcity.","We can change the drive demand to create excess demand relative to that measured capacity, which obviously allows us to capture or the value gap that currently exists between land-based vacations and cruise. We're still a much better value than land-based vacations and we have lots of room to move. David?","David Bernstein","And as far as the derivatives, you said unrealized, but I think what you meant is how much was in our guidance in terms of realized losses on the fuel derivatives for the year and the number is about $330 million of realized losses.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ian Rennardson with Jefferies.","Ian Rennardson","Just a couple of questions for you. How much more are you sold than this time last year? Is it 5%, is it 10%, is it 20%? Could you give us a sort of numerical answer, please? And moving on to yield expectations, Q2, 1.5% to 2.5% growth at constant currency after a very strong end to Q1, you mentioned close in pricing, why this sort of slight disconnect, please?","David Bernstein","So we are ahead on bookings, but we don't give the details for competitive reasons about exactly what percentage points we are ahead. So we just rather leave it more general. And as far as the comparisons on the quarterly basis, the second quarter is lower than the first quarter, but you got to remember, you got to look back against the prior year, the second quarter last year was much stronger than the first quarter.","We were up 2% more in the second quarter. So it has a tougher comparison in the prior year. As well as the fact that, in the first quarter this year, we had indicated, we were 47% in the Caribbean versus 30% in the second quarter. The Caribbean was a very strong market for us. And so you are seeing some differences between the first and second quarter in terms of yield increases.","Arnold Donald","But that yield improvement in the second quarter, obviously, is consistent with the overall guidance. And it's going to lead us to 20% or better at the midpoint of our current guidance earnings improvement year-over-year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stuart Gordon with Berenberg.","Stuart Gordon","Just a quick question on the close in bookings, have obviously been very strong and held beat on the yield. Could you give an indication as to whether this has been helped by less sort of onboard concessions that's helped drive up that ticket price rather than driving up onboard spend?","David Bernstein","When we package -- what you're talking about is some value-added packages. And when we provide those value-added packages, we do segregate a portion of the revenue and record it in onboard. So you wouldn't see an artificial drive-up in ticket prices from a value-added package.","Stuart Gordon","But did you have to give away less value added packages in the close in of this quarter, which than perhaps has been the case in previous quarters?","Arnold Donald","Well, certainly, compared to the prior quarter, the yields are up significantly. So overall pricing at total was stronger, whichever way you want to look at it. And so that means, I don't know whether they gave more packages out or not, but again, that would have been reflected on our onboard versus ticket. But the practical reality across the fleet, we have so many different brands, but across the fleet overall close in was much stronger this year than last period. So that means that they reduced pricing less.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research.","Jared Shojaian","Have you guys stopped hedging fuel? It looks like you haven't put on anything new for a while. Can you just give us an update on your current policy here?","Arnold Donald","Well, we had collars that went out a number of years. And right now, we continue to live with those, as you can see from the derivative losses. So at this point in time, we evaluated constantly to see what we should do. In the past, we did it to avoid a significant spike in fuel pricing that could have created any kind of short-term cash issues. And we don't see, at this point in time, a need to do anything. We are collared on all the way into 2018 at various levels. I think next year is -- David?","David Bernstein","Next year, we've got 8.1 million barrels collard.","Arnold Donald","Which is what percent?","David Bernstein","A little over 50%, and 5.4 million barrels in 2018, which is less than 50%. But as Arnold said, we're collared out almost three years. So we're comfortable with our current position. We constantly talk about it and analyze it and think about it. But as you said, we haven't done any fuel derivatives since it was October of '14. And we'll give it more consideration as we go forward.","Jared Shojaian","And then should we expect the pace of your buybacks year-to-date to continue throughout the balance of the year? And if so, are you comfortable financing CapEx in order to do that? And if not, can you just help us understand why you wouldn't take on some incremental debt right now, while still being able to maintain the investment-grade credit rating?","Arnold Donald","Well, yes, you bet. First of all, we do have an authorization. We will do as we've done in the past, which is opportunistically use that authorization. Beyond that, that's a Board decision. The Board is constantly looking at it. In terms of our debt position, we're, as you can tell by our balance sheet, in a pretty good shape. I'll let David add any additional color you would like. Go ahead, David.","David Bernstein","We have said many times that we would return all our excess free cash flow to the shareholders. We have done that. We did get the second $1 billion authorization from the Board of Directors. We'll be opportunistic, as we purchase throughout the rest of this year. And when we get completed with that we'll take a look and we'll talk to the Board about what's next. But you've to keep in mind, this is a Board decision, so we don't want to preempt the Board. But when we get done with the $700 million, we'll look at potentially what's next in the program.","Arnold Donald","One last question please, operator?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research.","Dan McKenzie","With respect to the revenue beat, I'm just wondering how much of it was tied to investments and advertising spend over the past year? And then with respect to the uptick in advertising in the third quarter, I am wondering why then, and how you have been measuring the link between the campaigns and the revenue production?","Arnold Donald","Well, as you know, we have 10 brands. They all have segments that they are catering to. And they all have their independent marketing plans. We do look at it collectively. We are leveraging our scale in terms of looking at common media buy and those types of things to be even more efficient as paying dividends for us.","But the reality is, we are expecting a return on any investment we make and that includes advertising and whether it's mass media advertising, product placement advertising, digital, all the various forms of it, and PR, public relations efforts.","So our belief is that we have to keep cruise out in the public space in a positive way on a constant basis, so that when people are considering vacation, there has been enough noise about cruise that, they say, well, I have an idea, let's look at a cruise. And so, the idea is to just keep it out there and that's utilizing all the various forms.","There is no question we have created incremental demand. We also know there is no question that an incremental demand has been in part created by the fantastic work of our team members across our 10 brands who literally exceed guest expectations every day when they come onboard. And that word of mouth and that personal experience of having your expectations exceeded is the most powerful marketing tool we have by far. And that is by the work of our people in engineering, the experiences on board and then delivering against it.","So to your question, yes, we have increased advertising overall. We will continue to look at it. We don't do it willy-nilly. We do a lot of measuring and tracking to see what kind of impact we get both in attitude and in bookings and so on. And we're constantly monitoring that and tweaking it. But the third-quarter rationale is a peak communication time to prepare for the coming year. And that's why you often see an increase in that period.","Dan McKenzie","The next question gets at the competition for the upper scale traveler, and specifically, your key competitors have products within their core brand to chip away at that market share in that segment. And so you have got the Norwegian Haven, the Royal suite products, looking ahead Virgin seems poised to also chip away at the upper scale traveler. So I'm wondering if you can help us put some brackets around the revenue that this market segment represents. How you are thinking about these moves by key competitors and how Carnival is responding?","Arnold Donald","You bet. Our primary competitor is land-based vacations. One of every two people who cruise in the world cruise with us and we have tremendous respect for the other companies that operate. And we want them to be successful. That helps us a lot. The stronger they are the better it is for us.","So having said that we have 10 brands, we have ultra-luxury in Seabourn, we have luxury in Cunard both our Queens Grill and Princess Grill, we have Holland America on Neptune. We have premium brands in Fathom, our newest premium brand, but obviously our long-established premium brands of Princess and Holland America and AIDA. And we have mass contemporary brands like Costa and Carnival.","So we look at that, but again, the really important thing about cruise is this, we've had Steve Wozniak, who we pay to lecture on Seabourn, but he pays to go on Carnival, okay, because it's not a demographic choice per se, we have taxi drivers who will save for five years to go on a Seabourn Cruise and we have billionaires who want to sail on Carnival. And the reality is the experience that you're looking for.","And each brand is a different experience, caters to a different psychographic market. So we have ultra-luxury brands, luxury brands, premium brands, et cetera, each with their own experience and that's what drives it for us. But for us, we are definitely looking at penetrating more land-based vacations, because all the cabins in the world added up together in the industry represent less than 2% of the hotel rooms in the world. So that means there is 98% of the market to chase as opposed to 1% because of that 2%, 1% is ours already. So that's kind of our approach.","End of Q&A","Arnold Donald","Thank you very much. I really appreciate the questions. Thanks for your support. We look forward to talking to you guys next quarter and in between. And as always, feel free to call Beth with any additional questions or insights you might want to offer us. So, thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",""]}}
