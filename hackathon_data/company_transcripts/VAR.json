At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Spencer Sias, Vice President. Please go ahead sir.","Spencer Sias","Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Varian Medical Systems\u2019 conference call for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. With me are Dow Wilson, President and CEO, Elisha Finney, CFO, and Clarence Verhoef, our Corporate Controller. Dow and Elisha will summarize our results and we will take your questions following the presentation.","This is, to simplify our discussion, unless otherwise stated, all references to the quarter or year are fiscal quarters and fiscal years. Quarterly comparisons are for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. References to financial results for orders are to gross orders, unless otherwise indicated.","The company is reporting non-GAAP results in order to provide quarter-over-quarter comparison and operation of performance excluding unusual items. A reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure is included in our earnings release, which can be accessed on our website.","Please be advised that this presentation and discussion contains forward-looking statements. Our use of words and phrases such as outlook, believe, expect, anticipate, could, should, will, promising and similar expressions are intended to identify those statements, which represents our current judgment on future performance or other future matters. While we believe them to be reasonable based on information currently available to us, these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.","Some of the important risks relating to our business are described in our fourth quarter earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements in this presentation and discussion, because of new information, future events or otherwise.","And now, here is Dow.","Dow Wilson","Good afternoon and welcome. Our company finished fiscal year 2016 on a positive note with healthy fourth quarter and revenue and significant margin improvement in both our Oncology and Imaging Components businesses. Orders in the Oncology and Proton businesses on the other hand were down during the quarter versus tough year ago comparisons in which we had record setting Oncology growth in Western Europe and in our Proton business.","To summarize, our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2016 we are reporting, GAAP net earnings of the $1.24 per diluted share, up from $0.99 from the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP net earnings of the $1.38 per diluted share, up more than 30% from the $1.04 in the year ago quarter.","A decline in Oncology orders due to weakness in Western Europe. Revenues of $912 million up 12% in dollars and up 11% in constant currency and gains of about four percentage points in our gross margins the significant improvements in both our major businesses.","Focusing on Oncology operations, orders totaled $897 million for the fourth quarter, down 2% in dollars and down 4% in constant currency versus a strong year ago quarter. Orders for the year totaled $2.7 billion, up 1% from the prior year and up 2% in constant currency.","Fourth quarter orders in the Americas grew by 4% in dollars and increase by 3% in constant currency. For the year, orders in Americas were up 4% in both dollars and constant currency. In North America, orders fell by 2% in the fourth quarter but grew by 5% for the year ahead of our expectations for these markets. Fourth quarter Oncology orders in APAC rose by 8% in dollars and fell by 1% in constant currency. For the full-year, APAC orders rose by 5% in dollars and by 3% in constant currency.","In EMEA, Oncology orders declined by 17% in dollars and in constant currency principally because of weakness in Western Europe where we had exceptional strong growth in a year ago quarter when we set a record by booking orders for more than a 100 escalators. For the year, orders in EMEA were down 6% in dollars and down 4% in constant currency driven by weakness in Western Europe.","Comparing revenues on a trailing 12 months basis, we believe we gain market share versus our primary competition. Our average selling price rose with the help of higher mix of TrueBeam and VitalBeam orders. We generated solid order growth during the quarter in emerging markets including Brazil, Africa and in the Middle East.","In Brazil, we booked nearly $30 million of new business including a big win at Grupo Oncoclinicas, where we will be installing 13 TrueBeam and VitalBeam accelerators as well as software to support clinical operations.","These will be the first VitalBeam accelerators installed in Latin America. Columbia was also a strong contributor to robust order growth in the quarter. Total orders in Latin America exceeded $60 million during the quarter, up more than 70% from the prior year period.","Other emerging markets contributing to Oncology orders during the quarter included Africa was about $20 million and the Middle East where we booked more than $40 million and as an example of progress, we received $14 million order for a eight escalators at the Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad.","In APAC emerging markets, we have generated healthy order growth in Indonesia, Korea and the Philippines, in those markets particularly Japan also contributed to the order growth in this region.","Meanwhile, orders in greater China were down from a year ago period in part because of continuing tender protest, while we anniversary the effects of these multiple order and while we are retaining the book of the business that we won. We estimate that orders in China in a fiscal year could have been more than 15 million higher without this protest activity.","Turning to North America, we established significant new three-year strategic agreement with McKesson Specialty Health to supply its U.S. Oncology Advantage Cancer Treatment networks with equipment software and services. In the first phase, we will be equipping centers with seven TrueBeam and five VitalBeam accelerators.","We also will be working to establish in our interoperability with Varian\u2019s Information Management and McKesson\u2019s iKnowMed G2 clinical oncology sector. We see an opportunity here to support these networks with more of Eclipse, ARIA, Velocity and new 360 Oncology software. Overall, we had a very good year in North America, where we had in excess of $130 million in take out of more than 40 accelerators and nearly 100 software installations from competitors.","As you now, we have just return from ASTRO in Boston, it was a great show for us with some 900 attendees at our users meeting numerous customers for emerging markets and very positive response to several major new products that we will be bringing to market this year.","We introduce 360 Oncology a first of its kind of software tool that enable clinicians on tumor boards to more effectively coordinate patient care among the numerous specialist involved in cancer treatment. This software also provides patients with the clear picture of how the many elements involved and treating their cancer fit together. Customer responses enthusiastic and we believe, we have winning product on our hands.","We also showed our progress in the development of our HyperArc technology for automating and simplifying the delivery of stereotactic radiosurgery with more compact dose distributions and better protection of surrounding healthy tissue. We are aiming reduces important upgrade to our TrueBeam and Edge platform this year beginning with the module for treating head neck cancers.","Oncology administrators were also very interested in our initiatives in which we will be enhancing the security embedded within Varian Software Systems. We believe, we have a leading position in the development of this important new capability and we expect it could generate an additional $80 million in revenues by the end of fiscal year 2018.","We have continued to see a very positive market response to our rapid plan and insight of analytics software products that help to improve the speed, quality and cost efficiency treatments. We have taken more than 650 orders or rapid plans since its launch and more than 135 orders for our insight of software. Touching on the service business global revenues rose by 7% during the quarter with gains in all geographies.","Turning now to our Particle Therapy business, we generated $38 million in orders during the fourth quarter bringing total orders for the year to $104 million. Orders were down significantly from fiscal 2015, when we had a total of fixed system orders including an $87 million order for our ProBeam System at University of Maryland.","Revenues from 14 ongoing projects grew nicely reaching $68 million in the fourth quarter and bringing total revenues for the year to $163 million including about $10 million in annual service revenues.","During the fourth quarter, we booked our first single room ProBeam compact order marketing important milestone for the business. This new system will be installed that the Advanced Medicine Training Center in Singapore, where Varian loss provide Eclipse treatment planning system. We also have a 10-year agreement to service the system.","Also during the quarter, the UK University, Collage London Hospital placed an order for our fourth treatment gantry at the Proton Therapy Center that is currently under construction. Earlier this month, treatment commenced using our ProBeam System at Cincinnati Children's Hospital making it the fifth Varian equipped Proton center to treat clinically. At this point, the Proton sales funnel looks healthy and I\u2019m pleased by the progress we are making.","Let me turn now to imaging components. Recovery in this business continued in the fourth quarter. Orders grew by 2% to $168 million fourth quarter resulting in 7% orders growth for the last six months. Orders for the year totaled $571 million down 6% from the prior year because of first half headwinds including significant purchasing slowdowns at two major customers. Revenues were up 7% for the fourth quarter and down 2% for the year.","Our Memphis and Claymount acquisitions as well successful efforts to develop business with new customers contributed Imaging Components order and revenue growth during the quarter. Great cost control as well as a favorable product mix in tubes and fat panel Imaging detector and higher volumes in our security and inspection line enabled the Imaging business to achieve a significant gain in its gross margin for the quarter.","Looking at operational highlights for the whole year. The Imaging Components business introduced 20 new products completed a 140,000 square foot expansion of this manufacturing facility and Salt Lake City. Opened a new facility in China to service drawing customer base there, successfully integrated and mobilized its Memphis and Claymount acquisitions added 12 new customers to offset slower purchasing from established customers and exceeded its profit targets.","We are proud of this performance and we expect Imaging Components to be a great company that deliver solid returns on a separates from Varian and is established as Varex Imaging an independent publicly traded company. Work on the separation continues to go smoothly.","Now, I'll turn it over to Elisha.","Elisha Finney","Thanks, Dow, and hello, everyone. Dow has already covered gross orders, so let me start with backlog.","We ended the quarter at $3.5 billion, down 1% from the year-ago period with the gain in Oncology offset by declines in our Particle Therapy and Imaging Components backlog. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled $47 million, bringing net orders for the company to $1.1 million.","Fourth quarter revenue for the total company were $912 million, up 12% in dollars and up 11% in constant currency. For the year, total company revenues were $3.2 billion up 4$ in dollar and up 5% in constant currency.","Oncology posted a fourth quarter revenue gain of 7% in dollars and 6% in constant currency. For the year, Oncology revenues increased 5% in dollars and 6% in constant currency. Imaging Components posted a fourth quarter revenue gain up 7% driven by a recently acquired x-ray accessories businesses, as well as security and inspection products. Including the challenges in the first half, Imaging Components revenue declined 2% for the full year.","Our Particle Therapy business posted fourth quarter revenue of $68 million bringing total revenues for the year to $163 million a 13% increase from the prior year. The total company growth margin for the quarter were 42.7% up by nearly four points with significant contributions from both Oncology and Imaging Component. Oncology Systems fourth quarter gross margin improved by about five points to 45.3% with the help of favorable product and geographic mix shift as well as product cost reductions.","For the year, Oncology Systems gross margin improved by almost two points to 44.5%. Imaging Components fourth quarter gross margin rose by about three points to 42.1% due largely to favorable product mix, high volumes in Tubes and security product and lower more anti cost. For the year, Imaging Component gross margin improved by about one point to 41.9%.","R&D expenses were 66 million, or 7% of revenue, down one point as a percentage of revenue from the year-ago quarter. For the year R&D expenses were 254 million or equal with the prior year as a percentage of revenue at 8%. On a GAAP basis, fourth quarter SG&A expenses were 152 million, or 17% of revenue.","On a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter SG&A expenses were 134 million or 15% of revenue. The 19 million in non-GAAP adjustment primarily related to the plan separation at the Imaging Components business, ongoing pattern litigation and amortization are been tangible.","Operating earnings for the quarter were 18.6% of revenue on a GAAP basis and 20.7% of revenue on a non-GAAP basis, reflecting our solid gross margin performance in the quarter. For the year our operating earnings were 17.1% of revenue on a GAAP and up 50 basis points from the prior year to 19.1% of revenue on a non-GAAP basis. Depreciation and amortization totaled 24 million for the fourth quarter and 80 million for the year.","The fourth quarter effective tax rate was 31.1%, up from the year-ago quarter due to an unfavorable geographic mix of profits. For the year, the effective tax rate was 27.6%.","Fully diluted shares outstanding for the fourth quarter were 94.5 million, down on a 5 million shares from the year ago period due to our ongoing share repurchase program. Fourth quarter diluted EPS was $1.24 for the quarter on a GAAP basis and the $1.38 on a non-GAAP basis. For the diluted EPS was $4.19 on a GAAP basis, on a non-GAAP basis diluted EPS rose 9% to $4.68.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of 844 million, debt of 667 million, and stockholders' equity of 1.7 billion. DSO at 93 days was up from the year-ago quarter, but improved sequentially from the third quarter.","Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was 152 million, bringing the total cash flow from operations for the year to 356 million. Primary uses of cash were 87 million for the repurchase of 1 million shares of stock, 43 million to reduce debt, and 20 million for capital expenditures. At the end of the quarter, we had 3.8 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization.","Before I turn it over to Dow, as you may have seen in our release issued before this call, I intend to retire from Varian in fiscal 2017. I\u2019ll remain in my current role of CFO until a replacement is found and a fluid transition has been completed.","I\u2019ll also continue leading the separation of our Imaging Components business. We have a tremendous financial team that will perform to this transition to a new CFO without missing a beat. It has been an honor to serve all the Varian's Investors and Analyst over the past 17.5 years. And it's been a privilege to be part of a tremendous growth story that has seen Varian become a global power in to fight against cancer.","Thank you for being part of the story with me. And now here is Dow.","Dow Wilson","Thanks, Elisha. For our company and for our investors Elisha has been an Intelligent Trusted and Energetic leader that all of its count on to help little winning results. We are just counting it up, we think its 71 quarters. So bravo Elisha with help and guidance, we have achieve the sustain decades long record of growth and revenues and profitability. We have been fortunate to have Elisha on our management team, I\u2019m confident that we will make a smooth transition.","Turning now to guidance, we believe that for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 non-GAAP earnings for the total company including the imaging components business and ramp up costs for a separation will be in the range of $1.3 to $1.7 per diluted share. And revenues will increase by about 1% to 2%.","As we announced earlier, we will not give earnings guidance for the full fiscal year until after we have completed the separation of the imaging components business. For the full fiscal year 2017, we expect that Varian\u2019s revenues excluding the imaging components business will rise by 3% to 4%. We expect that imaging components revenues for the full fiscal year 2017 will also rise by 3% to 4%.","We are now ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Jeff Johnson from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Jeffrey Johnson","Thank you. Good afternoon, guy. Can you hear me okay?","Dow Wilson","Hi Jeff. Loud and clear.","Elisha Finney","Hey Jeff.","Jeffrey Johnson","All right. Great. Elisha I\u2019m not going to touch the 71 quarter comment, I\u2019ll just leave that one alone. I guess, but it\u2019s been great working with you I said that every time, it\u2019s been great working with you for the last seven or eight years that I have covered the stock and I wish you to best in the future.","Elisha Finney","Thank you, Jeff.","Jeffrey Johnson","You are welcome. So two questions here, one I guess just on cash flow. So cash flow was down, I think on a year down about 25% looks like it\u2019s kind of lowest level we have seen since fiscal 2009 and I was going back. And if I add back some of the non-GAAP cash charges even if I add those back still down below $400 million and it looks like receivables were up, I think about $120 million year-on-year and even 50 million up sequentially. So just trying to figure out, it\u2019s a receivable issue, what is going on there or what is going on basically with your cash flow at this point?","Elisha Finney","Sure. So Jeff the oncology AR increased about 8% and that compares the year-to-date sales up 5%. As we have been talking all through this fiscal year early in the year. We moved our collection staff, we had a sales force IT implementation and I think that slowed down collections in the first half and we are continuing to feel that effect all that","We are making good progress collections in Q3 and Q4 were very strong. But as we move into FY17 absolutely AR collection is going to be a big focus for the entire team. A little bit of it has to do with more extended terms and a zero interest rate environment, we can continue to win high margin business by offering terms.","And then some of it also both inventory and AR up in the Proton business as we continue to grow that business. And with percentage of completion accounting, it gets a little funky in Proton, because a lot of times were taking revenue and creating an AR under the percentage of completion long before the bills are actually due by the customer. But it will be a big focus as we move into this year.","Jeffrey Johnson","Okay, and I know you don\u2019t guide the cash flow I mean on a consolidated basis, can we expect to get back above $400 million in a year we almost touching $500 million a couple of years ago and it seems like $350 million can we at least get back above $400 million, do you think over the next year too?","Elisha Finney","That is absolutely my goal this year, and also contracted [indiscernible] were down in the Proton business with orders being lower that drove about I think $40 million or bit so. But yes, our goal is what we did back on a consolidated basis to you know the $400 million level.","Jeffrey Johnson","Yes, all right and Dow from a guidance stand point. You know I think we all knew you work on a issue full year guidance from an EPS perspective and we understand the reasons why, but if I look at, if I look at first quarter guidance from an EPS perspective. You are guidance about 5% to 6% EPS growth on a year-over-year basis.","Is it fair to think about that on kind of a core basis over the following few quarters, obviously we have to take into account that extra $20 million of revenue dyssynergies that will start to hit those to back three quarters. But outside of that issue, is kind your first quarter guidance a reasonable wait of think about kind of the core outlook for the rest of the year?","Dow Wilson","Let me talk to the market slight a bit and then I will let Elisha talk it to nothing goes on the guidance side. I think from market perspective, we had big comp in Europe here in the fourth quarter but fundamentally we had a very sound year in the U.S. we see that continuing next year. our funnel remains very good in the U.S. in Asia, China was a little bit off due to some of the structural issues we have seen there, but we think that that market remains robust and should kind of bounced back to double digit levels.","And then the question for us all this year has been kind of Western Europe and where is it going to land. You know we have talked about on that on this call about it being soft all this year. As we close the year, I would say we feel pretty good about Europe for next year. So, just kind of rounding out the market and top-line side of it I think we feel pretty good about where the market is going to be globally next year with especially Western Europe bouncing back.","Elisha Finney","Yes, so for specifically re for Q1 of FY 2017 Jeff, that 1% to 2% on the revenue side, Varian Oncology and Proton is going to be flattish on revenue, but that's really because in the year-ago Q1, we had something like 9% constant currency revenue growth and then we looked at Q2 it was actually a percent.","So this is just a matter of timing and I think to revenue will be split more evenly between one and Q1 and Q2. So again 3% to 4% for the full year for Oncology. Q1 for Varex the Imaging Component business should be up in the current low double digit range and that versus a very easy year-ago comp as their recovery continues.","On EPS if you look at our range, it would be 4% to 8% EPS growth versus a year-ago quarter. but I need to stress that also includes $0.01 to $0.02 cost that we are building in the Imaging Components business today to prepare them for the stand. So for an example, they have hired to CIO, they have hired a manager of tax. As their building out their corporate function, those costs are duplicated in this quarter and so really you need to tack on an additional $0.01 to $0.02 to account for that to get to an apple-to-apple.","Jeffrey Johnson","Okay and I guess I\u2019ll just repeat the last part of my question which was, is it fair to think of that 4% to 8% EPS growth is kind of a core range we could think of for the rest of year before we then tack on that 20 million of the dyssynergies?","Elisha Finney","Okay so let me answer it this way, and this is a completely non-relevant a number, but I\u2019ll give it to you anyway, because we are going forward with this stand, but if we weren\u2019t spending I believe fiscal year 2017 on a consolidated basis we could grow EPS in the high-single-digit range.","Jeffrey Johnson","Okay, all right that\u2019s a good start. I appreciate it. Thanks Elisha.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Amit Hazan from Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Amit Hazan","Good afternoon guys and let me just add, Elisha had been a great run and we will definitely miss you.","Elisha Finney","Thank you Amit.","Amit Hazan","Let me start with the guidance on the top-line that you guys talked about the 3% to 4% top-line growth. I just want to make sure we understand that the reported number and constant currency number first and then either way really is that kind of look at orders for Oncology and obviously now pretty much for last couple of years on a reported basis backlog kind of flattish. So maybe just help us Elisha kind of get to that 3% to 4% growth range versus the order in the backlog growth rate we have been seeing?","Elisha Finney","Yes, well that\u2019s assuming at today's exchange rate which fortunately have stabilized over the last several quarters. The euro has stabilized, the yen is obviously helping us, if yen weakened significantly that could be an impact, but look at where currency rates are today that 3% to 4% for Oncology and Proton combined, feels about right, that does compare to an Oncology backlog that\u2019s up 3% at the end of the fiscal year 2016. So that looks pretty achievable going into FY2017.","Amit Hazan","Okay. And let me just follow-up on the order side on Europe. I mean if I look at EMEA for the year down 4%, I think there is obviously some tough comps there, but are you actually seeing some issues that have been persistent in Europe that you would call out that you don\u2019t have great visibility to them ending other easy comps or. Maybe just a little bit more color on what is going in the issues that have seeing have been or continue to be persist, and what those are?","Dow Wilson","Sure, through the course of 2016, I mean I think we had weakness especially in UK, France and Germany and as I mentioned in my response to Jeff's question, we are seeing our funnels in those markets and the rest of Western Europe and the rest of our European map look pretty good as we look forward.","So I think we are little more encourages about what we see forward than what we see backwards. So we also see some opportunity in Italy and Spain going forward. And then of course our map of Europe includes Africa, Middle East, India and those markets were good to us in Q4 and we see those as continue to strength from those markets.","Amit Hazan","And then last one from me just on the [indiscernible], maybe just give us a sense of when those units would actually be booked as orders, if haven't be booked already? And then you kind of talk about that is Phase I, to the extent if you can maybe just talk about they are obviously a big organization right on center perspective. Just the installed base, how much of it is yours and the expense kind of potentially for maybe I would two year how you see that develop beyond these first 14 units or so?","Dow Wilson","Yes. Although, we book so far is this first 14 units. So that\u2019s just this first phase, we feel very good about our relationship with McKesson U.S. Oncology Vantage. What we have booked so far is pretty much the hardware piece of the relationship. The contract does include software and service and that will be booked, some of it next year and beyond.","So we feel very good about where that is headed, I think they are very much and think for what the software product have to do in terms of managing the clinic, providing the analytic tools, macro reimbursement tools, it will include some interoperability with the McKesson iKnowMed product, which was important for McKesson. And very excited about that whole relationship, but most of it is yet to be booked.","Amit Hazan","All right. Great. I\u2019ll let some others jump in. thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Tycho Peterson from JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Tycho Peterson","Thanks. I apologies I\u2019m going to ask another guidance question. But if you think about kind of the end markets values to talk about kind of 6% to 8% market growth then it was kind of mid-single-digits. You are talking 34% revenue growth with some share gains I guess embedded into. Can you maybe just talk about what you see as underlying market growth and in 3% to 4% revenue guidance, how much of that is software and services versus underlying growth in LinAcc?","Dow Wilson","I don\u2019t know if I can break that out at this point from a guidance point of view. But as to the overall markets, I mean if anything you might have been a little bit conservative here. I think as we look our funnels here at the beginning of the year, I think the market looks pretty good. We had a ton of activity in especially in the fourth quarter in Europe last year and as we look forward, we see pretty good strength.","So I would say there are uncertainty around the course, but it\u2019s probably 3% to 3.5% to 6% market growth scenario. Chin is going to continue to do well. India is going to do well, We are growing in Africa. We had pretty good years this past year in Brazil, but we see continued strength in the Brazilian market and that\u2019s good news.","And then in the U.S. market it\u2019s been as I mentioned in the scripts, it was 5% growth on the year and if anything that would a little bit ahead it kind of where we thought, it would be coming into the year as we look at 2017 funnels remain very strong in the U.S.","Elisha Finney","If I could just add to that Tycho, in terms of the top-line growth for oncology, the good news is pricing is holding globally and we have seen significant product cost reduction, we have basically obsoleted the C Series and moved everyone on to the TrueBeam platform. And I think this margin improvement, you have seen the last couple of quarters and oncology is sustainable going forward. So We are kind of moving them up to 44% to 45% gross margin level and so obviously even at the top-line is off a point or so, we make up a lot of that difference in the margin improvement that we are seeing there.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. That's good to hear, and then Dow may be could you help on macro the final rule where your thoughts on. As we think about that getting implemented how do we think about that may be driving more of a bias towards software and some of this.","Dow Wilson","Yes, no I think we are overall it's a good opportunity for our product line with our insight of analytics tools, our rapid plan and treatment planning and our 360 Oncology you know its connect trade and opportunity. For us to provide our customers with required reports they're going to need to comply.","They have got a demonstrate certified the HER, Electronic Health Record. They have got to demonstrate improvement in care management and practices and they have a report on their quality metrics. So these tools all do that. So I think it\u2019s going to be pretty good news for us. The product line is about where we needed to be to comply we got few things to button down but we will be way ahead of the in the compliance requirements and we have got just our own installed base is about 18,000 sites that got to go and we are very excited about that.","May be just on top of that this is a macro but the other keys from a market point of view that is a least as important as macro is the cyber security. And you know this at ASTRO we launched a very significant upgrade to our software products for cyber security and that product could be ready here in early spring and that should drive some upside for us too, so we are excited about that one.","Tycho Peterson","And then one last one, you know North America Oncology orders last quarter up 15%, they were up only 3% this quarter, were there some pull forward dynamic to CMS to kind of come out ahead time and said physician fee schedule wouldn't be [indiscernible]?","Dow Wilson","You know there is always from lumpiness quarter-to-quarter, I would say, in the second half the CMS had very little to do with this. You know it's just timing of some of the orders.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question today come from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Dow Wilson","Hi Vijay.","Vijay Kumar","Hey guys, how it's going?","Elisha Finney","All right.","Vijay Kumar","So, Elisha maybe I'll start one with the a question for you just sort of fund of timing here, just on the decision to step aside, if you could just walk us through some the claiming mission I think that will be helpful context in the heading into the span?","Elisha Finney","Sure, well I started my CFO career with the span, I figured why not end it with a span. So, back in 1999 and as Dow said about 71 quarters , it just feels like to right timing Vijay. In terms of the exact timing that's to be determined, I am completely dedicated to getting us through to span of the Imaging Components business. We can now go out and conduct a research and want to find a world class finance leader who can come into describe organization and have time to transition and so it will be at some point in this fiscal year but the exact date is are not determined at this point.","Vijay Kumar","Got you, and may be just a couple of a quick one on the guidance question. So did I hear you correctly when you said the EPS was a high single off of the current year base and just does that number include the 20 million dyssynergies and you have the accounting rule change sort of baked in and just can you walk us through some moving parts there?","Elisha Finney","Yes, that was a hypothetical number that said if we weren\u2019t spending, we believe EPS would grow on a consolidated basis in the high-single-digits. The 20 million of dyssynergies, I have to say we are well underway of looking for cost reduction opportunities and we are absolutely committed to having $10 million of that out at a run rate by the end of fiscal year 2017 and the additional $10 million out by FY 2018. So lots of work already going on that.","I will tell you that most of those dyssynergies for Varian are offset because we will have a lower tax rate, because Varex has a 35%, 36% tax rate. Unfortunately for my colleague [Clarence Verhoef] (Ph) his tax rate is going up versus the Varian average but a Varian\u2019s tax rate will come down a point or two and that largely offset the dyssynergies in you are wanting to.","Vijay Kumar","That was helpful. And maybe just a quick one on Q1. I mean if I look at the guidance commentary at the midpoint EPS, it looks like maybe margins would be somewhere around 17.5 maybe a few basis point above the 17.5. so that\u2019s a step down just from the Q4 levels, commentary on which is gross margin for Oncology, can you just walk us through why the margins were step down from Q4 to Q1? Thank you.","Elisha Finney","Yes, you always. Every year if you go back you see seasonality, I mean Q4 is always our largest quarter with the highest operating margin typically. So it's not uncommon for the operating margin to step down from Q4 to Q1. When you run your model through, I mean what I am showing at the mid-point is that we will increase our operating margin by about a point to 18% on a non-GAAP basis. Again, Oncology\u2019s gross margin will be between 44%, 45%, Imaging Components in the low 40s. So it's looks closer to an 18% operating margin.","Vijay Kumar","Thank you guys.","Elisha Finney","And again Vijay, that does include - I want to make sure everyone understands, it includes some duplicative cost and Varex as we are hiring people to gear up with the span, we cannot take those cost out to be non-GAAP and that\u2019s between $0.01 and $0.02 in Q1 for those duplicative cost.","Vijay Kumar","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thanks. Our next question today is coming from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Anthony Petrone","Thanks and congratulation Elisha, it was great working together over the years and good luck on the next phase.","Elisha Finney","Thank you.","Anthony Petrone","A couple of questions just I guess higher level, maybe exiting fiscal 2016 here will be helpful to get an update on the percentage of the installed base, the LinAcc installed base that really is now TrueBeam and VitalBeam. And really what I am getting out is what percentage of the installed base has stereotactic to capabilities and what percent is not truly in relation to Dr. Kuntia\u2019s presentation at ASTRO.","The opportunities for SRS, SBRT going forward over the next 10 to 15 year. I am just trying to get a sense of what percentage of the base can migrate to having stereotactic capabilities in the next few years? And then I have a follow-up on software and margins.","Dow Wilson","That\u2019s a good question, I would say from a very high level we have got about 1,500 TrueBeams in the installed base of call it 7,500 machines. Now, when you look at some of the capabilities, the interesting thing, when you talk about HyperArc. HyperArc available on every one of those TrueBeams. So this is kind of first, we have had some other smaller upgrade that we offered on TrueBeam like some imaging improvements and some other things over the last few years.","But the HyperArc for some of the stereotactic radiosurgery patients that Dr. Kuntia talked about at ASTRO will be available on the Edge and TrueBeam only. So very excited about that. I think that will probably drive some of the other installed based to trade out to TrueBeam as well.","So very encouraged about that, I would say when you look at the past quarter Americas was almost virtually 100% TrueBeam, VitalBeam might have been one or two that weren\u2019t, but pretty much everything in the Americas, that well North America for sure was TrueBeam, VitalBeam.","And I would say of those in terms of the capability that they had in the fourth quarter. Maybe half had SRS, SBRT capability. When you look at the install base big opportunity there. Most of them do not have that capability.","And so I think, this bodes well for us next year in two ways, one it\u2019s an upgrade opportunity and two it\u2019s going to help us on pricing on TrueBeam. We are going to be able to maintain or grow price on TrueBeam and I think that\u2019s a little bit, We are doing very well on the cost side.","Where is this margin rate improvement coming from are doing very well on the cost side the operational team has done a fabulous job getting cost down on TrueBeam. But then as well We are seeing a really nice mix of these advanced capabilities that are giving us some price support on the pricing side.","Anthony Petrone","And just a quick follow-up on that, that would be just. How do you see that transitioning, just when you think of the 2019 reimbursement changes when oncology may go bundled and then more focused on efficiencies and outcomes? Does it accelerate the demand for stereotactic within the installed base or do you think this sort of plays out pretty ratably over 12 to 15 years?","Dow Wilson","I mean, I think, if anything that will be a little faster, because some of the reimbursement pressure. Having said that, clinicians are going to want to make sure there is a really responsible clinical comparison done. So our customers are sensitive about that. I think one of the exciting things to us is in some applications the hypofractionation trend is going to bring more patients back to us.","So for example, in prostate cancer over the last half dozen years, we have lost a little bit of share at robotic surgery. But I think now as those starts to go hypofractionated we get those, a lot of those patients back. Results are as good or better than surgery and that\u2019s well documented.","And then as well, I think the other big opportunity from a clinical growth perspective here is metastatic disease, this capability really enables a very precise dose deposition. And we think that there are in the U.S. alone 300,000 patients that we get could have opportunity to go after with this capability and bring some new folks into the radiation therapy paradigm. So we are excited about the capabilities this opens up.","Anthony Petrone","And then just quickly on software margins may be just another high level. Where do we sit exiting fiscal 2016 when you look at software\/services as a percent of the total for the [remain co] (Ph) and do you see a point where there is a higher mix of software. Say over the next three to five years and if we do have that scenario what do you think overall margins look like under that scenario? Thanks again.","Elisha Finney","Let me just say for you to date 2016 service was just low 40. There was about 42% of the total revenue for Oncology so call it 60\/40. And clearly as of service and software grow faster than the hardware. It does have an upward bias on gross margin. In fact that has been helping us for last couple of quarters. Software is roughly 10% of total Oncology revenue.","Anthony Petrone","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question today is coming from Brandon Henry with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Brandon Henry","Hey, thanks for taking my question. First of all can you just discuss how software and services performed in the quarter. These businesses continue growing combined kind of high-single-digits. And were there any change in growth rate this quarter versus last quarter?","Dow Wilson","Our revenue in service were up 7%, revenues in software were around the same. I think the as we look forward in the service funnel I would say it looks very good. We had a little bit of currency last year, we had a little bit of timing. I think on the year we would like to see that number be a little of north of 7% and that's kind of what we are stressing the team for, but service business continues to be solid growth for us.","Software, we had the very good year in treatment planning. We talked about that in the script with all the rapid plan orders. I think this next year with the improvements that we have in our in insight of analytics and with our 360 Oncology product. It can be very exciting. We are curious little bit to see how that goes because 360 Oncology is going to be cloud based.","So the financial impact is going to be a little more back end loaded as we accumulate sites, do to billing and collect the orders on that basis. I think it's going to be a little - it is a little bit of a transition as we go kind of from annual license model to a software-as-a-service model.","So having said that, one of the really cool things about the 360 Oncology product is it can play not just in ARIA Varian side, it can play in every radiation Oncology site in the world and just a really a great opportunity for us to get some penetration, in fact we that we don\u2019t have today.","Brandon Henry","Okay and then separately can you guys talk about your expectation for free cash flow for fiscal year 2017 versus fiscal year 2016 and how should we think about the balance of M&A versus share repurchase is in the near-term and then what size deals and debt levels do you feel comfortable for each company going forward? Thanks.","Elisha Finney","I'll answer the first part of that to have question Brandon, as it has came up earlier on the call. Our cash flow from operations was down year-over-year we ended both Q3 and Q4 on a strong note, but we were kind of in a whole in that. The first half of the fiscal year on collections of AR for a couple of reasons moved this collection staff, we had at IT implementation et cetera.","So we are very focused on cash flow particularly AR as we move into FY 2017 and on a consolidated basis our expectation would be that we could get back to around the $400 million level in cash flow from operations.","CapEx has always been relatively stable. And then in terms of share repurchase versus M&A, I think we would always love to prioritize M&A if the right targets come along in that\u2019s the duty of our share repurchase program we can turn it on and off and at various levels depending on what activity in M&A that\u2019s there.","Dow Wilson","Yes, and just as a comment, it's can be strategically driven, how can we strengthen our Oncology franchise, I don\u2019t see us going way out on the edge and doing something for example maybe in chemotherapy to pick one. But other image guidance technologies, are there radiation technologies, are there software technology that can reinforce our core and give us some higher growth segments to participate in. That\u2019s what we will look at.","Brandon Henry","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thanks. Our next question is coming from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Anthony Petrone","Just a quick housekeeping one, just kind of going to some queues here on the Kendall acquisition in Poland, maybe what is baked in there for fiscal 2017 and if any of that hit in the fiscal fourth quarter as well? Thanks again.","Elisha Finney","In terms of revenue?","Anthony Petrone","Yes, revenue contribution in the quarter and then\u2026","Elisha Finney","It would just be service revenue about $1 million or so this fall.","Anthony Petrone","In Q4 and I guess if we just annualize that in 2017 to get the contribution or\u2026","Elisha Finney","Yes. It's somewhere between annualized $14 million to $16 million market for us and it's a growing market, so we feel very good about Poland over the next several years. And one of the reason is the timing was right to make the acquisition and go direct.","Anthony Petrone","Okay. Thank you again.","Operator","Thank you. We have reached end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.","Dow Wilson","Thank you.

My name is Ann and I will be your coordinator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Spencer Sias, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Spencer R. Sias","Thank you. Hi, folks, just move your slide to Varian Medical Systems and I apologize for the lateness of getting this call started. We had trouble with our conference operator. But welcome, though, to the Varian Medical Systems Conference Call for the Third Quarter of Fiscal Year 2012. Participating in this call are Tim Guertin, President and CEO; Elisha Finney, CFO; Dow Wilson, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Tai Chen, our Corporate Controller. Tim and Elisha will summarize our results and we'll take your questions following the presentation. To simplify our discussion, unless otherwise stated, all references to the quarter or year are fiscal quarters and fiscal years, the quarterly comparisons are for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 versus the third quarter of fiscal 2011.","Please be advised that this presentation and discussion contains forward-looking statements.

We assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements in this presentation and discussion because of new information, future events or otherwise.","And now, here's Tim.","Timothy E. Guertin","Good afternoon, and welcome. And today, we're reporting results for the third quarter of 2012 with healthy growth in revenue, margins and earnings. Net orders were up slightly in constant currency, but even with the -- excuse me, net orders were up slightly in constant currency, but even with the year-ago period on a dollar basis.","To summarize the third quarter results compared to the year-ago quarter, company revenues rose to $705 million, up 9% in dollars and 11% in constant currency. Our gross and operating margins improved even in the face of a weakened euro and net earnings increased 16% to $0.96 per diluted share. Net orders were up in Oncology Systems and were down in our X-ray Products and Security businesses. Our quarter ending backlog rose 16% to more than $2.6 billion with Oncology backlog up 9%.","Let me give you more detail about our Oncology Systems Business first. Third quarter revenues for this business were $546 million, up 7% from the year-ago quarter. The gross margin was 44%, up nearly 40 basis points from the year ago quarter and up 2 percentage points from the second quarter. We achieved this improvement while continuing to experience a significant shift to International business, which accounted for 57% of total oncology revenues.","Oncology net orders totaled $562 million, up 2% in dollars and 4% in constant currency. Reported net orders were up 4% in North America but down 1% internationally with currency-driven declines in EMEA that offset double-digit growth in Asia. Oncology orders were split 46% in North America and 54% internationally.","Our flagship TrueBeam system continues to be ordered and deployed in healthy rates. Since the product launch, we have received 550 orders and some 270 installations are complete or in progress. TrueBeam comprise about 50% of total high-energy machine orders in the quarter.","During the quarter, we received several multi-Linac orders including 6 TrueBeams at 2 centers in New York. We also received our first 2 orders as part of a program in the U.K. to stimulate replacement of machines in public hospitals. We were selected to supply a minimum of 10 TrueBeam machines that hospitals can acquire through the National Health Service between April 2012 and March 2013. The first 2 of these have been ordered for our new cancer center in Hereford and to replace a competitor's machine at Clatterbridge, near Liverpool.","Service orders and revenues, which represent a long-term annuity for oncology, grew at a faster rate than the overall oncology business. Year-to-date, services achieved double-digit growth and is nearly 35% of Oncology Systems revenues.","Shortly after the quarter ended, CMS announced its initial proposals for 2013 reimbursement rates in the U.S. This calls for slight increases in hospital rates, but painful and inappropriate cuts for freestanding clinics. As a consequence, we are working with clinic operators in the industry to oppose these cuts in order to help ensure continued access to cancer care for patients. Freestanding clinics in the U.S. represent about 10% of Varian's global oncology business. With ongoing pressure on reimbursement rates, it's clear to us that the market will place a greater and greater premium on fast, cost-efficient delivery of both radio therapy and radiosurgery without compromising treatment quality. This is a strength for Varian because we offer greater performance and value than any of our competitors.","We continue to see promising developments in clinical studies related to the efficacy of modern radiotherapy. I'm pleased to announce today that Varian has become a supporter of a multi- institution, randomized Phase III study comparing surgery and radiosurgery for patients with early-stage, high-risk, operable non-small cell lung cancer. The study will accrue 420 patients across the U.S. over 5 years and evaluate survival at 3 years. It is being conducted by the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology and National Cancer Institute sponsored the cooperative research group. We believe this study is the logical next step towards expanding the use of radiosurgery for the treatment of lung cancer following numerous studies that showed promising results for the treatment of inoperable lung cancer.","As we reported in our press release on May 1, doctors at VU Medical Center in Amsterdam published a data showing that radiosurgery can be a viable option for treating potentially operable cases of early-stage lung cancer with outcomes that compare favorably to surgery. We are excited about the results of this study and recommend that you read it in the May issue of the International Journal of Radiation, Oncology, Biology and Physics to fully appreciate the work that is being done in this field. Studies such as these mark the progress that is being made in the fight to control cancer with radiotherapy and radiosurgery and enhance efficiency of these treatment methods.","Our X-ray Products business continued to experience challenging conditions in the third quarter, but managed to deliver record margins. Net orders were $120 million, down 1% from the year-ago period and revenues rose 5% to $127 million. Sluggish capital spending on imaging systems around the globe appeared to dampen demand for our components in the quarter. However, we believe our X-ray Products business is doing better than the overall diagnostic imaging industry and that we are growing share.","The long-term growth on our X-ray Products business has been driven by our ability to introduce new tubes and panels that enable us to serve more customers and address new market segments. We're currently in the process of introducing multiple new products, which we believe will help us to sustain growth.","Looking forward, for example, we are starting to see some new panel business from Siemens for systems that it expressed to sell into emerging markets. Results in our Other category, including the Varian Particle Therapy business and our Security and Inspections Product business were mixed. As you know, results with these businesses can vary substantially from quarter-to-quarter based on the timing of large orders and deliveries. Combined net orders were $7 million down $10 million from the year-ago quarter. Orders for Security were down sharply, revenues rose about 70% to $26 million in the quarter.","Deployment of security systems by governments around the world is continuing, and our customers have received orders for systems that incorporate our components. So we can expect to see more orders in this business in a relatively near future.","In our Particle Therapy business, we continue to work on the installation of the new system in Scripps in San Diego, and several other customers are in the process of financing and launching their projects. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we signed an $84 million contract for a new 4-room proton installation at MR University and we will book this order in the backlog when this project is financed. This is a vote of confidence in the future of proton therapy that comes in spite of CMS proposals to cut reimbursement rates for hospital-based Proton Therapy Centers in 2013.","The proposed hospital cuts have no direct effect on current Varian projects such as Scripps, Maryland or Emory. These clinics will operate as freestanding centers and negotiate reimbursement rates with their local Medicare providers. I should add, CMS has indicated it is open to modifying its proton reimbursement proposal for hospitals because it has acknowledged that the suggested rates are based on very limited data from only 3 hospitals.","And now, let me introduce Elisha Finney to cover the financials.","Elisha W. Finney","Thanks, Tim and hello, everyone. While Tim has already covered net orders, I want to give you a little more detail on the constant currency growth rates.","In comparing quarter-over-quarter exchange rate, the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against European currencies and weakened slightly against the yen. As you know, in the third quarter, the euro weakened by about 10% from the year-ago period. Oncology grew net orders by 2% in dollars or 4% in constant currency. Oncology's European net orders were down 4% in dollars but up 5% in constant currency. And Asian orders were up 12% in dollars and up 11% in constant currency.","Third quarter revenues increased 9% to $705 million and 11% in constant currency. Oncology Systems posted a 7% increase with strong growth in international sales. X-ray Products posted a gain of 5% and our Other category doubled with strong growth in the SIP business and with $6 million of proton revenue.","Even with the negative quarter-over-quarter currency impact, the gross margin for the company increased by 0.5 points to 43.6%. Oncology Systems gross margin increased by 38 basis points to 34.3% due primarily to strong growth in service and improved installations, warranty and factory cost. X-ray Products gross margin had a new record, climbing 4 points to 45.3% due to favorable product mix as well as improve quality and product costs.","The gross margin for the Other business and the total company was negatively impacted by revenue recognized on the Scripps contract, which reduced the company's third quarter gross margin by about 35 basis points.","Third quarter SG&A expenses were $105 million or 15% of revenues, and R&D expenses were $49 million or 7% of revenues, both up slightly as a percentage of revenue from the year-ago quarter.","Moving on the income statement, third quarter operating earnings totaled $154 million, up 9% to 22% of revenues. Depreciation and amortization totaled $15 million for the quarter. The effective tax rate was 29.3% for the quarter, down about 0.5 points from the year-ago quarter due largely to a geographic shift in earnings towards lower tax jurisdictions. For fiscal year 2012, we now estimate that the tax rate will be about 28%.","Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased significantly from the year-ago quarter to $113 million due largely to our ongoing share repurchase program. We repurchased 1.5 million shares in the quarter. Diluted earnings per share rose 16% to $0.96.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $633 million, debt of $175 million and stockholders equity of $1.5 billion. DSO improved by one day from the year-ago quarter to 80 days. Third quarter cash flow from operations was $143 million, more than net earnings due to noncash items and improvements in working capital. Primary uses of cash included $97 million for stock repurchases. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 4 million shares remaining under the current repurchase authorization.","Now, back to Tim for the outlook.","Timothy E. Guertin","Thanks, Elisha. With tremendous movements in currency exchange rates particularly the substantial weakening of the euro, we're adjusting our outlook for fiscal 2012. Compared with fiscal 2011 totals, we now believe that for fiscal year 2012, revenues could increase by about 8% and net earnings per diluted share from continuing operations could grow by 8% to 9%.","Thank you for your attention, and we're now ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","On freestanding centers, I just want to focus there to help everyone. You mentioned the impact. If we could take it back to 2009, there was a fair amount of understanding about negative commentary from ASTRO on the potential impact of these cuts, which were on the order of what we saw in the proposal for this year for freestanding centers. And there was one survey that suggested quite a few centers would close or potentially restrict treatments for non-CMS patients. So I was wondering, in your dialogue so far with ASTRO and potentially ASRO so far, can you characterize what you're hearing in terms of the message to CMS that they want to deliver about the potential impact of these cuts in an effort to try and turn the tide there?","Timothy E. Guertin","Clearly, ASTRO has been speaking with its members. And nearly 50% of freestanding clinics have indicated that they would either need to shut down or consolidate in some way or restrict Medicare patients. So this is a draconian cut and furthermore it's in error. The formula that was used, they adjusted the hours that they had assigned the radiation therapy, but they did not open up the formula. There were a variety of other errors in the formula itself and when you use correct assumptions for the expenses associated with equipment and time and vault expenses and a variety of other things, you wind up with reimbursement rates similar to what they are today. So for all of those reasons, we think that when that evidence is presented to CMS, which, of course, will happen, by ASTRO and by Association of Freestanding Clinics and by Varian and by others, I think that they'll see that there's enough information that they should rectify this change, that it was a mistake to do this. It's a little different than that we saw in 2009 because in 2009, they made assumptions based upon trigger radiation oncology like we were in imaging business. And so, CMS reversed that because MedPAC encouraged them to do so. In this case, we think we have to open up formulas and reacquaint them with how radiation therapy mathematics actually works in the clinic and change a variety of their assumptions. If they don't do that, then yes, the impact is rather severe and cancer patients will suffer. So we expect that a lot of politicians will get involved and will vent their frustration on this kind of behavior on the part of ASTRO because voters will be affected.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Tim, that's really helpful. One on gross margins in oncology, Elisha. On the last call, you gave us a sense that you could maintain gross margins in oncology at fiscal '12 level going forward and with the cost-cutting programs that we talked about. It looks like in the fourth quarter gross margin in oncology might be a little wider than the third quarter implied by the outlook, are you still in the view that this fiscal '12 level and maybe 44 is a good level to shoot for, for a sustainable gross margin level for oncology?","Elisha W. Finney","Yes, I think 43 to 44, Steve, is a pretty good level. I need to put the caveat in there that we are just seeing unprecedented swings in currency, which are having a major impact of 50 basis points or so. But when I look at the mix of business, the profiting backlog, the geographic mix, the product mix, from where I sit today, I think that 43 to 44 should be sustainable as we hopefully continue to get some cost reductions going forward. But again, currency, geography can change that pretty significantly in any given quarter compared to another.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then just one housekeeping question and then I'll drop. MedTek tax for next year for the fiscal year, somewhere from $10 million to $12 million range, would that be about right?","Elisha W. Finney","Well, if I annualized that, and again we're still trying to understand all of the rules in terms of deferred revenue and how installation, warranty and freight and all of those things are going to be treated. But if I just do a very, very rough calculation, taking U.S. sales of oncology plus aftermarket sales of X-Ray and excluding service and applying the 2.3%, it comes to about an annualized pretax number of $20 million. And then, of course, we were taxed after that.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Dalton Chandler with Needham & Company.","Dalton L. Chandler - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up in the oncology orders. I think you said overall, it was up 4% in constant currency. Press release says North America was up 4%. You also gave us -- Europe up 5% in constant currency, Asia up 11% in constant currency. So what's the number I'm missing that gets the average of all that down to 4%?","Elisha W. Finney","Yes, it's the rest of the world was down in double-digits in constant currency about 15% in dollars and that would include primarily Latin America.","Dalton L. Chandler - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","You said it was about 15% in constant currency?","Elisha W. Finney","Yes, it's a small part of our business. It ranges from about 5% to 7% of the total Oncology business.","Dalton L. Chandler - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I guess, just to follow up on that, given where the global economy seems to be today, do you think you for the foreseeable future this sort of the mid-single-digit order rate is where we are or do you think there's a potential rebound sooner?","Timothy E. Guertin","Well, yes, you're asking me the $64 million question. Clearly, the impact on capital markets was slower to hit us than it was some other companies. And about the situation with the euro and the situation with Southern Europe and the confusion in the United States over reimbursement rates in Medicare has started to affect capital equipment and us along with it. And so, if we go forward and the euro stays at 120 or north of that, I think we can find ways to accommodate it. So we'll have to look at that. The good news is, I think it is possible to make this business. I've been saying that my target was to make this a $4 billion business over 3 years. I'm not sure I can do it in 3 years, but I'm pretty sure we could still make it the $4 billion company. China, Southeast Asia, Japan, all still are functioning very well. We were going to have to be cautious because of currency volatility in North America and Europe, especially Southern Europe behavior. The global economy is going to make it a challenge for financing in those locations. And their substantial political uncertainty as well. But we're confident in our technology and our market position. Do I think we can do better? You bet. So we are going to compete aggressively for business. We're going to introduce some new products. We're enhancing our team especially in Asia. I think that in this partnership is going to help us. We're going to use price judiciously as a weapon and we're increasing our presence in a lot of countries. We're going to do what we can to protect reimbursement or we have to do more clinical research. I think we have over ideal ways that we can do this. I don't want to specifically tell you how I think 2013 is going to work out because I want the couple of months to see what the euro does and to see what North America reimbursement trends are and to see whether we can get that reimbursement situation turned around. But hopefully by November, I'll have a much better picture of this. But the list of concerns that you have is the same list of concerns that I have and so all we can do is fight back and we're going to fight back in all the ways that I mentioned.","Operator","And our Next question comes from the line of Jason Wittes with Caris.","Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just to clarify on the guidance. That's FX, but it also sounds like there's a little bit of concern about the U.S. market and especially that 10% of freestanding clinics. I just want to make sure we -- I also understand.","Elisha W. Finney","Jason, let me kind of give you the guidance block, if you will, from the last quarter when we gave guidance for the fiscal year versus the current guidance for the fiscal year. And the FX impact was significant to say the least. When we gave guidance last quarter, the euro was at about 134. As of yesterday it hit about 120. So 10%, 12% decline in just the last 3 months. So pretty significant. What that meant to our top line is we lost about $20 million just due to the euro exchange rates, and the other $20 million or so is from the fact that we have first thought we would get the Maryland or the Saudi revenue for the proton center both in Q4. I just am not certain that the financing for Maryland is going to be all of the I's dotted, the T's crossed and the contracts signed. And so to be conservative, took it out. It really has no impact on EPS because as you know, the first couple of proton deals are going to be at very, very low margins. So the impact from last guidance to this guidance due to FX alone is $0.05 to $0.06.","Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So that $0.05 to $0.06 is specifically FX related. And then on the top line, you also have the move out of Saudi and Maryland, just to characterize. Okay. So I guess, it sounds like there's pretty much -- and I don't think this is a big surprise, no leverage on the bottom line to be expected this quarter, except maybe from share buyback -- excuse me, for the year?","Elisha W. Finney","For the year, no. In fact, if you include the proton revenue for the year, the RoS, when you pencil this out, it's going to be around 21%. It was 22.7% in the year-ago period. The impact -- you also, you have to back out proton revenue in the fourth quarter of last year. You remember we started the Scripps project and there was a be catch-up of $33 million. So if I just flip out protons year-over-year, it's more like a 1.5 decline in the EBIT margin. And again, a lot of that is currency-driven.","Timothy E. Guertin","Okay. And I'll just add that we've mentioned in the past that we have significant natural hedging, and we do. But the currency, the amount of business that we're doing in Europe in terms of sales combined with the substantial size of the currency swing is just greater than our natural hedge.","Elisha W. Finney","Yes, Q4 is the biggest impact because we have more revenue in Q4 than any other quarter. And of course, the expenses are a little more linear throughout the year.","Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just to backtrack on the reimbursement rates, it sounds like you feel there's a pretty strong case here to be made on reversing those trends, which in terms of at least what they said about their freestanding clinics. I guess in the interim, though, I think have you already seen some holdouts? One, have you already seen some holdouts in terms of order rates from the freestanding clinics? But B, as a backdrop, have they actually been that strong this year anyway and was there much incorporated to your guidance to begin with?","Timothy E. Guertin","It's about 20% of North American business freestanding this year and that includes the third quarter. I don't think -- obviously, this could affect the behavior of freestanding clinics in the fourth quarter. Some of them may adopt a wait and see. We'll have to do it. It's not -- I do think that's necessarily a big swing factor for us in the fourth quarter, but will be a problem in 2013 if it doesn't get turned around. So we have logical and meritorious arguments. To the extent that logical and meritorious arguments will affect the U.S. government agency, I think we will win.","Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","And I guess just on the same ...","Spencer R. Sias","Jason, this is Spence. Listen, in the interest of fairness to the other analysts who are covering here, we'll try to circle around back to you if we can [indiscernible].","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Feffer with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Tim, a couple of quarters ago, you mentioned that as you look at U.S. oncology, you're seeing that market evolving more as a replacement market since you're at pretty high level penetration. So given some of the, I guess, CapEx trends that we've seen, are you seeing any extension or delays in hospitals purchasing new equipment?","Timothy E. Guertin","We have definitely seen some hospitals in -- make some delays. But hospital business seems to be growing in the U.S. and they just got good news, they just got told that their reimbursement is going up. So I would expect hospitals to feel better about the situation right now and act accordingly. Have we seen some hospitals delay decisions? Yes, we have, and I'm hoping that those decision slide no further than the fourth quarter.","Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And just very quickly on x-ray. Where specifically are you seeing most of the weakness or is it pretty global?","Timothy E. Guertin","In X-ray, we're talking about what our customers are seeing. And what they're seeing is a global capital equipment, big systems, scanners and X-ray product, X-ray systems and all these kinds of things. The things we sell tubes and panels for, there's just been a global capital slowdown in this area. So in the first part of the year we saw an inventory adjustment. That's sort of ended. Now what we're just seeing is a slowing, a general slowing of business that's affected our business. At the same time, we think our share is growing in panels and X-ray tubes. We think that we're seeing opportunities that we haven't seen before and we're seeing some customers come to us that we haven't had a chance to talk to before. I mentioned Siemens, for example, as an opportunity that's already starting to have some movement. So for all of those reasons, I think we're strengthening our market position. But in this case, the stronger wind was created by kind of a global slowdown in capital equipment","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was hoping team, Tim, if you could comment a little bit and how you're thinking about capital deployment and the context of what is more difficult operating environment. Your reference obviously, the global CapEx slowdown, as well as some broad-based macroeconomic uncertainty. Obviously, there was accelerated share repurchase programs that you did last year, maybe how you're thinking about cash at this point and can you just remind us what your priorities are?","Elisha W. Finney","Sure. Well, and David, you know we have spent -- in fact, we spent more than the cash generated in the U.S. over the last year and share repurchase and returning capital to shareholders. So we're in the enviable position. We have strong cash flow. We have a very conservative balance sheet. And we spent a lot of time thinking about what's the best way to return that cash to shareholders, whether it's a share repurchase, acquisition, and we can be opportunistic on repurchases based on the stock price. But of course, we're still going to be prudent relative to what's going on in the worldwide economy and what our cash position is and what our debt levels are. So no, this is not giving any guidance or indication as to what our plans are, but I think you should anticipate that we will continue to have a share repurchase program, that we have been buying somewhere between 1 million and 1.5 million shares per quarter on average for the last several quarters. And obviously, it increases our return on equity significantly by having lower cash assets and it's something that we'll continue to do.","Timothy E. Guertin","We have a nice line of credit in the U.S. to hold us up. Of course, a lot of our cash is internationally and that's why we made that move. And I'll just speak to the acquisition point. In my view, we're having a recession in the U.S. And if, let's say, austerity wins out over stimulus in this situation, then we can expect this to go on for a while. I think that is going to create opportunities for us in the acquisition arena, if not, in the early part of 2013, but certainly by the latter part of 2013. I think we will see more acquisition opportunities. When you combine that to the fact that in that -- for some companies, this 2.25% tax burden will be lethal, I think that creates opportunities as well. So, Elisha, spoke to the buyback thing, but I'll just speak to the acquisition things and say, I think opportunities will arrive in 2013 and then our cash position puts us in a position to do both buybacks and some kind of prudent acquisitions where they fit with our business.","Elisha W. Finney","And I just want to finalize by saying, just as a reminder, given that we are borrowing at about a 1% aftertax rate, it is significantly accretive to the spending to even be borrowing at this point and spending all of the cash generated in the U.S. to do the buybacks.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That makes sense. And then, Tim, maybe a follow up for you and your comments about using price judiciously. I guess what I wanted to extrapolate is, has this market sort of gone from an oligopoly to a duopoly given Siemens' retrenchment here. Could you maybe speak to your view on why price competition would be intensifying here? Is that more a function of geographic mix in the market to which you're selling and those will comprise bigger percentage of the growth rate or is there something that's happening in the competitive set that's driving prices lower?","Timothy E. Guertin","Yes. I think mix, geographic mix will make a difference because in Asia and Latin America, there may be -- in the capital pressures exist around the world. And so people may want to have a business that the competition may be especially fierce and maybe some large tenders for which the competition is exceedingly fierce. So we may see that kind of activity. At the same time, price -- the other effect on price is just simply that I think our major competitor will be trying to get share. And we're going to be trying to get share at the same time. Siemens has exited the market that left a hole. It's not a huge hole, but it's a hole and we're all going to try to fill it and that is going to grade especially in developing markets were Siemens was strong. That's going to create the kind of fierce competition. And I think our competitor has made some predictions about the behavior of markets in 2013, and currency helps them in this current situation. And I think they will try to take advantage of that to strengthen their business. We have, of course, our traditional advantages. Our machines are very fast. We have the highest quality of machines. I think we offer superior value proposition to our customers and we'll take advantage of all of those. But I just -- when you have markets that are not growing as fast as they did, you get -- and you have a small number of competitors, they're going to fight and that's what we're going to see here.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla with Citi.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Tim, you generally in your prepared comments, you go into a lot more detail about what's actually happening in the regions for the Oncology business. So I was hoping you could actually just talk through North America and rest of world specifically with regards to Linac volume price and market share in the past quarter, and how those may have been the same or changed given the growth rates you just talked about in the order book?","Timothy E. Guertin","So you're telling me -- you want to understand North America how pricing volume and everything change in North America?","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And share.","Timothy E. Guertin","And share, yes. Okay. well, obviously, since this conversation is a direct channel to my competitors, I'm loathe to discuss volumes except to the extent that we already have by revealing the numbers. I will -- on share, I will tell you, that we study electors' releases as I imagine that you do. As a principal competitor, it's very hard to tell sometimes because we have to extract out their acquisitions. We have to extract out their service business, which is -- require some estimation to do that. We're confident that our market share is about the same as it was a year ago excluding the new Proton acquisition for them. We think our strategy to maintain share or gross share is going to work under these circumstances. But if you ask me to give you Linac numbers this year versus last year and volume and price and all that sort of stuff, I'd rather not get into that level of detail because at this point, as you mentioned -- as was mentioned earlier were down at the competitors and I just have to be more careful about what I say than I have in the past.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Would you be willing to just at least say if Linac volume grew or wad decline or stable, could you at least give a qualitative like that? And that's something you've done in the past.","Timothy E. Guertin","It fluctuates a lot from quarter-to-quarter. So let me think about that question. I don't think I'm willing to answer that at this moment.","Elisha W. Finney","Let me just add, Amit, that service is the biggest growth driver in the third quarter.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then just sort of like a follow up. You touched upon like kind of what happened in 2009 after the reimbursement rates came out and, yes, there was a little bit of market stagnation. Can you at least just tell us how July has played out? And if you're seeing any benefit from Siemens overseas?","Timothy E. Guertin","We've seen the Siemens effect. They've helped us on some deals. We're thrilled to have them as a partner in their very helpful. But I think there's some situations where we're going to get business that we would not have been able to get business before. So I can't speak to the Siemens thing. I would prefer not to talk about July now. I think I'll make all of that clear when I make my fourth quarter remarks. But I mean it's obviously, we're all going to be watching the way freestanding clinics behave in the next 3 months, and I'll get back to you with that when I have the discussions. And what I'm hoping for is, what I've said, which is we can turn this reimbursement situation around, then 2013 looks nicer.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Tim, I want to start with you. Just, I guess, Elisha gave the number that America was down from 15% constant currency on orders in oncology in the quarter. What's going on there? Is it top comps? Is the market slow, share loss? Just how do you quantify that?","Timothy E. Guertin","There's some -- no, it has to do with some large tenders that are happening in those territories and those tenders just did not happen this quarter. They are happening in the future. We might have originally expected they happen this quarter but are happening later. We're going to have to look at those tenders when they come out and decide how we're going to respond to them. But -- so this is just a lack of business, and it has to do with timing. It's not a lack of interest, it's not a loss of share, it's just share, it's just timing.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So outside of Brazil, your orders in Australia and some of those other markets and maybe you didn't mention doing okay or ...","Elisha W. Finney","Well, it's such a small market. I believe was down in the quarter, but again just doesn't mean anything in one given quarter. But you are correct, we include Australia and the rest of the world numbers.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Fair enough. And then, Elisha, did I hear you were right on guidance so it sounds like in the revenue change that you're making the guidance really the only 2 things their FX and proton, there's no operational change outside of proton implied in your revenue guidance?","Elisha W. Finney","Nothing significant. I mean obviously, we would have like to have made of that up in Q4, but where the currency is and even the order rate in Q3 particularly for X-ray, which is a short cycle business. Even though it's going to be tougher to do. But $20 million for proton and $20 million for FX is 95%, 97% of the impact.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then last question for me. I'm jumping between call here, so I don't think I'm repeating here. But on the manufacturing cost side, I know you guys have been making some efforts there to take cost out of the process both manufacturing and I guess more assembly than anything. Some of those efforts I think were focused on sourcing from alternate suppliers or maybe even do was suppliers things like that, but you need to be at regulatory approval there. If you do change out a part or something, I mean,  are there any efforts that are close to being done at this point? How do think that plays out over the coming quarters?","Elisha W. Finney","We're going -- we'll never be done. This is something we are just going to chip away at dollar by dollar by dollar from now until the end of time, Jeff, and we did made good progress in the quarter. It came a lot from installation. You'll see that we did exceed the state estimates. Some of that was literally getting some acceptance revenue in sooner than we had anticipated, and I think that was the result of getting these installs improved. We have improvements in warranty, we had improvements in purchasing costs in doing some bulk purchasing in factory efficiency, it was just a little bit of gross across the board, but we're not going to take our eye off the ball on this, sort of something that we'll just keep at.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Still feel comfortable with taking that 15,000 to 20, out for Linac kind of range?","Elisha W. Finney","That's what we're shooting for.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone with Jefferies.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","One reimbursement and then one on oncology, one on guidance. For reimbursement, Tim, I know that the stats that have been thrown out there with the IMRT cuts that proposed. You mentioned 50% of the freestanding clinics can potentially go out of business. In your mind, what is the threshold of where the cut would have to settle so that won't be the case? And if it is the case and we're sort of that threshold that's too high, do you see more rapid consolidation of freestanding clinics into hospitals?","Timothy E. Guertin","Under no circumstances should freestanding clinic reimbursement be below hospital reimbursement, and that's what happened. And I think that the idea was that hospitals have all of this overhead and everything. But the fact is that freestanding clinics have a lot of overhead. For example, in staffing issue, usually hospitals have a lot more clinics at a particular location. A freestanding clinic may only have one. So they have extra headcount associated with that. They may have resources that are not shared and the way they are with hospitals. And they may not have the loading that a hospital does because a hospital gets referred from its own institution. So they may have fewer patients per day. So for all of these reasons, I believe freestanding reimbursement should be higher than it is for a hospital, and under no circumstances should it be lower than what a hospital gets. So if you asked me the question where should it settle, I think it should settle above where hospitals are, but the amount above, we're going to have to do mathematically. And we're going to make our recommendations -- we, and other people are going to go back to CMS and were going to tell them. When we do the math, it comes out like this and see what they have to say.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Sure. That's helpful. And then just in terms of consolidation there, do you think some clinics will preemptively look to the consolidator consumed by hospital or is this still going to be wait and see until November?","Timothy E. Guertin","Well, the rules are kind of complicated. If you're a freestanding clinic and you get bought by a hospital but you're not in the physical -- you're not at the physical location of the hospital, then you're still a freestanding clinic. So -- but on the other hand, hospitals might be able to consolidate planning services and do things like that to try and reduce cost. So -- and if some freestandings close, then patients will either not be treated, which is of course, the worst fear, or they're going to have to make trips into hospitals to be treated. That will increase the workload of the hospitals and the hospitals will have to respond by doing something about it. Will they buy used equipment or will they buy new equipment? I really don't know. As you get into this imponderable territory, if you have a train wreck, what will happen in response of the train wreck? But honestly, I just can't bring myself to believe that CMS must stick to this strategy when they understand just how erroneous the math was.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just on oncology quick ones here. My understanding is that all the information management system you have, is that already fully communicating with the Siemens Linac install base, and can you just provide an update on the approval process for UNIQUE in China?","Timothy E. Guertin","We can communicate good some Siemens equipment. Other than Siemens equipment, we cannot. That is actually one of the things that we're trying to fix with this arrangement with Siemens their providing us with information that we did not have before and we are going to talk at ASTRO. If you come to ASTRO, we'll be able to give you better timing on this and share show you what we've got in accomplishment. Obviously, that was one of the things we hope to accomplish in our relationship with Siemens was to do that. So a bit more formal announcements about what we're able to do there. All we're telling customers is that we went from a situation in which we did not have the cooperation of Siemens in terms of talking to their equipment to a situation in which we do have the cooperation of Siemens to talking to their equipment, and we targeted ASTRO as the time that we would give specific details on that.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Junaid Husain with Dougherty & Company.","Junaid Husain - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division","Elisha, on the guidance front, just so this is clear in my head. I know it's hard to figure out the directionality of currency, but does the new guns reflect currency rates where they are today or the does it reflect where you think currency could go by the end of fiscal year?","Elisha W. Finney","No, no. I'm not in the business of predicting it, Junaid. So last quarter, again it was about $1.34 when we gave the guidance. I mean -- we put a range so that I could tolerate a couple of percentage points directional change in either way. But it was just 10% or 12%. We certainly can give guidance expecting that kind of a range. So it's really based on about where we are today at the 120, 121 level that we're looking forward into Q4.","Junaid Husain - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division","And then, Tim, on the proton side, with the proposed lower reimbursement rates for protons, what are conversations been like with the centers that have been contemplating making an investment in proton technology and then what you said has been tougher for them to get financing, you mentioned Maryland.","Timothy E. Guertin","Remember, Maryland, Emory, all of these are freestanding clinics. They negotiate their rates with the local Medicare -- they're considered local and they get a rate assigned to them as a freestanding clinic, a local and they negotiate those rates. For hospitals, the CMS and that with the CMS proposal is about hospitals. They use 3 institutions: Loma Linda and Massachusetts General and quite probably Penn. And that's 3 institutions, Loma Linda and Mass General, had their capital equipment was bought many, many years ago and is substantially depreciated. So under those circumstances, the numbers are kind of meaningless. The install base is too low to get the math right. On -- we just got a new contract with Emory that I mentioned, they were aware of the new rates when they signed that contract. So I think that's an example of the kind of thinking that people are doing there. So I still believe that for a lot of these institutions, based -- frankly, it just hasn't come up. I mean, obviously, it comes up in the context of discussing regular radiation oncology, but we're not really seeing people stop discussing protons because of this announcement about hospital-based reimbursement.","Junaid Husain - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division","Got you. And then, Tim, last question for you. I think you mentioned that Latin America has been a tad weak. And you mentioned or you alluded to some government tenders. I believe that government tender is Brazil, and is there anything you can tell us about what's going on with this tender?","Timothy E. Guertin","There is a significant tender coming up in Brazil. I expect it to come out in the fourth quarter and we'll take a look at it at that time. I can't really speculate until I see it, what the response will be. Obviously, it's going to be us versus Elekta. Elekta will be anxious to get it. This is going to be one of those battles that I mentioned earlier in answering questions.","Junaid Husain - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division","And how many linear accelerators?","Spencer R. Sias","This is Spencer. I just want to get everybody in. The answer is something like 80 accelerators, but we want the next person to have a chance to ask a question.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just first question on numbers for, Elisha. So if we look at this quarter, you'd be by $0.02, you're lowering guidance depending on where consensus comes out by about $0.10 in the fourth quarter. So looks like there's about $0.12 net there. You said currency about $0.06 of that. I'm just trying to reconcile what the rest of that would come from?","Elisha W. Finney","No. As I mentioned, I mean we just, it was timing, it was a good news that we got some revenue and profits sooner than we had expected, which came into Q3 and then there was just timing of expenses, which is always the case. So for the year, the midpoint is coming down by the $0.06 and that is the currency impact that we talked about.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then, Tim, on your strategy for developing markets, I mean you talked about using price judiciously as a weapon. I mean obviously, cutting price in emerging markets to be gain share can be somewhat dangerous. Can you comment a little bit more about where you see TrueBeam going with those customers, when UNIQUE starts to have an impact. I'm just -- I mean, the concern here is that you're going to start cutting very quickly on price and not be able to recover?","Timothy E. Guertin","So I'll begin by reminding everyone that there are a lot of things we're going to do before we resort to price. We want to have superior products. We want to have the best people. We're going to add staffing in locations. We are, so that we have greater presence, we're going to use the Siemens partnership. And so there's a variety of things that were going to do. All I was indicating there is that I expect the -- in a lot of situations, maybe where it used to be, Varian in versus Siemens. Now it's always going to be Varian versus Elekta, and I expect some of those battles to be difficult. Some customers put price high on their list of considerations. The people put pricing low on their list of considerations. Where pricing is not number one on the consideration, I think we have a good chance to be able to hold price or maybe get superior pricing. So far, oncology order pricing is holding and -- but I'm just saying, we're going to have to be in this market under these conditions, I think all of the players are going to be very aggressive about share. We're going to be aggressive about share. But you should not -- when I hear that, when I say that, you should not necessarily read into that the price is the first weapon were going to use.","Elisha W. Finney","And I'll just add to that, that our service business has grown in low-double-digits year-to-date so every socket we capture is very important to on a go-forward basis. I'm walking in that annuity.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then last one, on the position fee schedule, I guess 2 things: One, as we think about this current quarter, in your own assumptions, are you assuming a similar dynamic that we saw in 2009 in terms of orders basically freezing on the freestanding side? And then second, do we assume that going after treatment times in freestanding could maybe lead to going after treatment times on a hospital side? Obviously, they didn't do that this time around.","Timothy E. Guertin","Well, the hospital formula is quite different than the freestanding formula, and this is one of the points that we made is that they're calculated on different basis. And so, I wouldn't necessarily assume that a formula that was used for freestanding clinics would result in the same changes for a hospital base. In terms of -- what was the first part of your question again?","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Are you assuming a repeat of the 12 '09 for this current quarter in terms of the freestanding market essentially freezing here until we have resolution over the physician fee schedule?","Timothy E. Guertin","I think that there are some freestanding sites that have enough patients that their confidence will be reasonably high, that they can proceed. And I don't think freestanding clinics really believe, I think that a lot of freestanding people believe that this condition -- that there's not going to be any situation imaginable per hospitals wind up being above the compensation for freestanding clinics. I don't think anybody thinks that situation is going to stand and that at the very, very, very worst, and this would still be wrong, that freestandings would be the same as hospitals and under -- if you do the math under those considerations, I think that a lot of them are still going to think that there's opportunity here. However, caution will be probably more likely in the fourth quarter. We've sort of taken, as we looked at our sales situation, we try to take that into account, but we'll have to see how people behave on the orders front. I think in the end, some -- yes, you should expect some caution on the part of buyers but people are still talking to us, people are still interested. So -- and there's still need for these freestanding clinics.","Sean D. Lavin - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And do you think the 6% hospital increase holds or is there a risk that, that gets dialed back?","Timothy E. Guertin","We've done all the -- we do on the average, we calculated, there's 2. I think some of the codes are up in the 5 to 6 category, but we calculated it a 2. We think that's going to hold. We think the mathematics for that is certain. As I said, I think issue is on the freestanding side. There also, I'll just mention, the data that was used was based upon internet data and brochures and things like that. It wasn't based upon a study. And ordinarily, the rules that require that a study be properly conducted. So for all of those reasons, we think that will be reversed. But on the hospital side, I don't see anything that would cause me to think that, that 2% will drop.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, with no further questions in the queue, this concludes today's question-and-answer session.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Mr. Spencer Sias, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications for Varian Medical Systems. Thank you, Mr. Sias. You may begin.","Spencer R. Sias - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Varian Medical Systems conference call for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. With me are Dow Wilson, President and CEO; Elisha Finney, CFO; and Magnus Momsen, our Controller. Dow and Elisha will summarize Varian results and we'll take your questions following the presentation.","To simplify our discussion, unless otherwise stated, all references to the quarter or year are fiscal quarters and fiscal years. Quarterly comparisons are for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 versus the second quarter of fiscal 2016. References to financial results for orders are to gross orders, unless otherwise indicated.","The company is reporting non-GAAP results in order to provide quarter-over-quarter comparisons of operational performance, excluding unusual items. Unless otherwise stated, all financial results are discussed from continuing operations on a non-GAAP basis. Results exclude for all periods the Imaging components business, which is now operating separately as Varex Imaging and is accounted for as a discontinued operation.

So this is my 73rd and last call with all of you, which is probably enough for anybody. And it has been a pleasure to work with you, and I want to thank you for the support you have shown me and Varian for all these years. I'm as excited as ever about the future of this company, and I expect to continue being a Varian investor, like all of you, for many more years. Thanks again for your support.","And now, here's Dow.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Good afternoon. I'm pleased to report that our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 were at the high end of our earnings per share expectations. Highlights included solid growth in orders and revenues in our Oncology Systems business, a new system order in our Particle Therapy business, improved gross margins in our Oncology business and stepped-up investment in SG&A for market developments and new product introductions. Additionally, we successfully completed the spin-off of the Imaging Components business as Varex Imaging, which is off to a great start.","To summarize Varian's second quarter results, we are reporting GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $0.74 per diluted share and non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $0. 89 per diluted share; companywide revenues of $655 million, up 6%; solid Oncology orders of $648 million, up 5% in dollars and 6% constant currency, bringing year-to-date orders growth to 7% in dollars and constant currency; and a $26 million equipment order for a single-room proton system in Delray, Florida.","Focusing first on Oncology operations, we had a good quarter with solid order growth in emerging markets as well as healthy orders for software in North America and equipment in EMEA. Looking specifically at order growth rate in each region, oncology grew gross orders in the Americas by 3% in dollars and constant currency. Orders in North America were up by 3%, bringing the year-to-date order growth in this region to 5%.","Looking at some highlights in the Americas, we took orders to replace 12 accelerators from competitors. We also took numerous software orders for replacement of competitive software for treatment planning and information management. Among the competitive conversions was a $20 million, 10-year software commitment from Orlando Health. They will install our full suite of software including Eclipse, ARIA and Velocity systems and our FullScale managed services package. We booked nearly $7 million of that order in the second quarter, and we'll book the rest as installations are scheduled.","Elsewhere in North America, we booked 6 TrueBeam orders for installation at CHUL (5:19) in Qu\u00e9bec City and then another 3 TrueBeam orders for a Rhode Island Hospital in Providence. In Latin America, orders grew by nearly 10% versus a relatively small year-ago number, with order activity driven primarily by Brazil, where construction of our new Complexo for education and manufacturing is nearing completion. While the sales funnel across Latin America looks promising, activity is slow and we continue to be cautious about the rate of recovery in this market.","Turning to EMEA, orders rose 6% in dollars and 10% in constant currency. Africa, the Middle East and Western Europe were the biggest growth drivers in this region. Business in Africa has more than doubled over the past year and has risen successfully, successively for the last four quarters. As you may have seen from our recent press release, we are now selling direct in South Africa.","Among the highlights in Africa were orders for the first Edge Radiosurgery System in Morocco to serve the North Africa sub-region, and a low energy Linear Accelerator in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is the first modern Linear Accelerator in a country of more than 80 million people.","We also generated notable orders in Tunisia as well as in Turkey and Israel. Spain and Portugal contributed strongly to EMEA's Western European growth during the quarter, placing orders for a total of eight accelerators including 4 TrueBeams, 2 VitalBeams and two Clinacs. In APAC, gross orders rose 8% in dollars and 7% in constant currency.","Service grew in double-digits, but product sales also played a key role in this region. Orders in China rose by 8% and we believe we have the leading share in this market, particularly in the high-end segment with products like Trilogy, VitalBeam, TrueBeam and Edge. We are on track to top $225 million orders in China this year.","We also saw good order performance in Korea and the Philippines. We also received our first order in Cambodia for an accelerator and brachytherapy unit for Cambodia's largest public hospital, Calmette.","During the quarter, we hosted three users meetings in APAC including Beijing, Bangkok and Melbourne. We welcomed more than 1,000 customers at these terrific events where presentations focused on radiotherapy innovations , radiosurgery and the role of immunotherapy.","Turning to our Global Service business, we grew orders by 8% in the quarter and 7% for the first half. This more than $1 billion annual business is continuing to grow faster than oncology's overall growth rate and contributing to margin expansion. On the hardware front, TrueBeam continued its momentum with more than 1,700 installations worldwide or about 20% of our global installed base.","TrueBeam is a widely accepted product that addresses a clinical need in every region of the world. It is a versatile platform capable of delivering every type of treatment, from radiotherapy to radiosurgery with either electrons or photons and at multiple energy levels.","We are continuing to add to TrueBeam's capability. And later this year, we expect to introduce the first version of our HyperArc module for high definition head and neck radiosurgery with ultra-precise doses that cannot be matched by any other system on the market.","We're also making good progress with software. As of the end of the quarter, we had about 800 licenses ordered from more than 375 sites for our RapidPlan product that significantly enhances the quality and speed of treatment planning.","The ramp-up of this product has been tremendous. We see more opportunity ahead as less than 10% of the treatment planning installed base has adopted this technology since its introduction 18 months ago.","Our InSightive analytics software for identifying and removing bottlenecks in the clinical workflow has been ordered at more than 180 customer sites, who will use it to improve their clinical effectiveness and operational efficiency. We are building a robust pipeline of prospects for our 360 Oncology product.","I will now turn to our Particle Therapy business, which generated $31 million in revenues during the quarter and recorded $28 million in orders, including the Delray project. This project is being financed in part by the sale of $81 million in bonds, including $11 million of subordinated bonds purchased by Varian. Several other centers in the U.S. are working on similar bond financing.","In addition to the Delray order, Varian's ProBeam compact single room system has been selected as the equipment of choice for a center in Thailand. And we hope to book that order in the third quarter when the requisite paperwork is processed. Our proton sales funnel looks promising with another two to four projects that have the potential to be booked this year.","Before turning it over to Elisha, I want to take a few moments to call your attention to some recent promising studies on the role of radiotherapy for prostate and bone cancer as well as some lung cancer studies. The New England Journal of Medicine has published two recent positive studies for radiotherapy. The first shows that untreated prostate patients had more disease progression and metastatic disease compared to treated patients.","The study in the U.K. involved 1,600 patients who were randomized to either watchful waiting, radical prostatectomy, or 3D conformal radiotherapy over a 10-year period. The second study found no clinically significant difference in disease control between patients treated with either radiation or surgery.","However, patient-reported quality of life outcome showed that surgery had the greatest negative effect on sexual function and urinary continence. In contrast, radiotherapy had little effect on urinary continence.","Bowel toxicity was slightly worse with radiotherapy, but that largely cleared up after six months except for a minor increase in more frequent rectal bleeding. Today most radiotherapy for prostate cancer uses image-guided IMRT, a more precise method of dose delivery.","Also, ASTRO recently just published guidelines for palliation of bone mets with radiation, which continues to be the gold standard for palliative care. While 88% of hospice professionals believe radiotherapy should be used for pain control, only 3% of hospice patients actually receive it. A study in Canada showed similar results. Combined, these studies suggest that not only is radiation for bone mets effective, it is also underutilized.","Finally, two papers were presented recently at a Thoracic Cancer Meeting in San Francisco. The first was a multi-institutional study that analyzed patients over 80-years-old with early stage non-small cell lung cancer treated with radiosurgery. Despite their age, these patients tolerated radiation quite well with a 2-year local control of 84.5% and a cancer-specific survival of 73%, dispelling the myth that elderly patients cannot have curative radiation.","Second, preliminary results were reported in an abstract looking at 27 lung cancer patients retreated with proton therapy at MD Anderson. These patients typically do poorly. But in this study, 78% of patients had their tumors controlled at one year and had an impressive median survival of 18 months. Though retrospective, this small study does suggest that proton therapy may be an important tool for recurrent, previously radiated tumors.","Now, I'll turn it over to Elisha.","Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Dow, and hello, everyone. We have already covered orders and operations, so let me start with backlog. We ended the quarter at $3.1 billion, up 4% from the year-ago period including a 6% increase in the Oncology backlog to $2.9 billion. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled $50 million, bringing net orders for the company to $625 million.","Now, let me walk you through the P&L. Second quarter total company revenues from continuing operations were $655 million, up 6% in dollars and up 7% in constant currency. Oncology revenues totaled $624 million, up 7% in dollars and in constant currency versus the year-ago quarter. International revenues rose 10% and constituted 52% of Oncology revenues in the quarter. Year-to-date, Oncology revenues were up 3% in dollars and in constant currency.","Our Particle Therapy business posted revenues of $31 million, up 1% from the year-ago quarter driven by ongoing progress on installations. Year-to-date, Particle Therapy revenues were up 7%. The total company gross margin for the quarter was 42.2%, up 7 basis points with a 1-point gain in Oncology largely offset by declines in the proton business.","Oncology Systems gross margin increased by a point to 44.5%, due to a favorable product mix as well as product cost reductions. For the first half, Oncology gross margin is up almost 3 points to 45.6%.","Proton therapy gross margin was a negative 3.6%, due largely to revised profitability estimates on two projects in the U.K. where the pound is at a historical low. For the first half, proton gross margin is down from the year-ago period to 6%. For the first half, total company gross margin was up more than 2 points to 43. 7%.","Second quarter SG&A expenses were $118 million or 18% of revenues in line with our expectations as we accelerated investments in the introduction and commercialization of new products. Second quarter R&D expenses were $53 million or 8% of revenues, equal to the year-ago quarter as a percentage of revenue.","Second quarter operating earnings totaled $106 million or 16% of revenue, down from the year-ago quarter due to lower proton gross margin and the increased investment in SG&A. Depreciation and amortization totaled 19 million for the quarter. The effective tax rate was 21.6% for the quarter, lower than expected due to a large revenue shift to EMEA where rates are relatively low. For the balance of the year, we believe Varian's tax rate will be about 24% to 25%.","During the quarter, we spent $173 million to repurchase 2 million shares of stock. Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased 2.5 million from the year-ago quarter to 93.7 million due to our ongoing share repurchase program.","Diluted GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.74 for the quarter. Non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.89. Year-to-date, non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.47 including the $0.34 impact from proton accounts receivable impairments in Q1 versus $1.67 for the same period last year.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $706 million, debt of $547 million and stockholders' equity of $1.3 billion. DSO at 108 days was down nine days from the year-ago period due exclusively to significant improvements in our Oncology business, which is at 96 days.","Cash flow from operations including discontinued operations was $32 million for the second quarter and $114 million for the first half. Primary uses of cash were $173 million toward the repurchase of 2 million shares of stock and $15 million for CapEx.","As of today, we have 6 million shares remaining under our existing repurchase authorization. This is my last call as well, and I will be retiring as CFO on May 8. For me, it has been a tremendous pleasure to work with you. And I thank you for the support that you have shown me and this great company. Like Spencer, I will be a long-term Varian shareholder, and my blood will always run Varian Blue.","And now, let me turn it back to Dow.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Elisha. We now believe that for the second through fourth quarters of fiscal 2017, total company revenues from continuing operations will grow in the range of 3% to 5%, depending on the timing of proton orders.","For the full fiscal year, total company revenues from continuing operations should grow in the range of 2% to 4%. For the second through fourth quarters, we expect that earnings per diluted share from continuing operations will be in the range of $2.98 to $3.06. For the full fiscal year, earnings per share from continuing operations should be in the range of $3.56 to $3.64, including the $0.34 impairment of proton account receivables in the first quarter.","For the third fiscal quarter, we believe Varian revenues from continuing operations will grow by about 3%. And we expect that non-GAAP earnings per diluted share will be in the range of $0.92 to $0.96.","To summarize the second quarter, we had solid orders and revenue growth in Oncology systems, a new single-room proton order, a gain in our gross margin and earnings at the high end of our target range. We have stepped up our investment in market development as well as new product introductions that will drive continued growth around the globe.","I want to remind you to attend our Investor Meeting next week at the New York Stock Exchange or via webcast. You can get details on our Investor Relations website. We're excited about the future, and we're looking forward to the rest of fiscal year 2017.","Before turning it over to your questions, I'd like to acknowledge Elisha and Spencer for their many contributions to the company, 70-plus quarters together, what's the exact count?","Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","73.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","73 quarters together, that's more than imaginable. And we are so grateful for their contributions, for the advocacy they've had for our customers, for our shareholders, for our employees and for the communities that we live and operate in. They've been great business partners. And on behalf of myself and the company, we wish to thank them. We'll miss their leadership and we'll miss the blond hair flip and the voluble banter.","So with that, we'll open up for questions. Thank you, Spencer and Elisha.","Spencer R. Sias - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Hey, thank you very much, Dow. I just want to thank you for those comments. But I also want to just interject a quick correction. We talked about the Investor Meeting next week at the New York Stock Exchange. It is on May 10th, which is the week after next. And so the details are there. And not your fault. It's just my final error, I hope.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","May 10th. And we'll now open for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson of Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yes. Thank you. Good morning guys. Elisha and Spencer, congratulations on the retirements, and best of luck to you. And Elisha, how you survived 73 quarters with that man, I don't know.","Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Thank you, Jeff.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","And Spencer that was supposed to be a backhanded compliment to you as well. So congratulations","Spencer R. Sias - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yes, I got that. I got that, Jeff. Thank you","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","So a couple of questions, Dow, first just on guidance. You came in at revenue wise above kind of the three-quarter guidance that you've been providing. You came up above that from a revenue perspective this quarter. But you are lowering the low end of that three-quarter revenue guidance. So just trying to figure out the dynamics of a third, a second quarter that was kind of above expected, but now guidance is being trimmed at the bottom end. And what's driving that?","And then a second guidance question, just it looks like tax rate guidance is now adding about $0.10 relative to what we were thinking going into this quarter for the rest of the year. And yet, you're not changing EPS guidance, so any color there would be helpful as well. Thank you.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah Elisha, go ahead.","Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. Jeff, so let me take the tax first. So yes, it was lower than we expected in Q1. It ended up being roughly an exact offset to the reduction in the proton gross profit that we were expecting. So we hit the high end of the guidance range for the quarter, although the geography was a little different.","For the balance of the year, we continue to believe that tax is going to be now we think in the 24% to 25% range, which will get you up to about call it 24% for the year. We had previously guided 25% to 26%. So we're getting about a 1-point improvement in the tax rate largely offset by the proton gross profit.","And I think, we said last quarter, the biggest unknown in this whole \u2013 doing the discontinued operations and spinning out of Varex, the tax rate was kind of the cloudiest, if you will, for us to see.","The good news is we were able to shave out a point. And again, we think the full year closer to 24%, which should be sustainable going forward. So in the guidance, again because we got an improvement in the tax rate, the gross profit for the year for protons, we're losing somewhere around $6 million or $7 million. So that tax is an offset to that.","The gross profit for Oncology, right in line with what we were expecting in the call it the 44% to 45.5% range, SG&A, maybe $1 million or $2 million high, but within our expectations. So we simply raised the midpoint at this point in the quarter from $3.00 to $3.02 for the balance of the year and came off the low end of that guidance number. Does that answer your question?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yes, I think on the revenue side, really on the timing of protons...","Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yes...","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","...proton deals, that's the shoring up of the bottom end of the revenue guidance.","Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yes.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And Dow, maybe one follow-up just on the proton side. So when I think back five, six years ago when you first announced the Scripps deal and the balance sheet risk with that, I think one of the explanations was you had to get a win on the board and if you had to put the balance sheet at risk to kind to get a win on the board that makes sense.","Over the last few years, there's been a couple of other financing deals you guys have been involved with, but they've been big systems, they are multi-room systems. And we kind of thought as we go to single-room systems and you've got 16, now 17 orders out there, you didn't have to prove yourself anymore.","On this new deal, single-room system, you still have to put the balance sheet at risk. So I guess, what is driving that need to continue to put the balance sheet at risk, now that you have plenty of orders out there, you've proven yourself. The orders are getting smaller. Yet you're still having to get involved to get these things over the finish line?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","I think. I mean, first of all when you look at this deal, Delray, it's about $80 million of capitalization. We are $11 million of it. As I mentioned in the script, we think there's a few more like that.","These are deals that look pretty good to us from a profitability point of view. It remains difficult to finance. Having said that, when you look at the risk, when you look at the ramp-up of centers, pretty much every center that we have and that we know about, as we've looked at that ramp-up on these single-room systems, they get to profitability pretty quickly.","So the issue has been these three and four room centers have a lot of capital in them and the breakeven point is much, much higher. On these single-room systems, the breakeven point is much lower. We think they'll get to those volumes very quickly, should be able to be refinanced.","And if we can help bootstrap that and get it going, we're very much into it. So we did view this segment as this compact segment as a distinct segment to the proton market. We will use our balance sheet selectively there. We are vetting the risks very carefully. So that we're in with others. We're looking very hard at the referral networks and patient volumes to make sure they can get to those levels. And if we do it, it's also a profitability case. The interest income is not negligible on these loans.","Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yes. If I could just add one thing to that, I mean this is a developer deal with Proton International. Everybody has some skin in game in this particular deal, Jeff. So the doctors have money in. Everybody came together to get this to happen and it was oversubscribed on the muni financing by a significant amount. So we took that as great news that there is a real market for financing these one-room centers.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. And maybe I'd just add, we're not going to go crazy on this. We might, if everything went our way, maybe two more of these in the next 6 to 12 months. I mean at the high end, three. So it's not going to be, we still got Maryland out there, I'm sorry, not Maryland, we've still got Emory out there that we've talked about and then supporting a few of these compact deals as well. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amit Hazan of Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Amit Hazan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks good afternoon guys. And Elisha and Spence, thanks for all the help over the years and good luck in the next chapter.","Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Thank you.","Spencer R. Sias - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Thank you.","Amit Hazan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So let me just actually start with orders first and go to the U.S. environment. I mean, if I'm just kind of reading or understanding your comments correctly, it sounds like software was very strong, the implication being that hardware was maybe a little bit less strong. And so I'm just wondering in the U.S. market, did you see any changes in purchasing patterns with the uncertainty going on? Or has it been pretty much the same?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","I'd say it's been pretty much the same. We feel very good about the first half orders performance in the U.S. So that's been, looking at the half, it's been strong. And frankly looking back five or six quarters, it's been very steady. One of the things that we liked this quarter was the software volume was up. So, I mean equipment bounces around a little bit it's a little bit lumpier. The software volume was up double-digit and we were very pleased about that. I'd say, no real difference in the U.S. market.","Amit Hazan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then maybe let me jump to cash flow actually. So thinking about it in 2016, this came up a few times, free cash flow was down a lot, like 25% or so I think in 2016. Free cash flow conversion used to be really strong in the 80%s or so. Cash flow looked kind of weak again this quarter. Maybe give us some color on what's going on there, and what we should expect for the rest of the year.","Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Sure. So Amit, again, just given the spin, let me clarify that cash flow from operations is not on a continuing operations basis. So you typically don't try and go back and parse the cash flow from operations from one entity to the other. So for the first half, and I always like to look at this more, I mean you're going to get quarterly fluctuations. For the first half, cash flow from operations was $114 million.","We estimate, again this is not a number that will show up in a public filing, but we believe that about $94 million of that is attributable to Varian, with the rest being attributable to Varex. Remember, we've also had significant transaction expenses associated with the spin and on hiring people to get ready for the spin. So if you were to just add maybe, we still have some transaction expenses that have not been paid yet. But even if you add somewhere around $15 million, $17 million of that being in transaction, and the first half is usually about 40% of the full year, which gets you up around $275 million, $280 million for Varian standalone for the year. And what we've said is, our hope is that we were $400 million with Varex, and it would be probably closer to around $300 million. So I think we're somewhat in that. We're in that ballpark, as we speak.","Amit Hazan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Let me just sneak one more and then I'll jump back in. So back to the operating margin just as a follow-up to the earlier question. So, I think in your pro forma numbers that you guys filed, it looked like your operating margin is kind of as Varian as a standalone post \u2013 without the spin or after the spin is about 18% in fiscal 2016.","I think you're talking about 18% to 19% for this year. It sounds like this was a onetime type of item on the proton side this quarter, correct me if I'm wrong. But is the aspiration here for the rest of the year, is 18% or so is the right number for the rest of the year? Are you going to have lingering proton operating margin issues? How should we think about operating margin line for the rest of the year?","Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","You're absolutely right. I mean, once you pencil this out, you will see pro forma continuing operations for all of last year, we were 18.1%. If you look at the guidance, Q2 to Q4, we will be right around 18%.","What that means for the year \u2013 and again, I am excluding the impact of the proton AR write-off, so you guys can figure out how you want to reflect that. But for the full year, it puts us 17% to 18% operating margin, which is where we thought we were going to be this time last quarter. So we're not coming off that number.","Amit Hazan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC","Great. And congratulations again, Elisha and Dow (sic) [Spencer] (32:19). Thanks for all of the help through the years here. Just to stick on proton for a moment, just want to clarify what exactly is in guidance and what may be potentially still represents upside. And so if I'm hearing you correctly, Dow, the Delray order and the order in Thailand are now factored into guidance. And then there are several other orders, I guess two to four orders including Emory that represent upside to guidance. Is that sort of a fair statement?","Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","So Anthony, just to clarify. We \u2013 when we start the beginning of the year, we have our backlog of what if you will, of proton orders that we believe we're going to book throughout the year. And as soon as we book an order, we start taking revenue under the percentage of completion. So the timing of those orders can impact revenue. And clearly, that's why we came down a little bit on the revenue forecast for the balance of the year.","So the Delray deal, it was already in our forecast. So the only upside at this point is the Emory deal. We've been very transparent that it is because it is one of these very large five-room centers in the midst of getting their muni bond financing put together, we have not included that in our numbers because it has the potential to swing it very significantly.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC","And just to clarify on the swing, I think from my notes last quarter, it was a $0.10 to $0.12 swing the earlier in the year it was finalized. I mean what is the update on that now, just considering the time on the calendar that has passed?","Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yes, it's still in that ballpark. I mean it would have more significance on the orders and the revenue because we will start to, we'll start taking earnings on that. But that will obviously flow all the way throughout the installation and acceptance of the equipment. So that will be several years.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC","Great. And then just a follow-up on balance sheet utilization within proton and maybe across the business. Maybe just an update on, in aggregate, how many proton-related loans or loan products are held on the balance sheet? And in particular to the Scripps loan, is that completely written-off at this point? Thanks.","Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","No. So currently, we have $60 million in the balance on the Scripps loan. That was after we sold $45 million to JPMorgan a number of years ago. Maryland, our loan amount is $35 million; New York just shy of $20 million; and then we add Delray. So what is that, about $125 million all-in at this point.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Dow I'm wondering if you could, and congrats to Elisha and Spencer. Dow I'm wondering if comment on pricing dynamics. You talked about the12 competitive wins in the U.S. As you go to kind of swap out some of these competitor vaults are you able to hold on the pricing?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Our pricing dynamics continue to be okay, Elekta remains aggressive. I don't know that they are any more or less aggressive than they've been in the past and we've seen pretty good engagement. I will say that one of the things that was a little unique about the quarter is that the takeouts were broad-based across all our competitors. We had good takeouts against Accuray, good takeouts of old Siemens product as well as a few Elekta units. So it was pretty broad-based.","And that's something that we've seen in the past. I don't know that that's, it might be a little bit more on the quarter, but not materially more. I think when you look at the last half, TrueBeam pricing remains pretty solid and clearly upselling with Edge and getting some positive mix. The U.S. market continues to be pretty good. Other America's activity, it can be aggressive from time to time. But in the U.S., the pricing environment has been pretty stable.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I know you talked about the U.S holding up. I mean the data points from GE, Philips and some of the others has been a little more mixed. I mean is there any risk to you guys, because you guys are late cycle, there may be a little bit of a lag effect?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Certainly not anything that we're seeing at this point.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","If anything, I think that the strength of the portfolio and the rumored product introduction in a couple of weeks, we've if anything, maybe we'll even see it pick up a little bit.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And I guess on that point, you talked about seeing strength in emerging markets with some of the higher-end systems. I mean can you maybe just directionally give us a sense of where you see a gap in the portfolio from a linac perspective?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yes. I mean first of all, I got the week wrong, but come to New York. We'll talk extensively about it in two weeks. And if you like opera, come to Vienna.","We've \u2013 the European Society of Radiation Oncology meeting is in Vienna right before that. And we've \u2013 as we've kind of talked, what these emerging markets are looking for is really high-quality IMRT, they're looking for very fast high-quality imaging.","They don't want to make any trade-off in the quality of care. And then they want to do both in patients. And that's kind of the, when you think of it in market needs, maybe the other thing I'd add is simplicity. They want a high level of automation. They want to go fast. They don't want the training burden that certainly the industry was a long time ago. And as we think about, as we think about the market needs, I think we've got some really exciting news coming and look forward to seeing you in a couple of weeks.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. And then just last one maybe for Elisha on the revised profitability estimate on the U.K. project, that was all due to currency? Or were there any adjustments around utilization assumptions?","Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","It's largely currency Tycho, just the pound being at a historical low.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Henry of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. There's been a lot of concern from the investor base about the company's lengthening cash conversion cycle, particularly as it relates to inventories and receivables. So can you give any specifics there that can help us get more comfortable around what you guys are doing to improve these metrics?","Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yes. Well first of all, AR since the beginning of the fiscal year, is actually down 1% and while revenue is up 3%. So we are making considerable inroads into \u2013 we've had \u2013 we told you a year or so ago, we had a Salesforce.com implementation. We moved our collections staff.","Collections continue to be quite robust. And the DSO for Oncology is down 10 days quarter-over-quarter to 96. So what's driving as proton grows, that will drive the DSO up just because of this percentage of completion accounting where revenue and earnings are taken in advance of when the actual payments are due from the customer.","Inventory is only up very slightly from the beginning of the year just in line with revenue. So I think we're making good progress. Remember on this cash flow from operations, again significant transaction cost included in those numbers.","Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, and then a separate question. I think you guys have started to talk about a potential launch for a new linac later in fiscal year 2017. Are there any details you can give us regarding this product, what features or margin profile it may have and then what geographies you are going to target for this launch?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","I mean (42:27), as I just said, we'll see you in Vienna or New York. We've got a very exciting product. I think we're confident it will be margin accretive. And come hear about it with the rest of our customers in two weeks. So I think it will be a very exciting launch.","Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And one last one for me. Can you give us an update on what kind of trends you're seeing in the Chinese radiation oncology market? And then can you give us any updated timing on when a Class A quota might be announced?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Well, I think our China business has been very robust for a good strong period of time. We were up 10% this quarter. Our team is executing very well in that market. We've been double-digit-ish for many quarters in a row. We just had a users meeting in China. We had over 600 attendees. So very good reception.","Our market share is a leadership position now in China. So we're comfortable that the share is going in the right direction. And the whole market \u2013 I wouldn't get \u2013 yeah, there are category A, category B issues. But we got to watch the whole market here, and the whole market is moving.","And as I said in the script, we are well on our way to a $225 million business. We've got a great portfolio. And we think the news that you're going to see in a couple weeks, it's going to require \u2013 it'll probably require some regulatory approvals in China. But it's going to be very meaningful for that market as well.","Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then are you aware of a new Class A quota or is that still kind of TBD?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Not aware.","Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Hi, Vijay.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Hey, guys. How is it going?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Well.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Elisha, again, I wish you all the best for your next chapter, you too Spencer. And maybe, on, I guess, the guidance, so revenue is down by 100 bps and EPS up at the low end. Can you just, explain or walk me through on what changed between the revenue line and the EPS?","Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. So the revenue line is exclusively due to proton and just some timing of orders, primarily, because as you know under percentage of completion, at the time we book an order, we start to recognize revenue over the life of that project completion. So timing of orders is driving that. Oncology continues to be right where we were at the last quarter.","So EPS, again, it's just a little bit of difference in geography on the P&L. But the gross profit and decline versus what we were expecting in proton, almost an exact offset to the 1-point improvement for the year that we're expecting in the tax rate. And so that's why we were able to come off the mid-point, come up $0.02, come off the bottom of the EPS range.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Got you. And then the backlog, I guess, the way the accounting works is now, I'm assuming, you're pulling off some of the imaging components, maybe a couple of hundred million dollars. What's been the backlog growth for the last few quarters? Because, I guess I don't have the historical numbers here apart from the second quarter numbers, right, which just include the oncology piece and the proton piece. So can you give us a sense for what it's been over the last few quarters under the new reporting methodology?","Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Sure. So you are correct that Varex came out of the backlog. So, as of Q1, let's see, before we carved it out for disc op it was, the backlog was $3.389 billion. We are now at $3.136 billion. So you're right, a couple of hundred million dollars came out for the Varex Group. As of Q1, Oncology, $2.9 billion, we're still $2.9 billion which was up 6% quarter over quarter. We do have a decline in the proton backlog because we did book Delray, but we have yet to book that Thailand order and we've been taking revenue over the course of this year. So Oncology backlog is strong up 6% at $2.9 billion.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","I guess I was looking for some historical information. Is there, can you provide some historical information over the last \u2013 what it's been under the new reporting segments, either on the P&L and the backlog? I guess a part of the issue is, when I try to look back, what's happened over the last year, I guess the quarterly numbers it's hard for us to parse out under the new reporting methodology. So if you can have that information, I think that will be really helpful for us. Maybe one for you, Dow, big-picture question I think on the competitive side. Your competitor's making some noise about MR linac. And I know you have a certain view on this, but I'm just curious on what you're hearing about in the marketplace \u2013 and I am just curious about the timing of the new products that you guys are launching. Is this sort of in response to what competition is doing, or are these two things completely unrelated?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","I mean, the short version is, there is, number one, we believe that MR imaging is important. That's been growing in importance in radiation oncology. And we use that imaging for treatment planning and guidance literally every day today. We're not convinced that MR in room is more than a small niche. And that remains to be seen how big a niche that's going to be. And at least in terms of as we think about our focus, we're looking at a product that can have a global impact. I like to think of this in terms of, today we're at 13,000 units in our installed base. The world needs, at a minimum, another 10,000 machines and it needs to replace another 13,000 machines.","So how do we really grow the sockets that are doing radiation therapy? Many countries in the world have less than 10% of their cancer patients are getting radiation as part of their therapy. In the West, that number is around 50%. And there's just a huge opportunity there. So that's kind of how I view the global play. And then from a technology point of view, we do agree that adaptation is important. And that's one of the things that MR is bringing. But you can do adaption in lots of ways. It doesn't have to be with MR. So I think you will see us compete very aggressively for kind of the top technology space with ongoing coformality and adaptation kinds of plays, along with simplicity and automation. So I think we're, but when we look at the markets, I mean for us, it's how do we do 10,000 more machines?","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Got you. Thank you, guys.","Operator","We have a follow-up question from the line of Anthony Petrone. Please proceed with your follow-up.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC","Thanks Dow. Maybe just on the regulatory pathway for the system and timing there, and if this is included in guidance at all. Thanks.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","The short version is I'll talk to you in two weeks. I mean I think we've got a very exciting product. It's, from a guidance point of view, very minimal. It's, we are largely talking about ongoing impact and orders impact which, of course, we do not guide to. So but very excited about the product, and we can talk more about kind of the regulatory process when we see you in New York.","Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","But Anthony, it's more of an FY 2018 on the revenue side...","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","On the P&L side.","Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","On the P&L side. Yeah.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC","Yeah. That helps. Thanks.","Operator","We have another follow-up question from the line of Jeff Johnson of Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Elisha just quickly...","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Hey, Jeff.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, Dow, so just very quickly, is there a way can provide us with just accounts receivable number, maybe over the last couple of years in the first two quarters of this year, for just the Oncology business kind of ex-protons and obviously ex-Varex?","Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","I don't have it now, Jeff. You're saying on a go forward basis?","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. On a go forward basis or maybe you could post at some point on the website.","Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Sure.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Because I think a lot of the focus here recently on the working capital has been on the AR side. And the accounting for the proton stuff, I think obviously as you described, is one of the big impacts. But if we can see on the core business, the 90%, 95% of the business that is Oncology, those ARs are improving, that issue is solving itself, and maybe we'd feel incrementally better on that.","Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Absolutely. And I think the first thing to make you feel good is, again, Oncology DSO down 10 days quarter-over-quarter and roughly flat with Q1. So I think we've started to stabilize.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. It would be just be good if we could have those numbers and kind of play with them ourselves. But I appreciate it. Thank you.","Elisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. Okay.","Operator","There are no further questions over the audio portion of the conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Spencer Sias, VP, Investor Relations. Thank you, please begin.","Spencer R. Sias","Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Varian Medical Systems\u2019 conference call for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. With me are Dow Wilson, President and CEO; Elisha Finney, CFO; Varian Imaging Components President, Sunny Sanyal who will become CEO of Varex Imaging; Varian Controller, Clarence Verhoef, who will become CFO of Varex Imaging; and Magnus Momsen will replace Clarence as our new Corporate Controller and Senior Vice President of Finance. Dow and Elisha will summarize Varian results and Sunny will summarize Varian Imaging operations and we will take your questions following the presentation.","To simplify our discussion, unless otherwise stated, all references to the quarter or year are fiscal quarters and fiscal years. Quarterly comparisons are for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 versus the first quarter of fiscal 2016. References to financial results for orders are to gross orders, unless otherwise indicated.","The company is reporting non-GAAP results in order to provide quarter-over-quarter comparisons of operational performance excluding unusual items. Unless otherwise stated all financial results are discussed on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure is included in our earnings release, which can be accessed on our website.","Please be advised that this presentation and discussion contains forward-looking statements. Our use of words and phrases such as outlook, believe, expect, anticipate, could, should, will, promising and similar expressions are intended to identify those statements, which represents our current judgments on future performance or other future matters. While we believe them to be reasonable based on information currently available to us, these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.","Some of the important risks relating to our business are described in our first quarter earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements in this presentation and discussion, because of new information, future events or otherwise. And now, here is Dow.","Dow R. Wilson","Good afternoon everyone. Our company began 2017 with strong performance in oncology systems, continuing growth momentum in Imaging Components, and a $76 million GAAP charge related almost exclusively to the California Proton Treatment Center or CPTC in San Diego without which we would have handily beaten the high end of our earnings guidance range for the quarter. ","To summarize, our first quarter results we are reporting, strong oncology global order growth of 10% together with a four point improvement in its gross margin rate. Imaging Components gains in both orders and revenues, company-wide revenues of $763 million up 1% in both dollars and constant currency. GAAP net earnings of $0.22 per diluted share, after reporting $0.64 per diluted share in charges related almost exclusively to CPTC. Non-GAAP net earnings of $0.75 per diluted share, after recording $0.34 per diluted share in charges related almost exclusively to an accounts receivable reserve for CPTC and Board approval of the spinoff of Imaging Components into a new public company Varex Imaging in the next few days. ","Focusing first on Oncology Systems, orders totaled $586 million for the first quarter up 10% in both dollars and in constant currency. Broad-based demand for new equipment as well as software and services drove strong order growth across all geographies during the quarter. First quarter orders in the Americas grew by 5% in dollars and constant currency, orders in North America grew by 7% growth in both dollars and constant currency. The trailing 12 month order growth rate in North America is 6%.","First quarter oncology orders in APAC rose by 29% in dollars and 24% in constant currency while EMEA grew orders by 8% in dollars and 10% in constant currency. In India we booked $18 million for a multi-linac project with a customer that will total $35 million over the next 10 years. This is our first combined hardware and software as a service deal in the region and it demonstrates our ability to meet the growing need from customers for a cloud hosted software solutions.","Elsewhere in EMEA we continue to perform strongly in Poland. As you will recall we acquired our distributor there last year. During the quarter we won the majority of tenders and booked more than $20 million. The highlight in our APAC region was China, where we achieved 25% order growth during the quarter with sizable gains in both equipment and services. It appears that competitor protests to tender wins in this market are diminishing and are being resolved more rapidly. We grew orders in Japan where we're seeing positive signs of a market recovery. We supported an SBRT focused luncheon seminar at Jastrow [ph] the Japanese radiation oncology show, where TrueBeam and HyperArc created a real buzz. Several hundred people attended our sessions on SBRT and TrueBeam. Emerging markets in Asia were also active with good orders performance in South Korea, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines.","Turning to North America our order growth was driven mainly by healthy software and service gains as we expected potential changes to the Affordable Care Act did not appear to impact market performance in the quarter. Touching on our service business, global orders and revenues rose by about 7% in dollars in constant currency with gains in all territories.","On the software side we saw growing interest in our newly introduced 360 oncology software platform particularly from customers in Western Europe. You may recall this offering which was introduced at the ESTRO show in October is a first of a kind software tool that enables clinicians on Tumor Boards to more effectively coordinate patient care among the numerous specialties involved in cancer treatment. We have also continued to have a very positive market response to our RapidPlan and InSightive Analytics software products that help improve the speed, quality, and cost efficiency of treatments. We have now taken more than 700 orders to RapidPlan since its launch and 380 systems are installed at customer sites around the world. Sales of our InSightive product are also ramping up nicely.","During the quarter we received our 100th order for the VitalBeam treatment system. Half of these orders have come from customers in North America which demonstrates the appeal of this scalable solution even in developed markets. Comparing revenues on a trailing 12 month basis we believe we gained market share. Margins which Elisha will discuss in a few moments also benefited from ongoing efforts to reduce product cost.","I will now turn to our particle therapy business which recorded first quarter revenues of $30 million. As I mentioned at the outset of the call, Varian took a $76 million GAAP charge in the first quarter in response to certain actions in January by CPTC and its loan agent or its capital markets to address liquidity issues caused by lower than expected patient volumes that are insufficient to support CPTC\u2019s capital structure. This led us to reserve $38 million in accounts receivable and to impair $38 million of our $98 million loans to CPTC of which $29 million was accrued interest. These charges and the associated limited tax deductibility reduced our earnings in the first quarter by $0.64 per diluted share on a GAAP basis and by $0.34 per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis. ","We are reporting additional information on this matter today in the Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We believe this center can get on a more solid financial footing by serving a broader patient population with additional health care providers both locally and regionally. We remain confident and committed to supporting all of our customers and to building a profitable proton business based on leading technology that is treating many patients and performing at a high level. Of Varian's 15 proton projects we participated in the financing of only three. As of today our outstanding proton loan balance totals $131 million for CPTC and two other large regional centers in the U.S.","Stepping back from the financing issues, we are generating revenues and are continuing to make good progress on 13 installations. Our sales funnel continues to look promising. Now I'll turn it over to Sunny for his discussion of the Imaging Components business. ","Sunny Sanyal","Thanks Dow and good afternoon. Imaging Components Business had a very busy quarter as we prepared for the spinoff of Varex Imaging and announced the planned acquisition of the medical imaging business of PerkinElmer. First quarter revenues for Imaging Components were 152 million up 7% from the year ago period. Orders for our business were 132 million up 4% from a year ago period.","Going forward as a standalone company Varex will provide a different view than what you've seen in the past. Our public filings will provide a breakdown of revenues and gross margins by two segments, medical and industrial. Each of these segments will include X-ray sources, X-ray detectors, connect and control components, and software suited to their applications.","Revenues for Imaging Components rose during the quarter with solid gains in both medical and industrial segments. Medical revenues increased by 8% with strong growth in CT tubes and dynamic detectors while industrial revenues grew by 6%. We're pleased to see good performance from global sales of dental detectors as well as sales growth for CT tubes in Asia. We continued to see price erosion in the lower priced radiographic portion of our detector business where we were able to maintain revenues with higher volumes. Connect and control revenues in both medical and industrial segments contributed good growth but our medical segment software product revenues were down for the quarter due to softness in veterinary imaging. ","At the end of November we participated in the RSNA Trade Show in Chicago, the largest event for radiology. This show is always a great opportunity to see new imaging equipment products powered by our components being introduced at the show by our medical OEM customers. At this show we also introduced several new products and we enjoyed great customer response to our expanded offerings of collimators and next generation low dose, low cost, flat panel detectors.","In December we announced the signing of a purchase agreement to acquire the medical imaging business of PerkinElmer. We're very excited to add this highly complementary business to our detector portfolio. We're getting a great team that has built a strong brand and product offering in the industrial imaging market in addition to their portfolio of medical imaging products. They also bring us expertise in new detector technologies such as CMOS which will enable us to broaden our offerings with higher resolution solutions for certain applications. We expect to close this acquisition sometime in the summer after the regulatory approval process has been completed.","The spinoff of Varex Imaging is expected to be completed in a couple of days. The when issued trading started on January 20th and the regular way trading is expected to start on January 30th. The past few months have been filled with many meetings and road trip presentations with the investor and analyst community. I invite you to go to our website vareximaging.com, see more about our company and products.","It has been an exciting past year and as we prepare for the separation and I want to thank all the people at Varian and Varex who put in so much time and effort to make this a success. In particular thanks to Dow and Elisha for all their support through this process. Now I'll turn it over to Elisha. ","Elisha W. Finney","Thanks Sunny and hello everyone. We have already covered orders and operations so let me start with backlog. We ended the quarter at 3.4 billion up 2% from the year ago period including a 7% increase in the oncology backlog to 2.9 billion. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled 23 million bringing net orders for the company to 699 million. ","Now let me walk you through the P&L. First quarter revenues for the total company were 763 million, up 1% in dollars and in constant currency. Oncology revenues declined 1% in dollars and 2% in constant currency versus a strong year ago quarter. There was a geographic mix shift toward North American revenues which grew 7% in both dollars and constant currency to constitute 48% of oncology revenues in the quarter. ","Imaging Components posted a first quarter revenue increase of 7% with increases in both its medical and industrial segment. Our Particle Therapy business posted revenues of 30 million up 15% from the year ago quarter driven by progress on installation. The total company gross margin for the quarter was 44.1%, up three points due to strong performance in oncology.","Oncology Systems gross margins increased by four points to 46.8% due to favorable product and geographic mix as well as product cost reductions. Imaging Components gross margin for the quarter fell by almost two points to 39.1% as a consequence of a product mix shift toward radiographic detectors as well as stepped up investments and increased production capacities to meet expected long-term demand.","Including the Proton AR reserve first quarter SG&A expenses were 167 million up significantly in dollars and as a percentage of revenue from the year ago quarter. The accounts receivable reserve up 38 million is considered in the ordinary course of business for accounting purposes and therefore is not adjusted out of earnings as a non-GAAP number. Excluding the AR reserve SG&A would have been 129 million or 17% of revenue.","First quarter R&D expenses were 63 million or 8% of revenues equal to the year ago quarter as a percentage of revenue. First quarter operating earnings totaled 106 million or 14% of revenue down significantly from the year ago period due to the Proton AR reserve. Excluding this 38 million reserve, the operating margin would have increased two points from the year ago quarter to 19% of revenue.","Depreciation and amortization totaled 22 million for the quarter. The GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate was unusually high because of the proton impairment. The CPTC loan was made by our subsidiary in Switzerland where our tax rate is low so there was very little tax benefit from the loan impairment. Furthermore a large portion of the AR reserve was attributable to our subsidiary in Germany where our tax rate is effectively zero due to large tax loss carry forwards. Had it not been for the CPTC impairment our tax rate would have been about 27% for the quarter. For the balance of the year we believe Varian\u2019s tax rate from continuing operations will be in the range of 25% to 26%.","Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased 3.6 million from the year ago quarter to 94.2 million shares due to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted GAAP EPS was $0.22 for the quarter, non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.75 including a $0.34 impact from the Proton AR reserve.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of 815 million, debt 607 million, and stockholders equity of 1.7 billion. DSO of 100 days was up one day from the year ago period. First quarter cash flow from operations rose by 6% from the year ago quarter to $82 million.","Primary uses of cash were 17 million for CAPEX and 49 million for the repurchase of half a million shares of stock. As of today we have 8 million shares remaining under our existing repurchase authorization. Varian plans to repurchase 2 million shares in its second fiscal quarter of this year. And now let me turn it back over to Sunny and then Dow for the fiscal 2017 outlook for both Varex Imaging and Varian.","Sunny Sanyal","Thanks Elisha for Varex Imaging we expect revenues for fiscal 2017 to grow by 3% to 4%. Over the 620 million total recorded for fiscal 2016 in our Form 10 filing with SEC. Assuming approximately 38 million shares outstanding and a 35% tax rate we anticipate that GAAP net earnings per diluted share for the second through fourth quarters of the fiscal 2017 will be in the range of $1.20 to $1.30. Going forward Varex Imaging will provide annual guidance.","Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Dow for the Varian outlook.","Dow R. Wilson","Thank you. Beginning with our fiscal second quarter Imaging Components will be reflected as a discontinued operation for the first four months of fiscal year 2017. The company is guiding for continuing operations for the second through the fourth quarters of the fiscal year 2017. For the balance of the fiscal year we believe Varian revenues from continuing operations will grow in the range of 4% to 5% bringing revenue growth for the full year to 3% to 4%. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the second through fourth quarters of the fiscal year will be in the range of $2.94 to $3.06. For the second quarter we believe Varian revenues from continuing operations will grow in the range of 4% to 5% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share will be in the range of $0.84 to $0.90.","To summarize the first quarter, we have demonstrated strength in our oncology business with strong orders that will support future revenue growth. We have successfully set up Imaging Components for continued expansion with an important acquisition in life as a new public company Varex Imaging. And while it was painful, our exposure to particle therapy financing has now been significantly reduced. We are continuing our drive for profitability with over a dozen projects and a healthy sales funnel. Varian is poised now to focus exclusively on providing the world with the technology it needs to beat cancer and our product pipeline has never looked better. We're very much looking forward to the rest of fiscal year 2017. We're now ready for your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone with Jeffries. Please proceed.","Dow R. Wilson","Hi Anthony.","Anthony Petrone","Hi Dow, how are you? Thanks and good afternoon everyone. Hi, Sunny, hi Elisha. Congratulations on approaching spin 2 to everyone. Good luck, separate companies going forward. I think, Dow I'm just getting some e-mails on sort of the implied full year guidance overall and maybe even more so the implied non-GAAP operating margin guidance for the remaining company. As I'm working it here I think if we give back the $0.34 take into considerations the $0.75 in the quarter and adjust for share count differences, I am coming up with about 450 to 470 in implied full company consolidated earnings. So A) just wanted to check if that math is correct and then B) what would be the implied non-GAAP operating margin outlook for Remain Co? And then a couple of follow ups for Sunny. ","Elisha W. Finney","Yeah, so Anthony let me let me take a stab at it and please bear with this guys as we as we said because of the spin it is just -- it's going to be a little messy and so we're going to try and clear this up to the best we can. In Q1 it really is apples and oranges because we've got both Varian and Varex. We've got some duplicate costs and then of course we've got the complicating factor with the AR reserve that we could not adjust out for non-GAAP purposes. So we decided let's each guide Q2 through Q4 as standalone companies as continuing operations. What I can say though Anthony and this is a very, very rough, back of the envelope rule of thumb, is when I have looked at what continuing operations is for fiscal year 2014, 2015, and 2016 and some of the quarters and these are unaudited so they have not been published anywhere yet, they will be. The continuing operations is anywhere from 75% to 80% of our reported numbers. So if you were to consider, I don't know which number you want to use but assuming you start with the $1.09 that excludes the AR you can take 78% of that, it gets you to $0.85 and you could then add that to Varian's guidance which at $3 on the midpoint would put you at 385 for the fiscal year. Was that as clear as mud.","Anthony Petrone","That does help and I think we can run an implied operating margin guidance but I guess some confusion around that would be... ","Elisha W. Finney","Of course, sorry I forgot that part of your question. For these -- for Q2 through Q4 it should be in the range of 18% to 19% and then as I mentioned for Q1 without the AR reserve we would have been at 19% but of course that includes some Varex Imaging numbers in there. ","Anthony Petrone","Okay, and then the follow-up for Sunny would be the 7% growth number in the first quarter was ahead of what we were expecting and so I guess the question there is are there new contracts that were won in there or was there normalization of Toshiba? And then the follow up question would be on the Varex implied guidance. What does the operating margin profile look like through the remainder of the year? Thank you.","Sunny Sanyal","Yeah Anthony, first of all we have had really good growth for the last three to four quarters and it's a very good sign and we have confidence in the recovery path that we're on. For this quarter we had some easy comps so the first half as you recall, our first half of 2016 was soft so for the second half we've got some tough comps and so the 3% to 4% is what we were anticipating for fiscal year 2017.","Clarence Verhoef","You know second question on operating margins I'm sorry so I will take that. Anthony, this is Clarence. The operating margins for the balance of the year, the Q2 through Q4 will be in the range of 16% to 17%. There is a little bit of incremental SG&A cost associated with being a standalone company and then I guess as Elisha kind of alluded to there is just a ton of complication in trying to understand exactly what the Q1 number is. So therefore we're just really trying to give a cleaner answer is to just talk about the Q2s and Q4. Along those lines a little bit maybe one additional bit of information where you'll get more visibility to this as we will file a 10-Q for Q1 at the end of February and it's going to have a lot more breakdown of that and we'll be able to give you a little more color on the one time separation costs that are included in there.","Anthony Petrone","Thanks. I\u2019ll hop back in queue. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Henry with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. ","Brandon Henry","Yes, thanks for taking my question. The first on the Oncology Systems gross margin, looks like they continue to make good progress in the quarter. I think you mentioned last quarter that the gross margins for Oncology Systems would kind of be in the 44% to 45% range. I think you were above that range this quarter. So does that guidance now appear conservative and then maybe you can just talk about your expectations for gross margins for the remainder of the year for Oncology Systems?","Dow R. Wilson","You know on the quarter we had good product mix, good geographic mix, and then something we've been talking about last four to five quarters, we've had very good cost performance and variable cost performance on the product cost and installation warranty. Elisha can walk us through some of the guidance impact but those are the big drivers on the quarter.","Elisha W. Finney","Yeah, so at this point Brandon I am preferring to stick to the 44 to 45. I feel quite confident in those numbers given the performance that oncology has had the last several quarters. They really started to improve gross margin in the second half of last year so the comps get a little more difficult. But clearly I mean the business has done an outstanding job of maintaining stable pricing, product cost reduction, higher software, that would be the upside. If the stock were mixed we are to increase then clearly that could be some upward bias on the margin. But we're sticking to 44 to 45.","Brandon Henry","Okay and then separately I think you mentioned that you were seeing some positive signs of a market recovery in Japan and I think that's kind of the first time I've heard that in a while. So can you give us some more details on that commentary and is the government again kind of picking up spending like what we saw in the past or is that something else?","Dow R. Wilson","Well we unfortunately have not seen any new incremental government stimulus spending. That's what really drove this market three to four years ago. So, we haven't seen that but we have seen kind of a stabilization of the market with a little bit of growth. So, and that's two quarters in a row now. So we connected the dots. I mean I think it's still early but our funnel looks pretty good and that market has come down pretty substantially from where it was two to three years ago. But we're starting to see some turnaround. Our shares have been good there too.","Brandon Henry","Okay and then just last question on China, I think you said there was 25% order growth in the quarter for China. How much of that was attributable to a resolution of the previous protests and then can you just talk about your expectations for China for the remainder of the year? Thanks.","Dow R. Wilson","You know the protests piece was anniversary and so in fact what you're really looking at is growth. So we feel good about that. The market is strong and funnel remains good, the team is executing very well. I'd say that we continue to do very well especially at the high end of that market and get orders -- good orders there so, good execution in a good market.","Brandon Henry","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.","Dow R. Wilson","Hi, Jeff.","Jeff Johnson","Hi guys, how are you? Good, alright, so let me ask two hopefully quick questions and then I think I'm more confused after we went through the questions with Anthony but I want go through few numbers here if I could but first Dow just on the Proton business, you write down some of the scripts business, you gave a number that you still have $131 million exposure out there, what is the risk to that exposure number one? And number two, what your appetite may be for financing additional field down issue here? ","Dow R. Wilson","Great questions. So the total exposure as I said is $130 million. We've got $60 million remaining to CPTC in San Diego. We've got $50 million outstanding sub debt to Maryland and we've got $20 million of sub debt to New York. So those are the three that we have outstanding. I'd say feel very good about New York and Maryland and where they are. Large centers, Maryland is coming up to speed very, very quickly, fastest ramp. We believe in Proton Therapy, they're now doing 60 to 70 patients. They've got one more BeamLine coming on next month which should reduce the patient volume again a little bit more. ","In terms of appetite for more of these, these are all very large centers. I'd say that we don't have much appetite for large centers but we still look to use the balance sheet where there is a lower breakeven point, a smaller center, where we're a partner with reputable financing partners, where we're not the largest lender and where we're working with clinical partners who are leaders in their markets. So, for example in the case of both New York and Baltimore we are working with local leaders in their markets and that makes a big difference. ","And then of course we want I think the deal structure on this one was a little bit unique. We did it in 2011. So our first probing, show site, and in any case I think we want to make sure that we've got a local partner with some skin in the game. Elisha you have anything to add there. ","Elisha W. Finney","No, I would just say we are encouraged that big banks are continuing to finance Proton Centers. Varian has sold off as indicated a 120 million of loans that we had initially put on these centers. We sold off New York and a portion of San Diego. And the Muni [ph] financing program in Georgia from what we hear is continuing to proceed well. So I do think this is somewhat of a unique situation as Dow mentioned. ","Jeff Johnson","Okay, and then Elisha maybe not a technical accounting explanation because I really don't want to hear that but out of the $73 million write off you guys excluded $38 million. But there's another $38 million that we essentially have to take out of your SG&A and to non-GAAP earnings and things like that to get it apples-to-apples? ","Elisha W. Finney","That is correct Jeff and it's because and I won't give you any technical accounting but it's because from a SEC guidance standpoint accounts receivable is deemed in the ordinary course of business. It's not deemed unusual and something you can adjust into a non-GAAP number. ","Jeff Johnson","Okay and so the question where I want to step through a couple things is just if I look at your disclosures you get 70.3 million in non-GAAP net earnings. I need to add back about 35 million to that so your non-GAAP net earnings X all of the noise of the write off would have been closer to 102 million to 105 million or so, is that correct?","Elisha W. Finney","I've got it on EPS Jeff because the tax rate change between the GAAP and the non-GAAP as well because again a lot of the AR was attributable to Germany at a 0% rate. The loan is at Swiss rate so the non-GAAP tax rate is 34.5 I think it was, where as GAAP is 48. Suffice it to say let me do it -- let me give it to you this way, let's just assume you start with$0.75 -- let's assume you start with $1.09. You add the two numbers together, $0.34 is the AR reserve $0.30 is the loan impairment, and then you've got $0.23 of other stuff like the spend and litigation and amortization of intangibles and those sorts of things and that's how you get to the $0.22 GAAP. ","Jeff Johnson","Alright that's fine. X all that noise and we could use your $1.09 number for the quarter that equates to a little over $100 million in net earnings X that. So if we start there is a base I don't want to dominate the time here but if we start there is a base. You're guiding over the next three quarters. I think between the two businesses, the net earnings and if we take the EPS out of it just because again the share count changes with Varex and that you're guiding to about 330 million in net earnings between the two companies, if I add that to the 105 million or so you're essentially guiding combined companies all noise out of it at somewhere around 435 million I think. Is that about reasonable because the street was at 442, I think you guys are guiding somewhere around 435 and there are some big numbers floating around here in emails and all that that you guys are cutting $0.20, $0.30, $0.40 out of what where Street has been thinking and I'm just not getting it that big?","Elisha W. Finney","Well, let me take a stab at this. Jeff I will answer for Varian and I'll let Clarence answer for Varex. Q2 through Q4 when you run through our guidance you are going to see we are somewhere between call it 280 million and 290 million of net income for Varian. Then you need to take about 78% of Q1 net income assuming that\u2019s what continuing operations will be for Varian and add it to that number and then on top of that you would need to add the Varex net income for Q2 through Q4.","Clarence Verhoef","And that number just using the $1.20 to $1.30 range and I remember shares outstanding is somewhere in the range of 45 million to 50 million of net income after tax. One of the challenges there by the way also Jeff is that the Varex tax rate is significantly different than the Varian tax rate. Our tax rates in the range of 35%.","Jeff Johnson","Yes, understood. And then just on top of that Clarence just add the 22% or whatever it would be from the Q1 105 million or so?","Clarence Verhoef","That\u2019s a fair approximation at this point in time from us. Let's call it a non-GAAP perspective because that would exclude pro forma and look back time separation costs and the like.","Jeff Johnson","Alright, oh, I think my numbers are right but I'll follow up with you guys after offline just to make sure but I appreciate the time. Thanks guys. ","Dow R. Wilson","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Please proceed.","Tycho Peterson","Hey thanks, question on the viability of the particle therapy market. You know I know Jeff asked your earlier about your willingness to finance but Indiana did shut down, San Diego is having a liquidity issues, can you maybe just talk about you know the health of some of the other projects underway and why you think there's still a viable market here?","Dow R. Wilson","Yeah, I mean I think when we look into the funnel we still have a good funnel. Indiana was a very specific case with some extremely old technology that's been a little blown out of proportion. But that center was 20 to 30 years installed and installed as frankly as kind of a research center with a little bit of clinical lad on. So I think its failure has been a little overstated in the marketplace. There were some procure issues in the market a couple years ago. Now San Diego I think the transition from these really, really large centers to small center, something we've been talking about on our call is very much going on in the marketplace. I mean this center would be very viable as a two or three room center financially and so it's got a tough capital structure. It maybe a little bit over built for the market in the market position. We do think that as it regionalizes and has opportunity to bring some more customers in especially in the San Diego area, that it can be viable. So I think there are some very specific things about San Diego that made it that way. We're still, of our 15 customers, 12 are cash paying. So we've got the three that I talked about and we feel very good about where two of those are. And clearly nobody is proud about this but we feel pretty good about where things are headed.","Tycho Peterson","And then maybe can you just touch on what you're hearing from your customers in the U.S. on the CAPEX front. I mean your orders held up okay in North America and as you highlighted a lot of that was software and service but I'm just thinking about the remainder of the year did you see a freeze on CAPEX budgets?","Dow R. Wilson","You know everybody is watching what happens in Washington but I'd say at this point in time we're not seeing a change in our funnel shape or size. And as I said in the call our -- in the script our rolling 12 month performance in North America is 6%. I would say that's pretty good for 12 months and from a funnel point of view we're not seeing that change. Clearly who knows what's going to happen in Washington and everybody is watching. But it's not changing behavior in the short-term.","Tycho Peterson","Okay and then just two modeling ones. For dyssynergies can you tell us what the -- guidance, I know you talked about 20 million over two years, should we just assume 10 million this year?","Elisha W. Finney","We will exit this year with 10 million of dyssynergies out. It has a roughly a 50 basis point impact on the EBIT margin this year that we also our tax rate is going to go down because as Clarence mentioned Varex is at a higher tax rate. So we are helped at the after tax line.","Tycho Peterson","Okay and then for Sunny, the Varex guidance doesn't include anything for synergies right, assuming obviously that deal hasn\u2019t closed yet?","Sunny Sanyal","No, it is standalone Varex. ","Tycho Peterson","Okay, perfect. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kamar with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.","Vijay Kumar","Hey Dow, how is it going? Thanks for taking my question. I just maybe go back to the guidance question right. If you just go back simplistically maybe Elisha there's a question for you, on the last call so we thought that the combined rate was with the pre-oncology piece EPS would do high singles. So if we did $4.68 of EPS last year that implies somewhere around $5, call it 5 around that ballpark and I think the new guidance is $4.60 at the midpoint. I guess part of the delta, that $0.40 delta is the dyssynergies right which is maybe $0.20 but it still feels like there's a $0.20 delta between how we were thinking about numbers three months ago versus now, I just want to make sure was there anything else from an accounting perspective that I'm missing the way I'm thinking about numbers? Thank you.","Elisha W. Finney","I'm not sure Vijay, let me let me walk through it one more time in terms of our if you take the midpoint of our Q2 through Q4 so let's call it $3 and then you add the 85% for Q1, now there's about four months there where we have some duplicate costs that we're absorbing. It is probably I don't know 4 pennies or so that we're absorbing while Varex has been out hiring duplicate positions. That would compare to the $4.68 from last year and don't hold me to this, it is unaudited but the continuing operations number for Varian is $3.68 and for Varex is about $1. So that -- call it $3.90 compares to the $3.68 if you just look at it that way.","Vijay Kumar","I guess we will take this off line because I'm not sure, I get the math completely to be honest Elisha. I guess maybe one on -- in a doubt on the Proton business, a lot of questions here on -- for the other parts of the businesses right, other contracts you have you mentioned 15 projects right?","Dow R. Wilson","Yes. ","Vijay Kumar","I guess the reason for the financing issue was volumes, can you just talk about why for the other projects volumes wouldn't be an issue, is this a reimbursement issue or I'm just trying to understand was this more regional issue for them in California?","Dow R. Wilson","I'd say this is very much an issue in San Diego. So, first of all about 15 orders I have top -- count off top of my head but at least 10 of them are outside of the U.S. So there tends to be, it's not true in every case but it tends to be sovereign government purchases. So those are in pretty good shape. You know one or two of them are not, one or two of them are private but the vast majority of them are sovereign government purchases, backstop that way. So should be very good from a credit point of view. In the U.S., I mean New York the lead customer there is the top cancer center in New York City. They're already sending very significant numbers of patients to other centers. So as they build their own center they'll pull that volume back to this center. So we feel very good about the viability of New York. Baltimore is ramping very nicely. Little bit of a slow start but they've gotten to 60 to 70 patients and now they open in February last year. So just in a year they've ramped up very nicely. Good reimbursement environment there and I think this is really kind of about some of the very specific contractual things and market conditions that were in San Diego.","Vijay Kumar","Got you, and maybe up one for Sunny, a lot of questions Sunny on the outlook for Varex. I guess maybe simplistically if I look back margins for your business was in the mid 20's. We're now looking at high teens. Is there, if I just had to look at it from a medium term perspective is there any reason why peak margin shouldn't go back up to 25% or are there any reasons why the new I guess normalized margins would be below sort of a historical peak?","Sunny Sanyal","So we've communicated previously that we see as we have we expect margins to climb back up to 20% from where we are today in the 17%ish range and that's how far as we see at this point. We don't see a way to get back to the 25%ish range. Those were at a point in time when low end of the radiographic flat panels range, the pricing impact was less. But also overtime we've added more R&D and big R&D investment so with that as our base costs we see us getting to 20%ish.","Vijay Kumar","And maybe just one last and I know I'm taking time here, on I guess if you look at the guidance for Varex and Q1 obviously is off to a strong start, any reason why you have had numbers improving over the last couple of quarters, why rest of the year should be 4% for the business?","Sunny Sanyal","So as I said earlier, significant part of the reason is the comps. First half of 2016 versus first half of 2017. We had a tough first half in 2016 so came off a relatively easier comps. We had a very strong second half in 2016 so we got pretty strong comps going into the second half. So that's why we're expecting at this point to net out at 3% to 4% for fiscal year 2017.","Vijay Kumar","Got you, that was helpful guys. Thank you.","Elisha W. Finney","And Vijay just before you go I just want to remind you guys unfortunately this guidance is complicated because the continuing operations accounting is not yet done. When it is we will be posting this historical numbers on our website and will come out -- we're going to post FY -- the ANNUAL FY 2014, 2015, and 2016 next week or soon thereafter, and then we're going to give you quarterly continuing operations at the pretax level next week as well. So you'll have a lot more information on looking at Varian and Varex as independent companies.","Vijay Kumar","That would be helpful Elisha because a lot of questions I'm getting as. Looks like -- the guidance was cut I'm not sure I'm sure you know there's a lot of accounting math here and we'll take it offline but those disclosure think would be helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Hazan with Citi. Please proceed.","Q - Amit Hazan","Hey Good afternoon guys. Let me surprise you and stick with the guidance topic maybe I\u2019ll approach it in a little bit of a different way that I'm less interested in the mechanism around that than I am around how to model remaining Varian in a little bit longer term. So if you think about it kind of as fiscal year 2018 or down to 2017 maybe better fiscal 2018 give us a sense of what the operating margin aspiration is going to be for you but is it kind of 18% to 19% in fiscal 2017, what is it going to be in fiscal 2018, and maybe that'll help us to try to understand what kind of earnings growth the model off of what many of us I think are going to come off and I think many of us are going to be around $4.10 for fiscal 2017, so how do we grow above that?","Elisha W. Finney","Yes, So I mean we did the long-term kind of expectations at the top line will be in the mid single digits. We're not coming off of that. So that remains to be true. From a pretax margin, it's a little harder post then to get to that 22. I'm going to make a lot of this up in the tax rate. So if we can go from 18 to 19 up to 21 in the next two to three years that is what we're going to be aiming for. So it's 18 to 19 as our expectation for this -- for the balance of this fiscal year and then I would hope to get at least 25 to 50 basis points as we go forward into the fiscal year 2018 as well.","Q - Amit Hazan","Okay, so let me turn to sales, I don't think this has been covered yet. On the sales volume, especially while you guys actually reiterated your 3% to 4% guidance net reported number despite the fact that currency has gone against you. So, the FX effect on guidance really is what the FX number that you are guiding to is actually you're putting forward a kind of an increase of your FX guidance essentially. So, I want to make sure that that's confirmed with you and then secondly, in the Proton piece and you talked about that being up in fiscal 2017, do you still feel comfortable that that's going to be up this year?","Elisha W. Finney","So in terms of FX if I look at where both the Euro and the yen are today versus the year ago period it is roughly neutral. There's a little bit of a help with the yen and a little bit of hurt with the Euro and those tend to net out. So the FX impact on Q1 was very little. I'm expecting if rate stay stable where they are today and the balance of the year then FX was going to be pretty neutral to the balance of the year. Protons we are expecting growth. I am being very cautious just obviously in light of what the impairment that we've announced. We will be recording service revenue on the CPTC proton center on a cash basis because once I impair a receivable and a loan then it doesn't make any sense that I can then start to accrue revenue for that. So I'm a little less -- a little less optimistic on protons today just because of the situation we are in. But I would say that's offset by a little more optimism in our oncology business which is just doing very well.","Q - Amit Hazan","Let me just follow up on that just as the last question so, the currency has moved a lot since you gave guidance about three months ago. So the dollar is strengthened a lot against the Euro and against the yen and so maybe I don't if I understand why it would be the same now than it was three months ago for you. And given the proton piece if you're a little bit more cautious on that you're still kind of -- you still feel good though that we should be within that range of 3% to 4% that you gave three months ago?","Dow R. Wilson","I mean, it is not even clear how we've built the guidance on the revenue side is when you look at our last two or three quarters in oncology they've all been very good. So we have certainly had the orders. I mean just in this quarter alone the oncology backlog was up 6% or 7%. So we've got a very good backlog there and the margin position in the backlog as we've talked about looks very good.","Q - Amit Hazan","But you know -- yeah, go ahead. ","Elisha W. Finney","Sorry, the Euro has barely moved from when we gave guidance last. I mean in Q1 our average rate was 108, as of today it is 107. I would -- that's is the level. A little bit of help on the yen, a little bit -- so but they tend to be roughly an offset. The impact was very small in Q1 and we expect that for the balance of the year. ","Q - Amit Hazan","Okay, just one final clean up question on the share purchase, you said you would buy 2 million shares, is that incremental to what you usually buy or is that just -- you are just going to because that is pretty close to what you guys usually do in the quarter, how should we model that. ","Elisha W. Finney","Well now that's a little higher than what we have typically been doing when we were one Varian it was 1 million to 2 million shares per quarter typically. Obviously with Varian standalone there's going to be cash flow from operations will be lower by about 20%. We are just front loading so, we did 500,000 in Q1 and the plan is under 10b51 that we will do 2 million in Q2.","Q - Amit Hazan","Okay, thanks very much guys. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Anthony Petrone","Great for fitting me into the follow-up, just a couple of follow-ups for Sunny and then maybe one for Elisha. I'm just trying to get to a full year earnings number and so we have 120 to 130 for the remaining four quarters and I know Clarence you mentioned you have to sort of tax it under a different tax scheme using 35%. So my implied range for Varex for the year is 166 to 186. I'm not sure if that makes sense, if I'm in the ballpark so any feedback there would be helpful and then just on the consolidated guidance I'm just wondering, what is in there for stock based compensation, I guess more so for Remain Co? Thanks again.","Sunny Sanyal","Well let me let me start out by first of all saying that it\u2019s for Q2 to Q4 it's 120 to 130. And I have because of the carve out costs or the spin off costs in Q1, it's going to be lower than the average of those three quarters, okay. So I would just say that Q1 is going to be at a lower rate. I'm not ready to talk through the specifics of it yet because we haven't finished determining what those are, that's part of this discontinued ops discussion that we also were talking about previously. So give us a little bit of patience here to get to that number and so I can't -- I probably can't give you exactly the answer you're looking for, for the full year.","Anthony Petrone","That\u2019s helpful.","Sunny Sanyal","Then the question about the stock based comp I guess it's fundamentally at the same level of those as historical and so I guess the question is a little bit about are you asking what the mix is between Varex and Varian, is that the question.","Anthony Petrone","Maybe just some more simply, what is the level of stock based compensation reflected in the guidance for both Remain Co and Varex?","Elisha W. Finney","I don't want to get down to that level of detail. I would tell you in Q1 for total company it was 11 million was what was included. We\u2019re just not going to post the guidance in that detail.","Anthony Petrone","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of [Indiscernible] with CRM. Please proceed.","Unidentified Analyst ","Hey guys, on the Varex side for some sort of housekeeping, can you give us a sense or an update of what cash or debt the balance sheet will look like at separation for Varex?","Clarence Verhoef","Yeah, so a level of cash is going to be around $25 million to $30 million with a good portion of that being offshore and then the level of debt will be around 200, a little bit north of 200 million.","Unidentified Analyst ","Okay great, and then you gave us a slide deck for Varex when you were doing the road show that had 147 million of revenue in the first quarter of 2016. And so if you do the comparison year-over-year it's not 7% it's more like 3% or 4%, is there just some sort of difference there? ","Clarence Verhoef","Yeah, it's a little bit of an apples and oranges. That 147 includes the intercompany sales to oncology. So you would actually take the Varian Imaging Components number of 152 and add 5 million to it if you are going to look at Varex as a standalone entity, and then you're back to 7% again.","Unidentified Analyst ","I see and then just to clarify what you're saying Clarence about EPS, the GAAP guidance you're giving us includes stock comp and DNA so it is just a pure GAAP number?","Clarence Verhoef","That's exactly right.","Unidentified Analyst ","Okay and then on the close of the PKI deal I seem to recall you guys originally saying sort of April, May, maybe now you're saying summer, has there been a change there?","Clarence Verhoef","No, April is the earliest that it can be done. We've put built out into the actual purchase agreement that April is the earliest. But it's just that the assumption is that the Hart Scott Rodino review process could take longer if it goes through a second review cycle and the like. And so, it's totally a speculation at this point time. I, from a planning perspective we're planning it out as if it\u2019s the first of April but the timing could be delayed just because of that process.","Unidentified Analyst ","Okay, and then in terms of orders at Varex, can you sort of talk about your largest customer order patterns there up year-over-year or they just sort of in line stable? And any comments on China versus Japan, I guess Sunny alluded to that in his comments?","Sunny Sanyal","Yes, so I\u2019ll take it as two separate questions. In general we see strength in our CT tubes business in China and that continues to be a good solid trend for us we've made a lot of investments in that area and it's a core part of our growth strategy. Orders performance has been consistent with how this business has performed so there's nothing unusual there. Their performance with our largest customer Toshiba continues to be -- it's come back towards normal and the relationship and everything we do with them is solid foundations are very strong there.","Unidentified Analyst ","As you alluded to Sunny a little bit of volumes versus price with the volumes being strong and price somewhat we see you still seeing the impact of the renegotiations due to FX in late 2015 maybe a little more color around some of the pricing?","Sunny Sanyal","So, first of all the price pressures are predominantly in the low end of the detector space which is a radiographic detectors which is also our smaller part of our detectors business. In there the price -- those price adjustments that happen that were at one point triggered by the FX situation but in general pricing in that segment even after, it was a onetime correction but we saw a pretty significant prior significant price adjustment. But now the price erosion is down to what I would call as historical levels there in the mid single-digits range and that's what we saw in this quarter but we had good volume which offset that.","Unidentified Analyst ","Great, thanks for the color and good luck.","Sunny Sanyal","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have no further questions in queue at this time I'd like to hand the floor back over to management for closing remarks.","Dow R. Wilson","Thank you and thank you all for participating.

Michael Bruff - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to Varian's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Conference Call and Webcast. Joining me today on the call are Varian's President and Chief Executive Officer, Dow Wilson; and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Bischoping. Dow will share his thoughts on our results and our long-term strategy, and Gary will cover our operating and financial results in more detail.","On the Varian Investor Relations website, you can find our fiscal third quarter press release and web deck, which are intended to provide additional perspective and details. Included in these documents is the reconciliation of the differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. We report non-GAAP earnings to provide comparisons of operational performance, excluding unusual items.","Unless otherwise stated, all financial results discussed are non-GAAP and from continuing operations, all growth rates are year-over-year and any references to orders are gross orders. All references to trailing 12 months refer to the trailing 12 months ending on the last day of our most recently completed fiscal quarter.","During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in today's earnings release, this conference call, and our SEC filings. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Dow.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Mike, and good day, everyone. Today, I'll share the key milestones we achieved this past quarter and how they contributed to our long-term strategy. First, let me touch on our results.","Total company revenues of $709 million increased 12%. Oncology revenues grew 18%, driven by our integrated platform with best-in-class hardware, software, and services. Revenues for our Particle Therapy business were $42 million.","Operating earnings of $119 million or 16.9% of revenues grew 26%. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.79 grew 4% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.04 grew 28%. GAAP earnings per share was impacted by acquisition-related expenses and an impairment charge related to the expected refinancing of the Maryland Proton Treatment Center. Gary will discuss these in more detail.","Cash flows from operations were $102 million, down 34%, due to a large cash receipt from the Georgia Proton Treatment Center in the prior-year period. Year-to-date cash flows from operations were $347 million, up 29%.","In terms of our long-term growth and value creation strategy, we made progress across our three growth initiatives. First, strengthening our leadership in radiation therapy. Based on public filings, the radiation therapy market grew 7% on an orders basis over the trailing 12 months ending in March 2018. Varian maintained its market leadership and worldwide share during that period.","In our Oncology business, orders grew 11% in the quarter and 8% year-to-date, our worldwide net installed base is now 8,046 units growing 4% or 280 units. On the hardware side, we made progress with our global rollout of Halcyon, and have now taken 98 orders since our May 2017 launch including 17 new orders in the third quarter. Since launch, nearly 60% of orders worldwide have been incremental.","We've also seen strong interest in the kilovoltage cone-beam CT option that we launched as part of Halcyon 2.0 at ASTRO in April. All of our \u2013 half of our orders in the quarter were for these new systems and approximately one-third of our previous orders are scheduled to be upgraded.","On the software front, we continue to see strong demand and positive feedback for our software solutions. Software revenues grew 13% and the number of unique Varian software customers grew 6%. Customers continue to adopt Varian's new software solutions. For RapidPlan, the installed base grew over 80% and we took more orders for licenses this quarter than in any prior quarter since we launched the product several years ago.","And for Eclipse, we have now taken orders for nearly 320 licenses for Eclipse MCO, our multi-criteria optimization treatment planning tool. This feature enables clinicians to quickly compare treatment plans and choose the optimal one, enhancing both efficiency and plan quality. Our services revenues grew 10% driven by our growing installed base and higher mix of newer machines which typically have a higher attach rate and contract value.","In our Particle Therapy business, we did not take any new orders in the quarter. However, we've taken four proton orders over the trailing 12 months and our sales pipeline remained solid. We continue to make progress toward completing sites that are under construction announced last month, the installation of a Varian ProBeam cyclotron at University College Hospitals in London.","The center will feature four treatment rooms and is scheduled to begin treating patients in 2020. We continue to see strength in our proton services business as our installations at operating centers continue to perform well. For example, the Georgia Proton Treatment Center Project is currently ahead of schedule.","Our second growth initiative is to extend our global footprint. Our global market share growth was driven by continued orders-based share gains in EMEA. For example, in Spain, the Ortega Foundation in Catalonia ordered nine TrueBeam and three Halcyon systems. In Great Britain, the National Health Service in Leeds ordered 20 TrueBeam systems. And in Poland, we continue to maintain market share leadership across public and private segments.","In Africa, we received an order for three linacs, including a Halcyon system, from Nairobi West in Kenya and an order for two linacs, including a Halcyon system, from Lagos University Teaching Hospital in Nigeria. We're proud of our EMEA team's strong execution, achieving four straight quarters of double-digit orders growth and the strongest sequential four quarters in the company's history.","We also made progress towards extending our global footprint in our Latin America and Asia-Pacific regions. In Latin America, we signed a training and cooperation agreement with the Brazil Ministry of Health and Science and Technology Institutions. This agreement is part of Varian's commitment to partner with the Brazil Ministry of Health to increase access to and quality of radiotherapy treatment in Brazil and Latin America.","In Asia, we acquired Cooperative CL Enterprises or COOP, a leading radiotherapy equipment distributor in Taiwan. We believe that by leveraging Varian's global network and COOP's strong local team, we can provide state-of-the-art cancer care for patients in Taiwan.","Finally, we announced that the first cancer patients in Korea were treated with Varian's HyperArc, high-definition radiotherapy, which is designed to automate and simplify sophisticated treatments like stereotactic radiosurgery. Two patients with brain cancer were treated using the company's HyperArc at the Ajou University Hospital and we're pleased to partner with leading institutions like Ajou to deliver advanced cancer treatments to more patients.","On the Halcyon front, global momentum continues to grow. Of the Halcyon orders taken since launch, approximately 45% have been from emerging markets and nearly 90% of these have been for incremental units, thus we see Halcyon expanding the market and our market share in this segment.","One of our key ambitions for Halcyon was to expand access to high-quality radiation therapy to underserved regions around the world. This quarter, we announced that Halcyon is now being used in three centers in Africa: Clinique le Littoral Casablanca and Centre d'Oncologie Nakhil Rabat in Morocco, and Busamed Oncology Center, Hillcrest in South Africa.","In fact, at the Centre d'Oncologie Nakhil Rabat, Halcyon was installed, commissioned, staff trained and began treating patients in just two weeks. Within several months, the center is already treating 70 patients per day on Halcyon and offers other state-of-the-art techniques, including image-guided radiation therapy, RapidArc and stereotactic body radiation therapy using Varian equipment exclusively. We are proud of our collaboration with these centers and look forward to working with more centers across Africa and around the world to provide access to high-quality cancer treatments.","Lastly, our third growth initiative is to expand into other addressable markets. We continue to believe that 360 Oncology will be a driver of future growth for the company as we enter the cancer care coordination market, an area of large unmet need. For example, this quarter, we won a competitive contract for a patient engagement platform at The New York Proton Center, which is an alliance between Memorial Sloan Kettering, Montefiore and Mount Sinai.","This five-year contract represents progress towards our strategy of pursuing key opinion leader cancer center adoption of 360 Oncology. And we look forward to demonstrating the impact the product can have on our clinical effectiveness as well as efficiency and productivity.","Additionally, we launched Velocity 4.0, a new version of our cancer imaging software that now includes RapidSphere, a module for Y90 Selective Internal Radiation Therapy or SIRT dosimetry analysis.","RapidSphere allows clinicians to better understand tumor response and normal tissue toxicity for individual patients receiving SIRT. The new software module extends Varian's Velocity platform to radioembolization in the interventional oncology market. Velocity 4.0 and RapidSphere module have received FDA 510(k) clearance.","Overall, we're pleased with the progress we made in the third quarter of our fiscal year 2018. We made meaningful strides towards our long-term strategy to become a global leader in multi-disciplinary integrated cancer care solutions.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Gary who will provide more context on the third quarter financial results.","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Dow. As always, I will consistently frame my comments in the context of our long-term growth and value creation strategy which includes balancing growth, profitability and liquidity.","So, let me start with growth. Company-wide revenues were $709 million in the third quarter, up 12% in dollars and 10% in constant currency. In Oncology, revenues were $667 million, up 18% in dollars and 16% in constant currency, driven by growth across hardware, software and services. Year-to-date revenues grew 14% in dollars and 11% in constant currency.","Orders were $763 million or up 11% in dollars and 9% in constant currency. On a trailing 12-month basis, orders grew 6% in dollars and 5% in constant currency. We ended the quarter with $2.7 billion in backlog, up 6%.","Taking a closer look at our Oncology business results, in the Americas, revenues grew 13% in the quarter and 8% year-to-date; orders were $363 million, up 9%, driven by North America growth of 9%. On trailing 12-month basis, orders in the Americas grew 2% and orders in North America grew 4%.","We saw strong demand in North America for TrueBeam and Halcyon systems as well as orders for HyperArc across MCO and our GPU which enhances speed of dose calculations for treatment planning. Over 60% of our Halcyon orders in the quarter were from the Americas.","Asia-Pacific revenues grew 13% in the quarter and 10% year-to-date, orders were $141 million decreasing 7%. On a trailing 12-month basis, orders for the Asia-Pacific region decreased 3%. We saw moderate growth in Greater China in the quarter, and continue to lead the market there. In Japan, orders were up slightly and year-to-date orders have been up mid-single digits.","In Europe, Middle East, India and Africa geography, revenues grew 32% in the quarter and 28% year-to-date. Orders were $259 million, increasing 27%. On a trailing 12-month basis, orders grew 20%. We saw outstanding results across the region with growth driven by large product tenders and strong performance in both hardware and software orders.","Our Particle Therapy business posted revenues of $42 million in the quarter, which is down 39% compared with last year, when we recognized significant revenues from the Georgia Proton Treatment Center. However, this quarter, we recognized $3 million in earnings previously expected for the fourth quarter, primarily driven by the Georgia Project, which, as Dow said, is ahead of schedule.","Turning to profitability, total company gross margin was $316 million, up 18% at a rate of 44.5% of revenues. This was driven largely by our Oncology business where we continue to see solid revenue growth across hardware, software and services, as well as margin rate expansion from higher TrueBeam mix. Oncology gross margin of $307 million increased 19%, largely driven by revenue growth and the rate was 46.1%, up 35 basis points.","Looking at Particle Therapy, gross margin dollars were $8 million, down $0.5 million. Investment will continue to be a key driver of our long-term growth and value creation strategy. In the quarter, R&D was up 8% to $60 million, investing 8.4% of revenues into organic innovation programs.","Likewise, we're investing in sales and marketing while continuing to be responsible of G&A investments to ensure our infrastructure scales to support company growth. Company-wide SG&A expenses of $136 million or 19.1% of revenues were up $20 million or 17%. The increase was primarily driven by investments in sales head count and in marketing.","Company earnings were $119 million \u2013 company operating earnings were $119 million or 16.9% of revenues increasing 26%. Year-to-date, our operating margin is 17.7% of revenues. Year-to-date and for each quarter of our fiscal 2018, we have driven leverage in the P&L by growing operating earnings faster than revenue growth.","This quarter, we had two significant items that impacted GAAP earnings. First, acquisition-related expenses totaled $13 million for the quarter, primarily driven by acquisition costs and the hedging loss related to the Australian dollar purchase price for Sirtex, partially offset by the breakup fee. Second, as a result of updated information on expected key terms of the refinancing of the Maryland Proton Treatment Center, we took an additional impairment charge of $11 million. The charge reflects a difference in value between the security held by us and the estimated value of the new security to be issued in exchange as part of the refinancing. We anticipate the refinancing will close in the fourth quarter. Overall, Maryland Proton facility continues to perform well, treating over 100 patients per day.","Turning to taxes. After impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation, our resulting GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 21.2%, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 19.6% which excludes the impact of the transition to the new legislation. Similarly, our non-GAAP net earnings per diluted share also excludes this impact. GAAP net earnings per diluted share was $0.79. Our non-GAAP net earnings per diluted share was $1.04 with related diluted share count of 92.5 million shares in the quarter.","Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $536 million and debt of $18 million, $237 million since last quarter. With the changes related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we are able to repatriate cash to significantly reduce our debt. Cash flow from operations were $102 million, down 34% due to a large cash received from the Georgia Proton Center in the prior-year period. This brings our year-to-date cash flows from operations to $347 million, up 29% in trailing 12-month cash flows from operations to $476 million, up 13%.","Oncology DSO decreased by 15 days from 121 days to 106 days in the quarter. In addition to R&D investments \u2013 in addition to R&D, other investments in the quarter included $13 million in CapEx and $39 million to repurchase shares of our stock. As of the end of the quarter, we had 4.1 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.","I will now turn it back over to Dow who will discuss our updated fiscal year 2018 annual guidance.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Gary. With respect to our annual guidance, we continue to maintain a pragmatic approach and have considered the following factors regarding our fiscal year 2018 guidance: first, continued projected market growth; second, our products and solutions are resonating, driving our market leadership; third, recent fluctuations in the currency markets; and fourth, the impact of the tax cuts and their implications to our tax rate.","Additionally, while it continues to be a fluid and dynamic environment, we have reflected in our updated annual guidance the projected impact of tariffs imposed on July 6th by the United States Trade Representative.","After careful consideration of these factors, we believe it is prudent to update our fiscal year 2018 annual guidance to the following: revenue growth range of 9% to 11%, non-GAAP operating earnings as a percentage of revenues range of 17.5% to 18%, non-GAAP effective tax rate of 20%, weighted average diluted shares of 93 million, non-GAAP net earnings per diluted share range of $4.43 to $4.48, cash flows from operations range of $475 million to $550 million.","Thank you. And now, let's go to Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Amit Hazan from Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Unknown Speaker","Hi, guys. This is Phil (20:27) on for Amit. Can you hear me okay?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Hey, Phil (20:29) yeah. Loud and clear.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Two questions on the guidance, if I could. The first one probably for, Gary, as I was wondering if you could clarify what's the ex-FX guidance for revenue this quarter versus what it was last quarter?","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","The FX guidance is consistent with what \u2013 where kind of rates are running today to when we had the original guidance \u2013 sorry \u2013 the FX guidance reflected today is similar to where we stand today. So, that's kind of where we are and it's kind of the framework we use going forward.","Unknown Speaker","So, sorry, maybe I didn't phrase it well. Could you characterize what the ex-FX guidance was at last quarter call and what it's being updated to today?","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Ex-FX guidance, sorry, I did not hear that, yeah.","Unknown Speaker","Well, that's okay.","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","So the impact that was embedded in the guidance from last quarter was 2 percentage points of growth from currency. So, 7% and 9% would have been 5% and 7%, ex-currency.","Unknown Speaker","7% and 9% today would have been 4% to 7% last quarter.","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","No, the guidance we gave last quarter was revenue growth of 7% to 9%, okay, embed \u2013 6% to 9% \u2013 sorry 6% to 9%, embedded in that was 2 points of currency growth.","Unknown Speaker","Sure. Okay. So, still embedded in the FX in your guidance today is 2 points of currency headwinds?","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","That's correct.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Got it. And the second one was on the operating margin side. Just wondering if you can parse out some of the components that Dow touched on and how those are impacting a reduction in the operating margin guidance for the year.","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. Let me go to that. So as we thought about the guidance and the results you see in the third quarter, there's a few things going on. So one is, in our results, we're investing in R&D as well as SG&A to support the growth trajectory, right. You see the topline moving where it's moving. You see the gross margin dollars moving where it's moving.","I just want to reiterate that year-to-date, our operating earnings dollar growth is 39%. If you exclude the PT charge from the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, then the year-on-year operating earnings dollar growth year-to-date will be 22%. And that's growing faster than our revenue growth, right. So, we're getting good scaling into the P&L.","That said, we're setting up the G&A infrastructure for what this business needs support for the next two to three years, so there's some G&A investment, but G&A is scaling with revenue. And where you see the investments would be in software from a sales perspective in key markets, emerging markets. Investments on the sell side, there's Mobius and Evinance now running in those numbers, right, that weren't in there a year ago, and we're setting up acquisition reps for new territories we see out there from an expansion perspective. So those are the key elements of the sales and marketing lines from a growth perspective that you're seeing running in that SG&A number.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","And maybe I'd just add a little follow-on to that. I mean, we're starting to see the impact of this in our software business line. So, as Gary said, some of the sales and marketing investments we've been making in software has been to support the new acquisitions and to support especially distribution of our software products outside the U.S. And in many ways, it's the best software quarter that we've ever had. We had very strong double digit growth.","You heard in the call, I underscored HyperArc and RapidPlan, both had their biggest quarters. We also had very strong quarters for MCO, our multi-criteria optimization product that I mentioned in the call, as well as our Velocity 4.0 product. And then, Oncology 360 continues to kind of be at the spear point of the strategy driving our vision with our customers. We were very pleased to win this big order in New York that I mentioned in the call. So anyway, I mean, a lot of that infrastructure, just as Gary said, is going to support a software strategy as we roll forward.","Unknown Speaker","All right. Thanks for the color. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC","Hi, and good afternoon, everyone.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Good afternoon.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC","Maybe you can start in a little bit just on TrueBeam, here two consecutive quarters of strength, so a little bit of renaissance for this technology, the 20-unit order in Great Britain is notable, but you're also seeing traction in other regions of the world. So, can you talk a little bit about TrueBeam, where the demand specifically is coming from, is it because of HyperArc on top of that, has the pricing for TrueBeam shifted, and maybe just a little bit more color on how sustainable you think the growth in TrueBeam is from here? And then, I have a couple of follow-ups.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. That's a really good question. We've seen multiple quarters strength in TrueBeam. So, this is not a trend by any stretch. Yes, we did have a very good quarter on TrueBeam, but it continues to be the most flexible, most versatile market-leading machine out there. So, that's not news.","For us, the strategy is socket growth and we love socket growth of any flavor we can get. And I mean I'm really thrilled about these 280 units, our installed base is over 8,000 units right now. You heard us talk about that on the call. That drives, as you know, service contracts, software upgrades et cetera.","With the Halcyon, I think it's supporting TrueBeam very much. So, I think that strategy is working out very well. You heard me say on the call, it's worth a pause \u2013 we're at the one-year mark now. We introduced the product just over a year ago. We've taken 98 orders since we introduced it. A vast majority of them are incremental. Almost half of them are in emerging markets.","And I think to your point, Anthony, we're seeing it support the TrueBeam strategy. And so that's part of that socket growth play. HyperArc, at the high end, is also working very well, it's driving the TrueBeam product line and we're getting a share of imagination and we had 30 new orders in the quarter, 100 since launch. It's a very good product in tenders. So, a very strong position with TrueBeam. But I think we do have to see it in the context of the total portfolio and the total portfolio right now is, it's rocking.","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. The only thing I would add is that installed base is up 4%, right.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah.","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","And backlog grew in the period as well. So, good strong execution across the portfolio.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC","It just leads into the follow-up question which would be, just still getting some questions on the delta of that product revenue growth which has been certainly maintained here in fiscal 2018 in the low-teens. And then to your point, Gary, the backlog growth, the installed base growth I should say of single-digits. So maybe just a reconciliation between those two numbers would be helpful. And then last for me would be just any update on the strategy post-Sirtex, obviously certainly freeze a balance sheet capacity, so anything you could add there would be helpful? Thanks.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","So, I'll take a try here. Anthony, if I'm not answering this right, correct me. Our service revenue is doing very well, it's double-digit revenue. Yes, when we \u2013 these new machines, when they go into installed base, they are in warranty for a year. So, we don't see the service impact for one year.","But, yes, the product revenue was higher than the service revenue this quarter. But both were double-digit, we'll take it, so that's kind of where we are. In time, that service revenue number will catch up as we come out of warranty. And then, I said it, briefly, but the software numbers were also double-digit and we're very pleased with what we saw there. So, it was really strength across the whole portfolio.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. Dow, I'm going to start with couple on Asia. APAC orders were down 9%, can you maybe talk on that and did the Taiwanese distributor do anything to you guys in the quarter in terms of numbers?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Short version is kind of starting at the top. China and Japan were both up mid-to-high single-digit and we had a really tough comp in the region that was especially driven by Southeast Asia and Australia. So, we didn't see anything in the quarter that shocked us, I mean, yes, we have been executing double-digit growth pretty much every quarter in Asia. We did back off that this quarter. It was really driven by tough comp in ANZ and Southeast Asia.","China was mid-single digit and Japan about the same, so we had good execution in those two markets. Taiwan, we're excited about this acquisition. It's going to bring some capability in that market that we're excited about. In terms of impact on the quarter, nothing really notable. And then maybe just to close it out by saying pipeline in Asia looks very good.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then can you just \u2013 on China, you mentioned tariffs, I didn't hear you quantify, so can you talk to that? Obviously, in linacs, we're on one of the list, so can you maybe talk to risk going forward and then latest thinking on approval for outcome?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah, sure. I mean, we have included tariffs in our guidance for Q4, so that is built into our Q4 guidance and a piece of what you see there. I'll just say maybe from the top, I'm really proud of the team. Varian is an American innovator, created thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs for our suppliers. We support efforts to expand American manufacturing and job creation. At the patient level, our innovation impacts more than 3 million patients each year, vast majority of those in the U.S.","In fact, one in seven Americans will be treated with a Varian system in their lifetime. We have really long-term relationships that are built with years of trust, and our strategy is to provide the most advanced cutting-edge cancer treatment around the globe to fulfil our mission to provide a world without fear of cancer.","While we support U.S. efforts to ensure a more level playing field for American businesses through bilateral trade, we also believe that trade dispute should not have an adverse impact on access to the highest quality of cancer treatment for each and every American and person around the globe.","So we continue to have very productive conversations with the administration on the disproportionate impact of tariffs to Americans who face cancer and to American jobs manufacturing and investments in next-generation technologies, those conversations are ongoing. And as we get more detail, we'll disclose those to you as that happens. But that's kind of what we know today.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And just two quick ones. Gary, can talk on cash flow? It looks like it did decline a bit there, and then did all of the 20 TrueBeams to the UK ship this quarter, could you recognize all that? Thanks.","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. So on cash flow, trailing 12-month cash flow from operations, $476 million, so in that $475 million to $550 million range that we've held here, that's a nice increase, that's up 13% year-on-year. So I think the teams were out there executing well, good operational execution, DSO in Oncology business down again on year-over-year basis, 15 days.","And so the engagement, the ability to get, like I've said before, an invoice is collectible out the door and get it collected, the first time the teams are executing well, and we're starting to see that show up in cash flow. Also, as I mentioned earlier, the operating earnings growth is driving through that number as well. The follow-up question was?","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Did you recognize all 20 TrueBeams...","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","No, no, no. I think a couple over two years that'll take us time to get those installed.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Perfect. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Hey, guys. Congrats on a nice quarter. I had a few questions. So maybe I'll start with the \u2013 on the revenue front, really impressive on the product revenues. I guess my question is, when you look at 2019, right, orders and backlog, they've sort of been growing \u2013 you look at the last year or so (34:44), the 5% to 6% or maybe even 7% dip. And then this 16%, 17% year-to-date product revenues that we've seen, is this now a comp issue, because just when I look at the order backlog growth versus the product revenue growth, it feels like this is going to be a comp issue and there is a catch up, can you explain that please?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, short version is, we'll talk to you about 2019 next quarter. I will say trailing 12 months we've seen market growth of about 6% in Oncology, backlog growth of about same. So, that sort of market performance level trailing 12 months, our performance.","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. So, yeah, we're growing a solid 6%, 5% on a constant currency basis. And like Dow said, we'll talk to you guys about 2019 in about 90 days.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","And that's the product revenue growth. I think if I understand correctly, this is mostly a mix issue, right, because I think the way you explained it was a higher proportion of revenues coming from Europe and those tend to be recognized faster. Is that what's going on here?","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. Like I said, Vijay, we're not going to get into the 2019 implications and how this plays out. We'll talk to everybody about 2019 in 90 days.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Got you, Gary. And then just one on gross margins I think, you know you mentioned tariffs was being baked into the Q4. Is that we're \u2013 just looking at the margin guidance, it looks like GM for Q4 should be somewhere in the 43% to 43.5% range. Is that \u2013 assuming obviously that's different on mix, but this is just based on tariffs, is that the right ballpark for us \u2013 for you to be modeling?","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. So we don't guide on gross margin rate. What we did see in the quarter though is good solid execution in TrueBeam, right, and we saw software and services grow as well. So, that's what you're seeing flowing through into the margin line here from the actuals perspective in the third quarter. So, we're happy with that. And again, we don't guide to the margin rate for external purposes.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Or if I have to ask the question in another way, Gary, the op margins was lowered, right, and that was based on tariffs and year-to-date impact, and that the tariff impact, that's a gross margin line, right. So for modeling for Q4 and if we're saying the guidance is baking in tariffs, that's a gross margin impact?","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","That is correct. The tariff impact will flow through the gross margin line. No, but, again, Vijay, we're very happy with that ex-PT charge, operating margin dollars are growing 22% year-on-year. Cash flow is growing 13% year-on-year. Both of those numbers are growing faster than revenue. That's good execution. And we're proud of those numbers and we'll continue to execute and try and perpetuate as we go forward.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Absolutely, Gary. I'm sure people will be happy to see that the cash flow turnaround. Just maybe one last one on Halcyon. I know when the Halcyon was launched, right, this was supposed to be incremental to corporate margins. Given that Halcyon is going to be assembled in China, should the Street still be expecting Halcyon to be incremental to corporate given the tariff impact?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","As I said on the call, we're really pleased with what we've seen so far. High percentage of these are incremental, they're going into cobalt vaults, going into tomotherapy replacement vaults, going into other small vaults till \u2013 people are now building small vaults around them, 40% of the volume is in emerging markets, that doesn't include Europe, and we can probably get that number for you. But we're doing very, very well.","Yes, a few of them are coming back here in the U.S., they might have some tariff exposure on the \u2013 as part of that, but we're very comfortable with where we are. And again, as a reminder, we continue to have \u2013 it's pretty opaque and we continue to have really productive discussions with the administration. We're trying to remove cancer fighting technologies from the list as these trade disputes go forward not to have an adverse impact on really high-quality cancer treatment around the world. So, that's still an ongoing conversation.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","That's helpful commentary, Dow. So last one for me is, any contribution from M&A, I think I heard you guys say the distributor acquisition, was there anything material at all in the Q or...","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","We've got a couple that we're very excited about that we've closed I'd say at least for Q4 marginal impact.","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","But on plan and tracking to...","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","On plan, tracking, a little small positive impact, maybe let me fix that, but on track with what we saw. We really like this Mobius in particular, taking these QA software tools and getting them through our global distribution network. That gives us access to a nice growth story there.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks. Just another one on the tariff topic, could you maybe just give us a little bit of color as to the customer conversations you had this quarter (40:21) this might be causing maybe delays in decision making or different decisions, I'd be interested in sort of what you're hearing now and basically as a result what's embedded in your outlook for the rest of this fiscal year?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","I mean, so far, we are having deep conversations with our customers. Those relationships are obviously important and critical to us. None of these are short-term relationships, they're all very long-term relationships that enable us to have the terrific position and franchise that we have. As I mentioned in the call earlier, we treat about 3 million patients a year. We're investing significantly in our R&D. Our customers buy us because we're best and we want to keep that going. We've reflected the tariff impact into our fourth quarter guidance. As to what the impact is going to be beyond that, as I said, we continue to have productive conversations with Washington and are trying to address the disproportionate impact that tariffs have to not just Americans because of the R&D impact, but to American jobs, manufacturing and investment.","But I think at this time \u2013 at this point, it's had real no impact from kind of a market point of view. You saw our China orders were still mid-single digit on a really tough comp, so we haven't seen the impact on the market side.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then just last question would be on just the velocity of this conversation. Obviously, this wasn't a topic for us for the most part of last quarter and now it is. (42:17) with your customers has really picked up in the last few weeks or has it been sort of a slow trickle for several months, I'd be interested in sort of the velocity of discourse with customers on this issue? Thank you.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","I'd say it's very opaque. There's conversations happening every day. I wouldn't say we've seen a pickup in that velocity at least in the sense that you're kind of getting at. These partnerships that we have with them are strong and, more often than not, often decades long and we continue to work with our customers to advance our joint mission to create a world without the fear of cancer.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Unknown Speaker","Hey, guys. This is Jason (43:13) on for Jeff. I just wanted to start with the tariff, again. Just is there anything you can discuss on maybe mitigation efforts here, you're putting in place or anything from like a supply sourcing or manufacturing perspective in order to potentially offset the headwinds, or is it really just trying to lobby the government for removal of the tariff?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","I mean, the short answer is, yes, to everything. I mean, we're looking very hard at mitigation efforts and we're looking very hard at continuing to work with the administration. We are having productive conversations there, as I mentioned. Our focus is on our growth initiative. As you've seen, that the business is enjoying a nice uptick in growth, that's because we're spending our R&D on the right stuff and we're supporting it with the right sales and marketing activities to drive our growth.","Clearly, we want to keep maintaining that, and so having a business that doesn't have an impact from a disproportionate share of tariffs, not only to Americans who face cancer, but to American jobs and investment in R&D, in next-technologies, that's the game for us. So we will always evaluate our supply chain. I think team's done a great job of that, as I mentioned. I'm very proud of what we've done. We've generated thousands of jobs here in the U.S. and then our supply chain probably tens of thousands of more jobs. We'd obviously love to keep that going, but we'll always evaluate our supply chain and optimize it given the environment.","Unknown Speaker","Yeah. Thanks, Dow. Would you consider that's more of the supply chain and manufacturing shift, would that be more of a plan B, plan C for you, is that a fair way to think about it?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","I mean, I think the short version is, we've got some global capability. We're a very large U.S. exporter. And clearly, we've got to look at cost as we go forward, that'll be a really important piece. But we're a very major U.S. exporter. Our supply chain is global. We do have some regulatory requirements. So shifting manufacturing isn't a snap your fingers, because we do have to go through FDA approval cycles. And I think for today, that's probably a specific as I'm going to get.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. That's helpful. And then, Gary, just wanted to come back to a question on the EPS guide. I just wanted to confirm from one question earlier that there's no change in the FX tailwinds that you're assuming in guidance for the year, still assuming 200 basis points. So then the follow-on to that is that there is no change reflect in your EPS guidance from FX, that's part one of the question? But then part two is then the entirety of the takedown of the top end of the EPS guide can be traced to tariffs, is that all accurate?","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. So the guidance that you saw on the revenue line 9% to 11% still reflects that 2 percentage points, right. And so that's kind of what's in today.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. So the full takedown for the guide is tied to the tariff, there's no FX reduction in the EPS guide from or so there's \u2013 yeah, there's no reduction in the EPS guide from FX?","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. I'm not going to talk to the tariff point of this. We will \u2013 I'd say that there's about maybe $0.01 or so of currency, but it's pretty de minimis in the big picture of thing so, but the range reflects what we think we're going to operate at here for the rest of the year.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Very helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC","Hey, just thanks for the follow-up. Just the math question on tariffs again, is the assumption that that would be on revenues or on the actual cost of goods sold in order to make an estimate on potentially what that impact is?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Again, let me come back to, it is very opaque and we have given you guidance for Q4, call us in 90 days and we'll clear it all up for what we learn and know in the next 90 days. So as it relates to kind of 2019, I think it's very important for us to get through the next part of the process. I've talked a lot about that here today. We're continuing to have very productive conversations with the administration. And until we kind of get some clarity on that, I think it's conjecture in our \u2013 we're kind of proud of the business we've built. And as a strong American exporter, I think, we've got a very, very strong case, we want to make sure that we've got the capability to deliver the best cancer treatment here in the U.S. and worldwide and continue the terrific job story that we have.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, again.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, operator. I'm very pleased with the progress we've made in the third quarter towards executing on our long-term valuation \u2013 value creation strategy. We continue to strengthen our leadership in radiation therapy, extend our global footprint and grow our addressable markets.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Spencer Sias, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications for Varian Medical Systems. Thank you, Mr. Sias, you may begin.","Spencer Sias","Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Varian Medical Systems conference call for the second quarter of fiscal year 20 15. With me are Dow Wilson, President and CEO; Elisha Finney, CFO, and Clarence Verhoef, our Corporate Controller. Dow and Elisha will summarize our results, then we'll take your questions following the presentation. To simplify our discussion unless otherwise stated all references to the quarter or year are fiscal quarters and fiscal years.

We assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements in this presentation and discussion because of new information, future events, or otherwise.","And now here is Dow.","Dow Wilson","Good afternoon and welcome. For the second quarter of fiscal 2015 we generated good earnings that were achieved in the face of significant currency headwinds. In summary, we are reporting net earnings of $1.05 per diluted share, revenues of $759 million, down 2% in dollars but up 2% in constant currency. Excellent cost control efforts that helped our gross and operating margins, double-digit oncology orders growth in the Americas that largely offset declines in EMEA and APAC, challenges in our imaging components business with the clients in orders and revenues and two big wins in our proton business.","Let's talk about each of the businesses in more detail starting with oncology. Second quarter gross orders for Oncology Systems rose by 15% in North America and by nearly 10% in China, partially offsetting currency related weakness across the bulk of the international markets. Oncology gross orders totaled $581 million for the quarter, down 5% versus the year ago quarter but equal to the year ago quarter on a constant currency basis. Looking at Oncology three geographies, gross orders in the Americas rose 12% in dollars and constant currency. Gross orders in EMEA declined 24% in dollars and 13% in constant currency, principally due to weakness in Africa and India, where we had strong orders in the year ago quarter and business tends to be lumpy. In APAC, gross orders fell by 15% in dollars and 8% in constant currency, principally due to weakness in Japan.","For the first half, oncology gross orders growth rates were as follows; worldwide, even in dollars and up 4% in constant currency, Americas up 5% in both dollars and constant currency, EMEA down 8% in dollars and up 1% in constant currency, and APAC down 1% in dollars, and up 5% in constant currency. Our strong order growth in North America during the quarter was highlighted by several large long term deals, the largest of which was the project with HCA to equip its Sarah Cannon Cancer Center in Tennessee with seven linear accelerators including six systems. This installation will also have our new rapid plan and analytics [ph] software using data analytics tools for treatment planning and information management. The HCA order is an example of the move towards consolidated networks making purchasing decisions aimed at standardizing clinical operations.","The need for integrated clinical solutions drove many customer decisions during the quarter to replace competitive hardware and software product from multiple vendors in favor of a single Varian system. Clinical integration of treatment planning and delivery, as well as information management for safe, efficient, and effective workflow is a key Varian advantage. In Latin America, currency headwinds led to some purchasing delays that resulted in modest decline in orders. In EMEA we had sizeable wins in Germany, Bulgaria, Finland, and in the UK; Bayer Healthcare, one of the UK's biggest private hospital chains ordered two true beams together with our full software suite for a planned new radiotherapy and radiosurgery facility in Jumpford FX [ph].","In APAC, weakness in Japan and Australia overshadowed our growth in China. In Japan, orders were flat in constant currency and down in dollars. The market remained sluggish, however, we gained share there during the quarter. Currency was also a culprit in Australia where a stronger dollar caused some customers to pull back on purchasing decisions. In China we booked an $18 million order following a public tender by the People's Liberation Army. During the quarter we also successfully launched the Edge Radiosurgery System in front of more than 250 customers at the Annual China Med Exhibition in Beijing. China remains a healthy market for us.","Order activity during the quarter was slow in other emerging markets including Brazil, India, Africa and Russia; Russia in particular remained very quiet. The long term need for cancer treatment products remained high in developing markets with a number of diagnosed cases is rising, and where radiation therapy is among the most cost effective treatment. In past calls we have talked about expanding our product portfolio to offer more to customers in global markets. Over the weekend at the ESTRO show in Barcelona, Varian announced VitalBeam, a significant addiction to our line of linear accelerators.","VitalBeam leverages Varian\u2019s basic two beam technology to provide clinics with new cost competitive options for delivering image-guided radiotherapy. It can be equipped with accessories including rapid arc, respiratory gating, onboard imaging, and 80 or 120-leaf collimators. VitalBeam is a scalable and upgradeable system that affordably meets the clinical needs of hospitals today and as they grow in the future. It's optimized for advanced radiotherapy. VitalBeam is targeted at the core radiotherapy market where it can serve as a work horse in busy clinics. Customer interest at ESTRO was very high and we plan to make it available to customers in Europe first, while seeking clearances around the rest of the world. CE mark, FDA 510-K and other international regulatory approvals have not yet been obtained. VitalBeam is currently not available for sale in any market. We will continue to invest in R&D to bring more products like VitalBeam to market.","In March, we held our annual research partner symposium, a two and a half day scientific meeting in Atlanta on the future of cancer care. It attracted 150 leading clinicians and research partners from 71 institutions and 15 countries. They shared ideas and presentations on their work with knowledge based planning, data analytics, stereotactic radiosurgery, and advanced imaging technology. It was an exciting meeting and we can see a clear path to the development of significant new treatment capabilities that will dramatically improve the speed and precision of radiotherapy and radiosurgery. The next steps will be every bit as exciting as IMRT, IVRT, SBRT, Rapid Arc, Rapid Plan and TrueBeam.","Let me turn now to our imaging components business. Gross orders for imaging components fell by 24% to $156 million for the quarter, and revenues fell by 8% to $155 million. Imaging components had a tough comparison with very high panel orders in the year ago quarter as a result of orders that flipped from the first to the second quarter last year. Additionally, orders in sales for tubes and panels were impacted by pricing pressures related to the devaluations in the yen and the euro. Very strong dollar is causing some customers to reduce inventories, insource or look elsewhere for lower cost alternative to our component. Orders and sales of our security and inspection products also fell sharply in the quarter. And these products [ph] have been delayed and it appears that customers have already ordered most of what they need for the next few quarters as they work through the backlog.","For the first half, orders for tubes and panels were up 6% and sales were flat. However, orders and sales for our security products were down significantly. While we remain optimistic about the long term growth prospect, we believe that this business will continue to face challenging conditions in the near term. The company's other category comprised of the Varian Particle Therapy business and the Ginzton Technology Center recorded gross orders of $44 million and generated $14 million in revenue.","It was a big quarter for our proton business, we won a public tender and booked an order for a ProBeam installation at Aarhus in Denmark. In addition, Varian was announced as the preferred bidder for two proton therapy centers that will be constructed in the United Kingdom over the next two years. The contacts for these projects are due to be signed during the summer and we expect to book the equipment portion of these orders at that time. With a strong backlog in the sales pipeline we're starting to see some real momentum in our Particle Therapy business.","Now I will turn it over to Elisha.","Elisha Finney ","Thanks Dow, and hello everyone. Before I walk you through the P&L, let me touch on backlog. The company ended the quarter with $3.1 billion backlog. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled $53 million bringing net orders for the company to $729 million. The adjustment includes $12 million related to currency exchange rates.","Second quarter revenues for the total company decreased 2% in dollars and increased 2% in constant currency. Total company revenues in the Americas were up 11% in dollars and up 12% in constant currency. EMEA revenues were down 1% in dollars but up 10% in constant currency. APAC revenues were down 25% in dollars and down 21% in constant currency. For the first half, total company revenues were flat in dollars and up 4% in constant currency. Oncology Systems posted a 2% decline in revenues during the quarter bringing the revenue growth for the first half to 1%. Imaging components posted a second quarter revenue decline of 8% with small declines in our tubes and flat panel products, and a 45% decline in our security and inspection products.","For the first half, imaging components revenues were down 3% from the year-ago period with gains in flat panels more than offset by declines in tubes, as well as significant declines in security and inspection products. Revenues for the other category increased significantly from the year ago quarter as we continued production and installation of several proton projects that are in our backlog. Total company gross margin for the quarter rose 30 basis points to 42.5% with increases in all of our businesses. Oncology Systems gross margin increased 18 basis points from the year ago quarter to 43% as favorable product and geographic mix more than offset the negative currency impact on revenue.","For the first half, oncology's gross margin increased nearly half a point to 44.3%. The imaging components gross margin for the quarter increased by 216 basis points to 43.7% due largely to a higher mix of panel products, product cost reductions, and improved quality costs. For the first half, imaging components' gross margin increased nearly 1.5 points to 42.9%.","Second quarter SG&A expenses were 117 million, or 15% of revenues, an improvement of 250 basis points as a percent of revenues from the year-ago quarter when we had a large patent litigation settlement. SG&A includes a $3 million charge during the quarter to complete the restructuring that was largely implemented last quarter. I think it's worth mentioning that SG&A expenses were down significantly from last quarter as the cost savings from the restructuring have started to flow through the P&L. Second quarter R&D expenses were $59 million or 8% of revenues, even as a percentage of revenue with the year-ago quarter. And for the first half, R&D expenses were about even as a percentage of revenue at 8%.","Moving down the income statement, second quarter operating earnings totaled $146 million, or 19% of revenue. Depreciation and amortization totaled $16 million for the quarter and $33 million for the first half. The effective tax rate at 28% was up 35 basis points from the year-ago period when we benefited from a patent litigation settlement. We now believe the tax rate for the full fiscal year will be 27% to 29%. Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased from the year ago quarter to $101 million shares due largely to our ongoing repurchase program.","Diluted earnings per share was $1.05 for the second quarter including the $0.02 restructuring charge.","Turning to the balance sheet we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $862 million, debt of $513 million, and stockholders' equity of $1.67 billion. DSO at 88 was improved seven days from the year-ago quarter. Second quarter cash flow from operations was $53 million, less than net income primarily due to working capital increases in inventory and accounts receivable. For the first half, cash flow from operations was $132 million. Primary uses of cash were $76 million for the repurchase of about 825,000 shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had 3.9 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2015.","Now I will turn it back to Dow for the outlook.","Dow Wilson","Thanks, Elisha. We believe that for fiscal year 2015 total company earnings will be in the range of $4.02 to $4.14 per diluted share, and that revenues will increase by about 1% to 2% in dollars and by about 5% in constant currency. We now expect that challenges in our imaging components business and currency headwinds will more than offset the earnings momentum of the first half. We estimate that imaging components could negatively impact earnings by about $0.08 to $0.12 per share.","Additionally, since our guidance last quarter the strength of the dollar has diminished our earnings expectations by another $0.06 to $0.10 per diluted share. For the third quarter of fiscal 2015 we believe total company revenues should be about equal to the prior year period in dollars, and up about 4% in constant currency. Net earnings per diluted share for the third quarter could be in the range of $0.90 to $0.94 per diluted share. The outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2015 excludes any impact of proton orders not yet booked into the backlog. ","Let me finish with a comment on the significant impact of the strong US dollar. Since last October when we first guided for fiscal year 2015 the strengthening of the dollar has cost us about $0.30 per diluted share not accounting the competitive challenges that this has presented to our imaging component business. The good news is that we've managed to largely offset this in our operations.","We are now ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Jeffrey Johnson","Thank you, good evening, guys. Can you hear me okay?","Dow Wilson","Hi, Jeff.","Elisha Finney","Yes.","Jeffrey Johnson","Great. So Let me start \u2013 I don't think I have ever started this way but I'm going to start on the imaging business. So Dow, I hear what you are saying there on some of the dollar impact and all that. Kind of run me through the Hitachi deal I thought kind of helped mitigate some of the volatility and there was some minimum purchase requirements and all. Is it that others on the margin outside of that deal where those variances are coming relative to prior expectations, or how should we think about that?","Dow Wilson","Sure, let me walk you through it. First of all from a profit...","Jeffrey Johnson","So sorry, my fault, sorry.","Dow Wilson","That's okay. Toshiba is our largest customer. We have seen a little bit of weakness from Toshiba, the Japan equipment market is very soft. Equipment is \u2013 most of the business is a service business but the equipment business, Japan equipment business is off for them, and that's been an impact. But you heard us say on the half, you do have to kind of look at the half to see what's really going on. The panel business is still a very strong double-digit business, and the first half, it's going well north of up 10%.","Elisha Finney","14%.","Dow Wilson","14% on orders in the first half. The tube business is about flat in the first half, and in orders, and SIP, our security and inspection business is where we've taken a big hit. We had some big orders last year and then we think with the inventory that people have they're kind of taken care of for a while. So we see that as kind of the ongoing part here.","And in tube and panel, you know, we are concerned \u2013 combined panel and tube together, 6% in the first half, that's not kind of 8 to 12 that we've done historically, so we're a little bit worried there. I'd say people are being very careful and holding back purchases. We think it will come back, but it's a little cloudy as to what it's going to be here over the next six months.","Jeffrey Johnson","Okay. And then any update at all on Maryland? And Elisha, just want to ask one question on FX.","Dow Wilson","I'll start on Maryland, and Elisha can fix it. We have made significant progress towards financing this past quarter, and we know it's been frustrating for everybody but we're feeling good about where it is. It is still not done yet, we won't book until it's complete so it is still not in our guidance for the year. There is some probability that could happen this quarter or next quarter, so that's the good news but we're not going to put it in guidance until everything's signed up. When it does book, just as a reminder for everybody, it will be about $80 million in both orders and revenues and around $0.20 of EPS.","Jeffrey Johnson","Got it. And then just on currency, Elisha, I just want to make sure I'm understanding the comments over the last few quarters. I thought last quarter, the currency impact for the year was up to $0.30, then another $0.06 to $0.10 here. And Dow I think you referenced in your prepared remarks you're hurdling $0.30 for the year altogether. So just trying to reconcile, I thought we were at $0.30 already last quarter plus the $0.06 to $0.10 incremental this quarter. Am I missing something there or am I misremembering?","Elisha Finney","Jeff, I would have to go back and take a look at that, since we gave guidance in Q1, we had another FX impact of about $0.18. So if you look back at January, we were facing guidance on a euro rate of around $1.14 to $1.15 as we've talked about. Recently up to today it's been closer to the $1.07, $1.08 revenues coming in April are closer to that range. So that's the delta that we're now talking about. If the euro were to come back to the $1.11, $1.12 rate that we saw today and stay there for the balance of the quarter, obviously that would be good news and could help us get back to the higher end of that range. But currencies have just been all over the map and so we're trying to look at it as where it's been trending the past week which was closer to the $1.07 range.","Jeffrey Johnson","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Wittes with Brean Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Jason Wittes","Hi, thanks for taking the question. If I could just follow up on imaging, it seems like this is more than your temporary destocking issue hitting that business. It sounds like you think this will be a little bit more prolonged than we have seen in the past. Am I characterizing this correctly or how do you think about sort of what's happened in this quarter and the outlook for the rest of the year but that's basically three quarters.","Dow Wilson","We think that certainly the security and inspection piece is going to be a big issue for us all year. So on that aspect of it, you're right, we \u2013 as I said, when you look at the panel and \u2013 panel business is doing great going 14% in the first half. The tube business is flat in the first half. Combine it together, 6%. We'd like to see two or three more points on that. So we have seen people be very careful with their purchases. Will that come back? We do know that people are \u2013 it is hard to move because we're designed in. But they are looking at other sourcing options and in-sourcing options in the case of some competitors. The exchange rate has moved a nickel here just this week, maybe that helps us out a little bit as we look at the second half. Anyway, I mean, I think the bottom line is, when you look at the business I think it's fair to say that we've got some challenges here in the near term, two of them panel markets are likely to grow in the mid-single digit range, that 5%, 6%, 7% range is probably about right for panel and two of them comes from market growth.","Jason Wittes","Just to push a little further, just to understand, I mean most of your panels and tubes are made, I think, in Utah. So that the US dollar manufacturing, that's obviously gotten more expensive so that's part of why some of especially the lower cost customers are looking other places. Is that the right way to think about?","Elisha Finney","Yes, Jason, I mean \u2013 because like we've said many times, we sell in dollars, so the direct FX impact has not affecting us, but what I'm kind of referring to is an indirect impact of the exchange rates. We are just less competitive relative to Japanese or European manufacturers right now. And holding inventory, helping, we suspect customers are going to bleed inventory down to the bare bones and hoping they can bay at a better rate.","Jeffrey Johnson","Okay. One other question I wanted to ask about was VitalBeam. I assume, you guys have talked a lot about coming out with products for emerging mark that are both cheaper but also lower cost for you guys to produce as a way of maintaining or even helping your \u2013 or even boosting your gross margin. Is VitalBeam sort of part of that process? Is there a way to think about?","Dow Wilson","Absolutely. Your VitalBeam is the force of many, so I think this is an important growing market for us \u2013 as we've said too many times last year we took up R&D pretty significantly last year because we saw a lot of opportunity in the number of markets. One of those being value segments around the world.","Jeffrey Johnson","Okay, thanks. I'll jump back in queue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Tycho Peterson","Actually I just want to pick up on that last line of questioning. Was there any disruption in the order book from VitalBeam from the sales people knowing about coming for the emerging mark orders? Just trying to figure that.","Dow Wilson","I don't think so at all. I think you kind of heard that go around, maybe that's worth hitting for just a second. Just as a reminder, the Americas was great, so gross orders were up 12% in the Americas. North America was up 14%, so that was terrific. EMEA, as I said, was down when you look at year-to-date, year-to-date gross orders are up, constant currency 1% in EMEA, and that feels okay, we would obviously like to do better than that. We've been surprised by the strength in western Europe, we've been weak in eastern Europe, Russia; we had a weak Q2 in India and in Africa. So \u2013 Africa and India tend to be lumpy, I think the Russia, eastern Europe impact is a political one. But I think we'll see India and Africa come back. And then we did have a tough comp for our EMEA organization where last year we had a large Algeria order. In Asia, you have heard the story a little bit, year-to-date gross orders are up 5% in constant currency in Asia. In China we were up 9%. So we still feel very good about where we are in China.","The Japan market year-over-year, we think it's down pretty substantially, there is some retrenchment going on in Japan, the market feels like it's down 30ish percent. The good news is, as I mentioned, we've had a very strong performance in market share in Japan, and it's nice to see that coming around. Then of course the other impact we have in Japan is the yen\u2019s off pretty substantially and hitting us there as well in Japan. So that's kind of a go around the globe. Elisha, would you add anything there?","Elisha Finney","No, sounds good.","Dow Wilson","Does that answer your question Tycho?","Tycho Peterson","That helps. And then I guess just as we think about the opportunity for VitalBeam, it's unique as a proxy or I'm just trying to understand how you think about these?","Dow Wilson","Sure, it's a really good question. As I said, the really great thing about VitalBeam it's built on the TrueBeam platform, so it gives our customers a ton of upgradeability, they can scale up IMRT, IVRT, Rapid Arc, they can put a mega voltage imager on it, or mega voltage and killer voltage imager, they can go down market with an 80 multi-leaf collimator, we haven't done that before. It's got a dose rate that's optimized for radiation therapy at 14000 monitor units. The TrueBeam is still optimized for SRT \u2013 for SRS and SBRT, and TrueBeam still has all the motion management, the six degree of freedom couch, the high definition, collimator flatten and culture free in all of our triggered imaging capabilities.","The difference between VitalBeam and Unique, Unique is built on our C series platform, it's a single energy system, and it's really the entry-level product. So I don't think these \u2013 we see this as really kind of between Unique and TrueBeam, and fulfilling a space where we can be more competitive. I think it's going to give us better price support, TrueBeam, and it's not going to compete with the Unique at all. And we still have the rest of the product line, the IX and the trilogy that kind of fit in there as well. So we feel very good about the way this product lines up. I guess just kind of reiterate the point, I don't think there was \u2013 I would like to say there was some impact from people waiting in these markets for VitalBeam but I don't think so in this last quarter.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then just lastly on software, you guys have done a good job there, you called out HCA. I mean is rapid plan coming up in most of your discussions with consolidated networks? And can you maybe just talk to how much share you can pick up? I know you've put out overall goals.","Dow Wilson","I mean the response of rapid plan has been huge. I think we're in the top half of the first inning still of that diffusion. I will say at our research symposium, people extremely excited about what rapid plan can do. We've talked about it a lot in the context of quality, in terms of letting everybody in the world do the absolute best care. But I think the other thing that people are getting ready excited about is the efficiency aspect of the product. And we had a paper presented at ESTRO last week where one institution was seeing 90-minute reduction in planning times. So that's per plan, that's huge. And all of a sudden you start to get the same productivity and the symmetry that we had. When we launched Rapid Arc, Rapid Arc was about productivity in the delivery room. Now we're talking about patient productivity in planning 90-minutes, where do you get that kind of productivity, it's huge. And by the way this is a Varian only thing, research can't do this, and Electa can't do this, Pinnacle can't do this. So we're really first to market with a terrific product, great quality and great efficiency.","Tycho Peterson","Okay, thank you.","Dow Wilson","I'm selling hard there, Tyco, you should buy one.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","David Roman","I wanted just to start with a few detailed follow-ups on the guidance, and hopefully my math is correct here. As I look at the operating margin progression that sort of implied by the guidance for the rest of the year, it does look like you're contemplating a very significant fall-off in profitability in the third quarter and a big bounce back in 4Q. And while I understand revenue volumes have something to do with the overall profitability, you would still be down materially on operating margins year-over-year in the third quarter despite relatively flat revenue. Can you just help us understand the gyrations in profitability over the balance of the year?","Elisha Finney","Absolutely, David. And really it's just \u2013 when we look at the shippable backlog and what we expect to deliver in Q3, it is very significantly shifting to international and to emerging marks. So it's really reflected in the gross margin based on geography. We had the opposite effect in Q2 where we had a significant increase in North America deliveries. It's just the way the machines land, I would say in Q4 in the year ago period if you remember we had strong orders in North America. So Q4 will be again more North American focused, and so it's just the way it breaks down. I wouldn't read too much into quarter-to-quarter but really just kind of looking at the year. And interestingly on the year, if you exclude all of the augmenix [ph] and the patent litigation from last year, and you exclude the restructuring from this year, we're actually going up about 10 basis points in margin. So I look at that and say apples-to-apples, we're doing a really good job on controlling costs and that the restructuring is starting to pay off. So I would just caution you to look at the years versus one quarter.","David Roman","Okay, understood. And then I guess a follow-up on the restructuring, it looks like a very fast impact for the comments in your prepared remarks, and also in the numbers. Are we getting to a point where the direct costs take out opportunity is reaching a plateau or is there still more opportunity to go on the SG&A line without seeing a pickup in revenue?","Elisha Finney","Yes, I mean you saw from immediate impact on the restructuring because the bulk of that was implemented in the first quarter. And so those heads came out of payroll immediately when that was executed. So you will continue to see that flow through the P&L. Now that said, we are continuing to replace some of those retirees and lower cost jurisdictions. So don't hold me to no headcount increases because that won't happen, but we did see a significant improvement in SG&A. It can be lumpy, I will caution that, but I feel very good about how the businesses have controlled headcount, how we've controlled travel expenditures, and all of our costs.","David Roman","Okay. And then my last question, it's sort of a longer term one, and understandably this business does have quarter-to-quarter fluctuations and order timing delivery, macroeconomic factors, etcetera, but as I think about what you talked about as a multi-year revenue goal, something like 68%. You just haven't gotten there the past several quarters; I think the trailing four quarter constant currency average revenue growth is below 5% and closer to 4%. So what gives you the confidence in being able to see that type of sharp acceleration and be able to perform at that higher level sustainably?","Elisha Finney","So if I look at the full year in dollars, we're expecting 1% to 2% as we talked about, and constant currency is going to be between 5% and 6%. Now a significant part of that is coming from growth in our proton therapy business year-over-year. But \u2013 you get me back to $1.27, $1.30 euro, we can turn in that kind of growth. This is clearly FX related and unprecedented levels on the euro and the yen that we're facing today.","David Roman","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Vijay Kumar","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. So Dow, I apologize if I'm repeating my question. I just hopped on the call. Can you give some clarity on the cancellations within the quarter \u2013 it looks like, if I'm looking at may math, oncology was high singles or maybe low doubles; and could you talk about sort of what drove that acceleration? I mean, sequentially it looks like it's worsen.","Elisha Finney","Vijay, actually if you were to look at the year ago period, backlog adjustments at $53 million are down. In that $53 million \u2013 I think it was $59 million in the year ago period. In that $53 million, there is $12 million related to FX, and that's because when we put something into backlog, we put it in at that rate and then it is held at that rate in dollars. So when the revenue comes out at a different exchange rate, we have to adjust our backlog to make the math work. So though we put the order in at the exchange rate of today, I know that's a little complicated answer, so there is an FX impact of $12 million in the quarter, as well as we had a $10 million, $11 million outright cancellation of a tender for our security and inspection products business. I believe it was the Saudi Arabia tender that was just delayed indefinitely, so we took that order out of our backlog. So oncology, actually if you look at those two things, they had a very low rate of dormant fee or cancellation in the quarter.","Vijay Kumar","Got you, and that was helpful. Maybe on the imaging side, and I understand you have a large customer, sort of \u2013 can you maybe just talk about the longer term sort of trends? Because imaging in past, I mean it's been a fantastic business, probably doesn't get as much attention, but then when you look at the EBIT line the contribution has been pretty significant. So I'm just trying to sort of put this into context and probably some of this was FX or maybe on the longer term outlook for this market.","Dow Wilson","No, we still really love the long term prospects to this business, the whole shift from analog to digital products is driving the flat panel business. We actually think that, in fact, as that cost and price comes down, we're opening up more and more markets for that growth. So we think the panel business is going to continue to be a very strong and good market for us. I think we've got some short term perturbations, we're looking at our supply chain, comment was already made relative to the cost of businesses, very good dollar denominated, and do we need to do something to have a little bit more of a natural hedge and make sure we've got the cost position that we need with this kind of global currency market fluctuation that we've seen. But we think the long term of the business is still very, very positive; we love the business model that we have, it's a very low cost distribution and service business. So that's terrific, and frankly, we love to add on to it, and are even looking at some inorganic opportunities to maybe grow the portfolio.","Vijay Kumar","Got you. And maybe if I can squeeze out one more in, I'm not sure if your commentary on product versus service growth within the oncology systems in the quarter?","Elisha Finney","Yes, service on the revenue side for the quarter was up 4%, 9% year-to-date. Orders were about flat, and that really is just a timing issue related to when contracts get renewed.","Dow Wilson","And currency.","Elisha Finney","And currency, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Dow Wilson","Hi, Steve.","Steve Beuchaw","Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Sorry if it was embedded in that last response somewhere, but did you give a software growth number for the quarter?","Dow Wilson","We did not.","Elisha Finney","No, but it was up $7 million or $8 million quarter-over-quarter versus year ago period and revenue.","Steve Beuchaw","Quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year?","Elisha Finney","I don't have year-on-year but it should be up in revenues. I believe it was up last quarter as well.","Steve Beuchaw","Okay. And then we're here in late April, so I'll ask the obligatory reimbursement question. I guess it's less interesting than some years given that CMS laid out so much in the final rule last year about where they were going, but I wonder if you've heard anything from your DC folks about where you think reimbursement goes this year, whether it's in terms of structure or rates? Thanks.","Dow Wilson","I'd say is it's been pretty quiet, we have not heard anything new in the last quarter or so. So it's been pretty quiet on the eastern front.","Steve Beuchaw","That's impressive that you know that considering that you're on the west coast. Well, thanks so much, guys. Have a good day.","Operator","There are no further questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Sias for closing comments.","Spencer Sias","Thank you.

I want to start by thanking Neil for jumping in for the recently retired Spencer Sias. We'll be replacing Spencer shortly, but thanks, Neil, for leading us through this process this quarter.","Before I start, I want to introduce Gary Bischoping, our new Chief Financial Officer. Some of you have already had a chance to meet Gary. He joined us in early May. So he doesn't have a full quarter under his belt yet. But he's already making an impact, and we're delighted to have him on board. Welcome to the first of what I'm sure will be many quarterly earnings calls, Gary.","Turning to the quarter, we delivered solid progress towards our long-term aspirational goal to touch 6 million cancer patients each year, more than double where we are today. This is predicated on our focused commitment to develop and deploy industry-leading capabilities in developed and emerging markets, while delivering balanced financial results.","In the quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $1.04. Orders for Oncology were up 5% to $708 million in both dollars and in constant currency. Year-to-date, orders were up 6% in dollars and 7% in constant currency. Company-wide revenues were up 3% to $662 million.","We received orders across 10 countries for our new Halcyon treatment system, which was introduced during the quarter. And we booked three orders in proton therapy; two orders for single-room systems, one in the U.S. and one in Thailand; and a multi-room project at the Georgia Proton Therapy Center, Atlanta.","Turning to our Oncology operations, we had solid contributions from all three of our geographies. In the Americas, orders were up 3% in both dollars and constant currency. Highlights include 3% growth in North America, mainly driven by service and software, where we executed multiple competitive software takeouts, and we gained share.","Also in North America, we struck a strategic deal with PetCure to deliver six Halcyon units for a veterinary oncology network. I'll go into more details about Halcyon a little bit later.","In Latin America, orders declined due to challenging macro and political environments.","Looking at EMEA, gross orders rose 2% in dollars and 5% in constant currency. Growth was particularly strong in India where orders more than doubled. We also had robust order growth in Eastern Europe. During the quarter, we booked a $14 million order with a private European medical center in Russia.","In APAC, orders rose by 13% in dollars and in constant currency, with broad-based contributions across the region. In China, we achieved market-leading order growth of more than 30% as our team there continued to do an excellent job establishing Varian as a premier supplier in both the public and private sectors.","In the broader APAC region, we also booked multimillion-dollar orders in Vietnam, South Korea, Thailand and the Philippines. In addition, in Australia, we received orders for five TrueBeam systems from GenesisCare, and for two Halcyon systems from the Icon Group.","Now let me touch on our new product, Halcyon. As we shared with you during our midyear review in New York, Halcyon received a tremendous reception when we unveiled it at the ASTRO show in Vienna in May. We've designed Halcyon to expand the availability of high-quality cancer care to globally, helping to save the lives of millions more cancer patients.","Halcyon is the result of a focused four-year development project to revolutionize clinical workflow by simplifying and enhancing virtually every aspect of image-guided volumetric intensity-modulated radiotherapy. This advanced industry-leading treatment system offers high-quality care, greater ease of use, enhanced patient comfort and lower total cost of ownership.","Its smaller footprint means we now have a solution for older cobalt and tomotherapy bunkers, which are too small to accommodate our other linear accelerator products. We believe there are around 2,000 such bunkers as potential opportunities.","We launched Halcyon with CE approval, which enabled us to immediately sell in Europe and other key markets. Early interest is high and, during the quarter, we booked several orders from countries where we have approval, including Australia, Belgium, India, Morocco, Romania, Russia, Turkey and the United Kingdom.","Just before the close of the third quarter, we received 510(k) approval to market and sell Halcyon in the United States, resulting in several orders in the quarter. Regulatory approvals for China and Japan should follow within the next year. Halcyon is one of the largest new product introductions in our history. Early interest has been strong, and we'll start providing more color on the pacing and impact of the roll-out when we report our fourth quarter results.","Also on the new product front, later this year we expect first patient treatments with our HyperArc module for high-definition brain radiosurgery. This upgrade provides ultra-precise doses that cannot be matched by any other system on the market and has the potential to make a meaningful difference in the fight against cancer.","Turning to software, we ended the quarter with more than 930 RapidPlan licenses at about 440 customer locations. This knowledge-based treatment planning system is making a major contribution to improving the quality and efficiency of radiotherapy treatment planning globally, while also being accretive to our profitability.","Other recent software introductions, such as our InSightive analytics and 360 Oncology systems, continued to gather momentum during the quarter as customers sought to improve workflow in their clinics.","As we announced last week, radiation oncology professionals using Varian's Eclipse treatment planning software created the top-scoring head and neck cancer treatment plans at the 2017 International Radiotherapy Plan Competition. The treatment plan competition is part of the Radiation Knowledge initiative, a cloud-based platform for sharing best practices in the medical radiation field.","The two highest scoring plans and seven of the top 10 plans at the competition were created using Eclipse and employed Volumetric Arc Therapy to target head and neck cancers. The competition attracted more than 460 dosimetrists from around the world, with the goal of sharing the best planning skills to improve radiotherapy plan quality.","Before leaving Oncology Systems, let me call out our service business, which had a 7% increase in global orders in the quarter, supported by an 8% increase in North America. Service continues to be a significant growth driver for our company.","Now let me turn to our Particle Therapy business, which delivered $122 million in orders in the quarter, up $71 million, and revenues of $68 million, up $31 million. Among these orders was the Georgia Proton Therapy Center. We delivered the cyclotron to site earlier this month. And the center plans to start treating patients in 2018.","We also booked orders during the quarter for two ProBeam Compact systems at the University of Pennsylvania and at Thailand's first proton therapy center in Bangkok. Our proton business continues to gather momentum. There are now five proton therapy centers delivering clinical treatments using our equipment. And we're working on a further 14 projects. A number of these projects are due to begin clinical treatments in the next six months.","In addition to the cyclotron installation at Georgia Proton Therapy Center, there were significant milestones at two other projects in June when cyclotrons were delivered to the National Centre for Particle Therapy in Aarhus, Denmark and the Christie Proton Therapy Center in Manchester, England.","Now let me turn to guidance for this fiscal year. And as a reminder, this is non-GAAP and from continuing operations point of view. For the fourth quarter, we believe revenues will be flat to down slightly and for earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.23. For the second through the fourth quarter, we now expect total company revenues to grow in the range of 2% to 3% and for earnings per share to be in the range of $3.08 to $3.16.","Before I turn it over to Gary, I think it's important for me to highlight that this was our first full quarter as a standalone cancer management company, following the successful spinoff of our Imaging Components business in January. Varian is now focused exclusively on expanding our position as the leader in systems and software for the treatment of cancer and other indications. We are increasing our efforts to make the treatment of cancer more effective, affordable and accessible for patients around the world.","Now, I'll hand it over to Gary.","Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Dow, and hello, everyone. As Dow mentioned, this is my first earnings call for Varian and I'm delighted to be here. I've framed my comments today in the context of our long-term focus to drive balanced financial results including growth, profitability and liquidity.","So let me start with growth. We ended the quarter with $3.25 billion in backlog, up 6%, including a 7% increase in Oncology. Backlog adjustments during the quarter were $49 million, bringing net orders for the company to $781 million.","Total revenues were up 3% in dollars and 4% in constant currency. Growth in the quarter was impacted by the lumpiness of our revenues in our proton business. Excluding the revenue from the Georgia Proton deal, revenue was down 4%.","Oncology revenues totaled $594 million, down 2% in dollars and 1% in constant currency. International revenues, which were 51% of Oncology revenues in the quarter, declined 7%.","Oncology revenue growth in the quarter was negatively impacted by increased mix from emerging markets in our backlog. Given emerging markets orders typically take longer to deliver and install, this caused our backlog conversion cycle to lengthen. Year-to-date, Oncology revenues were up 1% in dollars and 2% in constant currency.","Our Particle Therapy business posted revenues of $68 million, almost doubling from a year ago, as the Georgia Proton order contributed $46 million in revenue in the quarter. Year-to-date, revenues were up 37% to $130 million.","Turning to profitability. Total company gross margin increased 18 basis points to 44.5% and year-to-date margins increased 138 basis points to 44%. The improvement in gross margins for both the quarter and year-to-date was supported by increased mix of services, consistent with our long-term strategy.","Oncology Systems gross margin increased by nearly 200 basis points to 48.1% due to higher mix of services revenue as well as ongoing supply chain efficiencies. Year-to-date, Oncology gross margin was up over 200 basis points to 46.4%.","Proton Therapy gross margin for the third quarter was 12.7%, or flat. Year-to-date, Proton gross margin was down nearly 400 basis points due to the ongoing impact of the bankruptcy at Scripps and currency headwinds on our two projects in the UK.","Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter were $117 million, up 2%, driven by investment in new product launches, and flat sequentially, which is 17.6% of revenues.","In the quarter, we invested $55 million in R&D or about 8% of revenues. Operating earnings totaled $123 million or 18.5% of revenue, up 3%, driven by improved mix of services as well as supply chain efficiencies.","Depreciation and amortization was $14.7 million, and $17.6 million on a GAAP basis. Our effective tax rate was 21.5%, reflecting a revenue mix shift to Europe region where tax rates are relatively low. For the fourth quarter, we believe Varian's tax rate will be about 25%.","EPS in the quarter was $1.04, with the Georgia Proton order contributing $0.10 to this. Our diluted share count on the quarter was 92.4 million shares. Year-to-date EPS was $2.51, including the $0.34 impact from the Proton accounts receivable impairment in the first quarter.","Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $658 million and debt of $364 million. Our increased focus on working capital discipline drove a four-day reduction in DSO year-over-year, supported by a significant decline in DSO in our Oncology business.","The reduction in DSO contributed to the $155 million of cash flow from operations we delivered in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date cash flow from operations to $269 million, up $65 million.","In addition to R&D, our other investments in the quarter included $47 million to repurchase 500,000 shares of our stock and $8 million in CapEx. As of the end of the quarter, we had 5.5 million shares remaining under our existing repurchase authorization.","And now we'd like to turn the call over to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Anthony Petrone of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Hey, Anthony.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks. How are you, Dow? And welcome, Gary.","Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Thank you.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Thanks.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for taking the questions. Let me just start off a couple of revenue questions and Halcyon and then one for Gary specifically on margins. The fiscal fourth quarter guide is a little bit off from where we were expecting. And maybe, Dow, you can walk us through if there's any selling day impacts in there and what the read is for Oncology versus proton specifically in fourth quarter. And then, in terms of Halcyon, are you disclosing the specific order number in the quarters overall? And then maybe how is the funnel shaping up as you look out into the second half of the calendar year?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Sure. And I'll tell you I'll start with the second one first, how's that? Talk Halcyon here.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC","Yeah.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Customers and our field team remain very excited. Response has been terrific. People love the features that we've talked about, the fast installation time, the new collimator, the precision that you can get, the lower operating costs, the lower bunker costs. And, as I mentioned in the script, the access to cobalt vaults and tomotherapy vaults. One of the things that we're seeing is the conversion cost from an old vault to a new vault. The cost of putting a Halcyon unit in is much lower than any other system on the market, and that's having a real impact.","We're not disclosing the number on the quarter. We didn't have regulatory approval in the U.S. right to the very end. As I said, we did have orders from 10 countries, including some multi-unit orders. We're very confident about where we are. We feel very optimistic. And we will be disclosing that in Q4 and giving you more kind of unit color Q4.","When we did this with TrueBeam, we had global regulatory approval and we were excited that we get to launch it here at ASTRO here in September. So, that'll be its U.S. \u2013 Americas launch and get to the global customer as well at ASTRO.","But the Halcyon product is going very, very well. You see that a little bit in the order rate. The order rate was very good on the quarter. We're 5% on the quarter with good, strong growth in every one of our regions. And the amazing thing is China did really, really well without Halcyon. So, that'll be in that marketplace probably in about a year's time, as I said on the call.","Yeah. In terms of kind of the revenue issues, I'll talk at a high level about these and Gary can jump in. I'd say we're seeing a couple of things. Number one, the emerging market, so this is BRIC plus everybody else, so this is Latin America, Eastern Europe, China, Southeast Asia, that part of our backlog has grown quite substantially. So, year-over-year, we think it is up 300 basis points year-over-year. And this part of the backlog, I'd say it's taken us three to six months more to convert those into sales. So we are seeing a little bit of that.","I'd say, coming down the end of the quarter, we had a few slip-outs on some U.S. orders, a combination of some operational challenges, a little construction and installation, nothing that spooks us at all. There might be just a touch of folks kind of waiting to see what's happening with Halcyon in there, but I don't think that's the third in the list of three there. But I'd say those are kind of some of the revenue issues that we've got going on.","We did see some of this when we called guidance. So we know we missed our revenue guidance. We thought we could execute through this and between some of the longer emerging market backlog timing, and some of the U.S. pushes to Q4 we had to miss. And we feel very good about where the order rate is landing, continue to feel very positive about the quality of the backlog, still committed to a long-term kind of 5%, 6% growth, and think that that's kind of where it'll land.","In fact, we were looking at trailing 12 months \u2013 our trailing 12-month order and revenue performance is pretty close. Orders performance is 3.4%, revenue performance 2.7%, 2.8%. So those are tracking. We've got to get our heads around across the emerging market, make sure we got a little better visibility to that. We love the profitability that came in on the quarter, and you see that in guidance as well. So, that part was very strong.","And with that, Gary, jump in and...","Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. So the thing I would add, Anthony, to your question on kind of OS and proton, we see Oncology on a revenue basis returning to growth in the fourth quarter, and we do face significant headwinds in the proton business from a year-over-year perspective.","I think the other context I would give you with regard to the guidance is that last \u2013 so prior year, so Q4 2016, our Oncology sales or revenue growth year-on-year was 6%, and so had a good, solid execution there. So it's up against, I would say, a reasonable compare. And I think it's a pragmatic guidance relative to what we see here.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC","And just a follow-up, Gary, and I'll let others hop in, just the Oncology gross margin number, a bit of a surprise to the upside this quarter. Maybe just some of the drivers there and your outlook as you look forward for Oncology gross margins and maybe overall gross operating margin goals for the company next several years. Thanks, again.","Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Sure. Thanks, Anthony. We were very happy with the Oncology margin rate and, honestly, the operating execution inside of that business. And given what we saw on the top line, I think we did a good job of managing through and making the right trade-offs associated with where we're investing and how we drove profitability in the quarter. So I think our execution was very good there.","As it relates to kind of what happened, the dynamics around it, there's about 0.6% of that 48.1% was driven by an excise tax refund. And so, that certainly was part of that over-delivery. And then the services mix increase was another 100 to 150 basis points of that. And so, you have to kind of carve those two things off.","We think we can execute that Oncology gross margin rate in the 44% to 45% range and we think that makes sense relative to being able to then drive our EBIT from 18.5% to, say, 19% to 20% in the near term. So we think good, solid execution in pricing, our ability to get some operating leverage post the Varex spin really make that a realistic number as we think about profitability heading into the fourth quarter.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. And our long-term goal remains, over the next three years, can we get us back to 22% return on sales. So, that remains our long-term goal.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Hazan of Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Hi, Amit.","Amit Hazan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. Thanks, guys. And Gary, welcome. Let me maybe just start actually with longer-term fiscal year 2018 thoughts on the top line, just given some of these new mix issues you're talking about. Is the Oncology backlog growth a good way to still think about where fiscal 2018 growth might go for Oncology revenue? Or does this EM mix issue change kind of our thinking about that backlog being a good number to think about for growth in the next year?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Short version is I think it still remains an outstanding indicator of where we're going to land next year. We do have a little bit of emerging market mix we got to think through and that might mean that the velocity of that portion of the backlog might be a little bit slower. But as an indication of where we're headed, I think it's still an outstanding indicator.","Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. As Dow stated earlier, our trailing 12 months orders rate relative to our trailing 12 months revenue rate in the Oncology business track pretty much right on top of each other. So you may see some lumpiness in any given quarter, but our ability to execute through that emerging market increased mix, which is a great thing for growth and top line, we'll execute our way through that.","Amit Hazan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And just to clarify, that push out related to the emerging market mix, you didn't see anything in terms of its units adjusting out of backlog because of that? It's just pure delays in the recognition of revenues of those orders?","Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. That's correct. And the adjustments we saw in backlog are well within historical norms.","Amit Hazan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah. And then just one question, Gary, just you coming on. Just asking the question about what you've seen so far at the company and in particular what your views are on things like capital allocation going forward? Share repurchases have been, obviously, a key to this company for a while now. How you view that? And generally, just balance sheet risk and taking on, for example, the financed proton deal, do you view these things similar to how they've gone or what's your take on some of that?","Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","So, look, I've been really impressed with the board and our operators of this business. I think the board is engaged at the right level and helping us drive strategy forward. And the management team and its ability to execute and take advantage of the pure play cancer treatment platform that we have today is real. And so I'm excited to be part of the team with the fight against cancer and to take advantage of that opportunity I think we have in the marketplace.","As it relates to capital allocation, I would tell you that we are going to balance the need for financial flexibility with returning excess cash to shareholders over time. I think that's prudent. And if you think about being in the capital allocation business we are in today and the strategic opportunities we have in front of us, financial flexibility is going to be valuable. And so we'll make sure we keep that balance in place as we move through time.","Amit Hazan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And the proton piece?","Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Oh, yes. Sorry.","Amit Hazan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","You financing that deal?","Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. On the proton side, I come from Dell and they have a capital finance company. I think my view here early days in the proton business is we look very hard at the cash flows of that over a long period of time. It is a long duration business. That asset's going to be in place for a long time. And so you have to think about the risk of that asset over a very long period of time and look at those cash flows.","And then we have to score that risk. And I think we do a pretty good job of scoring that risk and evaluating cash flows over time. Will it be lumpy from here to there? Yes, it will. I think it will. But, again, I think we do a nice job of scoring that risk and looking at long-term cash flows to evaluate go or no-go on those business decisions.","Amit Hazan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. I'll jump back in queue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson of Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you. Good afternoon, guys.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Hi, Jeff.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, Dow and Gary. So, just wondering on, I guess, the proton business to start. One of your single-room European proton competitors recently had to lower their outlook and push out some timing of delivery on some deals in that. Have you guys recently scrubbed your proton backlog or anything from a delivery schedule standpoint we should be thinking about with your proton business?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. The short version is we scrub it every day. And there's no change. I mean, these are big projects. You got to stay all over it. I think we've got an exceptional team doing that for us. And there are movements all the time, but we're not seeing anything systematic the way, I believe it was IBA, reported in their last call.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Sorry. The only thing I would add to that is, we have seen delivering on what we said we're going to do. We've delivered some cyclotrons here recently, as Dow just stated. We're happy with progress at Georgia Proton Therapy Center and our ability to compete in those smaller roll-outs. So I think we're executing well against the backlog we have in place.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Understood. And Gary, you quantified the Emory or the Georgia Proton at $0.10 in the quarter. Did some of that benefit get caught up in tax rate? I think that's how it flowed through last time with \u2013 I'm blanking on the other deal with the one in Baltimore. I just want to make sure I'm not double counting, because your tax rate came in a couple hundred basis points lower than we were expecting. But I think some of that might have been tied to the Emory deal. I just want to make sure I'm understanding your tax rate at 21.5% on the quarter.","Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","The tax rate on that is very low. So, that $0.10 is obviously after taxes, and there was an immaterial amount of taxes on that revenue and profitability...","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","If not for Emory, your tax rate, your ETR probably would have been closer to what everyone on the Street was looking for at 23.5% or 23.5%?","Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Correct. That's the correct way to think about it. Yes.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then, Dow, as I think about your revenue guidance, I know Anthony asked this a little bit. But last quarter, you were guiding to 3% to 5%, now it's to 2% to 3%. You also got a couple hundred basis-point impact here from \u2013 benefit from Emory. Currency probably is working in your favor. So is it really just kind of the push out of these emerging market deliveries? Is that really \u2013 it just seems like there's a decent sized impact there that changed the guidance once we put Emory and currency in there. So, just wondering if there's anything else impacting timing on deliveries or anything else with revenue.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. The good guy was Emory. The actual that we do have a difference on currency. We actually think that's a point to the bad for us, it doesn't. It's not a good guy for us. It's about a point the other way. And then the other two, maybe three that we got that I mentioned briefly on the call is this growth in our emerging market backlog and, as I said, that's about a three- to six-month longer cycle to revenue than, say, our U.S. backlog.","Second, we did see in the quarter a little bit of U.S. backlog push out, just call it four, five units, at the end of the quarter. And then, this one is anecdotal and it's tough to quantify, but I do think we have a little bit of folks doing some look-see on Halcyon and what should I think, how did I play this. And the good news is the order rate is chugging along right where we'd like it to be, and we feel good about that. And we feel great about the Halcyon introduction and where it's going. And we might have a little bit of that kind of globally.","So, having said that, it didn't pause anything in China for two seconds. They had a banner quarter and we feel really good about our China team and what they're doing. We're seeing success in both the public market and the private market, and just really establishing our leadership position in China.","Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","And just to put a finer point on the currency side, currency in the quarter is probably $10 million, $12 million, $15 million of a revenue headwind, given our exposure in the euro, sterling and yen, broadly speaking.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. And I guess my comment, I'm sorry, just to conclude, was the change in currency from maybe last time you updated guidance to this time, I think there's been a positive move since. But I agree, year-over-year in my model it's going to be negative in 4Q as well. So, no, I appreciate that. Thanks, guys.","Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yes.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brandon Henry of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to touch on this lengthening backlog to revenue conversion issue in emerging markets, because I've always thought that EM orders are taking longer to convert to revenue than U.S. orders. So is it just a mix issue in terms of you're seeing a higher EM mix, or are you actually seeing lengthening in the backlog to revenue conversion in emerging markets itself?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","It's pure mix. Yeah, we're not seeing that. As I said, we're seeing about 300 basis point increase year-over-year in our emerging market portion of the backlog. And as that flows through \u2013 it's flowing through a little I guess just a bigger mix. We're not seeing any lengthening of the emerging market transition to revenue.","Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then can you walk us through how we should be thinking about the ramp for the launch of Halcyon versus the previous TrueBeam launch? Is the TrueBeam a good proxy for Halcyon, kind of why or why not? And then also how do you think the Halcyon launch may impact this backlog to revenue conversion? Might it actually improve that for emerging markets?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","What we like about Halcyon is it's going to improve it operationally. A site still has to be ready. Money's still got to be there. And in some of these emerging markets, that does take a little bit longer. But once the equipment's shipped, its installation today is six to eight weeks, three months sometimes in emerging markets, and we should go to two weeks with Halcyon. So, it's a little bit all over the map in these emerging markets. I'd say, on average, we're going to get a two, three week reduction in installation cycle time. So, that should help a lot.","I think in terms of how to think about the overall ramp, we think that this is going to be very significant. TrueBeam was replacing a product line. So it got a lot of price. It got a lot of share. What's interesting about Halcyon is it doesn't just replace a product line. So we're really trying to drive incremental growth with it. We've talked about some of these markets, the cobalt replacement market, the old crusty linac market, whether it's other brands or our own, tomotherapy vaults that we can't fit in. This can go in every one of those.","We're seeing a big uptick in the development of emerging market cancer plans. And so governments are getting together. And it's a little bit like the Brazil thing we saw three years ago. And governments are kind of saying, wow, how do we get 5 centers, 4 centers, 10 centers, 50 centers. I'd say we've got conversations like that happening in a number of places. And they love Halcyon because I think the thing that I didn't point out in the call that we should point to is the operator efficiency and the patient creature comforts are outstanding on this product, and the ability to implement it and execute quickly is really good.","And then the other factor is these emerging market governments, they're looking at high-throughput cancer centers, and this product is designed with that in mind. The imaging portion alone is four times faster than historical. And you look at the kind of treatment times, we're easily going to be able to meet the kind of volume requirements for patients per day that these markets have. So, Brandon, we will give you a lot more visibility on that next quarter. We feel very good about where we are. The uptick has been nice. We're very optimistic about where things are going.","I think TrueBeam as a comparison is a good one. Having said that, it's not perfect because one's a little more \u2013 Halcyon isn't replacing TrueBeam. We very much see TrueBeam in our market for people that want the most flexible, the best SBRT product in the world. TrueBeam is it for people that are looking for a little higher-throughput, bread-and-butter go, go, go. Halcyon is the game. We love the new collimator on the product, a much more precise product. And of course, the simplicity is really going to drive it.","You asked about the funnel. I'd say the funnel is very robust. We're excited about that both from a market point of view and a share point of view. So I think we're optimistic about the Halcyon funnel.","Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And just one last question for me. ASTRO has recently released their proposal for episodic or kind of bundled payments. And in that proposal, they talk about eliminating the reimbursement differential for various modalities for radiation oncology. So can you talk about your expectations for the timing of that program to start? And then how are you thinking about a potential similar reimbursement for the different modalities? How will that impact Varian's business, and specifically, proton therapy, which I think has historically had a premium reimbursement? Thanks.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","I think you've seen a month ago, four weeks ago, CMS published their guidelines for this next year. I'd say that had a very little change. So, at least as we see it executing for kind of fiscal year 2018, we don't see much change in the reimbursement scenario.","Longer term, I think we've been pretty consistent about this. We think that there will be some bundling options that are put forth. It'll be interesting to see how those go. We have not had any negative feedback from customers in the U.S. as to the reimbursable model they're seeing from CMS here recently. So, at least as it's impacted our comp outlook here and over the next year we don't see much change.","As to the long-term, how does value-based pricing impact radiation therapy? I'd just point out that that's how we compete in every other market in the world, and we compete on a very good basis. Radiation therapy remains one of the most cost-effective approaches to cancer care. The economics of radiation therapy are very favorable at that level.","It is how we compete outside of the U.S. Change is always the hard part. And when that change comes, I have no doubt there will be some hesitation in the marketplace as people kind of figure out what the new models mean. But I think, in the long-term, it actually is a positive for radiation therapy.","Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","And oh, by the way, the other factor in there is it will also \u2013 the trends to shorter fractionation, SBRT, SRS will continue. And that's a share opportunity for us because we're one of the best in that game.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks. Maybe first on just the revenue outlook. Dow, I want to make sure you're not factoring any sort of change in sentiment on just the hospital CapEx front. I know on the relative pecking order of issues you called out that that wasn't really listed there, but any sort of change in behavior around ACA?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","None whatsoever. Haven't seen or heard a whisper on that.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then, on the Halcyon front.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Other than a lot of noise coming out of Washington. We could talk about that for a long time. But our customers are head down, plowing ahead.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then, on the Halcyon front, I know it's early days but any preliminary color you can give us on just cobalt swap outs versus older other linacs. And any thoughts on TrueBeam cannibalization at this point?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","I'd say here early on, cobalt may be the couple. I'd say we're still very early. I'd say, when we look at our funnel, there's a whole bunch in the funnel. So we feel very good about that.","We also have kind of the interesting thing here is we're working very hard with some international organizations, like the World Health Organization, the UN, the International Atomic Energy Agency. They have historically made recommendations for emerging markets about radiation therapy. Their historical recommendation in these really cost-constrained markets has been for cobalt.","Well, there was a news article this last week. As Mosul slipped hands three or four times, there was a cobalt unit that could have been used for evil and fortunately wasn't. Anyway, we are seeing some increased, what should I call it, policy momentum in these organizations to move away from cobalts. And I think Halcyon is enabling that conversation, so we're excited about that.","I think, in terms of TrueBeam cannibalization, I alluded to it, I think it's anecdotal at this point. I'd say we haven't \u2013 there might be a little bit of it going on out there as customers kind of evaluate, especially while they didn't have regulatory approval. The good news is, in Europe and in the U.S., we move very quickly to regulatory approval. But I think where we are, given the configuration mix in the U.S., we just want to sell more of both.","And I think that's \u2013 the U.S. impact in the long-term should be negligible. Do we have a little bit of folks hesitating in the short-term? Maybe. Maybe that was a little bit some of our issue here in Q3. But I'm confident that this is really a nice play for us.","The other thing that's kind of interesting in the U.S. market is there's a lot of single vault customers out there. And historically, these are older units. We've talked a lot about them on this call before. These are hard to change out because often times they don't have high volumes, call it 25 to 40 patients a day. And swapping out that equipment has meant two or three weeks of de-installation, five or six weeks of new equipment coming in. So a customer is looking at two to three months of transition time. Well, if I'm a private radiation oncologist, my patients have to go somewhere else, and do I get them back? So our customers have been very worried about making that transition.","One of the things that Halcyon gives us is a capability for our customers to do that window and they can plan their treatments around it. So, all of a sudden they don't have this decision process to kind of think through oh, no, am I going to lose my patients. We can do it quickly enough that they can get the new equipment in, get re-commissioned, and back to treating patients without having to send their patients elsewhere.","So I'd say we haven't seen that yet, so we've got a bunch of that in the funnel. So, that's some of the incremental opportunity that we'll be looking at as we roll forward here.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then was the veterinary one-off? I mean that's not a channel we've thought about for you guys before with PetCure.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","I don't think it's a one-off. I think there's more of it out there. I saw a number, I don't remember it, but there's like 600,000 pets in San Francisco and 60,000 children. And so, one population is growing more than the other. We're excited about this. It's the first six \u2013 this isn't going to be what drives our business, but I do think there's some incremental opportunity there. And we're very excited to be partners with PetCure. And it is interesting, the statistics. There's 180 million pets in the U.S., and 12 million diagnosed with cancer, which happens to be almost exactly the same number of patients that are diagnosed with cancer in the U.S.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then you made the comment about commitment to 5% to 6% revenue growth before. Just in light of the commentary you also made on the order book, can you just help us get comfortable with that acceleration? Because that's a level you haven't really grown at on an annual basis since...","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","I did say it's aspirational. That's where we want to go. When you look at our 12 months trailing, what was it, Gary, 3.5%, 4%?","Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","3%.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","3% 12 months trailing. You look at the last three quarters, a little north of that, we've got new product. So, that's kind of what we're driving to. I think that we've got the usual clouds on the horizon in terms of reimbursement in the U.S. We talked about FXs. We've had other times when we've done really well but had to give a lot of it back in FX.","So there's some risk. But, aspirationally, we've got \u2013 as we were in New York, we talked about our software opportunity, can we grow that over five years to a $900 million business. We've got good \u2013 our portfolio has never been broader, never been deeper. Halcyon opening up some new market that we think is incremental. It's going to take us a while to execute on that, but that's where we're driving to.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. I'll leave it at that. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Joel Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. It's actually Joel in for Isaac.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Hey, Joel.","Joel Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey. How's it going? Maybe one for Dow. Could we just talk about the additional channel reach you think is necessary to effectively market Halcyon, just given the geographic mix that you're targeting? And then maybe just if you could parse out that operational reach by region?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","I think we're in really good shape. I mean we have over the last three, four years, we've made significant investments in China, in India, in Brazil. We've also invested very heavily in a market development resource and government affairs. A lot of these opportunities are government opportunities. So, as we look at these markets, one of the things we're encouraged by is, at least at this point, I don't think I have to go out and make a big sales investment. I think we've got pretty good coverage. And for where these markets are, we're in pretty good shape.","Joel Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. And then maybe one for Gary. You've had a few months under the hood. And if we think about non-operational items, tax rate, hedging, are there any low-hanging fruit you could identify that you think are ripe for improvement? And then maybe how we should be thinking about the phasing of those initiatives?","Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. I would tell you that it's working capital is the opportunity. And our ability to \u2013 thinking about capitalizing on Halcyon and the working capital benefit of time to value for our customers and our patients as well as in our balance sheet.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Along with some just good old execution.","Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","And that coupled with I think working our way through the right amount of detail and rigor as we think about interacting with our customers day-in and day-out to make it easier for them to take a bill from us and turn that into an actual payment. So it's good old fashioned execution on the working capital line I think is our biggest opportunity after I've been under the hood here for 90 days.","Joel Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And then maybe just a last one for me from a macro perspective. You made some comments that U.S. CapEx for your customers remains stable. Any color outside of U.S. in terms of CapEx demand?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","I haven't seen any data, so this will be a little bit from the hip. I'd say we haven't seen \u2013 maybe a little bit of change in Japan. That market's been tough. And otherwise I'd say kind of Brazil \u2013 I don't know if that's a change. It's kind of been that way for the last three or four quarters, so I don't know that Brazil is a change. That market remains tough. But otherwise I'd say pretty stable.","Joel Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sean Lavin of BTIG. Please proceed with your question.","Ryan Zimmerman - BTIG LLC","Great. This is actually Ryan Zimmerman on for Sean. Can you hear me okay?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Hi, Ryan.","Ryan Zimmerman - BTIG LLC","Great. Just you called out China as an area of growth this quarter, but competitors that we've followed in the space have struggled I think to really gain orders in that market and it's delayed their growth in subsequent quarters. And I'm just curious if you can expand on what you're seeing in China. And you talked about it a little bit, but how sensitive are you to the tender process? And what the opportunity looks like going forward, given how large of an opportunity China could be just from an Oncology standpoint?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","The market remains very good. I like to think of this at a very high level. And when you look at the percent of patients in China that are treated with radiation, it's less than 20%. In U.S. and Western Europe, it's between 50% and 60%. So, that's where I like to start. There's a huge need.","And then when you start thinking about it in terms of kind of urban China versus rural China, that's a description of urban China and rural China hasn't even been touched yet. So we are optimistic of our position in all segments. We've worked very hard to kind of get a leading market share in both. We've historically been a leader in the private market and we're working very hard to be a leader in the public market. We're now established leadership in both markets. And we feel very good about that position.","So, in terms of the market, I'd say the market and long-term trends are very positive. It is a market that every now and then, what, it was two, two-and-a-half years ago, we had this reform hiccup where they went quiet for a quarter or two while they retooled their purchasing processes due to some anti-kickback issues that they had had in other sectors in healthcare, not in radiation therapy. That impacted everybody, of course.","Every now and then when political change happens and chairs rotate, we see a little bit of delay. But I'd say, when you kind of look at trailing 12 months, it's been strong double-digit growth and we feel pretty good about that as being the market. Might we have a quarter or two where things slow down, that could always happen, but our funnel remains very robust in China. We got a very good team over there and feel very good about where the team is, getting deeper and broader and I believe worked hard to establish share leadership in that market, and now have it and are looking to leverage it as that market builds out its cancer capability.","And I think, oh by the way, this is worth a reminder. Halcyon is built in China. And we got to get through the regulatory process but we think that also sets us up very nicely for kind of the next inning of this game in that market.","Ryan Zimmerman - BTIG LLC","Appreciate the color there, Dow. And then just lastly for me and I'll hop back in queue. You had a multi-system order with Georgia Proton Center. And then you had two single-room orders. And just thinking ahead on terms of customer demand for proton, I mean how should we think about the balance between, say, single-room centers versus multi-room centers? And what customers prefer maybe on a broader basis for proton therapy centers would be helpful.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. Market is clearly moving down-market. It's interesting. There are some sovereign governments, China, Western Europe. I think they have much more rationalized governmental health systems. And so, they'll do some of these big, large multi-room centers. But I think the U.S. market with maybe this Georgia exception and a few others, it's going to be one and two room treatment centers.","Protons remains very interesting clinically. The benefit of the physics behind the proton remain very exciting for our customers and matters. There's some debate about in what percent of cancers does it matter in, but I think it's safe to say that somewhere between 15% and 20% of all cancers can really benefit from proton physics and we're going to see that kind of come into the marketplace.","When you look at the financial modeling on these one and two room centers, it's so much easier. It is really difficult to financially pencil out these really, really large centers. And certainly, we've seen that in some of ours and in the broader market as well. So I think the U.S. market is clearly moving to one and two room centers, and we'll see a lot less of that in the future. And so we're excited about these.","University of Pennsylvania, the order we booked this last quarter, one of the leaders in the world in proton therapy, to have them kind of give us a vote of confidence is a real boost to our position and talks about the credibility of our single room product. And then, to have this other one in Thailand talks about the scope and scale of Varian, the ability of us to deliver in those markets.","Ryan Zimmerman - BTIG LLC","Appreciate you taking the question. Thank you.","Operator","Our final question comes from Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. A couple of quick questions here. Maybe on this proton therapy, the Georgia, Atlanta orders and revenue rec. I got a bunch of questions from people asking, did you recognize I guess the Atlanta Proton revenues in the Q? I guess the question was, it looks like the installation was completed in July, so was there any criteria in recognizing revenues in June? So there's some confusion. If you can clarify, I think that would be great.","Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Sure. This is Gary. We are on a percent of completion basis accounting for our proton business. And based on the percentage of completion of that project, in the third quarter we booked $46 million in revenue and the associated costs with that.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","That's helpful, Gary. And welcome to the earnings call.","Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Thank you.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Just maybe on, I guess, follow up to that question was gross margin strength in the quarter. I know when you do these installations, a lot of the costs are incurred up front. Did these revenues just slow down? Is that possible one as the explanation for this strength in gross margin being in the Q because there were no costs associated with it?","Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","No. We recognize the cost and revenue on a percentage completion basis. And so there's the appropriate amount of costs booked relative to the revenue for the percentage completion of that project at that point in time. So, $46 million of revenue did not drop to the bottom line. There was associated cost with that.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","I guess maybe continuing on with that, I guess what were the drivers on the gross margin strength? And I apologize if you answered this before. I just hopped on.","Gary E. Bischoping - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Sure. In Oncology, I would say there's kind of a couple of things. So we've seen certainly benefits around our supply chain efficiencies. That's certainly a very favorable driver. And we've seen that kind of increase as you look throughout the year. That's been a steady increase in the Oncology business. And I think good, solid pricing discipline has been good.","We did in the quarter get an excise tax refund that accounted for about 0.6 percentage points of that increase we saw in Oncology, up to 48.1%. And then we also saw favorability in our services mix as a percent of revenue. And that's about 100 to 150 basis points of that favorability we saw. So we're happy with progress and our ability to manage cost and good pricing discipline in the market as we move through the whole year in the Oncology business.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Got you. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thanks, gentlemen. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Dow Wilson for closing remarks.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, operator. I think there's four key takeaways that everybody should think about today. First and foremost, we're the market leader. We now have the strongest portfolio of product offerings in our history, evidenced by our successful launch of Halcyon. This positions us very well as we execute against our long-term aspirational goal to touch 6 million cancer patients each year, more than double where we are today.","Second, Varian's focused with our successful spinoff of Varex this year. We're now focused exclusively on extending our position as a leader in systems and software for the treatment of cancer and other indications.","Third, we're optimally positioned to grow in both developed and emerging markets, supported by our new product offerings and rapidly growing service and software businesses.","And fourth, we have the discipline to drive profitable growth and improve liquidity, both of which strengthen our financial flexibility so that we can continue to invest in growth opportunities.

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and a replay can be accessed on the Varian Investor website at www.varian.com\/investors.","Now, I'll turn it over to J. Michael Bruff, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.","Michael Bruff","Thank you, Dana. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Varian\u2019s third quarter conference call. Joining me today on the call are Varian's President and Chief Executive Officer, Dow Wilson; and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Bischoping. Dow will share his thoughts on our results and long-term strategy, and Gary will cover our operating and financial results in more detail. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions.","On the Varian Investor Relations website, you can find our fiscal third quarter press release and earnings presentation, which are intended to provide additional perspective and details. A webcast of this call and any accompanying non-GAAP reconciliations are available on our website at www.varian.com\/investorrs. Unless otherwise stated, all financial results discussed are non-GAAP. All references to EPS are to net earnings per diluted share. All growth rates are year-over-year, and any references to orders are gross orders. All periods referred to are fiscal periods unless otherwise stated, and all references to the trailing 12 months refer to the trailing 12 months ending on the last day of our most recently completed fiscal quarter.","The results announced today include the preliminary impact of our recent acquisition of CyberHeart, which closed early in the quarter and Endocare, Alicon and Cancer Treatment Services International or CTSI, which all closed in June.","During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections and other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our results could differ materially because of factors discussed in today's earnings release, this conference call and our SEC filings. We do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement.","And with that, I'm pleased to turn it over to Dow for his comments.","Dow Wilson","Thanks, Mike and thank you everyone for joining us. Today, I'll share the key milestones we achieved this past quarter, and how they have contributed to our long term strategy. Our core remains strong and we're pleased to see continued momentum in the second half of 2019. We're investing in innovation and future growth opportunities, both organically and through acquisitions, and that together are designed to accelerate our execution to be a broad based cancer solutions company.","First, let me touch on our third quarter performance. Total company revenues increased 16% to $826 million. Oncology revenues grew 19% to $793 million, driven by double digit growth in all geographies and strength across our portfolio. Proton revenues were $31 million, down 26%. Operating earnings increased 22% to $144 million or 17.5% of revenues, including a $15 million gross impact from tariffs. GAAP earnings per share was $0.32, which includes a $51 million impairment charge to proton goodwill. Gary will discuss the details of this charge in his section. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.32 was up 26%. Cash flows from operations were $130 million, up $28 million due to increased operating profit and strong collection momentum in our oncology business. This quarter, we closed the acquisitions of CyberHeart, CTSI, Endocare and Alicon. ","Now, let me provide some additional color on the quarter. In terms of our long term growth and value creation strategy, we made progress across our three growth priorities. First, strengthening our leadership in radiation therapy. Based on public findings, the radiation therapy market grew 11% on an orders basis over the trailing 12 months ending in March 2019 and we grew our worldwide market share by a percentage point during that period.","In our oncology business, orders grew 2% in the quarter and 11% in the trailing 12 months. Our worldwide net installed base of 8,412 units grew 366 units or 5%. This robust growth in our installed base drives future recurring software and services revenues. [indiscernible] revenues grew 31%, driven by our TrueBeam and Halcyon platforms. Halcyon orders grew over 150% to 46 in the quarter, of which 60% were taken in emerging markets. We have taken 284 orders of Halcyon since its May 2017 launch. The success of Halcyon has been driven by its unique treatment capabilities, smaller size and lower power consumption requirements. These capabilities have driven greenfield orders, access to smaller vaults, competitive takeouts and general market demand. Ofuna Chuo Hospital and Herlev University Hospital delivered the first Halcyon system treatments in Japan and Denmark respectively. The global installed base for Halcyon is now 90 systems. ","The development of our artificial intelligence driven multi-modality adaptive radiotherapy suite is progressing well. In anticipation of market introduction, we recently announced the formation of our Adaptive Intelligence Consortium. This consortium will lead clinical trials to develop evidence based clinical protocols for Varian\u2019s planned adaptive radiotherapy solution. The solution will incorporate MR, Tad, CT image information via the form of image registration and artificial intelligence algorithms. This should be the most cost effective, versatile and workflow efficient solution for on-couch adaptive therapy and will be ideal for an alternative payment model or APM value based care environment.","On the software front, revenues grew 23%, driven by continued adoption of our recently launched software solutions. Orders for HyperArc, our high definition radiotherapy solution for stereotactic radiosurgery or SRS grew ho double digits in the quarter. We have taken 263 orders since launch in over 40 countries. Orders for Eclipse MCO, our multi criteria optimization planning software, grew over 50% and we have now received nearly 1100 MCO orders in 46 countries. ","Our services revenues grew 4% to $277 million, driven by our growing installed base. In our approach on solutions business, we took three orders totaling $188 million in the quarter. We were selected by Radiumhospitalet, part of Oslo University Hospital and Haukeland University Hospital Bergen to equip each center in Norway with a ProBeam multi-room system. Additionally, we were selected by Shandong Cancer Hospital in China to equip its new multi-room proton clinical research center with the ProBeam Proton Therapy system. The Shandong order includes our ARIA oncology information management system and Eclipse treatment planning software. We now have a total of 79 proton rooms under contract across 26 sites globally. 35 rooms are currently operational, including 5 rooms which were handed over to clinical operations this quarter. The pipeline for our proton business is healthy and we continue to make progress on installations. We installed cyclotrons at Biopolis in Singapore and King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand.","In October last year, we announced the formation of the FlashForward Consortium to study potentially groundbreaking ultra-high dose rate cancer treatments with protons. This quarter, we signed a strategic cooperation framework agreement with Shandong Cancer Hospital for proton therapy clinical application and research, the first center in China to join the consortium. We also had a successful show at the Particle Therapy Cooperative Group Conference in Manchester with record breaking attendance at our FlashForward Consortium Users Meeting and Symposium.","Our second growth priority is to extend our global footprint. In EMEA, this was the eighth consecutive quarter of double digit orders growth on a constant currency basis, driven by outstanding performance in India, the Middle East and Africa. In India, we booked initial orders for two linear accelerators and two brachytherapy systems as part of the Tata Trust Framework agreement. And our Middle East and Africa region continued strong close collaboration with Aga Khan Charity in Pakistan, led to four TrueBeam orders, two each at sites in Karachi, Pakistan and RSLM, Tanzania.","In China, our second largest market, key wins at Guangzhou Concord Cancer and Shandong Tumor Hospital fueled strong double digit growth. We took five Halcyon orders during the quarter, bringing the total to 8 in China since receiving regulatory approval last November.","Finally, our third growth priority is to expand into other addressable markets. With the acquisition of CyberHeart, we entered the ventricular tachycardia or VTAC market, which is expected to be a $1.4 billion market by 2028. The acquisition of intellectual property enables Varian to innovate in the space of cardiac radioablation. Varian is building a team and portfolio solution to address the VTAC market opportunity. We anticipate conducting clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy for necessary regulatory clearances.","In June, we announced the closing of our CTSI acquisition, which is an important step in addressing the growing global cancer burden and the human capital gap through innovation of new multidisciplinary solutions and provision of services as well as enhanced access to patient data for artificial intelligence and deep learning algorithm creation. CTSI operates the American Oncology Institute comprised of 11 cancer centers in India, and CTSI Oncology Solutions are technology enabled services business, supplying over 7000 treatment plans globally each year.","Data published in Lancet Oncology suggests that the world will need an additional 3000 radiation oncology centers, 22,000 linear accelerators and 150,000 skilled clinicians by 2035 for radiation oncology alone. CTSI will unlock global access to high quality patient care. Our company entered the interventional oncology market with the acquisitions of Austin, Texas based Endocare and Hangzhou China based Alicon to add cryoablation and microwave ablation therapies to our portfolio.","Subsequently, we signed an asset purchase agreement to acquire Boston Scientific\u2019s portfolio of drug loadable microsphere and bland embolic bead products. The interventional oncology market is expected to grow from $860 million this year to $1.1 billion in 2022. These acquisitions serve as the first step in creating a comprehensive interventional oncology platform that includes a consumables business and leverages Varian\u2019s unique software expertise.","We're also pleased that Tennessee Oncology selected Varian to implement Noona, a software application for managing patient symptoms and capturing patient reported outcomes in cancer care. As part of this collaboration, Noona will be deployed at more than 30 centers across Tennessee with the goal of reaching approximately 25,000 patients this year. In the past two months alone, 10,000 patients have been enrolled into the use of Noona. Noona was also chosen by the State of Michigan as the vendor for their statewide symptom management and patient reported outcome initiative. Once deployed across 19 centers, Noona will reach close to 60,000 new cancer cases per year. Last week, the first patient was enrolled at Henry Ford Health System.","Overall, we're pleased with the progress we made in the third quarter. We remain dedicated to providing patients and clinicians around the world with intelligent cancer care solutions.","With that, I'll turn it over to Gary, who will provide more context on the third quarter financial results.","Gary Bischoping","Thanks, Dow. As always, I will frame my comments in the context of our long term growth and value creation strategy, which includes balancing growth, profitability and liquidity. So let me start with growth. Companywide revenues were 826 million in the third quarter, up 16% in dollars and 19% in constant currency. One small correction to a prior comment Dow made, our software growth rate was 24% year-on-year.","Recent acquisitions of CTSI, Endocare and Alicon contributed revenues of 4.8 million in the quarter. For segment reporting, CTSI will be consolidated in Oncology Systems and Endocare and Alicon will be reported under our other segment.","In oncology, revenues were 793 million, up 19% in dollars and 22% in constant currency, driven by double digit growth in all geographies and strength across our portfolio. Tariffs had a 150 basis point negative impact on the growth rate. On a trailing 12 month basis, revenues grew 12% in dollars and 14% in constant currency. CTSI contributed 2.8 million in revenues in the quarter.","Orders were 778 million, up 2% in dollars and 4% in constant currency. On a trailing 12 month basis, orders grew 11% in dollars and 13% in constant currency. We ended the quarter with 2.9 billion in backlog, up 7%. In the Americas, revenues grew 19%, was 22% in North America. Orders were 357 million, down 1%. On a trailing 12 month basis, orders grew 6%, including 19 million in orders for six TrueBeam systems and associated software from the Veterans Affairs Medical Centers.","In our Europe, Middle East, India and Africa geography, revenues grew 23%. Orders were 281 million, up 8% and 13% in constant currency. On a trailing 12 month basis, orders grew 13%. Asia Pacific revenues grew 11% in dollars. Tariffs had a negative impact on the growth rate of 80 [ph] percentage points. Orders were 140 million, down 1% and grew 1% in constant currency, driven by weakness in Japan, Australia and Southeast Asia, offset by strong double digit growth in China.","On a trailing 12 month basis, orders grew 22% with double digit growth in all sub regions. Our proton solutions business posted revenues of 31 million in the quarter, down 26%. Services revenues of 5 million grew 44%. Three orders were taken in the quarter, totaling 108 million. ","Turning to profitability. Total company gross margin of 42.9% of revenues decreased 160 basis points. This included a negative impact from tariffs of 130 basis points, with the remainder driven by product and geographical mix. Our trailing 12 month gross margin rate was 42.4%, down 150 basis points. This included a negative impact from tariffs of 100 basis points.","Oncology gross margin rate was 43.9%, down 210 basis points. This included negative impact from tariffs of 130 basis points, with the remaining difference driven by product and geographical mix. System pricing at the region level remains relatively stable. Looking at proton solutions, gross margin dollars were 5 million. As Dow mentioned, we took a 51 million goodwill impairment for our proton business. Our aspirational goal to achieve near term breakeven earnings for the proton business is impacted by slower than expected order volumes, notwithstanding three orders in the third quarter. We revise our growth expectation based on the current market, resulting in lower evaluation which triggered a non-cash charge to fully impair the proton goodwill.","Even with the market recalibration, we intend to grow our market share for the proton business. We remain committed to proton therapy as an important treatment modality in cancer care, complementary to our oncology portfolio, and we continue to invest in Flash technology. Investments will continue to be a key driver of our long term growth and value creation strategy. We invested 62 million in R&D, which is up 4% at 7.5% of revenues. SG&A expenses were 148 million, up 7% at 17.9% of revenues, down 150 basis points. ","Company operating earnings were 144 million, up 22% at 17.5% of revenues, up 80 basis points. This included a negative impact from tariffs of 160 basis points, more than offset by tariff mitigation execution and operating expense leverage. On a trailing 12 month basis, operating earnings increased 6%, at 16.6% of revenues, down 80 basis points. This included a negative impact from tariffs of 120 basis points.","Turning to taxes, our GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 50.9% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 18.5%. The lower tax rate in the third quarter is driven by a lapse in statutes in various jurisdictions. GAAP EPS was $0.32, our non-GAAP EPS was $1.32 with diluted share count of 91.8 million shares in the quarter.","Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of 523 million and 401 million in debt. Cash flows from operations were 130 million, up 28 million due to increased operating profit and strong collection momentum in our oncology business. Oncology DSO decreased to 105 days from 106 days in the quarter. In addition to R&D, other investments in the quarter included $19 million in CapEx and 49 million to repurchase shares of our stock. As of the end of the quarter, we had 2.5 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.","I'll now turn it back over to Dow.","Dow Wilson","Thanks, Gary. And just a brief clarification on proton orders before we continue, I read $188 million of third quarter proton orders, dyslexic moment, it was $108 million. It is stated correctly in the financial information and as Gary said in his section.","Before I discuss guidance, I want to comment on a couple of recent announcements. On July 8, the US Trade Representative announced a retroactive tariff exclusion on multi-leaf collimators sourced from China. We expect the fiscal year 2019 gross tariff impact to reduce by approximately $5 million. Also on July 10, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services or CMS announced a proposed radiation oncology payment bundle intended to test an episodic payment structure across a cohort of US hospitals and freestanding cancer centers. ","At Varian, we've long anticipated the transition to a value based care environment, our innovations over the past decade such as TrueBeam, Halcyon, Bravos, HyperArc, RapidPlan and numerous other innovations combined with our recent acquisition of CTSI provide solutions designed to be the most efficient and effective delivery systems, driving outstanding quality and return on investment as the clear leader in the market and with over 1.5 million patients treated with SRS now SBRT, we are poised to help guide customers in implementing a value based care environment. ","As the proposed rule enters the comment period and additional data regarding the actual rates and coverage areas are released, we will assess policy implications and work strategically with key stakeholders to advocate for changes that ensure that our customers are best positioned to successfully provide quality care to their patients. And now looking forward, our guidance continues to consider the projected market growth and continued momentum of our products and solutions in the market.","Additionally, the $5 million positive impact due to the retroactive tariff exclusion is being reinvested to drive future innovation and support our long term growth, including investments in Flash technology, software capability, key programs such as adaptive radiotherapy and infrastructure. Incrementally, we're also investing in sales and distribution capability to support the global build out of our recent acquisitions.","And after carefully considering these factors, we expect the following for the fiscal full year. Revenues of $3.18 billion to $3.21 billion, representing growth of 9% to 10%. Non-GAAP operating earnings as a percentage of revenues of 16.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.58 to $4.63 cents. Cash flows from operations of $430 million to $470 million. The guidance continues to assume a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 21% to 22%, a weighted average diluted share count of 92 million, currency rates as of the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2019 includes the expected net impact of all tariffs currently in effect, and includes acquisitions announced to date.","Thank you. And now, let's go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with UBS.","Matt Taylor","So the first topic I wanted to ask about was just some of the changes in the ordering patterns here. Would you say there's any change in the environment in the Americas or in APAC, you called out some weakness in the number of geographies or would you chalk this up to some variability? What are you seeing in terms of trends that would explain some of the difference here?","Dow Wilson","Looking at the biggest picture, first of all, trailing 12 months growth remains robust across all geographies. Our orders are lumpy, as you know, it's also tough to grow off a very large comp. We had a very, very good third quarter last year. And, but now just kind of making around the horn on the geographies, the trailing 12 months in the Americas is 6%. We're very pleased with long term performance. The -- we had strong wins at the Veterans Hospital. I'd say, certainly here in the short term, there's no indication that CMS proposal is impacting US demand, wouldn't make that linkage at all.","The US product portfolio remains in a very good position to drive growth. We're seeing software, competitive takeouts, installed base growth, and a lot of folks transitioning to higher technology with SBRT capability. Asia, as I said in the script, we continue to see strong double digit growth in China, despite the fact that we\u2019re not seeing [ph] any traction yet from the licensed quota, but China remains very, very strong, rest of Asia and Japan did not grow in the quarter. These are smaller markets with lumpier businesses, but all are growing double digit on a trailing 12 month basis and it's certainly been strong for us for the last year.","As I said about EMEA, this is the eighth consecutive double digit constant currency growth quarter we've had, so we're continuing to see a strong environment there. I mentioned on the call, we did see the first activity in the Tata agreement. We booked two orders in the quarter. Now, we hope that will continue to grow. I think that's probably a pretty good around the horn.","Gary, anything to add there, am I missing anything.","Gary Bischoping","No. The software growth continues to perform well from an orders perspective as well as we continue to sell those solutions around the globe. That's the only thing I would add, Dow.","Dow Wilson","Yeah. And maybe, since I messed up the number, we did get three proton orders in the quarter. And I'd also say the funnel looks pretty good there so far after a couple of quarters with no proton activity. It's nice to see that come back.","Matt Taylor","Okay, thanks for that. And then just as a follow up, you did mention the bundled proposal that came out and some initial thoughts on that. And there has not been a linkage to decrease demand, it would be great to hear what you're hearing from customers, what are some of the things that you think might need to change or be commented on during the comments period?","Dow Wilson","Yeah, clearly, I'd say the number one item is people are still looking for more clarity. They didn't give everything, just to remind everybody kind of from the top, this is a proposed rule. And, we will be working with stakeholders to address issues. But, we've long anticipated transition to value based care environment. Our innovations, especially our big ones with Halcyon, TrueBeam, HyperArc, RapidPlan, all of these have had, in the back of our minds, as we've developed them or transition to this kind of payment model.","We're also very encouraged, we haven't known CTSI very long, but we're very encouraged about the kind of play it gives us, it gives us an opportunity to consult and sell with people, as they go through this transition. So we think, so the short version is, from a product line portfolio perspective, I think we're really in very good shape to help our customers. In terms of the proposed rule itself, it remains in the comment period. The actual rates and the geographic areas are not yet released. So, that\u2019s a very key piece of information, we're going to need to kind of complete the final assessment on the policy implications, we do have some concerns as to other stakeholders in the field. There's lots of data and complexity to sort through, but we're working with ASTRO and others to advocate for changes to ensure our customers are in a very good position.","Just kind of coming back to the portfolio position, I think we're in a really good shape and niche players are going to have difficulty, justifying slower treatments and higher costs. That's kind of what this comes down to. So from a share perspective, I think we're in very good shape, maybe even at better shape than ever. And, as to what it happens in the market, I think we really kind of have to kind of look at the final rates before we can make that assessment.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amit Hazan with Citi. Amit, your line is now live.","Amit Hazan","I want to start with guidance. I apologize if I missed it. But, can you give us a kind of better understanding of the higher revenues, but tighter EPS guide, just thinking through some of the positives that you're experiencing with the Halcyon installs now coming through, the tariff mitigation that you've been mentioning for the second half of the year, the big software growth, seems to be some pretty good visibility, but the -- obviously the operating margin coming down to 16.5%, and a tighter EPS range, just help us out with what the offsets are there.","Gary Bischoping","Amit, great question. And, first of all, I\u2019d say, yeah, as you referenced, the revenue is definitely growing and we felt good about that and Dow referenced some of the tailwinds we're seeing in the marketplace, and trailing 12 months orders are in good shape. And, we're certainly getting a little help from acquisitions there. And that will translate into some of that revenue guide increase that you just saw. ","From an operating perspective, I just got to kind of help you think maybe a little sequentially from Q3 and Q4 a couple of things. So first of all, as we alluded to in the CTSI announcement, there's $0.03 of dilution here that you're going to see that we talked about in the quarter, next quarter. I would say the tax rate from an EPS perspective is seasonally low in the third quarter. Under FIN 48, we set up reserves for uncertain tax positions. And typically in Q3, we have lapses in the statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions. And that causes a seasonally low tax rate in Q3 that bounces back up into Q4.","We have a little more interest from the IOS acquisitions, interest expansion in the IOS acquisitions that we just talked about. And then, I think one of the things that we want to make sure that\u2019s fully understood here is, the ongoing nature of the investments we've been making, not only in R&D, but also in sales and marketing and G&A to support that long term growth. For the Boston Scientific beads portfolio that's pending close, we're going to build into a sales force for that. And so we'll make ongoing investments there in that SG&A line to make sure we support that growth rate over time.","The last thing I would point to here is, the current range that we gave from an EPS perspective, which is narrowed, the prior midpoint of our guidance is still within that range. So, we like how this is positioned relative to wrapping up the year and facing into this tariff, tariff challenge that we had, I feel like we're operating very, very well in that environment and delivering strong growth on top of it.","Dow Wilson","Maybe if I could just maybe make a few comments too about the reinvestment side. We've been making some ongoing investments in our software upgrades in emerging markets, field teams, so that's kind of ongoing, little bit infrastructure support to go with that. But then when you look at the acquisitions, CyberHeart is very exciting. It's an intellectual property acquisition. We think it can be a very substantial piece of business, it's going to require some clinical trial work and some investment to get going. So, we've got that ticked off. ","We haven't owned them very long as I mentioned, but we're very encouraged by what we see with the interventional oncology play, three acquisitions there, Endocare and Alicon and then the asset purchase from Boston Scientific, that's $1 billion plus -- will be $1 billion plus market with very generously accretive gross margin rate. So our challenge there is to kind of bring that to global scale. So we've got some investment going on there. And then as I mentioned, the CTSI play, literally with every day, we like it more and more, opportunity to pivot that business into a technology enabled services business and really help grow the business also with accretive gross margin rates. So, that's a little bit where the investments are going, in the kind of the $0.04 ish impact that we've got here in Q4.","Amit Hazan","Okay, and just to make sure we're clear on that. So the prior guidance of 16.5% to 17.5% going to 16.5% now, it sounds like that's all related to acquisition. There's nothing else that's impacting that reduction.","Gary Bischoping","Predominately investments to support acquisitions, and that's diluted to get to scale and get to those higher gross margin rates in growth over time. ","Dow Wilson","And then the tax and tariff piece that you talked about.","Gary Bischoping","Well, the tax and tariffs will be below that line. Yeah. From an operating earnings perspective, that is correct.","Amit Hazan","So, I\u2019ll just stick with this topic for my last question, and just thinking about this obviously just past this next quarter, I think people will understand dilution from deals, but as I think about the year and you guys having started out at 17% to 18% operating earnings, talking about getting to north of 20 and here we are, looking to end the year at 16.5, inevitably, the question is going to come and go. So, how do we think about this for next year? So, can you, I know, you're not going to give guidance, but can you talk just directionally to, whether in aggregate the acquisitions are going to be accretive next year and whether some of the items that I mentioned that seem to be positives for you are going to start to pay off and how we should start to think about that 16.5% as we go into next year, is that now the new base and we just work off of that for another 100 basis points, or is there more room because of some of the one times and other impacts this year?","Dow Wilson","I think a couple of things there, I mean, great question. So, first of all, there's roughly 160 basis point impact from tariffs in that number. Okay, and so, let's add that to the top, and then that starts to get you, heading in the right direction relative to the 20%. The 20% that we gave, certainly wasn't inclusive of what's going on with the tariff environment we're in today. So that's kind of point one.","Two is, yes, we are seeing some nice tailwinds from hardware accretion from Halcyon. We've now got 90 of those installed in the world and good healthy backlog to pull from. So, we're seeing that nice accretion. I would say that, we are seeing dilution on the other side of that from the acquisitions, investments in Flash and other investments that we've alluded to along the way. And, I would say that software is going to continue to be a good tailwind for us. We saw it here in the third quarter, we anticipate seeing it for the rest of the year and continue to be a nice mix up from a margin rate perspective. Proton profitability has improved the last two years on a year-over-year basis and with Kolleen at the helm and the work she has underway, we hope to continue that down the path. So -- and then we'll get some operating leverage out of this portfolio, as we stabilize those investments to support the growth in the near term. So, we feel good about where we're exiting the year from an operating earnings perspective. And to remind you that even with the tariffs, we're still going to grow operating earnings dollars on a year-over-year basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Bednar with Robert W. Baird.","Jason Bednar","Dow, I just want to come back to the China quota. I mean, how would you suggest that quota is going to contribute to your business here going forward. I mean, and how should we think about it for fiscal \u201820, assuming that we start to see it here coming in a bigger way in the coming quarters? And is it fair to think it's a gradual ramp up, is that the right way to think about it? And is that market, the China market running really into any bottlenecks that's holding up that quota from being executed?","Dow Wilson","I think the short version is, to where we are today, it's kind of within our expectations. I do think we've got to watch it going forward. You've got the data on the 1200 to 1400 systems that they had licenses that they were going to do, we've kind of thought from the beginning that that would be a gradual ramp that they had a lot of work to do to get that done. We are seeing some of that work come together, now kind of how the whole China economy plays into this and what's going on, will they spend the money, I think that's a question that we're just really not going to see till next year, next fiscal year for us. ","So, short version is, nothing we've seen so far surprises us, it's kind of on track for what we thought would happen. The licenses are moving through the provinces. And as soon as we see that, we\u2019ll certainly let you know. I would say that absent all that, we're still seeing a very strong market, it's been strong double digit in the quarter and in the trailing 12 months. And our share is very, very good, 55% public win rate. So we're, I think, very well positioned and kind of like what we're seeing, even despite the quota not hitting maybe as fast as some people had hoped.","Jason Bednar","And then I did want to come back to Matt\u2019s question earlier and just maybe dig in on APAC a bit more. I mean, do you think you just ran into an air pocket with some of those markets, like whether it was Japan or Southeast Asia or Australia? Or has CapEx spending softened in some of those markets? I mean, just trying to understand what's really going on in there in those markets, just especially in light of what had been some pretty darn good growth rates you've been putting up here the last few quarters?","Dow Wilson","Yeah. I mean, clearly, China was very strong, as I mentioned, strong double digit growth, both in the quarter and the trailing 12. In the quarter, both Japan and rest of Asia were down and down not insignificantly. These markets are just lumpy. So, we look very much the trailing 12 on these markets. It's been strong double digit, both in Japan and in the trailing 12. But they are markets, for example, Australia, the market is very tender driven. And you could get five or six LINACs [ph] one quarter and zero the next. So, we got some of that lumpiness kind of going on in those markets. So, at this point, I wouldn't over read anything into Asia. We continue to see a strong Asia and believe it's going to be a good geography for us. We've recently retooled kind of our rest of Asia team. We got very strong leadership in China, Japan and Australia and we've retooled our Southeast Asia leadership team, really like the team that's in place and, pushing that market and seeing some market development and growth there. ","One of the things that maybe just to come back to the Halcyon comment that Gary mentioned, we did 46 Halcyon orders in the quarter, 60% of them are in emerging markets. The really amazing statistic is nearly every one of the emerging market orders was a new vault, so this is growing our installed base, growing the beach front of the business, long term growth of our service and software business, it's doing exactly what we wanted to do and kind of really responding to that Lance's study that we famously quoted now for three or four years and it's just fun to see the fulfillment of that, fulfilling that access to care in these markets where cancer patients have not had radiation therapy as part of their arsenal.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone with Jefferies.","Anthony Petrone","And maybe I'll stay on APAC orders for a sec and move into just reimbursement. Just as we look ahead and when we start to see orders from say Tata and then also the outstanding tenders that are in China, that 1400 or so systems, I mean, how are you expecting eventually that to roll through? I mean, it seems that it possibly will cause even more lumpiness, as time goes on or you're expecting perhaps maybe a more measured processes as both Tata and the tenders in China begin. ","Dow Wilson","Let me talk India first. We\u2019re very pleased with the Tata relationship, a big piece of our EMEA growth this last year has been India. And that continues, even, it's kind of same story in both India and China, right. I mean, the core business is doing very, very well. If you look at it on a revenue basis, our five year CAGR in India is 20%. So that's kind of the India story. Our radiation therapy utilization in India is less than 20%. So there's still a huge access issue. That's what the Tata foundation really wants to get at. We booked the first two orders. It's underway, two LINACs and two brachytherapy orders, so those are kind of their pilots to get it going. ","I think there's been a lot of focus on the election and the campaign and now, the government is rolling out budgets, I think we will see, over the next few years, more engagement from the government buyers in India. So, you have kind of our core market, the Tata Foundation, and the India government getting into it. So, I mean, it's going to be a little bit lumpy and we don't guide to orders, but that's kind of the market that we're seeing in India. On China, we're seeing the historical market, as I mentioned a minute ago, is very strong and continues to be strong. ","I would maybe add one thing to it. And that is we're starting to see a private market emerge in China. And, that's good. The Ministry of Health thing as I mentioned, it's on our expectations. We had hoped to see some here in the second half of the year. I think, that's what we said earlier in the year. We do see provinces starting to kind of get their ducks in a row and line up, now what economy emerges in China and is there some fiscal restraint and how does that impact us, I couldn't look in the eye and tell you how that's going to impact us one way or the other at this point. But, maybe there would be some of that. But frankly, the core business continues to rock in China and we feel very comfortable about its growth and about our market position there, I mean, literally, that our market share has been trending up there the last eight, nine quarters and continues to be very strong position as a leader, so grateful for that.","Anthony Petrone","And just to follow-up there in the US on reimbursement, understanding, it's early here, but as you look at sort of what's out there in the proposal, is there any early view on perhaps what impact this could have on one hand, when there's changes, maybe it leads to a little bit of hesitation on hospitals, but on the other hand, it seems like going to value based could trigger an upgrade cycle if your systems are really not prepared to do, really hyper fractionation really, so maybe just some early thoughts there.","Dow Wilson","I think it's really a good question. We're watching it very, very closely. My view of this is there's one negative and one positive. The negative is, it's uncertain and at uncertain times, people hesitate a little bit. The positive is, with this transition to more value based, we're going to see a shift to more hyper fractionation. And, there's no product portfolio better positioned in the world than ours to take advantage of that. And that could cause people to really look at their fleet of LINACs and say, boy, are we well positioned for that transition, and, I need a better SRS\/SBRT capability, and I need to be able to do it in my standard treatment slot. ","So, it's, I think it's a nice opportunity for both new systems and for upgrades. We could sell imaging upgrades, more rapid plan upgrades. I'm very encouraged. I mentioned briefly our Adaptive Therapy Consortium, to do that in a existing treatment window without impacting the productivity of our customers is a big deal. So, they can maintain and grow their return on investment with equipment. So we think we're in, so I think that's the positive. I think the positive is there is some encouragement to swap out old stuff. And then there will be a little uncertainty, while people kind of transition into the new alternative payment model.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho Peterson","Hey, I'll start with where you left off. You made a comment earlier about working with customers to address some of the issues around bundling. Can you maybe elaborate on that and what's kind of a range of acceptable outcomes in your view when we do get the physician fee schedule, in terms of cuts?","Gary Bischoping","I think the only outcome I could really predict is, we\u2019ll know in November and December. So, I mean, they've been very regular in terms of their timing. We see the trial balloon in July. And then the final proposal comes out in November, December. We have not seen actual rates in geographic areas yet as part of this. So that's one item, the mandatory nature of it is another item. Anyway, we're working with a number of customers, freestanding hospital, academic, across the board, working with our trade association [indiscernible] and of course through ASTRO to raise some of the issues we have and make sure the voices are heard, so that cancer patients continue to receive the best quality care.","Tycho Peterson","And on Halcyon, I appreciate the commentary, can you just comment on the KV launch, how much is that driving demand at this point, what's the mix like KV versus non-KV enabled systems?","Dow Wilson","Let\u2019s see. I don't have it here for you. If I get it before the end of the call, oh, here we go. We got -- 55% is KV. Let me start over. 60% of this is in emerging markets. So, you could say that the 40% that's in developed markets, almost all of that is -- virtually 100% of that is KV. I'd say in emerging markets, maybe 10% to 15% of it is -- has a kilovoltage imager in it. I think the one thing that we're excited about is the kilovoltage imager is not yet launched in China. We don't have regulatory approval for that yet in China. And I think our Chinese customers are in part waiting for that. And, that's going to be another elbow of growth for us when we bring that into the market.","Tycho Peterson","All right, and one or two quick ones for Gary. I have to ask on cash flow, because you did cut it again, can you maybe highlight what's behind that?","Gary Bischoping","It\u2019s really related to growth, as we're growing faster, as outlined by the upgrade in the growth rate, we're going to put some more receivables on the board and carry a little more inventory. So, that's kind of the bulk of it -- of the small change we made there. And, let's say on the flip side of that, our oncology business saw a record collections quarter, so really good collections by the team. And our DSL and oncology was down from 106 days last year to 105 days this year, and is down from 110 in the prior quarter. So, the teams are executing very well. It's just, we're growing fast, so we're going to use a little more working capital.","Tycho Peterson","And then on tariff, you offset the impact on EBIT this quarter, are tariffs then a net tailwind to earnings growth next year as you lap the softer first half or do you plan to kind of reinvest that.","Gary Bischoping","We'll talk a lot more about that as we talk to you guys next quarter, but we've seen some good momentum as you outline as we've gone through the year here.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I have a few here. Maybe just starting on the fourth quarter guidance here, Gary, if I understand correctly, the 10% revenue growth for the year, that's implying low single digit top line for Q4. Were revenues pulled forward into 3Q, I'm just trying to understand, you did 16 reported, 19 constant currency. Why is that decelerating to 3% reported in Q4?","Dow Wilson","Yeah, big compare from last year Vijay. When you look at what we did in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201918, that's the majority of the reason and going off that big compare is always a challenge. We're up to the challenge. And as you outlined, given the guidance, we\u2019ll seek growth here. So, that's really the long and short of it here from a revenue growth perspective.","Vijay Kumar","The EPS guidance, that's implying $1.21 at the high end, that's 15% below street models for Q4. I'm just wondering if there was any timing element from 3Q to 4Q, obviously, you had a really strong 3Q, that EPS number basically implies a sequential deceleration in op margins, am I looking at this the right way in terms of the implied fourth quarter guidance on EPS and margins?","Gary Bischoping","So, it implies a sequential decline in earnings per share. Right. So the first thing that I think you have to look at from a quarter-on-quarter perspective is, the tax rate, like I outlined. That's certainly the sequential tax rate decline that I talked about earlier. Under FIN 48, we set up reserves for uncertain tax provisions and positions and in the third quarter, we had some of the statute limitations and various jurisdictions lapse there. So you see, seasonally, as you\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years, a drop in the growth, a drop in the tax rate in the third quarter and that'll pop back up in the fourth quarter. That's a big part of that earnings per share sequential change. ","CTSI, the $0.03 dilution, we'd already talked about, that you'll see in the fourth quarter. We'll have some more interest expense, as we go from Q3 to Q4, given the acquisitions that are outstanding, and then as Dow outlined, we continue to make investments across the SG&A line to support that growth rate, building out a sales, distribution, marketing with the acquisitions we're very excited to have in the portfolio.","Vijay Kumar","And if I could just squeeze in one on the bundling side, when I was reading the document, it looked like freestanding centers are getting paid double digits, about 11% higher than hospital rates. Is that -- am I reading that correctly? And what percentage of your backlog is from freestanding centers, is comprised of freestanding centers right now?","Dow Wilson","I'm not sure about your math on the first part, Vijay. I know in a lot of areas, the reimbursement rates have been equalized. So, that might be something we can tackle in another call somewhere. ","In terms of the second part of your question, percent of backlog, I mean, there was a day a decade ago when the freestanding market was a quarter of our business. Today, it's less than 5% of our business. ","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to Dow Wilson for closing remarks.","Dow Wilson","Thank you. In closing, we're excited about the strong momentum in the business and look forward to continuing to execute on our growth priorities. We remain committed to investing in innovation and future growth opportunities, both organically and through acquisitions. These activities accelerate our strategy to be a broad based cancer solutions company to drive toward the ultimate victory, a world without the fear of cancer. Thanks for joining us today.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."],"21588":["Varian Medical Systems, Inc.

As a reminder this conference call is being recorded and a replay can be accessed on the Varian Investor Relations Web site at www.varian.com\/investors.","Now I will turn it over to J. Michael Bruff, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.","Michael Bruff","Thank you, Matt. Good afternoon everyone. Joining me today on the call are Varian's President and Chief Executive Officer Dow Wilson; and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Bischoping. Dow will share his thoughts on our results and long-term strategy, and Gary will cover our operating and financial results in more detail.","On the Varian Investor Relations Web site, you can find our fiscal first quarter press release and earnings presentation, which are intended to provide additional perspective and details. A webcast of this call and any accompanying non-GAAP reconciliations are available on our Web site at www.varian.com\/investors. Unless otherwise stated, all financial results discussed are non-GAAP.

All periods referred to are fiscal periods unless otherwise stated, and all references to trailing 12 months refer to the trailing 12 months ending on the last day of our most recently completed fiscal quarter.","During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections and other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in today's earnings release, this conference call, and our SEC filings. We do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.","With all that said, I'll turn it over to Dow.","Dow Wilson","Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon everyone. Today I'll share the key milestones we achieved this past quarter and how they contributed to our long-term strategy. We're pleased to see continued momentum coming off a strong fiscal year 2018.","First, let me touch on our first quarter results. Total company revenues increased 9% to $741 million. Oncology revenues grew 8%, driven by our integrated platform with best-in-class hardware, software, and services. Revenues for our Proton Solutions business were $39 million, up 32%. Operating earnings declined 5% to a $120 million or 16.2% of revenues. GAAP earnings per share was a $1.12 and non-GAAP earnings per share was a $1.6, flat year-over-year. Operating earnings and earnings per share results were negatively impacted by $11 million of tariffs. Gary we'll cover this in more detail during his discussion. Cash flows from operations were $141 million, down 21%.","In terms of our long-term growth and value creation strategy, we made progress across our three growth initiatives; first, strengthening our leadership in radiation therapy. Based on public filings, the radiation therapy market grew 9% on an orders basis over the trailing 12 months ending in September 2018. Varian grew its market leadership and worldwide share during that period.","In our Oncology business, orders grew 16% in the quarter, our highest growth rate in a decade, and 11% in the trailing 12 months. Our worldwide net installed base is now 8,198 units, an increase of 322 units or 4%. This continued growth in our installed base drives recurring revenue from software and services. On the hardware side, we made progress with our global rollout of Halcyon, and have now taken 202 orders since our May 2017 launch, including 20 orders in the first quarter, up eight units or 67%. Since launch, over 60% of orders worldwide have been incremental. Additionally, Halcyon was selected by R&D magazine as an R&D 100 winner as one of the most exceptional innovations in science and technology in 2018. We are pleased that Halcyon was recognized for empowering clinicians to care for more patients by making radiation therapy simpler and more efficient than ever.","On the software front, revenues grew 14% as we continue to see strong demand and receive positive feedback. The number of unique Varian software customers grew 8% driven by our integrated best-in-class portfolio and the acquisition of Mobius. Varian is the industry leader in machine learning and AI-driven software solutions. We launched RapidPlan, our machine learning planning software four years ago, and have taken nearly 1,800 orders since launch, continuing to expand penetration within our Eclipse installed base.","Related to RapidPlan, Beijing Cancer Hospital won an IDC China Digital Transformation Award for their successful clinical use of the product. IDC, the world's leading digital research firm recognizes outstanding organizations in China that have successfully implemented digital transformation. Beijing Cancer Hospital is one of the pioneers in China utilizing RapidPlan in clinical practice, and was the only winner from the health care industry in its category.","Hao Wu, Deputy Director of Radiotherapy and Chief Medical Physicist of Beijing Cancer Hospital shared that RapidPlan has improved the quality and consistency of treatment plans and efficiency of clinical workflow. Since the technology reduces planning time from several hours to several minutes, he noted that it could greatly help with the shortage of medical physicists in China.","Orders for HyperArc, our high-definition radiotherapy solution for SRS grew nearly 50%, and we have expanded our global reach by taking orders in over 30 countries since launch. And Eclipse MCO, our multi-criteria optimization planning software delivered stellar performance with 180 license orders in the quarter bringing our total orders to nearly 800 since launch in Q4 of 2017. Our services revenues grew 8% driven by our growing installed base and higher mix of newer machines which typically have a higher attach rate and contract value.","In our Proton Solutions business, we completed clinical handovers for one room each at the Emory Proton Therapy Center in Georgia, HollandPTC in the Netherlands, and the Christie Hospital in the U.K. These handovers represent an important future recurring revenue stream for our Proton business. We also announced the official opening of two proton centers, the four-room HollandPTC and the five-room Emory Proton Therapy Center. Equally exciting is the start of patient treatments at the Christie, HollandPTC, and Emory proton centers, each center is treating complex disease sites, including pediatric patients with sophisticated IMPT protocols. We continue to see strength in our Proton Services business with 27 rooms handed over to-date, and our customers continue to perform well, achieving an average 95% uptime across all clinical sites.","In October, we announced the formation of the FlashForward Consortium to study potentially groundbreaking ultra-high dose rate cancer treatments with protons, more commonly known as Flash. We are currently conducting preclinical research building on published studies suggesting that Flash significantly spares normal tissue, while maintaining tumor control in animal models. If the results of our preclinical studies continue to be encouraging, we would move to human trials in the next 18 to 24 months. Both Flash and ProBeam 360, our new smaller footprint Proton System introduced at ASTRO in October are building momentum for our Proton Solutions.","Our second growth initiative is to extend our global footprint. Our global market share growth was driven by continued orders based share gains in our three geographies, each of which delivered double-digit orders growth in the quarter. For EMEA, this was the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, driven by emerging markets and public tender wins. For example, in November, we announced that Varian was selected by South Africa's largest private radiation oncology provider, Medical Specialist Holdings or MSH, to equip seven of its centers of Varian Linux and Eclipse treatment planning software, the seven Linux included in the order are three Halcyons, two TrueBeam, and two VitalBeam Systems. This deal also represents a major win for Acura health with a competitive software conversion. We are proud MSH selected Varian as his partner, and look forward to expanding access to advanced cancer care across South Africa.","We also made progress towards extending our global footprint in our Asia-Pacific and Latin American regions. In Asia, we saw very strong growth across the region. For example, we booked orders for eight systems from the Philippines Department of Health in the quarter, as well as two Halcyons and two HyperArc orders in Korea. In China, our second largest market, we continue to see momentum with strong double-digit orders growth in the quarter. Our portfolio is well-positioned to take advantage of the continued shift towards SBRT and the increasing demand in China for world-class products and solutions is driving continued momentum.","In October, the Chinese government announced the quota of 188 Category A licenses, and 1208 Category B licenses. The increase in license quota demonstrates China's commitment to increasing access to radiation therapy for the treatment of cancer including protons. This is welcome news as it provides greater opportunities in the China market, the market in which we have been winning over 50% of public tenders.","One of our key ambitions for Halcyon was to expand access to high-quality radiation therapy to under-served regions around the world. This quarter, we announced that we secured approval for Halcyon from the China National Medical Product Administration. In China, approximately 4.5 million new cancer cases are diagnosed each year, compared with 1.7 million in the U.S. However, radiation therapy utilization in China is less than 25% as compared with 50% to 60% market in mature markets. We specifically designed Halcyon for resource constrained markets like China, and this approval further expands the global availability of Halcyon and access to high-quality cost effective cancer treatments.","Earlier this month, following approval, we launched Halcyon in China and showcased our broader cancer treatment portfolio at our China Users Meeting. This is the largest customer event in Varian's history with nearly 1,300 Chinese radiation oncology professionals in attendance and over 8,000 additional clinicians watching via a live webcast. We are committed to the Chinese market and are well-positioned to continue to grow there. Our integrated best-in-class portfolio, our commercial team, and our investments in channel localization and local manufacturing are proving to be the right strategy.","Finally, Latin America also performed well with Halcyon orders in Guatemala, Colombia, Chile, and Brazil. We also opened a Jundiai manufacturing facility and delivered our first locally manufactured TrueBeams to Oncoclinicas in Brazil.","On Halcyon front, global momentum continues to grow, the Halcyon orders taken since launch over 40% have been from emerging markets, and approximately 90% of these have been from incremental units. Thus, we see Halcyon expanding the market and our market share as well as increasing our patient impact.","And lastly, our third growth initiative is to expand into other addressable markets. We continue to believe that 360 Oncology will be a growth driver for the company as we enter the cancer care coordination market, an area of large unmet need. In the first quarter, we won a competitive contract for our cancer care coordination platform, including patient engagement at Northeast Georgia Health System. This $8 million\/five-year agreement will enable the oncology program to optimize clinical, operational, and financial workflows, support growth, and improve patient care. This contract represents progress towards our strategy of targeting key opinion leaders for adoption of 360 Oncology, and we look forward to demonstrating the impact the product can have on clinical effectiveness as well as the efficiency and productivity.","In October, we expanded our addressable markets in the broader cancer space by announcing the acquisition of Noona, a developer of cloud-based mobile patient engagement software, designed to capture patient-to-patient cancer patient reported outcomes or PROs. We signed two deals this quarter with pharmaceutical companies to conduct post-market prospective clinical trials on patient outcomes using the Noona platform. Through Noona, we plan to continue building partnerships with life science companies as the Noona software application is used to meaningfully engage patients, collect PRO data, and enable clinical studies and real world evidence generation about the efficacy of cancer treatments.","Finally an update on tariffs; we received notification in December that the United States trade representative granted our exclusion request for Halcyon Systems manufactured in China and subject to tariffs, resulting in approximately $1 million anticipated positive impact on fiscal year 2019 earnings. We think the U.S. trade representative and U.S. government for recognizing the impact of Varian's cancer technologies on millions of patients by excluding Halcyon from the current trade dispute. We are hopeful that China will reciprocate, but until further notice, tariffs on products imported into China from the U.S. effective as of August 23rd remain in-place. Additionally, Varian's exclusion applications for component sourced from China are still pending with the U.S. trade representative. We remain dedicated to ensuring that our customers and the patients they treat are able to achieve new victories against cancer without any global disruption in access to our leading-edge technologies and solutions.","Overall, we're pleased with the progress we made in the first quarter towards our long-term strategy to become a global leader in multi-disciplinary integrated Cancer Care Solutions.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Gary, who will provide more context on the first quarter financial results.","Gary Bischoping","Thanks, Dow. As always, I will consistently frame my comments in the context of our long-term growth and value creation strategy, which includes balancing growth, profitability and liquidity.","So, let me start with growth. Companywide revenues were $741 million in the first quarter, up 9%in dollars and 10% constant currency. In oncology, revenues were $702 million, up 8% in dollars and 9% in constant currency, driven by growth across hardware, software, and services. Excluding the impact of tariffs, revenues were up 9%. On a trailing 12-month basis, revenues grew 12% in dollars and 11% in constant currency. Orders were $716 million, up 16% in dollars and 17% in constant currency. On a trailing 12-month basis, orders grew 11% in dollars and 10% in constant currency. We ended the quarter with $3 billion in backlog, up 11%.","Taking a closer look at our oncology business results, in the Americas, revenues declines 2% in the quarter, on a strong prior year comparison; orders were $336 million, up 12%, and in North America orders grew 12% driven by strong execution across our integrated portfolio. We saw robust demand for Halcyon, TrueBeam, as well as significant growth in software and services. Asia Pacific revenues grew 7% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of tariffs, revenues grew 13% in the quarter. Orders were $162 million, up 25%. As Dow discussed, we saw growth across the region particularly in China where we continue to lead the market and grew strong double digits.","Orders in Southeast Asia and Korea nearly doubled, and Australia, New Zealand grew strong double digits. In Japan, orders were also up over the prior year. In our Europe, Middle East, India and Africa geography, revenues grew 28% in the quarter. Orders were $218 million up 15% with outstanding performance across the region particularly in emerging markets. This is EMEA's sixth consecutive quarter with double-digit growth in orders, driven by large tenders.","Our Proton Solutions business posted revenues of $39 million in the quarter which is up 32% driven by the progress made on centers under construction in the increasing centers transitioned into service contracts.","Turning to profitability, the total company gross margin increased 5% driven by continued solid revenue growth in our Oncology business. The gross margin rate was 42.9% of revenues down 189 basis points. This included approximately 100-basis-point impact from tariffs with the remainder driven by geographic mix. On a trailing 12-month basis, gross margin increased 12% consistent with revenue growth. Gross margin rate over this period was 43.4% up 58 basis points including approximately 19 basis points negative impact from tariffs. Oncology gross margin rate was 44.4% down 209 basis points approximately 100 basis points of decline were driven by tariffs and the remainder was consistent with the drivers at the total company level. Despite a lower margin rate, Oncology margin dollars grew 3% due to a strong 8% revenue growth.","Looking at Proton Solutions, gross margin dollars were $7 million, up $4 million. We continue to make good progress on profitability. However, our aspiration to achieve operating breakeven in this fiscal year may be delayed due to the timing of orders. Investment will continue to be a key driver of our long-term growth and value creation strategy. We invested a record $61 million in R&D which was up 9% at 8.2% of revenues. Likewise, we are investing in sales and marketing while continuing to be responsive with G&A investments to ensure our infrastructure scale to support growth.","SG&A expenses were $137 million or 18.5% of revenues, an increase of 47 basis points. The increase was driven in large part by investments in Software Solutions and the timing of the ASTRO trade show falling in October of 2018 versus in September of 2017. Company operating earnings were $120 million or 16.2% of revenues, decreasing 5%. Excluding the impact of tariffs, operating earnings grew 4% and was 17.6% of revenues.","On a trailing 12 month basis, operating earnings increased 13% at a rate of 17.1%. Excluding the impact of tariffs, operating earnings during this period grew 17% at a rate of 17.6% of revenues, an increase of 83 basis points. This quarter, GAAP earnings per share included $22 million from the gain on the sale of our equity investment in Augmenix. We also incurred from gain on the sale of our equity investment in Augmenix. We also incurred $2 million in acquisition-related expenses.","Turning to taxes; after impacts with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation are resulting GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 24.4%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 20.3%, which excludes the impact of the transition to the new legislation. Similarly, our non-GAAP EPS also excludes this impact. GAAP earnings per share was a $1.12. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was a $1.06 with related diluted share count of 92 million shares in the quarter. Tariffs resulted in a reduction of non-GAAP EPS by $0.10.","Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $660 million and no debt. Cash flow from operations were $141 million, down 21% driven by timing of certain accounts receivable collection efforts and an inventory build to support production offset by moderate improvement in accounts payable. Our Oncology DSO increased from 107 days to 111 days in the quarter.","In addition to R&D, other investments in the quarter include $14 million in CapEx and $35 million to repurchase shares of our stock. As of the end of the quarter, we had 3.3 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.","I will now turn it back over to Dow.","Dow Wilson","Thanks, Gary. With respect to our annual guidance, we carefully considered the projected market growth and the continued momentum of our products and solutions in the market. We also continue to monitor the situation on tariffs. As we discussed on our last earnings call, we expect roughly $16 $60 million gross impact from tariffs in fiscal year 2019. As noted earlier in the quarter, we had an $11 million negative impact from tariffs which was generally in line with company expectations. We anticipate the remainder to be spread evenly throughout the rest of the year.","Lastly, we remain on track to mitigate the impact of tariffs which are expected to materially phase in during the second half of the year. Therefore, as we stated in our fourth quarter earnings call, we continue to expect our earnings performance to be weighted towards the back half of the year. As such, we are - reaffirming the following guidance for fiscal year 2019, revenues of $3.06 billion to $3.15 billion, representing growth of 5% to 8%, non-GAAP operating earnings as a percentage of revenues of 17% to 18%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.60 to $4.75. Cash flows from operations of $460 million to $510 million. The guidance continues to assume a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 21% to 22% a weighted average diluted share count of 92 million, and currency rates as of the beginning of fiscal year 2019 and excludes any future acquisitions.","Thank you, and now let's go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Great, thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from that Matt Taylor from UBS. Please go ahead.","Matt Taylor","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question.","Dow Wilson","Hi, Matt.","Gary Bischoping","Hi, Matt.","Matt Taylor","Hi, there. So, I was hoping that you could go into a little bit more detail around some of the dynamics that you're seeing on the ground in China. You mentioned you had a good users meeting, it seems like there's early signs of interest there. Can you talk about your confidence in being able to keep up the kind of 56% win rate that you've had there in the public tenders? And then, how the timing of orders and placement could shape out with this new order that the governments have placed?","Dow Wilson","Yes. Sure, Matt. Thank you. I'd say, first of all, we really like what we see in China. We had a very strong quarter there. Having said that, we don't believe there's much impact at all from the announcement about the new China quota in our first quarter. So, any impact today so far is immaterial, and we think it's going to take some time for that to play out.","Second, we think the market is very good. As I mentioned in the text, there's almost three times as much cancer incidence in China as there is the U.S. U.S. is about 1.7 million diagnoses a year, China is 4.5 million, and you're talking about a factor of at least two in terms of patients to get radiation therapy. So clearly, the government is seeing the need and making the investment.","In terms of the win rate, I'd say we've been kind of above that 50% win rate for some time, and feel very confident about our ability to execute that. Our team is obviously having lots of conversations in China, and we're excited about what we see there. Our portfolio is winning, and I think maybe a little piece of the new news is we got Halcyons in that market, we also have got recent introductions of our software products that are starting to scale now in China.","Matt Taylor","Great, thanks for that. And I was wondering, maybe for Gary, you talked a little about the tariff, and it sounds like you're kind of cautiously optimistic that you'll get some relief on the other side, but what should we look for as guideposts as analysts or investors to think about, I mean really - you could get, and I guess if you did get upside, how would you think about reinvesting that or dropping that through?","Gary Bischoping","Yes, no, thanks Matt for the question, and as we stated in the quarter, $11 million impact in Q1, just a little more color there, $8 million of that would have been through the revenue line and $3 million through the COGS line, all dropping into the operating line of $11 million. We think that - we will continue to talk about the growth impact on the call, it's clearly easy for us to track that, and as we stated, we think the rest of that $60 million gross impact we talked about will be spread pretty evenly throughout the rest of the year. Mitigation efforts take a little bit longer, and so, therefore the back-half ended - the back half strengthened in profitability that we alluded to you earlier.","As far as, you know, if we get relief from the tariffs that we have currently in place, look, we're going to balance always that growth and profitability over time, and we see a great opportunity to continue to invest in that market. We've invested nicely in the China market, and it's yielding some of those results. And so, we'll put some of that money back to work. How much, and what the breakout will be, you know, we'll see as we get closer to that, as we're not certain about how the breakouts will be, is it going to be retroactive or not, is it going forward. So we'll talk more about it as we get closer to that event.","Matt Taylor","Okay. Great, thank you very much guys.","Operator","Our next question is Amit Hazan from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Amit Hazan","Thanks. Hey, good afternoon guys. Let me ask the guidance question first. It's on the top line and the reiteration, I mean obviously if we think about the order growth in the first quarter being where it was pretty high, and looking at your backlog in health and high single-digit growth there, you know kind of begs the question of why your top line guidance couldn't have been raised a little bit. So I'm wondering if you can just give us some color on that first.","Dow Wilson","Yes, sure. Thanks, Amit. I think the way to think about in terms of headwinds and tailwinds as we thought through that question is there are still some unknowns in the macro environment, and I wouldn't say the geopolitical environment is cleared up any at all either. And so, we're keeping a close eye on that and want to make sure we continue to be aware of that risk as we thought about the guidance.","The other thing is that no orders here in Q1 in the proton business. And so, I would say that would be a headwind as we think about the full-year guidance. That being said, our oncology business is just a fantastic continuation of the momentum of the business. China and India continue to be strong; our European business now six quarters in a row of growth, and so, I think we kind of balance it too, you know, strength in the oncology portfolio is offset by some risk in the top line. Our VPS business, our proton business and cumulative guidance of five to 18 will hold there.","Amit Hazan","Okay. And then I want to come back to China, just given this is your first earnings call since that announcement, and I'm curious if you can, you've had a couple more months now since then to kind of get smarter on this, and out of the 1,400 or so, if we think about the 12 units in that tender, you know, what percent do you think are going to ultimately get consummated that's the question I often did get just given the context with the prior tender? And then maybe give us some kind of a timeframe that you can on when we might start to see those hit your official orders?","Dow Wilson","I mean the short answer is it kind of depends. In our experience, all of them eventually get relieved. I think in the kind of timeframe that they have announced, the reality is it's probably going to be 70% to 80%, but I think it's fair to assume that eventually all 100% of - at least that's been their track record when they - when there is a license, it's going to happen. And I think that's kind of what we're seeing early on as I said in my remarks, you know, we haven't seen a material impact so far, and yet we had a very strong quarter in China, very strong double-digit quarter in China, and that is also from an order booking point of view we book them after the license are awarded to the sites and they issue a tender, so it's going to go all the way through the process for us to book an order.","Amit Hazan","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Anthony Petrone","Thanks, and congrats on a strong quarter here. Maybe I'll stick with China and then I have one on Noona. On China, maybe just a recap of which systems fall in their Class A, in our notes we have Edge and TrueBeam, and then which are currently under Class B and actually it's a correction I think\u2026","Dow Wilson","Yes.","Anthony Petrone","- I think TrueBeam is Class B.","Dow Wilson","Yes. TrueBeam was moved, yes, Edge is still in Class A and everything else is Class B.","Anthony Petrone","And then Halcyon is not in there yet?","Dow Wilson","Halcyon is in Class B.","Gary Bischoping","Approved in Class B, yes.","Anthony Petrone","Okay, okay\u2026","Dow Wilson","Yes, that did happened in December. We need the regulatory approval so that happened in December and that was part of the - that was the main focus of our users meeting that I mentioned was 1,300 customers showing up is to come see the Halcyon launch.","Anthony Petrone","Okay. And then maybe just a quick one there would be on - can you share anything on pricing like between Class A and Class B? How wide of a delta that is? And then I'll have a last one on Noona.","Dow Wilson","I'd say, the short version is, we'll see because we haven't done it yet, but we don't think that the China experience is going to be - our China pricing experience is going to be much materially different on these new quotas as it's been historically. In general terms, Class A products are kind of north of $3.5 million and Class B below, but I think just to kind of reiterate the price point, we like our pricing, had good execution in the quarter. There's some geographic mix but the actual price to price within a market looks pretty solid.","Anthony Petrone","Okay, all right. And then last on Noona, just - maybe just a little bit of background here on at least pharma - announcement of pharmaceutical deals with Noona specifically, so how large of an opportunity maybe not necessarily these two deals but as you look out in terms of mining the pharmaceutical sector with the Noona platform?","Dow Wilson","Yes. No, I mean we're very excited about it, I would say, the short version is, payers are looking to have not just a physician-reported outcome information, they also want patient-reported outcome information. And so, that's been one of the big trends that's been happening in clinical trial. And so, that's the market that we're selling into, and the two deals that we've signed up this past quarter is to help do that patient-reported outcome work in these clinical trials. These tend to be very large deals, as it tends to be multi-year. We hope they can expand in the kind of relationship, where in oncology, we're doing all of their patient-reported outcome, not quite there yet, but that's what we want to, and clearly it's not as fragmented as the provider market. We think that will be a provider market in this space, but the big fish here is it's going to be the pharmaceutical deals and we're kind of thrilled with these first two and look forward doing a whole bunch more.","Anthony Petrone","All right. Great, thanks, again.","Operator","Our next question is from Brandon Henry from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Dow Wilson","Hey, Brandon.","Brandon Henry","Hey. Thanks for taking my question. First question, I just want to touch on the - that the gross order be in the quarter, which you know, to me appeared pretty broad-based across the geography. So, can you just spend some time talking about the general environment you're seeing across the markets and do you think the market is accelerating again or are you just taking more share from Elekta?","Dow Wilson","I'd say share is a small positive trend, but the bigger one is just the underlying strength of the market. The market has been a really strong, let me kind of wing through the geographies in the Americas, we're seeing very robust demand for TrueBeam and Edge course but as well Halcyon in the Americas has been very strong. And we also saw in the quarter a very significant growth in software and services.","In EMEA, as Gary mentioned, there are six quarter of double-digit growth. Last year that was mostly - last year that was kind of in every geography of Europe, might see on the first quarter it was a little bit more emerging market growth, we think that that is going to continue. That's been Central Europe, Middle East, Saudi Arabia, Africa, and India, those have all been strong. And we think that that's going to continue, so we don't see that changing.","In APAC, we talked a lot about China here; we've seen pretty good activity in Southeast Asia, Australia has been a little quiet, but strong growth across Asia. Maybe just one other comment on the Americas, the Americas has - that was a huge quarter for the Americas and the trailing 12 months now is 7% for the Americas. So that's some renewed strength, and it's not just one quarter to celebrate, but it's kind of some sustained growth in the Americas, so that's very good. And then maybe just a reminder, our share reporting is one quarter lag, so our 16% print is not yet included in the number.","Yes, and then maybe from a market standpoint, and you guys ask a question maybe this is preempting the question a little bit, are we seeing a replacement cycle, acceleration what's going on? I think we are seeing a little bit of that in the Americas. I think Halcyon with the speed with which it goes in, it's ease-of-use, it's replacing some of this kind of really old freestanding market in the Americas; we might be seeing a little bit of an acceleration in the replacement cycle in the Americas.","Brandon Henry","Okay, very helpful. And just one other question on operating margins, it looks like that fell a little short of consensus in the first quarter, so can you spend some time discussing the reasons there with just the street in this mall and that the tariff impact in the first quarter and then what gives you confidence that your operating margins can reaccelerate that kind of 17% to 18% range for the remainder of the year?","Gary Bischoping","Yes, it's a little bit I think of we're trying to make sure we're all have the tariffs falling through here. Tariff is about 100 basis point impact from a year-over-year point of view. The other two big elements running around in that, Brandon, are this year we had ASTRO fall in our Q1, and you combine that with the acquisitions and investments we made starting kind of Q2, Q3 of last year. Those are now fully flowing in the Q1 of this year. Those two ASTRO as well as acquisitions and the investments we made and that are now flowing in Q1 of this year that's about 40 basis points. And there's about another 60 basis points of gross margin largely driven by geographic mix as we outlined that geographic mix next last year, our Q1 in the Americas was 20% year-on-year growth. And that's going to print a higher margin number in the overall portfolio and the rise to tides last year. This year, Americas not as strong and Europe was stronger. So when you mix that way you just get a little pressure on the margin rate at the transaction level, we're fine.","When you think about how do we accrete from here to there, as we exit the full-year and get to that guidance number there is a couple of things; one is that Proton business will keep putting on service sites, and so we'll start to see some more improvements in profitability there. Two is we won't see that, you know, that expense you had in Q1 here. As we roll out to the rest of the year three years we'll start to see some of OpEx scale and the R&D scales we talked about and then some of the tariff mitigation actions explicitly will be in the second half of the year. We've outlined so, you know as we've said we're reiterating that guidance range and we've operational actions in place to deliver that.","Brandon Henry","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from\u2026","Dow Wilson","Operator, are you still there? Hello. Operator, are you still on the line. We are live [indiscernible]. Good day everybody on the call, we show it still is live here in Palo Alto. So we're going to stay on the line. We assume we've had - if you can hear us we assume we've had a disconnect somehow at the operator level, and getting back on. Here we go. Operator, are we on?","Operator","Yes, I'm here. I apologize. Can you hear me?","Dow Wilson","Yes, we can.","Operator","Okay. I apologize for that technical difficulty. We do have Jason Bednar from Robert W. Baird to ask a question.","Dow Wilson","Hi, Jason.","Jason Bednar","Hi, good afternoon guys.","Dow Wilson","Not sure what you did to the line there, but glad we are back on.","Jason Bednar","Yes, have that effect on a lot of people, I think. I wanted to start with EMEA, past several quarters, you have been pretty impressive in related system and unprecedented, so just wondering if there is any insight you can give us, maybe to the pacing of backlog or tenders that are underway in EMEA.","Dow Wilson","You have seen from us, I would say EMEA is kind of the Tale of Two Cities. On the one hand, Western Europe, core Europe is pretty much a replacement market and that flows pretty fast, that's clearly what we have seen from a velocity, a backlog point of view is kind of the some of the calls we had last year as we talked through some of the faster pacing of the European market, the emerging market, market - the emerging market segment is not quite that fast, more of those volts tend to be new or waiting on a or waiting on a new volt to be built. So it's kind of a function of what mix fits us and what timing I would say especially in the last half of last year we saw an acceleration of that kind of core Europe market and thus pacing picked up.","I would say over time when you kind of look at the numbers, our the quarter in Europe was very good, constant currency growth of 17%, in the trailing 12-month constant currency growth 14%, so it's been pretty solid for a while, I think we are still pretty bullish about what we see in our funnel both segment of the market have been growing, we have seen a lot of replacements in conventional Europe and in our emerging market piece of that geography really, really good growth and we certainly don't see that slowing down at all.","Gary Bischoping","Just one point to add, the data point on, we have given before as a percent of revenue that comes from orders in the previous six months. In Europe, in Q1 of 2019, it's it was still a strong 59%, and so\u2026","Jason Bednar","Yes.","Gary Bischoping","And so, that was versus Q1 of 2018 at 64%, so we're still seeing the nice execution in that flow through in the book. And really I would add to Dow's comments is this is the result of sustained investments we've made on the sales and marketing front in and across the region. We've put in several teams was software as well as competitive takeout teams as well as replacement teams and they're delivering across the board and therefore the consistent results that we've seen now here for six quarters so. Nice team, nice job by the team executing across Europe.","Dow Wilson","Yes. And maybe one of the small thing to add that we've spent spend a lot of time talking about China and the new quota and all the activity going on, well the same things happening in India. The Indian government's really been outside of the market in India for a long time. They've had other health priorities and gradually they're turning their health priorities to cancer. The Modicare, that the new proposal for healthcare investment there looks to be expanding and we'll probably be targeting a lot more cancer as well. So I think we'll see some acceleration in that very good market growth in India for a while now, but I think we're going to see that accelerate as well.","Jason Bednar","Okay. That's very helpful, guys. Just one other, one other follow-up on here and just on the Proton service revenue in this and\/or the segment profitability, Gary, I think you referenced to make a delay in Proton segment breakeven, they've been no longer falling into this year. I mean, that getting pushed into fiscal 2020 or further beyond that and then should we interpret this adjustment in your breakeven target being part of your original guidance range or it's now being absorbed by maybe a little bit stronger than expected oncology performance?","Dow Wilson","Let me just comment on that, order piece of that and Gary can take the rest of it. In 2017, we had seven orders, in 2018, two orders. And for us to achieve our breakeven targets, we need some orders. So that's where we are clearly net order in the quarter. And as we think the number of orders that we take this year is probably somewhere between 2017 and 2018 actually somewhere between the two and the seven. We feel pretty good about that that as well as probably second half loaded. And so business is little bit lumpy and that's going to affect a little bit the timing of our kind of breakeven target. And with that, Gary, you can comment on the rest of the P&L.","Gary Bischoping","Yes. I would say the teams are executing across the rest of the P&L very well from where we're spending R&D dollars to controlling expense, to the pursuits that are required to pull deals out of the pipe which by the way we think is strong and probably second half weighted, but still strong. So we'll kind of see how this plays out I'm not going to guide you beyond what we talked about already. And like we said the teams that are out there executing and we still believe in that business and we'll continue to put investment in Flash and go down that path as an option on the back of getting the rest of the service rooms up and running and realizing the profitability from that. So, we'll continue to make this play and continue to invest in the business accordingly as we go through time.","Jason Bednar","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Dow Wilson","Hey, Tycho.","Tycho Peterson","Thanks. Hey. Maybe I'll start with the Halcyon orders, you had - 84 last quarter, can you maybe just talk to, was it pull forward last quarter and then as we think about the kV launch and Halcyon, how meaningful is that in terms of new adoption?","Dow Wilson","The good news is, we're seeing very nice uptake of the kV option on the quarter, more than half of our orders were KV. That gives us a little bit of price and margin. So we're, we're excited about that. You know I think as I mentioned in the script the 20 units is up 60% over last year. So, you know, it's good, good, good trend overall. Yes. We have gigantic Q4. I don't think that there was any pent up demand in there. I think that's just been kind of a track we're on is very much in keeping with what we were planning to and kind of on track with you know, with our internal plan.","Tycho Peterson","Right. And then just a couple others on China, you know appreciate all the color there, are you able to say what is kind of embedded in guidance for fulfillment there? And can you talk it all kind on kind of conversion of orders into revenues for the China market?","Dow Wilson","Yes, in terms of guidance, nothing there from a revenues perspective or an earnings line with regard to that, just going to take some time to translate into orders and orders into revenue. Look, I think the teams are out there executing we've got the field covered. Fantastic, I was actually in China for the users meeting and it was quite an event very, very well done and received and we got key opinion leaders there on stage talking about the quality and the technical capabilities of our, of our fully integrated platform and how it's going to help them solve the cancer burden there. And so it really is resonating clinically there in China, and you know, we're excited to see this play out.","Tycho Peterson","And then, Gary, can you comment on cash flow conversion looks like cash flow, is down about 21% are there other levers you can kind of pull there to improve that going forward?","Gary Bischoping","Yes. We're still on track to the guidance number that we had outlined and, yes a few things slip over the finish line here from Q1 into Q2 and we have line of sight continuing to see improvement and get to that guidance number.","Dow Wilson","And the other thing we said in the script as well as we did have some firm - we got a pretty big revenue bill, the great momentum in the market. So a big chunk of that was inventory.","Gary Bischoping","Thanks, Dow.","Tycho Peterson","All right, and then, just lastly for Dow on adaptive any - I mean, how should we think about kind of timelines there and then, once that gets added to Halcyon, how do we think about the trade-off with TrueBeam and risks if there is a cannibalization?","Dow Wilson","I mean the short version is we're still in active development on adaptive. We showed it as a works in progress. We had several hundred. I don't know what the count was 300 customers come through at ASTRO, 400 customers come through at ASTRO and what they really like about our product was the workflow. To a person they're saying, wow you're ahead of everybody in terms of how you're thinking of implementing adaptive in the workflow keeping it within or under a 15 minute time slot and really delivering both the clinical effectiveness and the productivity. So people were able to see actual development software, not PowerPoint. And so, the short version is I think we've still got ways to go, probably end of this fiscal year. I think it's a vision that's resonating with folks and we will probably have a big full FDA approved commercial launch in the next 12 plus-ish months.","Tycho Peterson","All right, thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Vijay Kumar","Hey, guys, thanks for taking\u2026","Dow Wilson","Hi, Vijay.","Vijay Kumar","Congrats on a really nice quarter frontier. I had a couple of questions, just to maybe a couple of housekeeping, one, I guess, what was the acquisition contribution in the Q, and for the guidance, can you give some color on what the FX assumption is?","Dow Wilson","Let me let me talk about the first part of this. First of all we really like the acquisitions as we did last year. I think, strategically they've really helped us out, some of the channel acquisitions two years ago we made an acquisition in Poland we think that's paying off for us big time we made an acquisition last year in Taiwan, that's starting to have little impact. The short version is these are all pretty small. They're on their business case and they're probably immaterial in the overall results of the acquisition we made last year of humediQ looks to be very good, we've got some nice orders momentum on that, but any revenue and margin impact is kind of immaterial at this point. Gary, anything else you want to add?","Gary Bischoping","No, that's right, Dow, continue to access business case as well, as the spending required to make sure, we deliver those platforms, so you know a lot of them are product driven and then technology driven, so we'll continue to invest in those solutions as we pull them through the product roadmap, so, more to come, Vijay.","Vijay Kumar","Got you, and then maybe a couple of quick follow-ups; one, Dow, on interesting comment in the slide deck, right, the cash from operations down, but the drivers were really inventories sub and that seems to be signaling you guys are prepping to fulfill some orders in the back half year. So, I'm just curious again given Q1 strength and then the guidance where I'm curious with the cash from operations and inventory commentary how we were sort of thinking about the back half trajectory?","Dow Wilson","I mean, you see our revenue guidance, revenue guidance was 5% to 8% we've reaffirmed that today. When you look at that revenue guidance and think about the tariff and FX hit, it's really about 150 basis points higher than that. So you're really talking about something that's more in the call it six to 10 range rather than five to eight range by the time you kind of take the revenue impact of the currency headwind and the tariff headwinds. So the revenue number is pretty big. We are building some inventory, we want to make sure we deliver on the revenue guidance and if we have a little extra inventory to take care of some upside. So be it. We see momentum continuing into 2020. So we want to build ahead here and that's what we're doing.","Vijay Kumar","And just maybe one last one on the margins here, Gary, the Q1 start, am I correct in assuming there was no benefit from the cost offsets in Q1 in the back half as we're looking at '18 or maybe even above the high end of the annual guidance?","Gary Bischoping","Yes, Vijay, that's correct. In Q1, there was gross equals net from an overall tariffs impact of $11 million. And as we said, the rest of the gross impact we think will be spread out throughout, pretty evenly throughout the rest of the year with the tariff mitigation actions to the back half of the year. Therefore, we'll see us ramp into that 17% to 18% overall guidance as we go through time.","Vijay Kumar","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Great, thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back to Mr. Wilson for any closing comments.","Dow Wilson","Yes, thank you. I'm very pleased with the progress we've made in the first quarter towards executing on our long-term - value creation strategy. We maintain the momentum we built last year, delivered exceptional orders growth and are on track to achieve our 2019 targets. Looking forward, we'll continue to invest in our growth initiatives and remain committed to innovating new technologies to drive towards the ultimate victory, a world without a fear of cancer. Thank you for joining us today.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."],"21539":["Varian Medical Systems, Inc.

To hear a telephone replay, please dial 1-877-660 -6853 from inside the U.S. or 201-612-7415 from outside the U.S. and enter the confirmation code 13669524. The telephone replay will be available through Friday, October 27.","At this time, I would like to turn the program over to Mr. Michael Bruff, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Michael Bruff","Thank you operator. Good afternoon and welcome to Varian's fourth quarter fiscal 2017 conference call. Joining me today on the call are Varian's President and Chief Executive Officer, Dow Wilson and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Bischoping. Dow will share his thoughts on our results and long-term strategy. And Gary will cover our operating and financial results in more detail.","On the Varian Investor Relations website, you can find our fiscal fourth quarter press release and web deck which are intended to provide additional perspective and details. Included in these documents is a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. We report non-GAAP earnings to provide comparisons of operational performance excluding unusual items. Unless otherwise stated, all financial results discussed are non-GAAP and from continuing operations. All growth rates are year-on-year and any references to orders are gross orders. Also, note that we may provide growth rates in constant currency allowing assessment of the business excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations.","As we noted in previous SEC filings, Varian, like other companies, is required to adopt revenue accounting standard and codification 606. We intend to implement this new standard in our first quarter of fiscal 2018. Our results for fiscal 2017 that we disclose today and any forward-looking statements, including guidance follow accounting standard codification 605. Once we adopt the new standard, we will hold a conference call to provide additional clarity on how the change will impact our reporting and guidance. At that time, we will also provide restated numbers for 2017.","And finally, during this call many statements made may be considered forward-looking statements. Our use of words and phrases such as outlook, believe, expect, anticipate, could, should, will, promising and similar expressions are intended to identify those statements which represent our current judgment on future performance or other future matters. While we believe them to be reasonable based on information currently available to us, these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements in this presentation and discussion because of new information, future events or otherwise.","Now with all that said, I will turn it over to Dow.","Dow Wilson","Thanks Mike and good afternoon everyone. Today I will devote most of my prepared comments to the key milestones we achieved this past year. And I also want to share with you our new strategic framework for driving sustainable long-term value creation.","First let me touch on our fourth quarter results, which concludes a transformative year. Total company revenues declined 1%. Oncology revenue grew 1%, while the proton business declined 23% in the quarter. GAAP earnings per share was $0.89, down 10%. Non-GAAP earnings per share grew 5% to $1.09. Gary will provide more details on the drivers of these results during his discussion.","Total orders for the company were $1 billion, growing 11%. Oncology orders were up 7% supported by the healthy ramp-up of new products. Halcyon, our new image guided IMRT treatment platform had 23 orders in the quarter, 12 orders in EMEA, 10 orders in North Africa and one in APAC. Additionally, orders growth was positively impacted by double-digit services growth and upgrades for hardware and software, including 40 orders for HyperArc, our high definition radiotherapy technology. BRIC markets grew 5% in the fourth quarter and 16% in the full year.","Services revenue grew 9% with strong growth across all geographies. Our LinAcc installed base grew 4% over the year exiting the year at 7,833 installs globally. Orders of our software products and services grew double-digit in the quarter and for the year. We continue to see accelerated uptake of Varian software solutions building on the strength of our Eclipse treatment planning and ARIA oncology information systems. Newer applications such as RapidPlan and multi-criteria optimization, our InSightive analytics solution, our 360 Oncology cloud-based cancer operating platform and the Velocity longitudinal cancer imaging solution are fueling the enthusiasm for Varian software solutions.","Since we acquired Velocity just three years ago, orders have nearly tripled and customer installations have more than doubled to 450 institutions worldwide managing over 50 million cancer patient images. We are very pleased with the customer uptake and demand for our software solutions and expect to see global installations continue to grow.","In proton therapy, we booked two orders in the quarter including the Concord Medical Proton Center in Guangzhou, China for $52 million and HCG in India for $19 million. Orders growth was 94%.","And one final thought on the fourth quarter, while Varian did not experience any material financial impact due to the hurricanes in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico or the wildfires in Northern California, we are very concerned about and have the deepest sympathy for the people in those areas. We continue to work closely with our customers in these regions to minimize disruption in their operations and want to say thank you to our Varian team members who went above and beyond in getting some of these facilities back to taking care of patients.","Looking more broadly at fiscal 2017. We took meaningful actions to transform our company. In January, we successfully completed the spinoff of Varex which allows us to focus exclusively on cancer care solutions. In May, we introduced the Halcyon treatment platform, which is designed to extend the availability of high-quality cancer care globally. Since the introduction, we have received 50 orders across 15 countries. Installations are progressing well and the first patient was treated at the University of Pennsylvania on September 13. In August, HyperArc treated its first patients in Negrar, Italy after receiving the CE Mark that same month. FDA clearance followed in September. We finished the year with six new proton therapy orders, bringing the total number of proton customers to 21.","Finally at ASTRO last month, we launched our new brand which defines the fresh focus for our company and is consistent with our long-term strategy. It expresses our Varian spirit, ambitions and mission to combine the ingenuity of people with the power of data and technology to achieve new victories against cancer. Our long-term growth and value creation strategy ensure that we have the right focus and capabilities to capitalize on industry trends. We intend to leverage our scale and financial strength to selectively broaden our capabilities as we transform our company to become the global leader in multidisciplinary integrated cancer care solutions.","To achieve these long-term objectives, we are focused on three growth initiatives. First, strengthen our leadership in radiation therapy. We are committed to the development and deployment of high-quality industry-leading innovation in this space. As an example, the ServiceTrak Imaging 2017 report recently announced that radiation oncology professionals rank Varian the leader in eight categories, including overall manufacturer performance, overall system performance and overall service performance. The report also showed Varian with a net promoter score of 75, which is over two times higher than our nearest competitor. These results along with our recent launches of Halcyon, HyperArc and 360 Oncology reflect our commitment to deliver world-class solutions in the fight against cancer.","Our second growth initiative is to extend our global footprint. Delivering world-class treatment platforms such as Halcyon with a lower total cost of ownership, faster installation times, smaller footprint requirements and the greater ease of operation enables us to touch more patients globally. And proton therapy too continues to expand its footprint. Through the end of this year, we have 21 customers in 13 different countries of which five are operational and 16 in varying stages of construction.","Third, expand into other addressable markets. This includes other modalities, software and services as we continue to build a comprehensive cancer care ecosystem across the patient journey. A proof point here is our 360 Oncology SaaS solution, which reflects our recent entry into the oncology care coordination and clinical decision support market. This broader oncology focused platform enables better, more informed decisions across the multidisciplinary teams engaged in that patient's journey.","We have also made select investments in companies such as Grail in the field of liquid biopsy and Fusion Pharmaceuticals in the field of radiotherapeutics. Investments such as these are important as we continue to innovate and look beyond our core market. We have the financial discipline and flexibility to continue investing in growth opportunities both organically and inorganically enabling us to expand into other markets over time.","Based on our company estimates and reported results, Varian has 54% share of the $5.3 billion global radiation oncology market gaining one point of share for the trailing four quarters ending in our fiscal third quarter. We expect this market to grow at about 4% compounded annual growth rate to $6.3 billion over the next five years. Executing on our growth initiatives, we expect to grow share in addressable markets such as in cancer care coordination and operating information systems, which is an estimated $2 billion market today and is expected to grow at a double-digit growth rate to $6 billion over the next five years. Combining the core radiation oncology market with these addressable opportunities, Varian is operating in markets projected to be $12 billion in the next five years.","Achieving our long-term strategy is a multi-year journey. As such, our targets for fiscal year 2018 support sustainable long-term value creation. Thus, we expect fiscal year 2018 results within the following ranges: Revenue growth from 2% to 4%; net earnings per diluted share from $4.20 to $4.32.","I will turn it over to Gary now who will provide more context on the fourth quarter financials as well as the fiscal year 2018 guidance.","Gary Bischoping","Thanks Dow and hello everyone. I have framed my comments today in the context of our long-term growth and value creation strategy, which includes balancing growth, profitability and liquidity. So let me start with growth.","Companywide revenue was $739 million in the fourth quarter, down 1% in dollars and down 2% in constant currency. For the full year, revenue of $2.7 billion was up 2% in both dollars and in constant currency. We ended the year with $3.5 billion in backlog, up 10%. For the fourth quarter, oncology revenue was $686 million, up 1% in both dollars and in constant currency. Orders were $964 million, up 7% in dollars and in constant currency.","Taking a closer look at our oncology business results. In the Americas, fourth quarter revenue grew 2% in dollars and in constant currency. Orders were $489 million, up 1% in dollars and 2% in constant currency. North America orders grew 8% supported by key wins in the quarter including Barnes-Jewish Healthcare, which ordered one Halcyon system, four TrueBeams and software packages for five centers in their network. We continue to see strong multisystem orders from a variety of healthcare customers such as Spectrum Health, MultiCare, Trinity and Western Connecticut. A slight correction to Dow's opening comments. We had overall 10 Halcyon orders in North America during the quarter, not in North Africa.","In Latin America, orders were down 46% due to several tenders pushing out, mainly from public-sector deals. However Brazil had solid performance highlighted by $9 million order with [indiscernible] and a $6 million order with the Clinic of Oncology and Radiotherapy of [indiscernible].","Asia-Pacific revenue declined 5% in dollars and 4% in constant currency. Orders were $155 million, declining 10% in dollars and 9% in constant currency. Orders declined double digits in the Japan market primarily due to continued market softness which was offset by solid double digit growth in other countries. Our first Halcyon system in Korea was ordered by a non-hospital. In Australia, we received a treatment planning system order from Peter MacCallum Cancer Center in Melbourne worth $16 million over 10 years. Lastly in the region, in China we maintained our market leadership position with robust double digit growth.","In our Europe, Middle East, India and Africa geography, revenue grew 3% and was flat in constant currency. Orders grew 32% in dollars and 29% in constant currency to $321 million in the fourth quarter. Growth was balanced across mature and emerging markets in the region. In Western Europe, an $18 million order at a network of clinics in France supported this 45% growth in the quarter. In India, strong double digit orders growth in the quarter was supported by a $15 million order from West Bengal for three TrueBeam and two VitalBeam systems. Across the geography, we booked 12 Halcyon orders in the quarter.","Turning to full year results. Oncology revenue of $2.5 billion was up 1% in dollars and in constant currency. Orders were $2.9 billion, up 7% in dollars and in constant currency. And backlog grew 9% over the year ending at $3.2 billion. By geography, Americas orders grew 3% for the full year, driven by strong North America performance of 6%. APAC orders grew 7% and Europe orders grew 14% overall, increasing its geographical mix to 30%, up two points from last year. Overall, we are pleased with our full year performance and strength in our oncology business, as evidenced by our LinAcc installed base growing 4% for the full year with a strong distribution of new units installed across all three geographies.","Our proton therapy business posted revenues of $52 million in the fourth quarter, down 23% from a year ago but in line with company expectations. We booked two orders during the quarter, bringing the total number of orders for the year to six, half of which were in international markets. For the full year, revenue was $182 million, up 12%. We ended the year with $323 million in backlog, up 18% year-on-year.","Turning to profitability. Total company fourth quarter gross margin rate decreased 50 basis points to 42.3%. This included a $2 million or 30 basis point unfavorable adjustment to estimated project costs in our proton business. However for the full year, gross margin rate increased 87 basis points to 43.5%.","Oncology fourth quarter gross margin increased $1.6 million, but the rate decreased 26 basis points to 45%. Strong services revenue mix within the quarter was offset by lower product gross margin rate in the quarter, primarily due to country and product mix. It is worth noting that at a country level average selling prices held relatively steady. Also, within the quarter, we recorded a $3 million customs duty related charge in Brazil. Full year oncology gross margin increased 161 basis points to 46%, primarily driven by increased service mix and realization of ongoing efforts to optimize the supply chain.","Looking at proton therapy. Fourth quarter gross margin dollars were down $9 million, including the impact of the $2 million adjustment to estimated project costs. Full year gross margin dollars were down 36%. Fourth quarter SG&A expenses were $131 million, up $11 million or 9% and 18% of revenue. This included a $5 million bad debt expense. A quick reminder that the fourth quarter of 2016 included a favorable $4 million bad debt release. And since the first quarter of this year, we have consistently reduced SG&A costs as a percent of revenue but there is more work to do. On a GAAP basis, fourth quarter depreciation and amortization was $18 million and full year was $77 million.","Investment will continue to be a driver of our long-term growth and value creation strategy. In the quarter, we invested $52 million in R&D or 7% of revenue. R&D expenses for the full year were $210 million, up 5% and representing 5% of revenue.","Turning to earnings. Fourth quarter operating earnings results were $131 million or 18% of revenue, declining 11%. The decline is primarily driven by bad debt expense of $5 million, Brazil customs duty related charges of $3 million, the $2 million adjustment to estimated project costs in the proton business and lower proton business gross margin. EPS in the quarter was $1.09 and our diluted share count in the quarter was 92.6 million shares.","For the full year, operating earnings of $437 million or 16.4% of revenue declined 8%. Our effective tax rate was 23.6% and EPS was $3.60. These results include the fourth quarter items I mentioned previously and the impact from the first quarter of $38 million accounts receivable reserve related to the proton therapy business. On a GAAP basis, Varian took a $13 million charge in the fourth quarter related to the California Proton Treatment Center or CPTC in San Diego because of a decrease in expected operating cash flows and an increase in incremental financing needs arising out of the transition of the center from Scripps to a white label regional center, which was an agreement executed in September.","During the quarter, we performed a review of this new agreement, including expected EBITDA amounts, timing of the expected municipal bond financing and the amount of new senior debt required. In comparing that to the analysis performed in the first quarter of 2017, it was determined that the present value of cash flows expected to be collected by Varian was less than the carrying value of the CPTC loan balances. Thus we recorded an impairment charge in the fourth quarter.","Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $716 million and debt of $350 million. Cash flow from operations was $130 million in the fourth quarter and $399 million for the full year. We are pleased to see continued improvement in DSO for our oncology business which was down one day from the prior quarter and down six days from our second quarter. We will continue to focus on operational discipline and the cash conversion cycle.","In addition to R&D, other investments in the quarter included $18.7 million in CapEx and $25 million to repurchase 250,000 shares of our stock. As of the end of the fourth quarter, we had 5.25 million shares remaining under our existing repurchase authorization.","Now let's talk about FY 2018. As Dow mentioned, we have a long-term growth and increase strategy supported by initiatives to strengthen our leadership in radiation therapy, extend our global footprint and expand into new addressable markets. We continue to invest in high quality, innovation and building new capabilities in software services and big data while driving operational efficiency and disciplined capital management. We will track key performance indicators to evaluate results but always in the context of progress towards our long-term value creation objectives.","Therefore we are deploying a framework across the business to drive a culture of ownership in evaluating operational trade-offs, capital allocation and investment decisions. We will also incorporate this into our incentive design to achieve the desired outcomes over the long-term. Given the duration our sales, research and development and product cycles, we believe that a trailing four quarter view is a better indicator of our progress toward achieving our long-term strategy. Thus we are moving to annual guidance for fiscal 2018 and are aligning our financial practices accordingly.","As Dow said earlier, for fiscal 2018 we expect revenue growth from 2% to 4% and net earnings per diluted share from $4.20 to $4.32. Going forward, we will also provide full year guidance on operating earnings, cash flow from operations, tax rate and share count. For fiscal year 2018, we see the following for these items. Operating earnings between 18% to 19% of revenue, cash flow from operations between $475 million and $550 million and a 23% tax rate for the year and no change to share count year-over-year.","Thank you. And now let's go to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Baird. Please go ahead.","Jeff Johnson","Thank you. Good evening guys. Can you hear me okay?","Dow Wilson","Hi Jeff. Loud and clear.","Jeff Johnson","Great. So Gary or Dow, I guess for you, just looking at the revenue guidance, again with the 2% to 4%, you did have 7% oncology order growth this past year, 11% I think companywide with a strong year in proton. I typically think of service and software contributing a couple points to fiscal 2018 revenue growth. So why are hardware revenue, I guess, essentially being guided flat to maybe up only slightly this coming year, given how strong the order growth was in the past year?","Dow Wilson","Why don't I start and then Gary can clean up here a little bit. As we said on the call, we are guiding to 2% to 4%. When you look at 2016 and 2017, we had 1% growth in 2016 and 7% growth in 2017. We have had a good orders year in 2016. That was a good orders year. And you saw the results on the quarter were also positive. With the increased mix in our EMEA backlog and 15 to 18 months cycle time on the backlog we have taken a pretty pragmatic view on our growth guidance. And at the highest level, that's how we are kind of penciling it out.","Gary, anything to add there?","Gary Bischoping","Yes. Look Jeff, we are coming out of a transitional year as well and the spin of Varex, new product launches with Halcyon and HyperArc, our new brand. We are going to continue to watch our conversion metrics as we go through the year. But like Dow said, this is a pragmatic approach to revenue guidance at 2% to 4% for the year.","Jeff Johnson","Okay. And Gary, I guess there are two follow up on that. One, is there any currency embedded in that? By my model, it's maybe 1% to 2% tailwind. I just want to confirm that. And then two, again it does seem to me the trailing 12 month order growth has been stronger. And maybe I am wondering if there is any chance with Halcyon out there, are any orders kind of sitting in backlog a little bit longer than usual, hospitals reevaluating, do they want to convert from one system to Halcyon instead? Or is there no extension going on in that kind of backlog exit timing?","Dow Wilson","Yes. We are not seeing extension in the backlog timing. We are seeing a little mix. So as we said last quarter, we are seeing a little mix to more vaults outside of our developed markets. And those, as people build new vaults that takes a little bit longer. So we might have a little bit of a geographic mix that way.","Gary Bischoping","Yes. Just to build on that a little bit and I will answer your currency question just thereafter. The market we just came out of for the trailing 12 months through the third quarter, market growth was 2.1%. And so we just guided to 2% to 4%. And then our orders growth over that same period of time is 3.4%. So again we feel like that guiding in 2% to 4% is a pragmatic approach to that number.","And then to answer on the currency side is no. We assume no currency impact next year.","Jeff Johnson","Okay. Well, I will let others jump in. Thanks guys.","Dow Wilson","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Hazan from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Amit Hazan","Thanks. Good afternoon guys.","Dow Wilson","Hi Amit","Amit Hazan","Let me start with you, Gary. And I think just given it's your first quarter out of the gate, people are going to want to know what surprised you causing the miss, given it's the first quarter and people are going to want to know why they should be confident in 2018 guidance range given this miss for the first quarter?","Gary Bischoping","Yes. Thanks for the question, Amit. From the overall revenue guidance perspective, we did make the revenue guidance in the quarter and felt good about the momentum exiting the quarter here in the second-half from an orders growth perspective. And so again we think 2% to 4% of revenue guidance is pragmatic. From an earnings per share perspective. I think the way to think about it is, as you look back on all of 2017 and you look back into the fourth quarter, there are things that impacted the business that was a result of good operational rigor that will continue.","Those things in the fourth quarter would include the bad debt expense, it would include the Brazil's customs duty related expense and the adjustment of estimated proton business project costs. That's about $10 million there in cost that, again, good operational rigor that drove us to incur those cost in the period. But as we work our way through the operational rigor, I am sure we will continue to improve from a results perspective as we move forward. So $4.20 to $4.34 from an earnings per share guidance perspective feels about right given the operational excellence that I have seen in the business here in the last five or six months that I have been at Varian.","Amit Hazan","So let me just follow up on that. It's another guidance question on operating margin and shares. So the operating margin guidance actually doesn't show much of a benefit over the periods in fiscal 2017 that would be apples-to-apples. So I am just wondering if you can give us some puts and takes to think about for operating margin and why you are not able to show additional benefits in fiscal 2018? And then separately on the share count, just give us an idea of, this would be the first time Varian hasn't bought back shares as long as I can remember. So just what your thoughts are behind that lack of share purchase in fiscal 2018? Thanks.","Gary Bischoping","Sure. So as it relates to the operating earnings margin rates, look, we are looking for targeting and driving sustainable improvement in our supply chain and operating expenses. This range that we gave would infer 50 to maybe 70 or even 100 basis points to the top end of the range of operating margin improvement in FY 2018 over FY 2017, when you take a look at things on a apples-to-apples basis. We are still trying to achieve that 18% to 22% aspirational target that we have got in front of us. And we also want to be cognizant of the fact that we want to ensure the ability to invest in growth options organically that we see in front of us. So that's the nature of the guidance from an 18% to 19% perspective on operating earnings.","As it relates to share repurchase, there will be share repurchase just like there was in the fourth quarter, right. We did $25 million to retire 250,000 shares. What I said in my guidance is that share count would be flat year-over-year. So there will be due to restricted shares and stock option exercises, there will be shares that come into the share count and we will endeavor to keep that flat year-over-year with our share repurchase activity in FY 2018. And again, the overall objective here from how we deploy capital is, one organically like I just said, two is look at inorganic options. We feel like we have good financial flexibility relative to our capitalizing on inorganic activities that are in front of us. And then third and only thereafter, we would execute on the share repurchase side.","Amit Hazan","All right. Thanks guys.","Gary Bischoping","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tycho Peterson","Hi. Thanks. Dow, I have got one question on the software side, given that that's driving a lot of the growth in orders here. Can you just get us comfortable with the trajectory here that that's sustainable? It seems like most of your installed base has RapidPlan at this point. I know obviously you have got HyperArc and 360 Oncology now. So help us think about the sustainability of the software growth side?","Dow Wilson","Yes. We had very good quarter and a very good year. Both fourth quarter and the fiscal year had strong double-digit growth rates in software. Maybe a little color, RapidPlan, we have 1,200 licenses ordered to-date, about 500 customers. The treatment planning installed base is 5,000 to 6,000 systems. So we still got a long way to go there. InSightive, we have 250 customers ordered with about 100 in clinical use. Again, our ARIA install base is 4,500 to 5,000. So we have got big opportunity to go there.","Velocity, while it's tripled it still is a pretty small business, but we very much like the trajectory of that business. So we have got I think 450 customers on Velocity now again an installed base of 7,800 machines. We have got a long way to go there. So our aspirational goal here is to see if we can drive this double-digit growth for the next four or five years and we think that this has moved off the historical lower growth and the trajectory is upward. So we like what we see on software side.","Tycho Peterson","And then I know you guys haven't given guidance on orders for Halcyon, But can you tell us how the 23 tracks relative to your expectations? And as we think about a lot of the emerging market customers and capital budgeting, when do you really think the product cycle could start to take off?","Dow Wilson","Sure. And apologies again for throwing in North Africa instead of North America in the call. Reception has been outstanding. It's ahead of our internal plans. We have taken 50 orders, as I mentioned in the call, since the introduction. We very much like what we are seeing. About half of them are for greenfield sites. So these are new vaults going in. We like that. So we have also had a handful of competitive takeouts. And we have also had a handful of units go in where vault fit has been a factor. As you know, this is kind of a stealth launch that we did in May. So people are still lining their budgets up. Our funnel looks terrific. Of the 50 orders we have taken, we have only taken three in Asia-Pacific. We do not have clearance yet in China or Japan and hope to have that into Q2, early Q3 next year. So we very much like what we see. The first treatments have been very successful. Our customers are very happy with what they are seeing out of the machine.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then on the longer term growth strategy you outlined, is the incremental spending starting to get baked in here in 2018? And what are your competitive advantages that you see in areas like diagnostic imaging and precision medicine? It seems a little bit far field relative to what you have historically done?","Dow Wilson","As Garry mentioned, it starts first with our core business. We have got bad terrific core business and we believe we have very significant opportunities to keep driving organic investment in R&D in our core business. Second, there are some inorganic opportunities out there. We see those in the first phase, maybe building off our software business, seeing how we can get more longitudinal with the patient through their cancer journey. And I would say, those are kind of the top two.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Anthony Petrone","Thanks. Maybe just back to Halcyon and HyperArc. Maybe on Halcyon where pricing has settled out, I know you had a range there of $2 million to $4 million. So how's that settling out? And is there a delta between U.S. pricing and oUS pricing to settle out? And then on the HyperArc, maybe with the margin contribution from a HyperArc upgrade isn't, what point do you see that benefiting the P&L? And then I have got a couple of follow-ups. Thanks.","Dow Wilson","Yes. I would say, on Halcyon on pricing is meeting our expectations. So we like that. It is very configuration dependent. I would say that our U.S. customers in general are ordering a richer mix, but our average selling price is ahead of our expectations and the overall margin of the product will be accretive to company margins.","On HyperArc, Anthony, as I mentioned in the call, we have received 40 orders in Q4. So the uptake has been substantial. We have just got regulatory approval, CE Mark in August and 510(k) in September. We have done first treatments at three sites. And this version of the product is optimized for brain metastatic disease. We will have future releases for SBRT. I think the reception the product has been very good.","In terms of how this flows to the P&L, you I think again margins here will be very good. I think Halcyon will move a little faster through the backlog into customers because of its installation time and where people build new vaults will be a little different. But we have Halcyon going in as replacement, that should flow very quickly. I think HyperArc will take a little bit longer as it flows into the P&L","Anthony Petrone","And so one of the follow ups would be just a little bit on, if you expect any cannibalization of the TrueBeam as it relates to halcyon? Or will that be offset by HyperArc? And then just revisit on Japan? A little bit more color on the weakness there? What's going on behind the pressure? And what's your outlook potentially for that to normalize out? Thanks.","Dow Wilson","Yes. We have maybe a little bit of movement from TrueBeam to Halcyon. I think it's going to be very small. We have been very pleased with the reception that HyperArc has received. So I think that will be very good. And then the second part of your question was --","Anthony Petrone","On Japan weakness.","Dow Wilson","Yes. Japan has had a rough year. I think good news is, we see that bottoming out. Our market share remains. We haven't lost any share there. So we feel good about that. But that market has been down pretty substantially this past year. And you saw a little of that more in the fourth quarter. Looking forward, I do think we are seeing that bottom out and the funnel looks pretty good.","Anthony Petrone","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Isaac Ro","Good afternoon guys. Thank you. I just want to confirm on the guidance comment you guys made that that topline growth outlook you gave, 2% to 4%, that is assuming zero impact from currency.","Gary Bischoping","Yes. That's correct.","Isaac Ro","Okay. And so just if I look at where you are coming from prior year, it does imply a bit of a deceleration even though you have a new product cycle in Halcyon. So just help us reconcile, is it the extent to what you have taken a lot of share in that part of the dynamic is flowing off? Why would you see a deceleration in topline growth as the new product cycle ramps? And then second to that, any commentary on emerging marked approvals for Halcyon would be great? Thank you.","Gary Bischoping","So just so we are on the same page, we grew 2% in oncology for the full year, right. And we see now and we are guiding now, I am sorry, 1% year-on-year in oncology and so we are guiding now %2 to 4% overall for 2018. So we don't see it as a deceleration in the growth rate. We kind of see it at or better than what we did here in 2017. Again, we will continue to keep a close eye on conversion rates and the opportunities we see in front of us. But we feel that that's pragmatic growth given the orders growth rate we have seen historically over the last 12 to 18 months.","Dow Wilson","And then for emerging market approvals, the biggest two, well one in that emerging market is Japan. We think both Japan and China, we should have approvals end of Q2, our fiscal Q2, end of Q3 next year, beginning of Q3.","Let's start that over. End of Q2, beginning of Q3 next year we should have China and Japan. Those are the two largest approvals that are remaining.","Isaac Ro","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Henry from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Brandon Henry","Yes. Thanks for taking my question.","Dow Wilson","Hi Brandon.","Brandon Henry","Can you start out by talking about your expectations for free cash flow for fiscal year 2018 versus fiscal year 2017 and what's driving the expected improvement in operating cash flow for next year?","Gary Bischoping","Yes. I will certainly to cash flow from operations. And the way to think about that guidance is that the revenue and EBIT targets that we gave plus we are looking for our continued focus on the cash conversion cycle and our ability to operationally execute through improvements there. Those two combine. So working capital benefit along with the EBIT dollars trends you right into that range for FY 2018. As far as free cash flow, I am not going to comment on free cash flow today and get into CapEx and other elements of capital allocation process that we have got ahead of us. But from a cash flow from operations perspective, we feel good about that guidance that we have out there.","Brandon Henry","Okay. And then on the proton side, it looks like Varian booked another two proton therapy orders during the quarter. First half of the year, I think, was kind of a slow start but it picked up in the back half. So can you discuss your expectations for the proton market for fiscal year 2018? And is the company's bundling strategy with LinAcc and protons helping the company to win orders there?","Dow Wilson","Yes. I mean I would say, first on all on the year we booked six proton orders, so pretty good year for us. We did seven in 2015 and two in 2016. The funnel looks pretty good. So I would say, a pretty good funnel for what we are seeing. The strategy that we are going to market with is with an integrated commercial team and that is working out very well for us. And then maybe from a bit of broader product strategy. We are certainly leveraging the treatment planning and the information systems with proton therapy as well.","Brandon Henry","All right. And last question for me. You mentioned that the company is making investments in, I think, liquid biopsy and radiotherapeutics. Can you spend some time helping us understand how you are thinking about the size, the potential timing from some of these new opportunities?","Dow Wilson","Yes. For now what we really want is a seat at the table. These are small investments that we have made. We are very interested in integrating our information systems, our treatment planning. There is something very exciting emerging, who knows exactly when, but called radionics and the idea there is that patients would have a different radiation dose depending on their genetic profile. And as we look at these kind of opportunities, these would be things that we have built into our information systems and treatment planning. And so having a seat at the table is very important to us. It is a growth engine for our existing core business as well as some new business opportunities.","Brandon Henry","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have no further questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.","Dow Wilson","All right. Thank you operator. Let me leave with a few key takeaways. First, I am very excited about the opportunities for Varian. We are solely focused on cancer care solutions and well-positioned to capitalize on our strength and leadership in radiation therapy to grow market share and extend our global footprint in both mature and emerging markets. With that foundation and a long-term focus, we intend to invest in profitable growth, expand into other addressable markets and build multidisciplinary integrated cancer care solutions. We are focused on being operationally and financially disciplined, aligning our internal decision-making and incentive structure to our long-term strategy. And we have built financial flexibility to take advantage of appropriate investment opportunities. Finally and most importantly, Varian is well-positioned to positively influence the cancer care continuum for more and more patients globally every day. By bringing smarter and simpler solutions to healthcare providers, they can focus more time on what's important to all of us, their patients and together we can achieve a world without the fear of cancer. Thank you very much for joining us today.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our teleconference for today. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day."],"21480":["Varian Medical Systems (NYSE:VAR) Q1 2013 Earnings Call January 23, 2013  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Spencer R.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Spencer Sias, Vice President of Investor Relations for Varian Medical Systems.","Thank you, Mr. Sias. You may begin.","Spencer R. Sias","Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Varian Medical Systems' conference call for the first quarter of fiscal year 2013. With me are Dow Wilson, President and CEO; Elisha Finney, CFO; and Clarence Verhoef, our Corporate Controller. Dow and Elisha will summarize our results and will take your questions following the presentation.","To simplify our discussion, unless otherwise stated, all references to the quarter or year are fiscal quarters and fiscal year. Quarterly comparisons are for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 versus the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Please be advised that this presentation and discussion contains forward-looking statements or use of words and phrases such as outlook, could, should, believe, can, estimate, will, plan and similar expressions, are intended to identify those statements, which represent our current judgment on future performance or other future matters.

Some of the important risks relating to our business are described in our first quarter earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements in this presentation and discussion because of new information, future events or otherwise.","And now, here is Dow.","Dow R. Wilson","Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone. I'm pleased to report that our company's first quarter revenues and net earnings grew in line with our expectations for our major businesses and the overall company. We also hit our margin targets, excluding a $4.1 million restructuring charge in the quarter related to an enhanced retirement program. Our operating margin improved versus the year-ago quarter.","Net orders rose robustly in our X-ray Products business but declined in our Oncology business, which experienced weaker orders in Europe and Asia versus very strong year-ago results.","To summarize our results for the quarter, earnings per diluted share increased 9% to $0.86. Revenues rose 8% to $678 million. Net orders were up 21% in X-ray Products and down by 2% in Oncology Systems. Our quarter-ending backlog rose 11% to $2.8 billion. We closed the quarter with $755 million in cash and cash equivalents and $206 million of debt. I will cover the operational highlights for the quarter and let Elisha walk you through the P&L and the balance sheet.","Oncology Systems' first quarter net orders fell 2% to $477 million, with 2% growth in North America that was offset by a 4% decline across markets outside North America. North American orders grew with the help of replacements of competitive software, particularly in the area of treatment planning. We also had strategic wins at several other sites that ordered our TrueBeam system together with our software. Order activity in the U.S. appear to be affected by timing.","Looking at the last 6 months, our North American order growth was 7%, in line with the market growth we have been seeing in this region. The first quarter also may have run into some headwinds from uncertainty in Washington and reimbursement cuts at freestanding clinics.","Additionally, we have seen strong early interest in our newly introduced EDGE radiosurgery system, which received FDA clearance at the end of the quarter. This interest may have caused some customers to extend their purchasing cycle in order to evaluate this exciting new treatment option. I will touch more on EDGE in a few minutes.","Outside of North America, Oncology's overall net orders declined by 4%. This included an 11% decline in EMEA and a 1% decline in Asia that, together, offset a 33% increase in the Rest of the World, including Latin America and Australia.","In Latin America, we booked orders in 5 countries, including the first TrueBeam order in Colombia. In Asia, robust order growth in both China and Japan was offset by sharp declines in several other countries. The sales funnel in Asia continues to look good.","Net orders were down in Northern, Southern and Western Europe, as well as in the Middle East, where government purchase orders were delayed. Orders were up in Africa, where we had a key win in Algeria, and up in Eastern Europe, where we saw significant orders in Russia and Bulgaria. In addition to helping with some international sales during the quarter, the Varian and Siemens strategic partnership went live in North America in October. We believe it contributed to orders during the quarter in Germany as well.","As you know, Brazil is conducting a public tender for the purchase of more than 80 units, and we are competing for this business. To update you on the status of the tender, the Ministry of Health still expects to conduct a reverse auction, and it is continuing to state that it is a \"winner take all\" proposition for hardware, software and brachytherapy products.","Before leaving Oncology, let me touch on 2 growth drivers for the business. As I mentioned earlier, there is strong customer interest in EDGE, which we launched at ASTRO in November. We hope it becomes a game changer in the fight against lung, liver, pancreatic and other cancers that have been very difficult to treat with traditional technology. Demand for EDGE should be helped by the adoption of the new reimbursement code for thoracic radiosurgery.","Lastly, Oncology's worldwide service organizations continue to drive growth for the segment, with quarter-over-quarter double-digit increases in both orders and revenues. This now represents more than 35% of Oncology's business.","Let me turn now to X-ray Products. This business had a terrific quarter and has started the year on an especially strong note. Good order growth was driven by strong demand for our radiographic panels and high-end CT tubes. Net orders for this business grew 21% during the quarter to $133 million. Revenues grew by 18% to $133 million, and margins for this business were up 1 percentage point over the first quarter of 2012, thanks largely to continued productivity gains.","Demand for our radiographic panels was particularly strong in China, while our newer high-performance CT tubes sold extremely well in Japan as a result of apparent customer share gains in the CT market. The quarter was also helped by the early sales of new products, which included a leading edge 43 x 43 centimeter Cone Beam dynamic panel. In the next few months, we will be launching further new products, including a wireless panel and new dental panels, which would help to continue this momentum. As the panel business expands and trends in digital imaging create new tube opportunities, we remain enthusiastic about our X-ray Products business.","Switching now to the Other category, including the Security and Particle Therapy businesses, we had a quiet quarter in our Security business and no Particle Therapy orders. Net orders for the Other category were $9 million for the quarter versus $12 million in the year-ago quarter. First quarter revenues for the Other category were $21 million compared with $25 million in the year-ago quarter.","Construction work at the Scripps facility in San Diego is nearing conclusion, and commissions at the facility are slated to start treating patients by the end of the fiscal year. Although we did not book any new orders in our Particle Therapy business during the quarter, the pipeline looks good.","Before leaving the Other category, I want to inform you that we have reorganized our Security business to report in to Bob Kluge, who has been managing our successful X-ray Products business. Bob will now oversee our Security business as Senior Vice President of our 2 components businesses. Congratulations to Bob.","Now here's Elisha.","Elisha W. Finney","Thanks, Dow. Congratulations, Bob, and hello, everyone. While Dow has already covered net orders, I want to briefly talk about the constant currency growth rates for the quarter.","In comparing quarter-over-quarter exchange rates, there was a small effect from FX. Worldwide Oncology net orders declined by 2% in dollars and fell by 1% in constant currency. Oncology's North American net orders were up 2% in both dollars and in constant currency. It's -- EMEA net orders fell 11% in dollars and 8% in constant currency, and Asia was down 1% in dollars and up 1% in constant currency. Oncology net orders in the Rest of World region grew by 33% in dollars and 31% in constant currency.","First quarter revenues increased 8% to $678 million, with constant currency growth of 9%. Oncology Systems posted an 8% increase in revenues, and X-ray Products posted a gain of 18%. Revenues from businesses in the Other category declined by $3 million.","Particle Therapy revenues booked on a percentage-of-completion basis was down from the year-ago quarter as expected, reflecting the near completion of our installation at Scripps. As an aside, we expect to book about $20 million in low-margin revenue during the second quarter, related to the Scripps installation and primarily from the commencement of our proton project in Saudi Arabia.","For the year, depending upon the timing of other projects, annual proton revenues could approximate $80 million. The first quarter gross margin for the company was essentially equal to the year-ago period at 42.9%. Oncology Systems' gross margin fell by 1 point, as expected, to 43.9%, due primarily to a product and geographic mix shift.","X-ray Products' gross margin increased more than a point to 41.7%, primarily due to a significant increase in volume and faster growth in our panel products. Panels now represent more than half of the revenue for X-ray Products.","As a reminder, in the second quarter, we will begin to account for the medical excise tax in our gross margin. The total company impact for the balance of the year is expected to be in the range of $8 million to $10 million.","First quarter SG&A expenses were $106 million, or 16% of revenues, up 33 basis points as a percentage of revenue from the year-ago quarter. Included in the SG&A expenses for the first quarter was the $4.1 million restructuring charge. This charge was a bit higher than expected, but it is evidence of the success of the enhanced retirement program. Excluding this charge, SG&A as a percentage of revenue would have improved by about 30 basis points from the year-ago quarter. Before leaving SG&A, I should let you know that during the second quarter, we plan to take an estimated $2.5 million additional restructuring charge to complete the enhanced retirement program.","First quarter R&D expenses were $47 million, or 7% of revenues, equal as a percentage of revenue with the year-ago period. First quarter operating earnings increased 7% to $137 million, or 20% of revenues.","Depreciation and amortization totaled $17 million for the quarter. The effective tax rate was 31% for the quarter, up 1 point from the year-ago period and about 1 point higher than we expected as a result of the geographic mix of profits. As I'm sure you have heard, the R&D tax credit was extended by Congress on January 2. Given this extension, we now believe that the tax rate for this full fiscal year will be about 28.5%. The catch-up of the 2012 R&D tax credit will be reflected in our second fiscal quarter, which should result in a lower tax rate of about 28% for the quarter.","Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased from the year-ago quarter to $111 million, due mainly to our share repurchase program. Diluted earnings per share increased by 9% to $0.86.","Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalent of $755 million, debt of $206 million and stockholder's equity of $1.6 billion. Day sales outstanding increased by 1 day to 87 days, including a 6-day impact from the Particle Therapy business. First quarter cash flow from operations was $72 million, with net earnings partially offset by increases in inventory to support this year's revenue growth. Other primary sources of cash were $59 million from stock option proceeds. Primary uses of cash were $104 million to repurchase 1.5 million shares under our stock repurchase program and $14 million for capital expenditures.","Now I'll turn it back over to Dow for the outlook.","Dow R. Wilson","Thanks, Elisha. We are pleased with our first quarter results in revenues and earnings, which should keep the company on track for hitting its fiscal 2013 growth targets. We remain confident in the fundamental long-term strategy for serving our markets.","For the second quarter of fiscal year 2013, total company revenues could increase by about 5% to 6% over the prior year quarter. With the balance of restructuring charges from the enhanced retirement program, net earnings per diluted share for the second quarter should be in the range of $0.98 to $1.03. For the fiscal year, we continue to believe that total company revenues could increase by about 8% to 9% over the prior fiscal year. Net earnings per diluted share for the fiscal year could be in the range of $4.08 to $4.16.","We're now ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Johnson of Robert W. Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Question one, Dow, you mentioned timing in your prepared remarks and kind of referenced the last quarter's strength in the U.S. Also, referenced in maybe some delayed interest in EDGE, or maybe some backlog interest in EDGE, given that it didn't get approved till late December. So just trying to figure out, is it -- as you point to timing issues, are you referencing that more as kind of take last quarter's numbers and this quarter's numbers and average them? Or there may have been deferrals this quarter that could come back and help over the coming quarters?","Dow R. Wilson","I think there's a number of things going on here. As we said last quarter, one quarter does not a trend make. So timing is certainly a factor as we look back that way. The reality is, the market's probably not as strong as last quarter and certainly not as weak as this quarter. So we're probably in the kind of mid- to high-single digit growth rates for oncology. We did have, as you know, very robust Q4 and a weak Q1. I think the market is kind of right smack in the middle. We think market fundamentals remain down.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And I may have misheard there, but it sounds like you may have actually provided a little bit of guidance around orders.","Dow R. Wilson","No, no.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Mid-single digits is kind of what I was hearing there. Mid to upper single digits. But...","Dow R. Wilson","Well, as you look back 6 months, that's kind of what we think the market is doing.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Ah, that was a backward-looking comment. Okay. No, that's fair. And Elisha, one question for you on just tax rate. You, obviously, with the R&D tax credit, can you remind me what was originally embedded in your guidance for this year for expected effective tax rate and maybe what the R&D tax credit is translating to as a sort of EPS tailwind relative to prior guidance?","Elisha W. Finney","Sure, Jeff. And the R&D tax credit is a little less than 1 point impact, if you look at it for the full year. And so, obviously, when we set our original guidance on tax, we're considering lots and lots of different variables that can go into that. What's really driving it more than anything is the geographic mix of earnings, but there's all other sorts of discrete items that go into the rate as well. So that's why we put a range on it. So at this point, what we're saying is that our range, instead of 28% to 29%, we've now come in closer to the 28.5% with that geographic mix of earnings, the negative being offset by the positive somewhat of the R&D tax credit.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","All right. That's helpful. Last question, I promise, just on the enhanced retirement program. Dow, can you put any, or Elisha, any numbers around that? What, maybe, percentage headcount reduction now you're thinking you might see, or how that might translate over the next few years from a cost-saving standpoint?","Elisha W. Finney","Sure. It's roughly 80 employees, and that's out of our worldwide number of 6,000. This was a US-based program. And this is the first time the company has done this. We really didn't know what to expect. And I'm happy to say, I think it was widely successful. It was a win-win for employees and for us. And the reason some of this charge is going into Q2 is just given the timing of some retirements. So we couldn't have them all in the first quarter, so there are some that will be completed in the second quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from James Terwilliger of Benchmark.","James Terwilliger - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes, I had just 2 quick questions. The first one was on the announcement for the TrueBeam in India. And the second, if you could talk about the Indian market and what that product means over there from a competitive standpoint, a pricing standpoint. And the second part of the question would be focused on, I think you had an ASTRO in Japan, and I was wondering if you could provide any color about the ASTRO that took place in Japan as well.","Dow R. Wilson","Relative to India, we have had success with TrueBeam in India. We did get the approval earlier. Was it early in the fourth quarter?","Elisha W. Finney","Yes, CE Mark.","Dow R. Wilson","Yes, yes. Anyway -- so we've been -- there were some local things that we had to go through in the Indian market. Those are now cleared. So we are set to go in the India market. That market is not unlike some other global markets where there's a good piece of the market that's very high end and then a significant piece of the market that's in kind of the performance value segment. TrueBeam will help us in that high-end market. Radiosurgery is a big deal in India. And a few years ago, as an example, we saw very good uptake of our Novalis Tx in that market. So I think this will -- this will help us there. I believe the JASTRO is this next quarter in Japan. So it's coming up on the calendar. So we haven't gone to JASTRO yet.","Operator","Our next question is from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you just flush out some of the end market commentary on Europe and Asia in particular? I know you called out some of these in your prepared comments, but where were you surprised by the weakness? And how should we think about trends in the next couple of quarters?","Dow R. Wilson","Sure. I guess -- maybe start with the comments from last quarter. I think, as we went around the horn last quarter, one of the surprises was just how strong Europe was last quarter. So we're very strong in Q4. So we think that timing is probably a good chunk of the main reason of what's going on here. We did see a couple -- a few orders delayed. Northern and Southern Europe were down. Western Europe and the Middle East were flat for us. We had good growth in Eastern Europe and Africa. Anyway, we still believe that the fundamentals in Europe are sound. The last -- if you look back 2 quarters, it's kind of mid-single-digit growth, and that's probably a pretty good indication of what's happening in the market. Our funnel-in forecast looked good there. We believe we're maintaining share, and one of the things we like is a stable foreign exchange environment. So that's kind of the Europe story. In Asia, we had great growth in Japan and China versus very tough comps. In China, we were up 30% on a 40% number from last year. And in Japan, we were up 15% on a 19% number from last year. So we feel very good about Japan and China. The rest of Asia is kind of lumpy. They come and go, and we were, in fact, down 90% in the rest of Asia. We had some orders last year in South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia that were big. And that's kind of the rest of the Asia story. Maybe just to round out the globe here for you, Tycho, in the Rest of the World we were up. We had very good growth, as I mentioned in the script. And Latin America and Rest of the World growth was up 33%.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then, Elisha, you raised the bottom end of guidance by, I think, $0.02. Is that just the R&D tax credit? Or are there some restructuring benefits from that?","Elisha W. Finney","Well, it's given the results that we had in Q1, where we landed right at the midpoint of the guidance, it's given the little bit lower excise tax, given the constructive pricing ruling that we had recently. That's offset by a little bit higher shares than we had first anticipated, and the higher restructuring charge for the retirement program. And then, yes, the tax is -- the R&D tax is a benefit. So you blend all of that together, and that's how we got to the new range.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then one last quick one on EDGE. Any update on when we should get the Calypso approval? How we should think about that being ruled out?","Dow R. Wilson","Yes. The Calypso approval, we expect in the -- I believe sometime in the April, May time frame. There's still some uncertainty about it. We have been back to answer questions. And as long as that question set goes around, it could take a while. But the clinical data is complete, and we think we're answering mostly technical questions. So our forecast at this point is kind of the April, May time frame, Tycho.","Operator","Our next question is from Amit Bhalla of Citigroup.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Dow, in your \"around the horn\" comments, I didn't hear a number for how India performed in the quarter. Could you just give us that growth rate? And second, for Elisha on gross margin. The gross margin in the quarter tracked better than your full-year guidance of 42%. So can you just talk to us on how gross margin will play out for the remaining quarters of the year?","Dow R. Wilson","Yes. I'd say, on India, Amit, we -- it's kind of buried in our Europe number. The Middle East, I said, was flat, so -- I don't have India in front of me, but I assume that it's probably in that range.","Elisha W. Finney","So for the gross margin, Amit, we're still at that 42% to 43% for the total company. Oncology landed exactly where we hoped for Q1 and where we thought they would and continue to be in that 43% to 44% range for the full fiscal year. Of course, there is an $8 million to $10 million excise tax. If you were to exclude that, the oncology margin would be, essentially, even with the year-ago period, very close to 44%, but we have to take that into the Oncology margin. X-ray Products is going to be in the low 40s, around 42%. We should see a -- towards the balance of the end of the year, we're going to anticipate significant proton revenue at a very low margin relative to our other businesses. So that has to -- that impacts the total company margin as well. So really, those 2 factors, it's the excise tax and increased proton revenue, which will only be about somewhere around a 12% to 15% gross margin for the deals that we book in Q3 and Q4.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And just a quick follow-up, Dow, on Siemens. It did go live in North America in the quarter. But in your comments, you only highlighted Germany as a potential positive impact. Can you just talk to us about the early thoughts on Siemens in the U.S.?","Dow R. Wilson","Yes. I think -- yes, we did kick it off. It took us till -- we were contractually obligated for our former partner through the end of September. And so that is now off and going. I'd say we've had very good progress. It's really kind of sales teams meeting together at this point. We have sold our few -- our first few CT scanners, CT simulators. So that's good. We -- they are helping us in the U.S. We did see -- we have had other very good contribution from them and other geographies, Northern Africa, Eastern Europe, and even some in Asia. So we are seeing some continued good pick-up outside of the U.S. We're still a little early here in the U.S., but we're -- I guess -- my barometer on these things has always, \"How do salespeople react?\" And the continued reaction of our salespeople and their salespeople is very positive. So that's, I think, a good barometer of what's to come.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","One question on the software business. Can you give us a sense to where the growth came out for that segment of Oncology in the quarter? Is that still trending in the $100 million to $200 million range, a mid-teens grower? Any updates there?","Dow R. Wilson","I'd say it's broad-based. We have very good customer response to our treatment planning products, probably starts there. Our ARIA product is going through a new product cycle, which is good. Some new features and capability and a lot of creature comfort for usability. So that -- we had a number of competitive takeouts in the quarter. And I'd say, geographically, that business is bigger in the U.S., especially on the oncology information side. But the treatment planning growth has been global, and we are starting to see pickup outside of the U.S. in our software business. Elisha, you want to add anything there?","Elisha W. Finney","No, I think that covered it.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then, Dow, just going into a little bit more detail on your commentary on a couple of the disruptions in the order funnel in the quarter, whether it's the fiscal cliff or the EDGE launch. Are you seeing signs that give you confidence that any of that disruption on the fiscal cliff is temporary? And then on EDGE, could you spend just a little bit more time talking about the commercial potential and impact of that product over the course of the year?","Dow R. Wilson","Sure. I'd say, in North America, we did have a very strong Q4. Q1 was up 2%. So just to look back on 6 months as a mid-single, a high-single-digit growth market. The hospital market remains okay. And as you know, the freestanding market has been quiet for the last year, and I'd say that market continues to be very, very quiet. The U.S. market is an innovation-driven market. Our share is stable, maybe even to a hair up in the U.S. Fiscal cliff impact, it's not clear. I do think there were some people kind of waiting. No, I don't think it had a big market impact, but the uncertainty around it certainly wasn't a benefit to the market. I think we are continuing to see slowness in the freestanding market. On EDGE, we are seeing strong interest in North America. We are seeing a very good interest from the radiation oncology community, as well as the surgical community. I think it's a game changer in lung cancer. And we're starting to see -- we've talked a little bit about this, but we're starting to see more momentum from folks around liver cancer. That market is mostly outside of the U.S. But even our U.S. customers are getting excited about liver cancer. I think as we said last quarter, the target market for this product -- I think if you add the Gamma Knife and the CyberKnife up, that's about 125 units a year-ish, and that's really where we want to position this product and go after that volume. Customer response to some of the features on the product, especially the 6-degree of freedom couch and the tumor-tracking, multi-leaf collimator have been really outstanding. And from a commercial point of view, we launched at ASTRO, the sales team has been trained. We await FDA approval and -- so we're kind of off and running. We've got to work with customers to get it in their budgets. So I think it's -- I think we'll see some impacts in Q2. It's probably a little bit more of the second half impact for us.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeremy Feffer of Cantor Fitzgerald.","Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Dow, I want to come back to sort of more bigger picture to the bigger reimbursement environment, and I'm wondering if that's having any impact? I know you've talked about in the past, your expectations of probably mid-single-digit cuts for the next few years, and I'm wondering if you're -- any conversations with customers you're seeing that being a bit of an overhang.","Dow R. Wilson","I would say in the freestanding market for sure. They were down 9% to kind of the final outcome of this last reimbursement decision. So I think the freestanding market is going to remain very quiet. I think this hospital market -- hey, there's always uncertainty around reform and kind of what's happening in Washington, but I don't know that it's, in any material way, different than what we kind of saw last year. So I kind of think the U.S. market is going to be not as strong as last quarter and not as weak as this past quarter. Not as strong as Q4 and not as weak as Q1.","Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then just quickly on gross margin. Elisha, I appreciate your comments there. I'm wondering, as we go forward, how we should think about this -- both the product and geographic mix as it relates to gross margin?","Elisha W. Finney","Well, the biggest driver by far in gross margin is the product mix. So with service and software being our highest margin products, and then accessories and then the hardware. So that can drive the mix pretty significantly. Secondly is the geographic mix. And in emerging markets, it can be 5 points easily lower than what we might see in the U.S. or Japan. So when we're setting -- when we're looking at guidance for quarter in and quarter out, we are looking at estimated -- where are products going to ship and what are the margin on those, and trying to give you our best guesstimate, if you will. And so looking out for the year, again, if we exclude the excise tax, Oncology would be roughly even with the year-ago period.","Operator","Our next question is from Jonathan Palmer of CLSA.","Jonathan J. Palmer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Dow, I apologize if I missed it in the prepared remarks, but did you mention when you expect the announcement on the Brazilian tender?","Dow R. Wilson","Yes. Sometime in January or February. Just a little more color on that, February is Mardi Gras, so we don't know if it will be before that or after that. But as we get closer to it, it's probably looking like it might come after. The Ministry is telling us the date's in either January or February. So that's what we know today.","Jonathan J. Palmer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then just in terms of the X-ray business, you've seen 2 very strong quarters of orders there after a more modest prior period. When do we start to see these orders translate into sales?","Elisha W. Finney","Oh, this is a fairly short-cycle business, so you already saw some of the effects in the first quarter where the X-ray sales were up 18% in Q1. The orders were up 21%. So it just tends to be, particularly on the tube side, very short-cycle business with orders and sales typically in the same quarter. Flat panel, we can build a backlog going out 1 to 2 quarters. That's much different than the oncology business.","Jonathan J. Palmer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Understood. And then one last one for me. Was there any update on the $80 million per ton order from Emory?","Elisha W. Finney","No. We are waiting until -- Maryland and Emory, we have signed contracts with both, but we will not actually book those deals into backlog until their financing is complete. In the second quarter, it is the Saudi proton project that we expect to commence. And then in the third or fourth quarter, we are assuming that the Maryland financing will be done and that we will be able to book a significant amount of revenue under that project in the second half.","Operator","Our next question is from Jason Wittes of Brean Capital.","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","First, you did mention there perhaps was some slowdown due to fiscal cliff discussions, though it sounded like it was negligible in terms of measurement. But the $1 billion that you did get was -- at least, I think, for Varian, was that the Gamma Knife product reimbursement got cut. I understand they don't sell that many systems into the U.S. at this point, but they do have quite a few -- quite a big install base. Are you hearing from customers that perhaps they are looking to upgrade from a Gamma Knife at this point, now that the reimbursement just isn't quite as attractive as it used to be?","Dow R. Wilson","Our customers were not -- as you stated, our customers are not impacted by the reimbursement cut. One of the things it does is it levels the playing field in stereotactic radiosurgery. So we're excited about that. There's a lot of clinical evidence out there that results from Linac-based SRS and cobalt-based SRS are the same. Also, we think this is the government being responsible with -- a cost comparative effectiveness. So we think EDGE is a game changer in the lung. That's what our customers are looking for as kind of growth into the future. The Gamma Knife, as you know, can't do body radiosurgery. And I think as the big trends move to lung and liver, we're very well positioned.","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Okay. And Elisha, if I heard you correctly, you've mentioned that you were going to be able to -- I may have heard this incorrectly, but did you say that you were going to be able to book some profits from proton this year, or is that -- or did I mishear you?","Elisha W. Finney","There will be some gross profit at the, again, very low level of 12%, 15%. But on an operating basis, it is still significantly dilutive to the company.","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","But I guess -- my understanding of the accounting was once you kind of had an understanding what the profitability was, you could actually start booking revenues with some profit -- with some gross profit. And it sounds like you're at that point at this point.","Elisha W. Finney","Correct. So Scripps, because it was our first and we couldn't accurately estimate our costs along the way, we deferred any profit until the end of the contract, and there won't be much profit being the very first one. We are now going to revert to a more typical contract accounting on future deals, where we will take a percentage of the revenue and a percentage of the cost. And again, on -- as we've always said, Jason, on the first few of these, is that very, very low gross margin. There was a lot of startup costs built into these first few Cyclotrons. So the hope is that, as we go forward, it will get a little better. But these first few are not going to be high margins.","Operator","Our next question is from Amit Hazan of SunTrust.","Amit Hazan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","First question, just on service gross margin. I'm wondering if you can confirm what that was in the quarter. And also, just kind of thinking about the strong growth it's had in recent years, and now that TrueBeam is coming into service, to what extent should that continue to move higher?","Elisha W. Finney","Sure. Well, we don't break it out in that level of granularity, Amit. But I will tell you that the service gross margin continues to be roughly 50%. I mean, it is a very nice product line with a nice recurring revenue stream at high margins. The TrueBeam, yes, as it continues to be a higher take rate, that is a positive on the gross margin. It was offset somewhat by the geographic mix, where it was 3 percentage points higher into international markets as opposed to North America. So you just take all of those things together, it can really drive margin a couple of points in any given quarter.","Dow R. Wilson","And just a comment on TrueBeam. Yes, from a -- it grows our installed base, we get better service contract pricing, that's all favorable. We have, just to update you, 690 orders, plus orders to date. 380 of those are installed or being installed. It did represent about half of our high-energy machines in the first quarter. And we did want to announce today that, in keeping with our practice, we'll stop reporting this number as TrueBeam is now kind of the business and is an established product.","Amit Hazan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","All right. And just a quick question on guidance. If I look at kind of the revenues for the second half there, third, a bit back-end loaded compared to maybe looking at the last 2 years. Not much, but just a little bit. I'm just wondering if that's tied to the proton contribution or anything else.","Elisha W. Finney","All right. Yes, it is, where a significant part of the proton revenue will come in the second half. And if you exclude the -- well, it's 1 point or 2 increase in the revenue line for the protons. And for Oncology, when you run your numbers, you'll see that it's relatively low sales growth in the second quarter, and that's really just because that we had a very strong comp in the year-ago quarter. And it's just based on customer expected delivery dates. So you really just look at the year, with Oncology up in the 5%, 6% range and X-ray in the low teens, and the balance of that really being the proton business.","Amit Hazan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then finally, kind of just a broader question. We're obviously seeing a lot of rather significant declines in prostate cancer treatments in the new PSA guidelines begin. And I'm wondering if you guys view that as something that, over time, affects your customers from either an ROI standpoint or capacity standpoint, where it could then indirectly impact you over time, or is prostate just too small in the scheme of things to really have that effect?","Dow R. Wilson","A, I do think it is small; B, we have lost some share over the last half a dozen years to robotic prostatectomy. And C, our argument is the best prostate treatment that you can get is with external beam radiation therapy. And we think that some of the new techniques for nerve sparing, our technology with spacers and our Linacs, really present opportunities for us to get toxicity reduction. The results, frankly, are -- we can all do a very good job at treating prostate cancer. And the question is toxicity elimination. There may be -- some of the watchful waiting may have some short-term impact. The patients will eventually come back in if their PSA scores elevate and now they'll come back into the system. But I think at this point, it's really kind of becoming a toxicity argument. And I think we've got some very good things to show the world as we kind of do the clinical work and show the impact of these new capabilities.","Operator","Our next question is from David Roman of Goldman Sachs.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Elisha, in your prepared remarks, I know you elaborated a little bit on the call regarding the recognition of the proton revenue from Scripps. I think you said $20 million in the second fiscal quarter is very low margin. Can you maybe just help us think about the longer-term impact of when that term is profitable? And then should we look at Scripps as a good analog for how the profitability of these follow-on projects might be phased in?","Elisha W. Finney","No, I think there was just a lot of learning that went into Scripps. And as they -- as we are booking this, again, Scripps today is at a zero margin, and any profit will not be recorded until we get to the very end of the installation and acceptance. The $20 million of revenue in Q2 is mostly associated with, we will begin the project for our Saudi proton project. And so we will identify components specific to that project, and there will be roughly $15 million or so of revenue that we're anticipating that we can book in the second quarter. As we've said, David, these proton projects in the early years are at very, very low margins. It continues to be dilutive to the total business. We believe in the future of this technology, and we are making an investment to about 5% of our total EBIT dollar. Not going to say exactly when this is going to turn profitable but, suffice it to say, it -- we're at least 18 to 24 months out. But we will start to make progress. And as we get new deals and as we start to book revenue, that dilution number should start trending down. And that is what we're committed to here.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then obviously, one of your very, very smaller competitors announced fairly disappointing results this quarter. Maybe you could just sort of update us on your latest thoughts about the competitive dynamics, particularly in the U.S.? I mean, is this really turning into a 2-player race? And then I guess you also didn't comment too much on any benefit from the Siemens software partnership, but I think we're now enough time into that where you might be seeing some benefit.","Dow R. Wilson","Maybe just beginning with the last point, the Siemens software, we did introduce to the market, at ASTRO, shipments will happen in our third quarter. So it'll really be, from a kind of P&L point of view, it'll be a second half impact, and we expect it to be small. The overall competitive environment, I think that our Accuray introduced a number of new products at ASTRO, what we kind of hear is they appear to be slipping with those product introductions. It happens to coincide with a very good introduction from us on EDGE, and so I think you got a combination of maybe some execution issues on their side with a really good product introduction on our side. So we're confident that we can make an impact in that market with our new EDGE product.","Operator","And our final question comes from Anthony Petrone of Jefferies.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I'll begin, one, with X-ray, and then a couple on Oncology. Dow, can you walk us through just the tailwind in the X-ray business that you mentioned in your prepared remarks as being driven by CT demand? Just how long will that kind of cycle last? And is there more room for share gains that -- similar to what you witnessed this quarter?","Dow R. Wilson","It's a combination of a couple of things. Our largest customer had a very good quarter. That's Toshiba, in that business, and we believe that they picked up some share gains. Frankly, that's been a long-term trend. When you look at the last 4, 5 years, they have been growing their share. We'd like to hope that our CT tube is part of that, and we can keep growing that. We also had some nice growth from other CT manufacturers. As well, we had introduced a number of products, probably, I'd say, 8 or 9 new products last year. And it takes a while to get those spec'd in. Some of those were panels, some of those were tubes. We started to see some traction at last on those new products, and we had some volume, especially in rad panels, radiographic panels, that drove some growth there, as well as really starting to see some traction from our InfiMed acquisition. So I think it's kind of broad-based, yes, when it happens in the CT business, the pickup is always a little bit faster. But we really like the prospects in this business.","Elisha W. Finney","And to be fair, I think it is over a relatively easy comp in the first half of last year, the X-ray Products business really started to turn around in Q4 of last fiscal year, but they are solidly on track for this year.","Dow R. Wilson","Yes. And let me say that...","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Is it fair...","Dow R. Wilson","Yes, let's do that one more time. Sorry. The -- clearly, the trend here is all about digital imaging, and that's really the big driver. That's the macro driver of this business, and that trend is going to -- that's a multi-year trend.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Is it fair to look at the relation from bookings to revenue, on a sequential basis, you had 15% growth in bookings last quarter that resulted in an 18% revenue growth this quarter. And sure, you have to normalize it for the weak quarter. But is the cycle enough to sustain perhaps mid-double-digit revenue growth if we can continue to see bookings to the tune that we saw this quarter, which was 21%?","Elisha W. Finney","Well, yes. I mean, this business tends to be a little more linear than the Oncology business. With that said, the fourth quarter tends to always be the biggest. But as I mentioned earlier, we're expecting low teens sales growth for the X-ray Products segment this year. So it's -- driven largely by the new products that Dow mentioned.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then on to Oncology. The Siemens relationship will extend to North America this quarter, and it's been in place for little over a year now in Europe. And I'm wondering, in relation to the lumpiness of orders in Europe specifically and how that plays with Siemens, specifically the 20% growth last quarter, and then we've had a decline this quarter, I mean, do you expect similar lumpiness as that relationship extends into North America?","Dow R. Wilson","I guess the short version would be, we always expect lumpiness. I'm not sure how much of it Siemens is a factor in. We have -- as we've kind of said before, we like to look at trends on a little bit longer-term basis. It's pretty tough to get a crystal ball of what's going on by just looking through the lens of a quarter. And I'm not sure that the Siemens relationship helps or hurts that in any one direction. Certainly, at this point, it's too early to tell.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Helpful. And last one for me is, you mentioned Brazil and timing on that. I'm wondering if there's any preliminary thoughts on pricing on that contract? And is it in line with other emerging markets? Is it similar to, perhaps, that gross margin discount that you spoke to, Elisha, when you compare, say, Japan to an emerging market, is that similar in Brazil, or should we expect something different there?","Elisha W. Finney","Let's just say, you're not going to like the growth margin in Brazil. As Dow said, you're going to...","Dow R. Wilson","Groan any way you look at it.","Elisha W. Finney","Yes, you're not going to be happy if we lose, and you might not be happy if we win, given that this is a reverse auction. However, we're looking at this over the lifetime. This is growing and developing a market, looking at it over the life of the equipment, with the service contracts, with the upgrade opportunity that it presents. But it will not be at the Oncology average gross margin, is my expectation.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Is it fair to say the service margin, as well, is much lower, or should we expect a normal service margin should Varian win the contract?","Elisha W. Finney","I'm anticipating it will be lower as well.","Operator","That is all the time we have for questions. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Sias for any closing remarks.","Spencer R.

We are reporting mixed results for the fourth quarter of 2014 with strong gross orders growth, but earnings that fell short of our expectations for two primary reasons. Earnings were $1.02 per diluted share. We did not book the Maryland Proton Therapy Center project, which would have added $0.17 per diluted share and we had $0.09 per share diluted share impact from an unusually high increase in our tax rate. Elisha will explain this in more detail later.","Now, let me summarize the rest of the quarter. We are reporting strong gross orders growth in our Oncology Systems business with several major wins in North America and Europe and continued double-digit strength in emerging markets. Healthy order growth, but flat revenues in our Imaging Components business. Total company backlog, up 10% at $3.2 billion, including an 8% gain in our core businesses. Revenues of $812 million, up 5% from the year ago quarter. Gross margin is down on Oncology Systems and up in Imaging Components and continued investment in R&D and SG&A to support our product roadmap and global expansion.","Oncology Systems gross orders grew 9% to $918 million for the quarter. Gross orders for oncology grew 11% in North America aided by multi-system network wins at several customers. We also saw one of the strongest ever quarters in Canada. Performance in North America was helped by the sale of integrated systems combining linear accelerator software and stereotactic radiotherapy and radiosurgery offerings. Our oncology gross orders grew 4% in EMEA during the quarter, with significant wins in the UK, Switzerland, France, Germany and Italy.","We were particularly strong in the UK, where we were selected to supply 8 TrueBeams and a full suite of software to Guy\u2019s and St. Thomas Hospital in London. Just a year after the UK National Health System supply chain ordered 20 TrueBeams, we received an order for a further 10 TrueBeams demonstrating the strong demand for this system among the country\u2019s hospitals. We also saw orders for our first two Edge radiosurgery systems in the UK, which will be installed at the Clatterbridge Center for Oncology near Liverpool.","Other highlights in our EMEA region included orders for our first 2 TrueBeams in Bulgaria and 12 TrueBeams ordered by a large customer in India. Our team in India generated strong gross order growth for the quarter and for the year. Total orders for BRICA territories including Brazil, Russia, India, China and Africa grew by about 35% during the quarter with particular strength in Brazil and India. BRICA orders were up by 25% for the year.","In Brazil we booked more than $30 million of the major Brazilian Ministry of Health tender that we are awarded a year ago helping the Latin America region to grow by more than 60% during the quarter. Even without orders from the Brazil tender, gross orders from Latin America were up by 10%. We continued to make progress in China with strong unit volume growth and the mix shift towards lower cost units in hospitals that are striving for more cost efficient care. Our global oncology service business continued to see double-digit growth with gross orders increasing 11% for the quarter and 12% for the full year. Overall machine volume rose significantly during the quarter, which will expand our installed base and set the stage for continued growth.","Service was 40% of the total oncology revenue for both the quarter and the year. It\u2019s been trending up as a percentage of total oncology business and we expect that this will continue. Software was the highlight of our exhibit this year at ASTRO in September where we featured new cloud based software and data analytics tools that we believe create the opportunity to double our software business over the next few years. We believe data analytics is the next frontier for our software business. Our customers are excited about the potential of mining their data for better decision-making and improved clinical outcomes. We had more than 900 attendees at our users meeting at ASTRO and there was tremendous interest in our new software tools. These products included full-scale cloud based oncology information system for remotely managing clinical information and treatment planning data with greater cost efficiency. We recorded more than $20 million in gross orders during the year with this product.","InSightive analytics, our new interactive dashboard that enables clinicians to aggregate, organize and present data from their operations for more informed decision making. Customer interest in this product at ASTRO was tremendous. Velocity, for consolidating and compiling historical patient images and treatment data from numerous sources to guide clinicians in the next treatment decision for the patient. And RapidPlan, our knowledge-based treatment planning tool for enhancing the quality and efficiency of treatment planning, orders for this product were up sharply in the fourth quarter. Each of these products is priced at over $100,000.","Let me turn now to our imaging components segment. Gross orders for this segment increased 16% to $234 million. This was driven mainly by a more than $40 million order for security and inspection products that we expect to deliver over the next two years. Orders for our X-ray tubes grew in mid-single digits in the quarter but were down for the year. We continued to push for the new OEM customers during quarter, while working to broaden the range of tubes we can offer as well as the markets we serve. Panel gross orders were up in low-double digits for the fiscal year, but down for the quarter versus the tough year ago comparison. During the quarter we made our first shipments of integrated panels and software for a veterinary imaging system.","The company\u2019s other category which is comprised of the Varian Particle Therapy business and the Ginzton technology center recorded gross orders of $3 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year gross orders for this segment were $120 million, up substantially from the previous year. Customer financing at the Maryland Proton Project was not sufficiently completed to enable us to book an order for that project during the quarter. We expect to book this deal when customer financing is completed and we will announce it at the appropriate time. As of the end of the year our backlog included booked orders for proton therapy projects in Saudi Arabia, Russia, Cincinnati, Taiwan and the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland. The script installation San Diego was essentially complete and is now generating service revenue. In addition to Maryland proton contracts not yet financed or booked include proton centers in Atlanta and in Dallas.","Now I will turn it over to Elisha.","Elisha Finney - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks Dow. Following Dow\u2019s lead, I am going to begin with a little more detail on the two significant items that impacted earnings in the quarter. As Dow mentioned we did not book an order for the Maryland Proton Therapy Center because our customer financing was not sufficiently completed by fiscal year end. Consequently we did not record an estimated $70 million in revenue for the project in the quarter, which would have added about $0.17 per share to our earnings. Earnings for the quarter were negatively impacted by about $0.09 per diluted share as a result of an increase in the annual effective tax rate.","For the first three quarters of the fiscal year, our estimated annual tax rate was about 28%. We ended the year with a rate closer to 30% with the full impact of the change resulting in a 6 point increase in the fourth quarter tax rate. The increase in the tax rate was caused by two primary factors. First, the dollar strengthened significantly right at the end of September, which led to a currency fluctuation impact on our taxes of approximately $0.06 per diluted share. Secondly, taxes were also about $0.03 per diluted share higher than anticipated, because the Maryland project was not formed.","With that, let me begin my normal walkthrough of the constant currency growth rate as well as the P&L and balance sheet for the quarter. Currency exchange rates had virtually no impact on overall gross orders and revenues versus the year ago quarter principally because the euro and yen offset each other. Oncology gross orders for the quarter increased 9% in both dollars and constant currency. Oncology\u2019s North American gross orders were up 11% in dollars and up 12% in constant currency. EMEA gross orders increased 4% in dollars and 2% in constant currency due to the strengthening of the euro quarter-over-quarter. Asia, where we followed slight weakening of the yen, was down 3% in dollars and down 1% in constant currency. Oncology gross orders in the small rest of world market grew by about 45% in dollars and constant currency.","Turning to the P&L, fourth quarter revenues for the total company increased 5% in both dollars and constant currency. And for the full year, total company revenues were up 4% in both dollars and constant currency. Oncology Systems posted a 6% increase in revenues during the quarter, with revenues split roughly 47% in North America and 53% outside North America. For the full year, oncology revenues rose 4% to $2.3 billion with a similar geographic split. Service revenues rose 11% in the quarter and 9% for the year accounting for 40% of total oncology revenues.","Imaging Components posted fourth quarter revenue equal to the year ago period, with 6% gains in flat panels offset by declines in the x-ray tube and security and inspection products. For the year, Imaging Components revenues increased 3%, with 9% growth in panels partially offset by declines in tubes and security and inspection products. And revenues in the other category increased by 30% to $22 million for the quarter. Annual revenues were $45 million, down 6% from the prior year. Total company gross margin for the quarter was 41.9%, down 79 basis points from the year ago quarter largely due to a higher mix of proton business.","For the full year, total company gross margin was 42.7%, up 22 basis points from the last year. Oncology Systems fourth quarter gross margin was 42.6%, down 36 basis points from the year ago period due largely to product and geographic mix. For the full year, Oncology Systems gross margin was 43.6%, up 23 basis points from last fiscal year with favorable product mix.","Imaging Components gross margin for the quarter was 43.7%, up 88 basis points from the year ago period due to higher panel volumes product cost reductions and improved cost of quality. For the full year, Imaging Components gross margin was 42.2%, up 43 basis points from last year, with a higher mix of panel shipments as well as productivity gains in tubes.","Fourth quarter SG&A expenses were $122 million or 15% of revenues, up more than 0.5 point from the year ago quarter due to our continued investments to expand our global infrastructure. We also incurred higher sales and bonus incentives associated with the strong orders growth. For the year, SG&A expenses rose 1.5 points to 16% of revenues with about 1 point of the increase due to the University of Pittsburg patent litigation settlement and the impairment of a portion of our investment in Augmenix.","First quarter R&D expenses were $59 million or 7% of revenues even as a percentage of revenue with the year ago quarter. For the full year R&D expenses were $235 million or 8% of revenue, up more 0.5 point as a percent of revenue as we continued to invest in our product roadmap. Fourth quarter operating earnings totaled $159 million or nearly 20% of revenues, down a little more than a point due to the lower gross margin and higher SG&A spending. For the full fiscal year, the operating margin was 19% of revenues, down 2 points from the previous year with 1 point due to the (indiscernible) and Augmenix charges. The other 1 point decline in operating margin for the year was due to higher spending in R&D and SG&A to support global growth consistent with our year of investment strategy.","Depreciation and amortization totaled $18 million for the quarter and $64 million for the fiscal year. The effective tax rate for the fiscal year was 29.7%, which led to a 33.9% tax rate for the fourth quarter. Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased from the year ago quarter to 103.5 million due largely to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted EPS was $1.02 for the fourth quarter and $3.83 for the fiscal year including a $0.22 impact from the patent settlement and Augmenix impairments.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $849 million, debt of $438 million and stockholders equity of $1.6 billion. DSO at 85 was equal to the year ago quarter and improved 10 days from the third quarter with strong collections and higher revenues. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was about $200 million significantly higher than net income due to working capital improvements. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was about $456 million. The primary use of cash was $210 million for the repurchase of 2.5 million shares of stock. At the end of the quarter we had 6 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2015.","Now I will turn it back over to Dow for the outlook.","Dow Wilson - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks Elisha. Fiscal 2014 was the year of investments aimed to stimulate long-term top line growth for the company and we have made good progress. We are focusing now on restoring our more normal operating expense levels to maintain margins and improve earnings growth. In the first quarter of fiscal 2015 we expect to take a restructuring charge of an estimated $13 million or $0.09 per diluted share to realign and reduce our staff levels through programs including an enhanced retirement plan. For fiscal year 2015 we expect revenues for our Oncology Systems and Imaging Components businesses as well as proton orders currently in backlog to grow in the range of 5% to 6%. Included the $0.09 per diluted share restructuring charge, earnings for the company should be in a range of $4.15 and $4.26 per diluted share.","Our guidance excludes contracted proton projects that are not yet financed or booked into backlog. If these projects are booked during the year, the potential upside in revenues and profits could be significant. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2015, we expect combined revenues from our Oncology Systems and Imaging Components businesses as well as proton orders currently in backlog to grow by zero to 2%. Earnings per diluted share for the total company including the expected $0.09 per diluted share restructuring charge should be in the range of $0.76 to $0.80.","We are now ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Robert Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird","Thank you. Good evening guys. How are you?","Dow Wilson","Yes.","Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird","So we are 20 minutes into the call and you guide \u201915 \u2013 I don\u2019t know $0.50 below the street and I haven\u2019t really heard an explanation, I guess I\u2019m confused, very confused where the 2015 EPS guidance and maybe a bridge to that, Elisha, if I look at the street at $4.74 granted, maybe some of those included Maryland, my number included Maryland pushed to 2015. But even I give you $0.09 back on the restructuring and if I assume currency was a bit of a hit that may be we weren\u2019t modeling correctly, I still can\u2019t get anywhere close, and I guess the last thing I comment on there before I open it or give it back to you guys is, I know you talked about R&D finally being in 2015 at a point where you can get may be a little leverage offer or at least it doesn\u2019t grow faster than revenue. The revenue guidance looks okay if you take \u2013 if you make some adjustments around a couple of different factors, so it\u2019s all EPS and yet it\u2019s not going to be R&D, it\u2019s not going to be revenue, I\u2019m confused as to where the big miss is coming at the EPS line?","Elisha Finney","Right. So Jeff let me just start with Q4 and give you the loss from what we said last quarter to where we ended up this quarter and the guidance is to $1.14 to $1.29 with a $0.15 delta attributed to the Maryland Proton project as we talked about on the last call. So, if I start with the $1.02 that we are reporting, Maryland would have added $0.17 to the quarter and that\u2019s really because it\u2019s more profitable than we have thought. And I\u2019ve learned to kind of hedge my best with Proton deals and so when it was going to stay in, yes it was at the $0.15 level when it came out it was at the more profitable $0.17.","The tax rate we had about a $0.06 impact from the euro moving literally the last two days of the fiscal year when our balance sheets translate and we had a huge hedging gain in the U.S. that was offset almost exactly by our subsidiary losses for a GAAP \u2013 for the P&L the pre-tax profit, but our hedging gains was taxable in the U.S. because our subsidiary hold their books from a statutory tax accounting in local currency, they did not have a loss with an offset in tax deduction. So a highly unusual event in my 15 years in this job, I do not recall having any impact anywhere close to that and it was just given a huge swing in the currency right at quarter \u2013 at year-end, which has to be reflected in the Q4 tax rates. And then $0.03 additional, we missed out on tax benefit associated with Maryland, where we have some NOLs in Germany that we could have taken credit for. So that\u2019s the guidance walk, I guess that there\u2019s (indiscernible) here, it\u2019s really Maryland with more than the $0.15 spread that we had put on the quarter, it ended up being the $0.17 of profit plus the additional $0.03 that we didn\u2019t get in the past.","Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird","Yes. And Elisha, I guess that, I probably understand that and I think most of us are probably willing to say hey you guys would have been at the upper end if not the most the street numbers for the fourth quarter, I\u2019m talking 2015 guidance, where EPS is coming in some $0.50 below the street, and that\u2019s where I\u2019m so confused?","Elisha Finney","Okay. So let me kind of quickly walk you, I won\u2019t ask you to bear with me on the tax again, because it has the same impact for the year and the quarter, but if I start with our GAAP numbers.","Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird","But not 2014, I\u2019m talking about your guidance for 2015, just to be clear.","Elisha Finney","Sorry Jeff, sorry. Okay. So let me just walk you through the various elements of the P&L from the guidance. Revenue of 5% to 6%, our oncology and ICB businesses together are in say to mid-single digits, and then our proton business, the core proton deals that are already in backlog should be somewhere between 60 million and 70 million, which is up about 40% year-over-year. I have to say I\u2019m a little nervous around exchange rates right now, we already know going into Q1, we are at a much different rate than we were in the year ago period. So we are hedging our best a little bit on the euro exchange rate on that revenue number.","Gross margin should be 42% to 43% for the total company with oncology in their long-term range of 43% to 44%, ICB in the low 40%ish and then a single-digit gross margin rate for the proton deals that are in backlog. It\u2019s going to put our EBIT margin at around 19% to 20% and that\u2019s about even with fiscal year 2014 with more proton revenue. Tax, I\u2019m putting a little broader range on it, again to reflect the currency movement we saw at 28% to 30%, which gets me to what I call non-GAAP EPS of $4.25 to $4.35, significant upside potential from the proton deals, but they wanted to take the downside volatility out of the guidance, and I want to thank you and several others who gave us that suggestion to think about. And then we\u2019ve got the $0.09 restructuring charge that gets you to the $4.16 to the $4.26.","Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird","Okay. We are going to \u2013 we\u2019ll just take this offline, I guess, because I\u2019m still $0.30 off from your number, even if I drop down that down at 20% EBIT margin and other stuff in your revenue guidance, so.","Elisha Finney","Jeff, you may be starting at the \u2013 you may be starting with the kind of a non-GAAP number for 2014, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m happy to walk you through it, but that\u2019s the detail. And then PT could add, if you just take Maryland its $0.17 plus the $0.03 and then Emory has about the same profitability. So that may be where your delta is as we are including nothing in Maryland or Emory in our guidance.","Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird","Okay.","Dow Wilson","The lesson we learned here from 2014 Jeff is, if it\u2019s not financed on the proton side, the timing is just too unpredictable.","Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird","Yes.","Dow Wilson","So, based on the feedback we received from a number of you, we have taken that out of our guidance, it does represent significant upside for us, but we\u2019ve \u2013 obviously we are not proud of this fourth quarter and not being in the fourth quarter earnings had a huge impact on us. We think Jeff, customer continues to move it along and were confidence is going to happen, but it has yet to happen, the timing is so difficult to predict that we have just taken it entirely out of game.","Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird","Alright. Well, I have dominated the first few minutes here and I have a feeling there will be other questions on this. So I\u2019m just going to get back in queue and we will talk offline. Thanks, Elisha.","","Elisha Finney","Thanks.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Amit Hazan from SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Amit Hazan - SunTrust","","Thanks very much. Hey, good afternoon guys.","Elisha Finney","We are having a hard time hearing you, Amit.","Amit Hazan - SunTrust","","Can you hear me any better now?","Dow Wilson","Yes.","Elisha Finney","Yes, that\u2019s better. Thanks.","Amit Hazan - SunTrust","Okay. Let me start just try to clarify around the 2015 guidance. Number one, just give us a sense of how much proton revenue there is may be theoretically or that could come in next year that\u2019s not in your guidance?","Elisha Finney","Okay. So, what is in my guidance is in the script is $60 million to $70 million. And those are Russia, Saudi, Cincinnati, all of the deals of that that we have booked into our backlog and we are starting to move forward on those deals. What is not in there is the $70 million that was as of the end of the fiscal year. Of course as we complete more on these projects, it\u2019s under the percentage of completion, but clearly we could have up to as much as $140 million of additional proton revenue stemming from the three deals that we have signed, but that has yet to get out the financing totally completed at this point.","Amit Hazan - SunTrust","Okay. And then kind of may be getting back to what I was expected to see for next year. It is really \u2013 talking about leverage, I mean, you have exclude I know your proton is going to grow a little bit, but you excluded a lot of your proton stuff from 2015 guidance. I think about your business, your North American oncology orders grew faster in the last year. And service is obviously growing very fast and that\u2019s a high margin. Why shouldn\u2019t we see leverage next year, you\u2019re taking a hit for some of the one-time offsetting you\u2019re planning to do in the first quarter. Shouldn\u2019t you be improving your operating margin in 2015 and why is that not happening?","Elisha Finney","Well, so the proton gross margin is going to be lower. So if all of that proton revenue materializes, it does have a downward impact on the gross margin for the total company. It absolutely gets us a great deal of leverage in the R&D, in the SG&A spending. So if I look at FY 2015, there\u2019s also a restructuring charge and I want to make sure that we have talked about that being in the first quarter. It\u2019s really the gross margin for the total company down a little bit, oncology should be right in the range that we\u2019ve talked about, ICB will be in the low 40s, but you have a proton business at a significantly lower gross margins with higher sales year-over-year.","Dow Wilson","Yes, I think the other thing I would add here is we are very gratified by the orders volume we saw in Q4 that was great. The first three quarters were lighter and so we have kind of got that flowing through the first half of the year, we have got some tough foreign exchange that we are looking at as they comes out of backlog and into sales. And then the other thing that we have got in the oncology business in 2015 is we will be taking our first Brazil units to the P&L, which has I think oncology is going to be fine overall, but kind of the better mix of the U.S. orders and software orders overall can be offset a little bit by the Brazil pressure we have that we deliver at the units down in Brazil.","Elisha Finney","If you do \u2013 if you take out the restructuring charge, the EBIT margin is right at about 20% in FY 2015.","Amit Hazan - SunTrust","Right. But is that actually I mean are you actually showing leverage in 2015, if you take out proton?","Elisha Finney","I\u2019ve not run it, but yes, I will run that very quickly for you Amit, but I think it would be \u2013 we would get some leverage. I have to back-off the proton revenue, back-off the gross margin, I haven\u2019t done that math right here in front of me, but we are growing R&D and SG&A slower than the top line next year for PT.","Amit Hazan - SunTrust","","Okay. Let me get back to the top line for a second, as I understand what you\u2019re excluding and that totally make sense, but 5% to 6% top line growth, if I look at your backlog ending your fiscal year, right, you\u2019ve got oncology up 7% in backlog, Imaging Components up a lot more, service obviously not in there, but growing faster. It sounds like your order trends are pretty good and may be you can comment on how you\u2019re thinking about that going forward on the order side. But why the 5% to 6% guidance if everything that I\u2019m looking at in backlog is looking stronger than that?","Elisha Finney","Yes. Well, a lot of our growth in backlog came right at the end of the fiscal year, and so we need to make sure that all of that is going to deliver in FY 2015. Additionally, I\u2019m looking at exchange rates today that are vastly different than where we were in the year ago period. And to be conservative, we are using today\u2019s rate that could either work for us or it could work against us. But the dollar is pretty strong right now and that\u2019s what we are using as we are penciling out FY 2015.","Amit Hazan - SunTrust","Okay. So I mean, may be I will make my final question. What would be your constant currency guidance for top line growth for 2015?","Elisha Finney","I\u2019m not going to guide to that, I mean, it\u2019s at the $1.26 to $1.27 level, so you can make assumptions on the yen, the Canadian and the euro and try and back into a number, but obviously, it would be higher, because the currencies have moved significantly against us.","Amit Hazan - SunTrust","Okay. I will jump back in queue.","Elisha Finney","Probably at a point or so.","Amit Hazan - SunTrust","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tycho W. Peterson from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Hey, first one on margins, specifically on oncology margins, you noted some (indiscernible) there, I know your guidance for next year is 43% to 44% for oncology, but as we think about more the business coming internationally why isn\u2019t the risk of further erosion within the oncology margins?","Elisha Finney","It\u2019s driven by the increase in service, which is in growing in double digits, which is in the low to mid-50% margin range. And we think we are going to get a resumption of software revenue moving into this year just given the very strong orders growth in software products that we had. So \u2013 and you\u2019re absolutely right with much of that could offset by the move to outside of North America. So net-net, if I look at oncology on the year, they came right in the middle of that 43% to 44% range, up 23 basis point and our goal is that we can continue for next year to keep oncology in that 43% to 44% range.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Okay. And then on proton, you saw the Indiana facility that gets shutdown obviously that wasn\u2019t yours, but maybe just talk about whether people are reevaluating the value proposition here and the returns on proton investment and is there a kind of a change in the landscape there?","Dow Wilson","No. I think there\u2019s a number of issues around proton. Clearly, one of the things driving proton is the inherent physics, the advantages of the Bragg Peak and the ability really to reduce dose to healthy tissue. One of the things that we identified when we acquired ACCEL seven years ago, was their technology for doing intensity modulated proton therapy was the best out there. And I think in large measure some of these older proton therapy systems do not have advanced capability for doing IMPT. And the analogy holds in radiation therapy if you don\u2019t have IMRT capability today you are no where. And so I think it was as much a technology reason as anything else. The Indiana, I haven\u2019t talked to them personally but it was one of the first proton centers in the U.S. It was older technology, generations behind, it\u2019s in a tough location, it\u2019s an hour outside Indianapolis plus outside Indianapolis not in a big location. It has a small catchment area. It did good work primarily research and if you had saw the report it was very costly for them to modernize in that location. So we feel very good about the partners that we are dealing with. Clearly the cost of protons is expensive and we have to work on that together to bring it down, but the clinical advantages of proton looks very, very positive.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Okay. And the last one on reimbursement, I mean you are obviously waiting for final reimbursement here with the assumption that bundling goes through it, that most people expect, what are you hearing from customers and was there some pent up demand potentially once the reimbursement gets put in place, how do you think about maybe the pacing of orders the next couple of quarters post the final reimbursement coming out?","Dow Wilson","Now, let me say this from the outset. For getting reimbursement for a second we are just looking at the North America market. North America market was up 11% in the fourth quarter, that\u2019s the best quarter we have had in North America in over two years, so we really like that. The market continues to be hospital market only. We see very little participation from the free-standing centers that\u2019s 90% plus of our market right now. I think what we are seeing in the proposal is that payments for the hospital market are going to remain okay. So we expect them to be up 1% to 2%. We like the fact that the bundled payment for single fraction SRS favors Varian Linux it\u2019s the same for any SRS SBRT treatment and there is no price advantage to any competitor in the marketplace.","In the proposal the freestanding rates are going to get haircut again as proposed. The rationale behind that is CMS wants to move the vault from a direct to an indirect expense and exclude it from the cost calculation that gets to reimbursement. We have had a major effort with our customer partners with Congress to oppose those cuts. We won\u2019t know if those cuts get modified until November. We did have a huge chunk of the Senate and the House signed the letter. So I think we have made what argument we can. But at this point I would say in the proposal the freestanding centers are looking at another 5% plus cut. And is it going to impact us at this point is less than 10% of our market. We had a good fourth quarter and I would our funnel looks pretty good.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","Thank you for taking the questions. And I wanted maybe just to start with a little bit follow-up to the commentary you just made regarding the U.S. market and maybe sort of a little bit broader context. And I think you obviously have faced some headwinds whether it was reimbursement related or freeze in hospital CapEx spending, but as we look across the early data points you have gotten out of this quarter, the environment does seem better whether there was comments from some industrial players or out of the hospitals themselves, can you maybe just sort of talk about what the nature of the conversations you are having with customers today, are you sensing any unfreezing of environment relative to call it 12 or 24 months ago?","Dow Wilson","I would say some of the trends that we have talked about before remains. We are seeing the strongest, stronger and the good news is that they doubling down and investing. This last quarter we had multi-system wins at a number of places, they are betting on technology, they really see the future of SRS and SBRT and are making that bet. There is a lot of investment in software for oncology information systems. We think we have got a very good position there. Being clinically rich is very important. And that\u2019s an advantage we have coming from our space versus some of the enterprise players. So, I would say conversations with our hospital system partners remain very robust. They are looking at technology as a means of differentiation. They are looking at consolidation in their local regional markets and the purchases, I mean, the kind of downside of that is purchases are bigger and take a little longer, but I think we have done very well. On the freestanding side, this is very, very flat.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe on the imaging business that has been a very strong contributor to your overall top line growth over the past couple of years, can you maybe just give us some perspective on where you think we are in the sort of digital conversion and when \u2013 are we operating at a above normal long-term trend line right now or is that a business that it can continue to sustain the growth that it has over the past several periods?","Dow Wilson","I mean there is a number of segments kind of sub-segments in here. The flat panel business is really what\u2019s driving the digitization. We are up 13% on the year. We had a tough comp in Q4, but flat panel business is continuing to rock as we see that as very strong. Tube business is it participates in the digitization, but it also participates in the analog world. It\u2019s a little bit more of the replacement business. You are down slightly on the year. So, I think that\u2019s kind of following the broader trend in radiology. In the fourth quarter, we had a huge order in our security and inspection business, $40 million, that\u2019s going to make next year in this business tough to explain all year, kind of those lumps come and go, but I think as a continued trend, we will see if flat panel business continue to grow very strongly and tubes would be a little bit of flattish to slightly up scenario and then security will come and go with big customer purchases.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then maybe just the last question on cash and I know you have been very explicit about share repurchases being pretty consistently a priority, but as you kind of look at what\u2019s going on over the past couple of years, a deceleration in the overall top line growth compression in your operating margin and some might argue a peaking in your return on capital metrics in the context of a large cash balance and why not look to get more aggressive on either the M&A front or other external investments that could restore the growth rate or give you some more flexibility from a diversification standpoint?","Dow Wilson","It\u2019s a good question, David and we are looking very hard at it. We have done a couple acquisitions this year that we are very excited about. They are pretty small frankly. We acquired Transpire and Velocity. They both help out our software business in oncology. We think that\u2019s a big opportunity that\u2019s the space we continue to look at. They were small acquisitions, but they are already contributing and the funnels. Transpire is a little more on margin rate side, was intellectual property that we acquired there and then Velocity, we had a terrific ASTRO with velocity. We have got a robust funnel of activity there. And \u2013 so I think we got some good execution on these two most recent acquisitions. We did the Calypso acquisition three years ago and I\u2019d say that\u2019s been slow, but now with SBRT starting to take off, we are seeing some nice growth kind of on the horizon of Calypso. More broadly, I would say from a 30,000 foot level, oncology software is one focused area for us and the other is strengthening our components business. We got a great business model, a great team in the components business and that will be another place that we look to enhance our portfolio.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","Got it. Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley","Hi, good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. Just two quick ones on the model actually, Dow, I wonder if you could give us a sense for how big ASTRO was in the quarter as a driver of orders? I know in past years where ASTRO was moved from one quarter to the next or?","Dow Wilson","Steve, I think if anything ASTRO in our fourth quarter is a drag. So, I mean, I take my whole sales team and I park them in a convention center, the least productive phase in the world. And so, I think it\u2019s an indication of the momentum that\u2019s out there.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley","So, could we see North American order momentum here into fiscal \u201815 remain close to this level?","Dow Wilson","All I can tell you is my funnel looks good.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then just circling back on proton, I appreciate the conservatism with the approach from proton for the fiscal \u201815 guidance and the specifics, Elisha on what the contribution could be to the top line? Could you give us a sense for how much proton could contribute for fiscal \u201815 on the bottom line if everything goes toward a best case scenario?","Elisha Finney","Well, and again it depends on how much of the project is completed that if I simply take Maryland which we just said were $0.17 at the pre-tax margin line and $0.03 in the tax and you double it for Emory, which is roughly the equivalent project. You can see that it could be significant, it\u2019s the timing and that is what is impossible for us to predict, but I don\u2019t think there is a chance that both Maryland and Emory would be totally complete within this fiscal year. Chances are Maryland could bring in maybe $0.20 and Emory could bring in perhaps half that and in this fiscal year and then the balance would be in a future fiscal year.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley","And that would incremental to the guidance?","Elisha Finney","Yes.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley","Great, perfect. Thanks so much, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from ISI Group. Please proceed with your question.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So, maybe just to add on to that prior question on the guidance on proton, right, and I think I am looking at your sort of prepared remarks the guidance excludes the contracted proton projects that are not yet financed or booked into the backlog. I guess, just to give us a sense, I understand Maryland and Emory being $0.20 and $0.05, thanks for the color. Were there any other projects, I mean, if you have done the normal way that you would have guided, right, were there any other sort of proton projects that were contracted, but not yet financed and now that is being excluded?","Dow Wilson","We mentioned on the call, there is a project of course in Maryland, a project in Atlanta, and a project in Dallas. Those are the three projects, where we have been contacted, but the deals aren\u2019t yet financed. We have not booked them into our backlog until they are financed.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group","I guess, Dow, I was asking on the EPS impact rate or there is a relative size?","Dow Wilson","Yes. And none of those are in our EPS guidance.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group","I know they are not in the EPS guidance, but if I guess any magnitude and what the magnitude is or what\u2019s been put out on the guidance?","Elisha Finney","Yes. Well, as I just mentioned, I mean, if you assume Maryland at the $0.17 pre-tax, $0.03 of tax impact. Emory, I don\u2019t believe, will get as far this year. On completing that project, we are moving forward, but it\u2019s again, that project is just behind Maryland. And it could add maybe half that much. So, that\u2019s at the outset.","Dow Wilson","Yes. And I just want to underscore the big if here. We burned down this last year. So, we have taken it out of our guidance. We are confident our customer will get it done, but the timing is just impossible to predict. So, we are getting out of the timing business.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group","Got it. Fair enough. And I guess maybe one bigger picture question on the environment of what you are seeing, you had some pretty good growth in the U.S., including double-digit growth, what\u2019s driving the growth out there? Is this new products and what\u2019s been the temporary response? And I guess as a corollary to that, when you look at the medium term outlook, how should we think about gross margins for oncology, right, with specifically given that at some point service growth, how long can that continue and offset the emerging markets sort of which is below the corporate margin levels?","Dow Wilson","Let me talk to the U.S. market thing here first. The \u2013 I think what\u2019s driving the U.S. market is new technology. People really want to take advantage of the new capabilities that the team is developing, especially for lung cancer and liver cancer. People want \u2013 hypo-fractionation continues to be a big trend. And as our customers go from a little bit of hypo-fractionation to a lot of hypo-fractionation, they need dedicated platforms to do it. And so I think hypo-fractionation is a big piece in the U.S. that\u2019s driving the growth. And our position with TrueBeam and Edge is terrific. The other thing is our \u2013 if you were at ASTRO I thought our software line up was just (gangbusters). And we got game in software.","And I think that we had very good \u2013 when you look at the U.S. orders coming out of the fourth quarter that\u2019s very, very positive for us. So that was good. I will go to your third question and turn it over to Elisha for some of the margin rate stuff. But the \u2013 for the service business how long can it continue. We just had our best unit year ever. Our units were up about 12% year-over-year orders wise. So we continue to see good install base expansion outside of the U.S. U.S. is a replacement market, OUS is not, we think there is another 10,000 machines that are needed outside of the U.S. So I think that we have got a double digit scenario. We are struggling a little bit with FX as we look at \u2013 as we look at our service business for 2015. But as we look at service long-term I think it remains a double digit scenario for a long period and I will let Elisha comment on some of the international mix on margin rates.","Elisha Finney","Sure. So again for FY \u201915 we are assuming that oncology is going to be again in the 43% to 44% margin range. The growth in service which is at a significantly higher margin than the equipment and the growth in software we think is going to offset the move to outside of North America. And we expect we are going to begin shipping on our Brazil tender this fiscal year and that is at extremely lower gross margin rate as we talked about for a while. So that will be in there as well, but we have continued to think long-term that 43% to 44% range will hold. I will say Q1 just based on where we see the backlog and where we see shipment deliveries and it\u2019s probably closer to 43% level in Q1 and then as more software and service through the balance of the year we will see it start to pick up from there.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group","Thanks guys. I will step back in the queue.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Wittes from Brean Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital","Hi, thanks for taking the question.","Dow Wilson","Hi, Jason.","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital","Hi guys. Elisha I just want to follow-up there has been a lot of questions about proton it\u2019s obviously the big distinguishing factor this year, from what you said thus far it sounds like potentially Maryland didn\u2019t end, Atlanta potentially hit this year and then you are going to have to look at the percent of complete to see how much of it actually would hit the P&L and I think you said that\u2019s about assuming best case scenario about $0.30, it sounds to me like Dallas is too far is not yet \u2013 is not for long answer really have much of an impact whether or not you can close the financing, is that the right way to think about it?","Elisha Finney","I think that\u2019s fair and just to be clear it\u2019s our customers, who is getting the financing. They are making good progress. They are working with a very large institution I mean we had no reason to believe that this won\u2019t get done. In fact we are committed to stepping in as a minority lender in this facility, but until it\u2019s done it\u2019s just not done and I am black and blue from this proton deal all year along and we are taking the downside volatility out of this.","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital","You are assuming black and blue from Maryland I don\u2019t know are the other \u2013 the Dallas and Emory facility is also sort of somewhat unpredictable from the same line\u2026?","Elisha Finney","They have yet to be financed.","Dow Wilson","They are not quite so black and blue, but\u2026","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital","Got it.","Elisha Finney","Maryland has been significant throughout this fiscal year and we are just now getting to the point where it can be significant in FY \u201915.","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital","Okay. Thank you. So then the other\u2026","Dow Wilson","Just to underscore Jason I mean again there is if on this and we are just taking ourselves out of the timing business on these.","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital","Fair enough.","Dow Wilson","There was 100% confidence they would be in our guidance.","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital","Got it. The other question is just to understand kind of how we should look at oncology, obviously you have got some pretty high expectations for software this year. I mean that\u2019s been growing at a very nice cliff, should we anticipate an acceleration and if I think about your oncology growth overall should we assume that product sales kind of remain in the low-single digits and we see some acceleration in service which is already kind of been in that sort of low to mid-teen range?","Elisha Finney","Well, maybe one way to look at this, let me take a stab at this, oncology, if I just look at where we ended the year on backlog, it was up about 7%. Now, again we think there is some FX risk in that, but that just gives you a flavor, because that obviously \u2013 that is only equipment and software, it does not include our service business, which is growing a little faster. So we are early in the year, much of this growth in backlog came in the Q3 and most of it in Q4, we need to make sure if it\u2019s going to deliver this fiscal year or next fiscal year, we\u2019re being conservative on the FX rate to the extent we can. But you are right, I mean with backlog being up 7%, if things were to start to moving in our favor, there could be potentially a little upside there. It\u2019s just too early to call at this point in the Year.","Dow Wilson","Just to put a final point, the software contract can deliver quicker than data product contracts from my understanding, in other words\u2026.","Elisha Finney","A lot of times they are."," ","Dow Wilson","A lot of times they are green.","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital","Okay. And then just on x-ray and components. I suppose that this has been somewhat a rough year, what kind of expectations that we have for 2015 for that business?","Dow Wilson","I mean, I think, the it\u2019s been a double-digit business in panel, I think we will continue to see that. I think on the year we\u2019re probably looking at strong single-digit performance in the x-ray business.","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital","Okay, great, thanks. That\u2019s all I have.","Dow Wilson","We are going to have a little bit of this lumpiness, because of the big security order that we took in the fourth quarter this past year, but the core business is going to do fine.","Elisha Finney","And they sell mostly in dollars for what it\u2019s worth.","Dow Wilson","Yes, yes.","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital","Understood. Thanks a lot. I\u2019ll jump back in queue.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon, good evening.","Dow Wilson","Hi, Raj.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies","I am wondering if I could just ask a little on the first quarter guidance, 0% to 2%, I think you\u2019re guiding to 5% to 6% per year, so I\u2019m sure up swing as you move through the year, but why so low in the first quarter the 0% to 2%?","Elisha Finney","Yes. So, well if I look back again, if I look back at where oncology was in the year ago Q1 and we have on average delivery about a year later, it was fairly low growth at that point with the backlog up in very low-single digits. So we expect that this is going to build as we go throughout the year. So I think both oncology and our imaging components businesses will be in the low single digits, some impact from FX when we look at the significant shift quarter-over-quarter and that\u2019s really where \u2013 that\u2019s really where that\u2019s coming from. And then our proton therapy business will be down, it looks like in Q1 assuming no it doesn\u2019t happen in the core projects just given the timing it will be down from the year ago period.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just it\u2019s my proton questions as well. This decision can move from not looking at \u2013 not considering projects for inclusion in your forecast unless they have financing. Is that any bearing on whether something actually goes into backlog or not or have you changed your criteria and how you assess your backlog at this point?","Elisha Finney","No, so none of our criteria on how things get into backlog have changed and again we\u2019ve got signed contracts, we have delivered the cyclotron, I mean that we have got a lot of things that are going on, but we will not book it into backlog until the financing contingency is listed. So, the only change here is how we select the fields and guidance just given the timing of when they are going to recur.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies","Okay. So, that\u2019s the \u2013 if they can have a contingency around financing to go into backlog, but the financing does not necessarily have to be secured?","Elisha Finney","It doesn\u2019t have to be 100% complete, but it has to be sufficiently completed to where we are comfortable that we can take the revenue.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies","Okay. And then just lastly on proton, I think it seems like you\u2019ve booked anything really in proton in the quarter and I guess I\u2019m curious about your views on this, because you now have a single room center and given the extreme cost of these systems, have you seen much of a change in perception in the marketplace of where your customers are looking now in terms proton?","Dow Wilson","I think the good news is, the funnel is robust and at this point we have a good funnel in both kind of smaller proton center market as well as bigger multi-room market and we have got capabilities in both segments. Last year, we booked three orders, we booked Cincinnati, Taiwan and Paul Scherrer Institute. So, we feel very good about getting those orders booked last year and the funnel looks pretty good for us.","Elisha Finney","Putting on a nice backlog in the proton business.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies","Okay, thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions. I would like to hand the call back over to management for closing comments.","Dow Wilson - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks very much. Thank you all for participating.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Spencer Sias, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Sias, you may now begin.","Spencer R. Sias","Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Varian Medical Systems conference call for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013. With me are Dow Wilson, President and CEO; Elisha Finney, CFO; and Clarence Verhoef, our Corporate Controller. Dow and Elisha will summarize our results, and we'll take your questions following the presentation. To simplify our discussion, unless otherwise stated, all references to the quarter or year or fiscal quarters and fiscal years. Quarterly comparisons are for the fourth quarter fiscal 2013 versus the fourth quarter fiscal '12.","Please be advised that this presentation and discussion contains forward-looking statements.

Details are posted on our Investor Relations site. We hope to see you there. And now here's Dow.","Dow R. Wilson","Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone. We're reporting mixed, but promising results for the fourth quarter of 2013. Revenue and earnings fell short of our targets for the quarter, primarily because of slow short cycle sales of oncology systems upgrades. Our backlog grew 1% despite a $156-million adjustment that I'll cover in a moment, and we generated order growth in all oncology markets outside of North America during the quarter with the help of a strong performance in our service business.","We had a record performance in our X-ray Products business, and we reached an important milestone in our Proton Therapy business.","To summarize our financial results, which Elisha will detail in a few moments, our net earnings were $1.08 per diluted share for the fourth quarter, equal to the year-ago quarter, and $3.98 per diluted share for fiscal year 2013, up 6% from the prior year. Revenues for the quarter were $770 million, up 2% on a reported basis and 3% on a constant currency basis. Company revenues for the fiscal year were $2.9 billion, up 5% on a reported basis and 6% on a constant currency basis.","As we reported in our press release, we reduced our quarter ending backlog by $156 million. This was the result of ongoing uncertainty in the U.S. health care environment, as well as a higher level of cancellations in the quarter, primarily relating to orders from small freestanding clinic developers whose projects did not move forward. This prompted us to reevaluate similar transactions. We determined that some orders were no longer firm and consequently decided to remove them from our backlog. We ended the year with a $2.9 billion backlog, up 1% from the end of fiscal year 2012.","Today, less than 5% of our total company backlog is comprised of orders from freestanding clinics. The remaining freestanding customers with orders in the backlog include large long-term partners who have continued to expand their operations. In order to provide additional detail going forward, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013, we are changing our presentation of orders to gross orders. A table showing the gross to net order comparison is provided in our press release.","I will now focus on the operational highlights of our businesses. Oncology Systems grew gross orders on a global basis versus a strong year-ago comparison despite ongoing weakness in the U.S. health care market. Oncology gross orders grew by 3% to $841 million in the fourth quarter, while net orders, including backlog adjustments, fell by 13% to $685 million. For the year, Oncology gross orders rose by 2% to $2.6 billion, while annual net orders, including our backlog adjustment, fell by 4% to $2.3 billion.","Compared to the year-ago quarter, gross orders in all markets outside North America grew by 12%, more than offsetting a 6% decline in North America. Orders grew strongly in several international markets, including Brazil, China, Japan, Scandinavia and Latin America. As an indication of our expanding global footprint, the quarter included some $20 million in orders from emerging markets such as Georgia, Kazakhstan, Guatemala and Burkina Faso. China was particularly strong, with fourth quarter gross order growth of 30%, which brought the order growth rate there for the fiscal year to 25%.","China is clearly investing in radiation oncology for its cancer patients, and we have stepped up our investment to serve them. In August, we held a very successful oncology summit for more than 525 customers in China, and we believe we are building stronger relationships than ever in that community. We've established a strong team in China that is performing well.","As you may have heard, earlier this week, Brazil's Ministry of Health conducted its reverse auction to equip its public health care centers with 80 linear accelerators. I'm pleased to report that Varian was the successful bidder, and we are now working with the Ministry of Health to finalize the deal. This calls for delivery of our digital Clinac CX accelerators over the next several years for some $55.5 million. We are pleased with the outcome, proud of our team's performance and excited about the prospect of helping Brazil reach its goal of giving more cancer patients access to radiotherapy. This is an expanding market for radiotherapy.","Turning to the U.S we continue to see growing interest in our new stereotactic radiosurgery products, as well as in our software and service offerings that we believe are setting the stage for long-term growth. This is largely a replacement market. At the moment, the U.S. market is challenged by ongoing uncertainties related to the implementation of health care reform, cumulative cuts and reimbursements for freestanding clinics and consolidation of radiation oncology centers. We believe these factors are causing customers to change business models and to slow purchasing decisions. One impact of this was that our short cycle upgrade business, where orders typically convert to sales within the same quarter, were lighter than we anticipated.","We continue to believe that market adoption of stereotactic radiosurgery will be a catalyst for replacing aging equipment with new products such as our EDGE systems and upgrade packages, as well as our more advanced software tools. As we've noted in earlier discussions, the proposed reimbursement rates for 2014 support investment in modern treatment systems and radiosurgery capability. We are hopeful that the new rates will be finalized on schedule next month, now that the 2-week government shutdown is behind us.","Our Oncology Service business grew 12% during the quarter, driven by higher capture rates and more software service agreements. TrueBeam contracts continue to drive global growth in the business. During the quarter, we received the CE Mark for our EDGE radiosurgery system, enabling us to move forward in marketing this product now in most major markets of the world. The first treatment using an EDGE system is slated to take place at Champalimaud Centre in Lisbon. To date, we have received orders for more than 10 EDGE systems, as well as more than 50 EDGE technology upgrade packages.","We also saw increased traction during the quarter in our Calypso motion management systems for enhancing radiosurgery precision. This underlines the growing interest in stereotactic radiosurgery.","At last month's ASTRO show, we unveiled RapidPlan, a game-changing software for enhancing the quality standards, speed and cost efficiency of treatment planning. This introduction generated great interest among customers at the show and reinforces our global leadership in radiotherapy treatment planning software. This month, we received 510(k) clearance to begin marketing and selling RapidPlan to the more than 3,000 customers who already have installations or Eclipse Treatment Planning software. This represents a several hundred million dollar opportunity for our Oncology business.","Innovation and new product development is a key to our strategy, and we increased our R&D investment during the quarter and for the year. We see a lot of growth opportunities for the company and we have stepped up R&D, particularly on global product opportunities and software in Oncology Systems.","Turning to X-ray Products. Fourth quarter gross orders rose 26% to $183 million, and gross orders for the fiscal year rose 15% to $585 million. Our X-ray Products business generated double-digit order growth for the quarter and the fiscal year in both tubes and flat panels. Our components are being designed to the next-generation imaging equipment from several large manufacturers and we're growing by gaining share in this market.","The quarter was particularly strong for our flat-panel digital image detectors, which grew orders by more than 30%, thanks to the continued shift away from film-based imaging to the speed, convenience and cost efficiency of filmless imaging. This growth occurred in spite of enhanced pricing pressure in the panel business. We also saw market acceptance for our new mammography panel, which should bolster sales in fiscal year '14.","We enjoyed double-digit order growth in our Tubes business, thanks to large orders from existing customers and the addition of significant new customers who should help to drive growth going forward. We also gained ground with our patented anode grounded technology. Our imaging workstations and image processing software offerings are beginning to gain traction among some of our bigger customers as well.","The company's Other category, which is comprised of the Security and Inspection Products business, the Varian Particle Therapy business and the Ginzton Technology Center, recorded gross orders of $18 million in the fourth quarter and $86 million for the full fiscal year 2013, down $130 million from the prior year when the company booked 2 proton orders totaling over $120 million.","Varian Particle Therapy achieved an important landmark during the quarter with the filing of our 510(k) clearance with the FDA, which is an important step closer to the first patient treatments at the Scripps Proton Therapy center in San Diego. Now I'll turn it over to Elisha.","Elisha W. Finney","Thanks, Dow, and hello, everyone. Let me start by talking about the backlog adjustment in the quarter. Historically, we have reported net orders which we have defined as new or gross orders minus customer cancellations, currency adjustments and other orders that we no longer expect to convert to revenue.","Looking back over the last several years, annual backlog adjustments typically have been between 3% and 5% of total company backlog. Given a larger than typical level of cancellations this quarter, particularly from small freestanding center developers, as well as the ongoing uncertainty in the U.S. health care environment, we reevaluated similar transactions and decided to remove $156 million from our backlog. This brings the total backlog adjustment for the fiscal year to $255 million, about 4% more than in a typical year. In order to provide you with an additional level of detail going forward, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013, we are changing the presentation of orders to gross orders. Net orders will be given for comparison purposes.","While Dow has already covered orders, I want to briefly talk about the constant currency growth rates for the quarter. In comparing quarter-over-quarter exchange rates, there was a significant negative impact from the weakening of the yen and a small benefit from the strengthening of the euro and other currencies.","Oncology gross orders for the quarter increased 3% in dollars and were up 5% in constant currency. Oncology's North American gross orders were down 6% in dollars and in constant currency.","EMEA gross orders increased about 13% in dollars and 10% in constant currency. Asia, where we saw a roughly 25% quarter-over-quarter weakening of the yen, was up 2% in dollars, but up 14% in constant currency. Oncology gross orders in the small rest of world market grew by about 40% in dollars and constant currency.","Fourth quarter revenues for the total company increased 2% in dollars and 3% in constant currency. For the full fiscal year, total company revenues were up 5% in dollars and up 6% in constant currency. And while we don't capture FX-adjusted revenue by business, virtually the entire effect of the significant yen decline was felt in Oncology Systems, where we sell in local currency. To put this in perspective, for the full fiscal year, the yen negatively impacted Oncology Systems revenues by roughly $30 million. Our X-ray components businesses sell almost exclusively in dollars and therefore were not impacted.","Oncology Systems posted a 1% decline in revenues during the quarter, with revenue split evenly between North America and the rest of the global markets. While our customers generally took delivery of equipment in backlog as we expected, oncology revenue was $10 million to $15 million lighter than we anticipated due to short-cycle upgrade business that did not materialize in the quarter. For the full year, Oncology revenues were up 3% to $2.3 billion.","Service performed well, with revenues up 9% in the quarter and up 12% for the year, accounting for 35% of total Oncology revenue.","X-ray Products posted a fourth quarter revenue gain of 6%, with Tubes up slightly from the year-ago quarter and Panels up in double digits. For the year, X-ray Products revenues increased 11%, with 8% growth in Tubes and 14% growth in Panels. This business achieved a milestone with Flat Panels exceeding more than 50% of the X-ray Products business for the year.","Revenues from businesses under the Other category increased by $11 million for the quarter and the year due to continued progress in completing our Scripps, Saudi and Russia Proton Therapy projects.","Total company gross margins for the quarter was 42.7%, about equal with the year-ago quarter. Similarly, for the full year, total company gross margin was 42.5%, also about equal to the year-ago period. Oncology Systems gross margins was 43%, down from the year-ago period by 0.5 points, including a $2-million impact from the excise tax. For the full fiscal year, Oncology Systems gross margin was 43.3%, down about 40 basis points from last fiscal year due to the excise tax.","We continue to believe that Oncology can sustain margins in the 43% to 44% range.","X-ray Products gross margin for the quarter was 42.2%, down about 1 point from the year-ago period due to the continued pricing pressure in the Panels business. For the full year, the X-ray Products gross margin was 41.5%, down about 1.5 points from last year, again due to Panel pricing. We continue to believe that this business can sustain gross margins in the low 40% level.","Fourth quarter SG&A expenses were $111 million, or 14% of revenues, a slight improvement as a percentage of revenues from the year-ago quarter. Fourth quarter R&D expenses were $57 million, or 7% of revenues, up 1 point as a percent of revenues from the year-ago quarter due to stepped up investments and our product pipeline. For the full year, operating expenses were 22% of revenue, up slightly from last year.","Fourth quarter operating earnings totaled $161 million, or 21% of revenues, down about 1 point, reflecting our increased investment in R&D. For the full fiscal year, the operating margin was 20.7% of revenues, down 0.5 points from the previous year, including the impact of the excise tax.","Depreciation and amortization totaled $15 million for the quarter and $63 million for the fiscal year. The effective tax rate was 27.5% for the quarter and 28.4% for the year.","Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased from the year ago quarter to 108.8 million, due largely to our ongoing share repurchase program. And diluted EPS was $1.08 for the fourth quarter and $3.98 for the fiscal year.","Turning to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we secured a new $500 million 5-year term loan and maintained a $300 million revolving line of credit. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 billion, debt of $506 million and stockholders' equity of $1.7 billion. DSO at 85 was equal to the year-ago quarter and up 1 day from the previous quarter.","Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $155 million, significantly higher than net income due to working capital improvements. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $455 million. Primary uses of cash were $135 million towards the repurchase of 1.9 million shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had 2 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2013.","Now I'll turn it back over to Dow for the outlook.","Dow R. Wilson","Thanks, Elisha. We remain confident and committed to executing on our strategic initiatives, global growth, innovation, software and service, commercializing in protons and operational excellence. Our product line and global presence has never been stronger. The company is driving for continued growth in all of our businesses during fiscal year 2014.","For the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, we expect revenues to grow by 6% to 7% and earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $0.87 to $0.91 per share. For fiscal year 2014, we expect revenues to grow in the range of 6% to 8% and earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $4.22 to $4.34.","We're now ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Amit Bhalla from Citigroup.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wanted to start with fiscal '14 guidance for a second. Can you just walk us through what the underlying assumptions are for revenue and what you're including in on proton? And walk us also through the leverage. There's not as much leverage from the 6% to 8% revenue to the earnings number you've outlined, so can you just explain the earnings and revenue on guidance?","Elisha W. Finney","Sure. Let me just kind of give you the walk on fiscal year '14. So sales should be up for total company between 6% and 8%. Remember, the yen is significantly weaker now than in the year-ago first half, about 20% to 25%. The euro is a little stronger, but it doesn't completely offset the yen. In that number, our core businesses, if I look at Oncology and the X-ray Products group, it's going to increase somewhere between the 5% and 6% range on a combined basis. So we are expecting some significant pickup in proton revenue in the year. Amit, it's difficult, just given the timing of these deals, but I'm anticipating anywhere from $100 million to $150 million. So I just picked the midpoint at $125 million, and it's going to be -- that's going to be somewhere around a 15% gross margin. So the gross margin at about 42% is down about 0.5 point year-over-year, primarily due to the increased proton revenue at a significantly lower margin. And we do have an additional quarter of excise tax that we didn't have last year. I'd say, both Oncology and X-ray, we're anticipating to be in that range of margins that we've talked about. So they're doing a good job of sustaining that. And the ROS or EBIT margin is somewhere between 20%, 21%. Again, it's going to be a little lower due primarily to the gross margin and the higher proton revenue. We are increasing R&D in oncology. But as a percentage of revenue, because proton is growing so rapidly, total company should stay at about that 7%. Tax, around 28%, and then that gets you to the EPS guidance that we gave you.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just a second follow-up question on just this shift to gross orders and the cancellations. I'm just trying to understand the rationale because you can make the one quarter adjustment and take these cancellations out. And then going forward, are you assuming that there's more volatility in your cancellation rates? Because I would just assume you would just continue to report net orders, unless you're thinking that cancellation rates are going to be more volatile going forward. Can you help explain this rationale?","Dow R. Wilson","Yes, sure. Let's start with just repeating why the adjustment again. We did have an unusual level of cancellations in the quarter. These were primarily large orders with small freestanding clinic developers that did not move forward. The U.S. health care environment, especially in this freestanding clinic environment, cumulative with years of reimbursement cuts, the ongoing uncertainty related to the implementation of longer-term health care reform on them and just what we've seen in terms of some consolidation in that market and purchasing delays at the end of this last quarter, especially as there was a lot of conversation around the repeal of the excise tax, you know that caused people, I think, to delay. And so we went and looked at what had happened there and the environment led us to reevaluate order firmness of similar customers. And that's how we netted out to the adjustment. I'll let Elisha talk about some of your other questions more directly here.","Elisha W. Finney","Sure. Well, the good news, Amit, is now, in terms of these small freestanding centers -- I mean, in total, freestanding centers are now less than 5% of the company's total backlog. And what's remaining tend to be the large, stable customers and they are continuing to expand. So I want to stress that the type of customers that we were talking about, that came out of backlog, were very different. Roughly half the adjustment was from cancellations and about half from this reevaluation that we did, of similar customers that were in backlog. In terms of volatility, you're going to see both. You're going to get both growth and you're going to get net, and you're going to get ending backlog. So I think it gives you more level of detail. Historically, the adjustments have been about 4% in any given year. I don't expect that's going to change significantly, but you'll be able to see that quarter-over-quarter. And we think it gives you a good reflection of actually what's going on currently in the market environment that we're dealing in when you have the gross orders.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Robert W. Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So just a couple more questions on, I guess, EPS guidance, more than anything, for next year. So, Elisha, I'm trying to understand -- I mean, the yen is basically 6 months into its big move here. So the year-over-year kind of impact for next year shouldn't be hugely different than the incremental headwind yet this year. Brazil, is there anything from your guidance in Brazil at this point? I guess that's what I'm trying to figure out, if that's why EPS was so much lower. There are some losses in year one of the Brazil deal that might be in guidance for next year?","Elisha W. Finney","Very little. I mean, we are -- this just happened this week obviously. We're still talking with the MOH, negotiating contracts, which is going to take us a bit of time to complete. We're just now starting to discuss what their delivery schedule plans are for this year and beyond. So we don't -- we think the impact to FY '14 is likely to be fairly small. We don't disclose gross margin by region or by customer, obviously. But as we promised, the equipment margin is lower on this deal. But looking forward, over the long term, particularly if you look at what service and upgrade opportunities we have, we think this is profitable for Varian, and we're very excited about it. Even if you look out over 5 years, it's going to represent about 2% of our total delivery. So again, it's a very large deal, but when you spread it over 5 years, the impact should not be that significant in any given quarter or any given year.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","All right. Then the follow-up there, I guess -- but I would assume, if -- at $55 million on Brazil, at best probably over a 5- or 6-year period is somewhere near break even, hopefully a little positive, but near break even. So in the first year or 2, how much dilution should we think from that, number one? And then just again kind of trying to understand the bridge on guidance, I thought there was going to be about a $0.06 gain from the University of Maryland deal this year. Is that $0.06 gain, in fiscal '14, in that low guidance number you've put out now for this next year?","Elisha W. Finney","So again, we -- it's way too early on Brazil to know what deliveries they want this year. Again, my assumption is that it's going to have a minimal impact on FY '14. It's really more of an FY '15 and '16. In terms of the guidance -- I mean, the timing of not just Maryland but all proton deals is -- it's just -- it's very difficult to predict. If that comes through in the short term, we should be at the higher end of guidance. So yes. I mean, of course this proton business -- I think it's about a $0.10. That's why we put a pretty wide range on our guidance this year. It comes down to the timing of these deals, some of which are already in backlog, some which are not. I mean, I have to say the Maryland -- the building, the project is progressing nicely. They are not yet ready for equipment. They've completed equity financing. They're making progress with the debt, and they're working with the German trade bank, which just is complicated and takes time to do. So when we get all the t's crossed and i's dotted, we'll book the order and start recording revenue at that time.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","All right. And then last question, I promise, just on R&D. Dow, you talked about this at ASTRO when you and I met, that R&D -- you had so many projects you wanted to invest in. We see R&D up significantly year-over-year this quarter. It sounds like -- I guess, how would you quantify, Elisha or Dow, how much R&D might be weighing on EPS next year? I know you said 7% of sales, but it sounds like x proton, kind of the rest of the R&D budget is going up pretty significantly. Any color you can provide on the projects there and the impact that's having next year?","Dow R. Wilson","Within Oncology, I'd say the 2 investment areas we're making are in the software area. We think there's a big opportunity, especially in informatics. That's a global opportunity. And we think we've got a really good space to grow there in both the U.S. and outside of the U.S. And then I'll say the rest is really in global product opportunities, hardware and software, but we've got a number of nice initiatives going on to make sure we've got global product lined up for markets where we struggle with complexity of existing systems. And customers want very high capability at a good price. And of course, we want to maintain our margin on those product offerings. So that's a key investment area for us. Those are the 2 big areas.","Elisha W. Finney","And, Jeff, once you pencil this out in your model, you'll see that the absolute dollars are going up roughly 10%. Most of that increase is in Oncology Systems. But as a percentage of revenue, it's about flat, given the sizable increase in proton revenues that we're expecting.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a clarification. In your prepared remarks, Elisha, as you were discussing the backlog adjustment, it sounded like it was predominantly freestanding, partially hospitals where you're seeing the change in the market. And, Dow, you've pointed out a number of issues in the freestanding center market that drove the backlog adjustment. Is this 80-20 freestanding versus hospitals, where the issues are driving the adjustment?","Elisha W. Finney","I think that's probably a fair assumption, Steve.","Dow R. Wilson","Yes, yes.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then I guess given that backdrop, it's a little surprising to see the adjustment, given that we had the solid proposals out there on the reimbursement rates for '14. I wonder, Dow, if you could just give us your latest thoughts on the outlook for the market in the U.S. When does it get better? What might the market for orders look like over the next year or so?","Dow R. Wilson","Yes. I'll start by saying the proposal is not good for the freestanding centers, and it's kind of the cumulative impact of reimbursement rate reductions that we've seen for freestanding centers over the last 3 or 4 years. So -- and I think we've been pretty consistent about pointing that out. The proposal is fairly good on the hospital side. We understand that the release of the final rules may be delayed a few weeks. Frankly, the delay shouldn't have a material effect on the market for 2014 and the rates should still go into effect on January 1, at least that's what we're hearing. Just to kind of review for everybody, the hospitals are positive. It's focused on a higher-end capability, so stereotactic radiosurgery and IMRT are up if the proposal bill is adopted and it's down for 2D and 3D conformal radiation therapy. But we like the fact that it encourages advanced treatments, and it also should encourage the replacement of older installed base. So that's good news.","I think on the overall market side, so we are seeing activity in the hospital side. There is a lot of old equipment out there. The freestanding clinics has been very quiet. I think we're getting to that period where that's starting to anniversary now, and it's going to be less of a factor moving forward. I think seeing what happens in the final proposal is critical. And if it remains as proposed, I think that'll be fairly good news on the hospital side, although there may be some movement.","And maybe just to add a point here, and that is we are seeing a fair amount of activity in the U.S. around our EDGE product and stereotactic body radiation therapy, in particular that stereotactic radiosurgery as well. And as you know, the reimbursement rates between those products and the Gamma Knife was equalized this past year. And in all the proposals, that also remains the same though up a little bit from where it was. Actually, not a little bit up, quite a bit from where it was in the July timeframe. And we're seeing a fair amount of activity in that part of our funnel.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Wittes from Brean Capital.","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","I guess, 2 questions. One if I could follow up on that. In terms of, Dow, the cascade of when you think this activity leads to actual order rates. I mean, how should we be thinking about that, especially through the course of 2014?","Dow R. Wilson","I'm going to be a little careful until I see the reimbursement proposal finalized. I think -- the good news is we're seeing a lot of activity, but I think it's -- I think people know a sequestration coming at the end of the quarter and Washington shutting down, I think there were some people that got conservative, especially as the excise tax got discussed. And I think that's kind of where we saw the impact in our short cycle revenue opportunities. So we're hoping that business will come back, but I think until the proposal comes out, I'd be a little careful on -- no, I think if the proposal stays as is, I think we'll have a -- it'll be a good year in the U.S.","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then for another follow-up. I guess my understanding is the CX linear accelerators that you sold for the Brazilian contract lists for about $1 million. So -- and the price that works out, if I do the math, is something like $650,000 per machine. Is that the right way to think about it? And are you still making a profit off those sales with that -- if those are the right assumptions?","Dow R. Wilson","I think -- let's start with -- we found out the news on Monday afternoon. We're extremely pleased. We executed our strategy very successfully. I can confirm that it's $55.5 million. The deal will be dilutive in the short term. As Elisha said, we're not sure it has that big an impact in 2014, probably a bigger impact in '15 and '16. And then of course, in the long term with the upgrade and service opportunities, as Elisha mentioned, it will be profitable. Over the course of this product development, we've got a lot of opportunity for volume-based cost reduction and sourcing savings. This is the largest single deal in the history of radiation therapy by at least a factor of 2. And so we're confident we can get some of the cost out.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Roman from Goldman Sachs.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I know that a lot of questions going through sort of the details on the moving parts in the quarter, but I was hoping you could give us a little bit of a broader perspective on what you think is happening in the U.S. market. I guess specifically what I'm asking is if I try to tie a lot of the pieces here together between changes in the business model to customer level, reimbursement pressure in freestanding clinics, consolidation among radiation oncology practices. Are the number of bunkers in the U.S. shrinking? Was there overconstruction during a period of time? And if that is a fair assessment, how do we think about the underlying growth of the, sort of, the available addressable market going forward?","Dow R. Wilson","I don't have hard data for you, but I would say with the consolidation, there has been some very small reduction in the number of bunkers out there. So we are seeing some of that go on. But I think mostly, the number of bunkers is -- and I'd say at the margin, that's very small. So I think we're seeing people just be very careful in this timeframe, especially our freestanding customers being very careful about how they invest and where they invest. And they're looking for local, regional consolidation opportunities on the freestanding side. On the hospital side of the market, we're not seeing that at all. We're seeing growth. We're seeing a lot of excitement about new applications, especially in brain and body stereotactic radiation therapy, and we're excited about that. I think the other factor is the baby boomers are retiring and moving into the demographic that needs this kind of equipment, and we're seeing good demographic over the next -- that's a longer-term thing. But I'd say on the freestanding side, David, some consolidation. On the hospital side, we're seeing investment.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up, and Elisha, I appreciate the comments on the earlier question regarding the bridge between FY '13 and FY '14, but maybe if I could just go a little bit deeper into -- when I look at the orders or net orders that you reported in FY '13 versus FY '12, they look to be down year-over-year, but you are guiding to a reasonable amount of revenue growth next year. And even when you adjust for the proton contribution, it still looks like revenue growth will meaningfully exceed order trends in fiscal '13. And then on the P&L side of the equation, you bought back a ton of stock this year and got to earnings that I think were roughly flattish year-over-year. So just wondering about how we think about the order to revenue tie, and then your flexibility to continue to repurchase shares at this rate.","Elisha W. Finney","Sure. Well, David, I mean, if I look at it, if you exclude protons on a gross basis, orders for the total company are actually up 4%. So our short cycle businesses and X-ray, Flat Panel is growing well. Our Service business is growing clearly in double digits. Oncology's backlog, even with this adjustment, is up about 2%. So we blend all of that together and we think our core businesses can grow in that 5% to 6% range. Of course, our X-ray Products business and our Service business have to continue to perform. And you're right, protons has the ability to get us a couple of points above that, assuming we can hit that $125 million or so number in proton revenue, depending on the timing. In terms of leverage, we have consistently bought back shares. We spent virtually every dollar that we generate in the U.S. on share buybacks. You should expect that we'll continue to purchase between 1 million to 2 million shares per quarter. It's very accretive, when we're borrowing at less than 1.5% pretax right now. And you'll note that we did take out a debt facility to give us some flexibility, so that we can continue on that share repurchase program and continue to return capital to shareholders.","Dow R. Wilson","Maybe just coming back a minute to the overall growth in orders. I think we hit the North America piece pretty hard on gross orders. Year-over-year, North America was down 6% in Q4 versus a very strong year ago comp, and I think we've talked through the reasons why. But I think we have to talk just for a minute about some of the other regions. In Europe, Middle East, Africa, on the quarter, we had a very good quarter. We were up 13%, up 10% in constant currency. We had strength in the Scandinavian countries, Switzerland, Africa, and we're starting to see some traction in those markets from our Siemens relationship.","In Asia, we were up 2%, 14% in constant currency. As I said in the text, China was up 30% and Japan was very strong. We had a huge Q4 last year in Korea and other parts of Southeast Asia. So the overall was a little quiet, but we were really pleased with the ongoing sustaining growth that we've had in China.","Rest of world was up 42%, 44% in constant currency. We had very strong growth in Latin America. And before this Brazil tender, we had good strong double-digit growth last year in Brazil, even outside of the tender. Now so that's kind of the roundup on the region. So again, pretty strong, very strong o- U.S. performance.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Hazan from SunTrust Bank.","Amit Hazan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question, again, on the order revision. If we kind of think about that $156 million coming out of backlog this quarter, I'm wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on the age of those orders and maybe how long they've been in backlog? I know that varies, but just a little bit of color on what we should be thinking about there in terms of how long that's been in the backlog. And maybe what you think might need to happen for any of those to potentially come back to become orders again?","Elisha W. Finney","Sure. Well, Amit, I mean this is -- I think this has been accumulative over, say, the last 3 years. I mean, at the time we booked the order, we believed the order was firm and had an estimated delivery date within the 2-year period. Some of those did age beyond that. And then with yet another reimbursement cut, as Dow has already outlined all of the reasons, we did see a higher level of cancellations. I have to say, though, I mean, in any quarter we have backlog adjustments. And so if this had been a typical quarter, we would've probably had somewhere between $30 million and $40 million of just typical backlog adjustments. So that net amount of, call it, $120 million, that's what we're talking about as this subset of our backlog that really deserved a very strong look and a reevaluation of whether or not those orders were still firm. It is possible that these orders could come back. I'm not counting on it. But again, the good news is in terms of freestanding centers in backlog today, less than 5%.","Dow R. Wilson","Half of them were cancellations, in fact, so we wouldn't expect those to come back.","Amit Hazan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on Brazil. I'm just wondering if you have any plans to increase manufacturing in Brazil to any extent with regard to this deal, whether you think there are any orders beyond the 80 for that market or whether it gets pretty saturated at that point in terms of new units, and what the implications are strategically for you in South America from winning this deal?","Dow R. Wilson","We think this is a great opportunity for us. It's interesting when you look at the Brazil market -- you've heard us talk about some of the benchmarks in terms of Linacs per million people. When you kind of look at that analysis, we think that over the next 3 years, there will be 250-ish Linacs that go into Brazil. So this is a small piece of that big market that's down there. So we're excited about that opportunity. There are requirements in the tender for local content and the tender also has the capability of going to 100 units. It's a minimum commitment of 80 and the Ministry of Health can go to 100 units within the context of this tender. But we're excited about the long-term opportunity. And as we said before, there will be service opportunity and upgrade opportunity over and above the $55.5 million over the life of these accelerators.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Feffer from Cantor Fitzgerald.","Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","I guess, first, just very quickly coming back to the U.S. on this short cycle upgrade delays you were seeing, is this something that we can expect? I mean, I know this is kind of -- you have a confluence of a lot of challenges now with the ACA coming online and sort of some residual effect of CapEx constraints. Is this something that we can expect going forward? Or do we look at this kind of as a 1- or 2-quarter blip?","Elisha W. Finney","So, Jeff, I mean, if we look back historically, every quarter we have anywhere between $40 million and $60 million of upgrade business. And this is things such as RapidArc, OBI, multileaf collimators, some of our accessories which tend to be high margin, anywhere from 60%, if it's hardware, to 80%, if it's software. And no, it just did not materialize as we expected in the quarter. However, the good news was the EDGE upgrades, which we're not yet shipping, those came in very strong in the quarter. So I think it had a little bit to do with the mix as well, and we won't be shipping the EDGE upgrades until we get into our fiscal second quarter, I believe, is the target date on that.","Dow R. Wilson","And I think the other thing I'd add is I think we might have some upside next year with RapidPlan upgrades. We introduced this at ASCO this last year, as you saw. The customer reception was outstanding, and we'll start shipping those as well this next year, and that probably have some upside on the upgrades number for us.","Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then shifting over to EDGE, and now that you see your mark and are ready to launch there, can you just give maybe a little bit more color on the opportunities and the interest you're seeing in Europe and Asia and how you expect that market to be segmented between the early TrueBeam interest there versus EDGE? How are those going to sort of work together?","Dow R. Wilson","I'll keep it pretty simple. Between Gamma Knife and CyberKnife, we think it's about 100- to 120-unit market and we really want to penetrate that market. The upgrade opportunity is significant in our own installed base and that's kind of what you've seen in the numbers from this last year. But with our first system going to Champalimaud late this year, and really kind of getting now into the production phase of this product, people being able to kick the tires and see it. We really want to drive share in that new unit market, and that's what we're targeting.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies Group.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","First one on the backlog, I'm wondering if you can maybe give us some color on were those existing customers that are simply no longer there? And if so, does that mean, in the future, we should see a write-down of receivables from things such as service contracts that were in place? And then a couple of follow-ups on Brazil and guidance.","Elisha W. Finney","Anthony, no. The answer is no. I mean the fact it's sitting in backlog and is taken out, it did not turn into revenue and therefore did not create an AR. So these were mostly small freestanding developers who were going to go out and develop these clinics. We do not have an AR risk associated with them.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Great, great. And on Brazil, wondering if you can maybe give us a little bit of an indication as to sort of the types of machines you'd be selling in there? Will they be completely new machines or refurbished machines?","Dow R. Wilson","These will all be new machines, all new digital machines.","Clinac EX is part of our Clinac series. A product that's got a terrific history and doing patients in every geography of the world.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And then last on guidance, Elisha. Maybe can you just remind where you are in terms of restructuring? I know there were some programs in place. Where those programs are, and maybe how those play into the earnings guidance for '14?","Elisha W. Finney","Well, we had a restructuring charge last year. Most of it was in our first fiscal quarter, some in our second fiscal quarter. I believe the total was $6.5 million roughly. And that was largely so that we could redistribute employees into growing markets and that's largely been done. So as we speak right now, I don't expect any other restructuring charges. We had it as a retirement program that was very positively received. But I'm not anticipating anything else at this point.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Well, in terms maybe of the benefit of those restructuring programs, in terms of restructuring the business from, say, oncology -- I know Kolleen had spoke about restructuring the oncology business quite a bit at the midyear review. And so the actual benefit of that over time from a margin standpoint, when should we see the benefit from those efforts?","Dow R. Wilson","I think as we -- the big issue for us here is redeploying the resources. So we've had restructuring in mature markets, so that we can invest in growing markets. And that's so -- it's kind of good news, bad news. Good news is we had a restructuring; bad news is we've been reinvesting it to make sure that we're positioned for growth markets as part of our strategy to be a multi-domestic company and make sure we've got a great global footprint.","Elisha W. Finney","Yes. And SG&A was down very slightly as a percentage of revenue. So we are focused on controlling those costs and putting the dollars in R&D, as we talked about.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","All very hopeful. Just maybe one last one on X-rays. The order number was quite big. Maybe can you speak about was that the catch-up order on inventory drawdowns from some of your customers from prior periods?","Elisha W. Finney","I'm sorry, we missed that question.","Dow R. Wilson","It was X-ray orders. We had a very good quarter in X-ray on the quarter. It was broad-based in both tubes and detectors. The Panel business, we had a number of our large customers ordering strongly, Carestream, Toshiba, [indiscernible] and Siemens. On the Tube side, we also had big orders from Toshiba, Hitachi and Hologic, as well as a number of new customers in the Tube business. So that business really ended the year with strong order momentum and sets us up for a good revenue year here in 2014 towards our X-ray components business.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Not to beat a dead horse on Brazil, but one of the things it does is kind of highlight the consolidation of purchasing power in this case, as you mentioned it, the largest order ever. Do you worry about the precedent being set here, in particular with the U.S.? I mean they are going to look at the potential to consolidate purchasing power and try to get larger tenders together?","Dow R. Wilson","I think a couple of things. The second largest unit order we've seen is, and I'm guessing, 20 to 25 units, so kind of a quarter of the size. We have seen some kind of 10-unit orders in the U.S. The kinds of equipment that people order in the U.S. and in Western Europe is a dramatically different configuration, totally, totally different. For example, on these accelerators in Brazil, there's no imaging. There's not a portal imager and there's not a kilovoltage imager. Long term, we think that's a nice upgrade opportunity for those systems. But virtually, every system that we sell in the U.S. and in Western Europe, for that matter, has a portal imager and a kilovoltage imager. So as we look back on the year, our pricing was stable. We were pleased with the pricing performance in the overall business as we look forward. If there's another 80-unit tender, we're going to go compete on it, as I'm sure our competitors are as well. But we think this is a pretty isolated case.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then on margins, I mean EBIT margins are down from -- have been down for a couple of years now. And despite revenue growth next year, it looks like there's still going to be some margin erosion. Can you maybe just talk about, in longer-term, how you're thinking about middle-of-the-balance-sheet leverage and your overall cost structure? Obviously, you made some changes when you first came on a year ago. But talk to how you're feeling about your cost structure today.","Dow R. Wilson","Yes, I might -- I think I'll let Elisha fix this after I'm done. But at a very high level, we have a regional shift from a high U.S. margin business to a faster-growing international business, so that's downward pressure, offset by product mix, which is favorable for us for software and services. So as we look forward, we're doing everything we can to have those offset each other. At the same time, Kolleen and her team are driving very hard the variable cost productivity piece of the equation. We've had very good progress this last year. I think you've seen some of the numbers in installations and warranties. That's been terrific on TrueBeam. In the second half of the year it had very nice traction. And so I think we've got some nice very soft productivity activities going on throughout the business. So the game is can we have those offset each other going forward?","Elisha W. Finney","Yes. And, Tycho, let me just clarify that next year, the Oncology margin is actually -- it's going up a little bit. And it was even year-over-year this year of course for the fourth quarter and the year. X-ray and oncology will be in that range that we talked about. The entire impact of that 50 basis point year-over-year has to do with the additional proton revenue at a much, much lower margin and an extra quarter of excise tax.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And if I could squeeze just one quick one in at the end. On Siemens, there's a lot of excitement when you took over a year ago, Dow, on that JV. I mean can you just talk to how it's tracked? We don't hear as much about it lately. Just wondering if it's lived up to your expectations.","Dow R. Wilson","I think it took us longer, quite frankly, than we thought to get it going. So we'll admit that. But we had some very nice deals in Q4 happen. We're pleased about that. The sales funnel is growing. I think one of the things that we are hearing as a big positive from customers is that they now have a choice. These are customers who did not have a choice before. It was kind of Elekta or LANTIS and nothing else. ASTRO, to 100% of the Siemens installed base. So we're starting to see some good movement. You heard me mention earlier that we saw some activity in Europe just last quarter. And so we're -- I'd say, I think it's fair to say that it took us a little longer to get this going than we thought it would when we first got in, but we're starting to see some nice activity, I think, on both sides.","Operator","At this time, I'd like to turn the call back to our speakers for closing comments.","Spencer R.

We look forward to your participation.","And now, here is Dow.","Dow R. Wilson","Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone. I want to take a quick moment to congratulate Tim Girton on his retirement. And now, I'm handling over the company in such great shape, despite tough circumstances and a challenging global economy. We finished fiscal year '12 on a strong note with growth in our major businesses and a record -- good progress on our -- in our proton and security businesses and a record backlog that positions us for continued leadership.","To summarize our results, earnings per diluted share increased 14% for the quarter to $1.08 and 9% for the year to $3.76. Revenues rose 5% for the quarter to $756 million and 8% for the year to $2.8 billion. Excluding protons, revenues were up 9% for the quarter and 8% for the year. Orders rose in double digits in our major businesses for the quarter. Our quarter-ending backlog rose 12% to $2.8 billion. Cash flow from operations was a record $191 million for the fourth quarter and $493 million for the year, exceeding net earnings for both periods. We closed the quarter with $705 million in cash and cash equivalents and $161 million of debt after spending $85 million to repurchase and retire 1.4 million shares of stock.","Turning to the operational highlights. Oncology Systems' fourth quarter net orders rose 10% to $789 million, up 10% in both international and North American markets. Oncology's net orders for the year increased 7% to $2.4 billion with 5% growth in North America and 8% growth in international markets. International markets generated 55% of annual net orders for the business. The solid North American performance during the quarter was highlighted by multi-Linac orders and software purchases at numerous centers that are modernizing their treatment capabilities. To give you a few examples, we signed a major long-term equipment and service contract with the Cleveland Clinic. Multi-Linac orders were placed by institutions, including Indiana University, Centura and Exempla in Colorado and the University of Nebraska, which is replacing 2 Siemens units. There were multiple TrueBeam orders, including our first order at University of Wisconsin. Conversions from competitors' treatment planning and information management software also contributed to strong growth in North America. I will touch more on that in a few moments.","Net orders for the quarter were up 22% in Asia with healthy gains in both Japan and China. Several centers in China ordered the TrueBeam platform, some together with our integrated suite of Eclipse Treatment Planning and ARIA information management software.","In Japan, we received orders from several centers in the national hospital system, including one order stemming from our new strategic partnership with Siemens. In EMEA, net orders increased 12% or 20% on a constant currency basis with key wins in several countries. In Turkey, we received an order to equip 6 centers with a total of 2 TrueBeam and 4 Trilogy systems, as well as our integrated software suite. The Curie Institut in France placed an order for 3 TrueBeams, together with our Eclipse and ARIA software. Newcastle, a former Siemens center in the U.K., ordered 2 TrueBeams as well as the software to go with them.","Net orders in the Rest of the World region were down 26% versus the year-ago period when we had exceptionally strong growth in Australia. The order decline in Australia offset growth in Latin American -- in Latin America where we sold linear accelerators in 11 countries during the quarter versus 8 countries in the prior-year period.","We had key wins during the quarter in Brazil, Peru and Panama. As you know, Brazil is conducting a public tender for the purchase of 80 units, and Varian is aggressively competing for this business. To update you on the status of the tender, there have been some delays while the Ministry of Health sorts out the planned placements of the units it will be ordering. At this point, we are expecting to go through a reverse auction bidding process sometime in November or December.","As you have probably noticed, our TrueBeam platform for radiotherapy and radiosurgery has continued to be a major driver for our growth in markets around the globe. As of the end of the quarter, we had booked more than 645 TrueBeam orders since its introduction in 2010, and we had some 330 installations complete or in progress. This premium product now represents about 50% of our worldwide, high-energy machine orders.","Oncology's worldwide service organization once again delivered double-digit growth in orders and revenues during the quarter. It ended the year with a total of $749 million in orders and represented more than 30% of total net orders for Oncology on the year. Growth in this business is being driven by more sophisticated systems, such as TrueBeam coming out of warranty, higher contract capture rates, higher average pricing and more software service agreements as well as the growing install base in international markets.","I'm pleased to report that Varian's customer support services organization has been rated #1 among linear accelerator manufacturers in 6 out of 9 key performance attributes, including Net Promoter Score, overall manufacturing performance and probability of repurchase. The rankings were recently announced by IMV, an independent healthcare market research firm that analyzes service trends in the imaging industry. It's gratifying to have this affirmation of our quality and field efforts.","We also had 2 significant votes of confidence in our software during the quarter with contracts from Memorial Sloan-Kettering and the University of Michigan for a -- for our Eclipse Treatment Planning system. These leading institutions have written and used their own treatment planning software for decades because they couldn't get what they needed from a commercial product. This is a big milestone for us as a software company. In addition to these sites, there were more than 10 conversions in the quarter from competitors' software to either Eclipse and\/or ARIA.","We're very excited about our exhibit at ASTRO this next week in Boston, where we scheduled a special event in our booth at 2:07 p.m. on Sunday afternoon, when we're going to unveil our next move against cancer. I can't say more about it today, but I'm looking forward to discussing this and other exhibit features with you during our investor meeting at the show. See you, I hope, at 2:07 p.m. on Sunday afternoon. We will also have a strong joint presence in our booth with Siemens. And we're very pleased with the way our new strategic partnership is progressing. It is going live in North America this month. We will be launching an exciting new marketing campaign at the show. The partnership is on target with our plans to establish ARIA connectivity to the Siemens installed base, and our teams have already succeeded in making some joint sales of imaging and therapy products to customers in international markets.","Let me give you a quick update on reimbursements in the U.S. We believe that CMS will provide some relief from its original proposed reimbursement cuts for freestanding facilities. Together with our partners in freestanding clinics, we have provided additional data, including actual equipment and facility cost that should enable CMS to recalculate and revise its proposed rates for freestanding clinics. There has been significant congressional support for a revision to the CMS proposal with the 1\/3 of the Senate and more than 100 House members signing a letter to CMS opposing the cuts. However, we will not have certainty around the final numbers until early November. We're also hopeful that proton reimbursement could be restored in the final rule.","Finally, we were pleased to see the adoption of a new code for thoracic radiosurgery beginning this January. This should help to expand the use of radiosurgery for lung cancer and it coincides with our focus on providing clinicians with more advanced tools to treat lung cancer.","Let me now turn to X-ray Products. This business had a terrific quarter and finished the year on an especially strong note with the help of new products that spurred top line growth as well as productivity initiatives that led to substantial improvements in operating margins. Net orders for this business grew by 15% during the quarter to $145 million. For the full fiscal year, net orders rose by 5% to $506 million. Higher demand for our panels was driven by radiographic equipment makers in China and dental imaging equipment manufacturers in Europe. The quarter was also helped by initial sales of new products, which included a leading edge 43x43-centimeter cone-beam dynamic panel as well as new radiographic panel offerings. We also saw sales of panel workstation combination package during the quarter as a result of our InfiMed acquisition last year. More of these packages will be rolled out as engineering work is completed throughout this current year -- fiscal year. As the panel business continues to expand and trends in digital imaging create new tube opportunities, we continue to see the potential for a billion dollar business in X-ray Products.","Switching now to net orders in our Other category, including our Security and Proton businesses. We had a tough comparison with the year-ago quarter, which included an $88 million order to equip the Scripps Proton Therapy Center in San Diego. Net orders for the Other category were $30 million for the quarter versus $124 million in the year-ago quarter. For the full fiscal year, Other category net orders rose 7% to $216 million, including 2 proton orders totaling over $120 million.","Highlights in the Proton business during the quarter included a new $83 million contract for a multi-room center to be operated by Emory Healthcare. We plan to book this contract as an order when the project is financed. As a reminder, we have 3 booked orders for proton equipment at Scripps in San Diego; in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; and in St. Petersburg, Russia. We also have a contract to equip a center at the University of Maryland, and we plan to book this order when financing for the project is completed.","Now, here is Elisha.","Elisha W. Finney","Thanks, Dow, and hello, everyone. While Dow has already covered net orders, I want to briefly talk about the constant currency growth rates for the quarter, which continued to be negatively impacted by the comparatively stronger U.S. dollar against the euro.","Oncology Systems, which is most heavily impacted by currency movement, grew net orders in the quarter by 10% in dollars or 12% in constant currency. Oncology's European net orders growth rate was up 12% in dollar and up 20% in constant currency, while Asia and the Rest of the World was little impacted by foreign exchange in the quarter.","Total international Oncology growth was 10% in dollars and 14% in constant currency. Fourth quarter revenues for the company increased 5% to $756 million with constant currency growth of 8%. Oncology Systems posted a 7% increase in revenues, and X-ray Products posted a gain of 9%. Total revenues from businesses and the Other category was down significantly as strong revenue growth in our SIP business was more than offset by a steep decline in proton revenues from the year-ago quarter when we booked more than $30 million of the Scripps project revenue.","For the full year, total company revenues were up 8% in dollars and 9% in constant currency. The fourth quarter gross margin for the company increased by 1 point to 42.8%. As we expected, Oncology's gross margin decreased by almost 1.5 points to 43.5% due primarily to the continued shift to international markets and the comparatively stronger U.S. dollar versus the euro.","X-ray Products' gross margin rose more than 2 points from the year-ago quarter to 43.3% due to a higher mix of panel products and improved quality cost for both tube and panels. For the first time, panels represented more than 50% of total revenues in the X-ray business. The company's quarter-over-quarter improvement in gross margin was helped by substantially lower proton revenues, which you will recall are booked at 0 profit. For the full fiscal year, the company's gross margin declined about 1 point to 42.6% due largely to a shift to international deliveries in our Oncology business and the stronger U.S. dollar.","While I'm on the topic of gross margin, I want to confirm that the future impact of the medical device excise tax will be reflected in the company's gross margin beginning in January of 2013. We will highlight the effect of the tax each quarter.","Fourth quarter SG&A expenses were $110 million or 14% of revenues, up 1 point as a percentage of revenues from the year-ago quarter. Fourth quarter R&D expenses were $46 million or 6% of revenues even as a percentage of revenue with the year-ago quarter. For the full fiscal year, total operating expenses increased about 40 basis points to 21% of revenues.","Moving down the income statement, fourth quarter operating earnings were $168 million or 22% of revenues. For the fiscal year, operating earnings were $594 million or 21% of revenues, down 1.5 points from the prior year as a percentage of revenues. Depreciation and amortization totaled $18 million for the quarter and $61 million for the year, and CapEx for the year was equal to depreciation and amortization also at $61 million. The effective tax rate was 28.7% from the quarter, down 2 points from the year-ago quarter due largely to the geographic mix of earnings.","For the fiscal year, the effective tax rate was 28.3%, also down a little more than 2 points from the prior year. Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased significantly from the year-ago quarter to 112 million due largely to our ongoing share repurchases. Diluted earnings per share was 14% to $1.08 for the quarter and rose 9% to $3.76 for the year.","Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalent of $705 million, debt of $161 million and stockholders' equity of $1.5 billion. DSO of 85 days, was up 5 days from the year-ago quarter. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $191 million. The primary usage of cash or $85 million to repurchase 1.4 million shares, $21 million for CapEx and $14 million to pay down short-term debt. For the full fiscal year, cash flow from operations was a record $493 million, more than net earnings for the year. We now have an 8 million share repurchase authorization that will be in effect through calendar year 2013.","Now, I'll turn it back over to Dow for the outlook.","Dow R. Wilson","Thanks, Elisha. Our company is positioned for growth by focusing on continuous innovation, expanding our global presence, building our software and services franchises and commercializing protons. We're also enhancing our operational performance through productivity initiatives in all parts of the company. As part of this effort, we will be taking a restructuring charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013.","For the fiscal year 2013, we believe that revenues could increase by 8% to 9% over fiscal -- over the fiscal 2012's total. Including an estimated $0.06 to $0.08 effect from the pending medical device excise tax, fiscal year 2013 net earnings per diluted share should be in the range of $4.06 to $4.16. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2013, total company revenues could increase by about 8% to 9% over the prior-year quarter. Net earnings per diluted share, including the planned restructuring charge of $0.02 to $0.03, should be in the range of $0.83 to $0.88.","We're now ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeremy Feffer with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","First, I wanted to ask about -- I just want to make sure I'm clear on reimbursement. I recognized your comments. I know we'll probably get the final rule in the next week or so. But just so I understand, assuming there's no change, assuming things stayed the way they were proposed, given your waiting of hospital to freestanding, how do you look at the net-net impact of those proposed rules, and how are there reflected in guidance?","Dow R. Wilson","First of all, that freestanding market is only about 10% of our global orders now, probably about 20% of U.S. Not too many years ago, that number was more like 30%. So we've already seen that market change quite significantly. I would say that, in the fourth quarter, that market was sort of quiet, and you saw our first quarter performance was pretty good. So we did see good hospital market growth in U.S. in the fourth quarter. If the regulation is not changed, if -- I'm sorry, if the reimbursement is not changed and left at the proposed rate, I think it's safe to say that it will be pretty dramatic impact on that market.","Elisha W. Finney","Jeremy, I would just add -- to answer the second part of your question, we are a backlog-driven company. And so fortunately, most of the revenue that we have in the guidance for FY '13 are machines that are already sitting in backlog plus our service organization.","Dow R. Wilson","There was a -- there also was a -- the Marwood Group published a report earlier this month, suggesting that they expected maybe a 10% cut instead of the 40% proposed cut. As I mentioned during the call, Congress and Senate have been very supportive of providers and the industry, and I think we're pretty encouraged by these new thoracic code. We think that, that's going to be a very important deal in helping open up radiation -- radiosurgery to the lung cancer clinic. So that will be nice for us.","Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then, I just wanted to switch over to X-ray. Obviously, a nice rebound from the last couple of quarters. I know you're citing some of these new products to drive that order growth. Do you see this as sustainable? Or these more -- some one-time things? Or is this a more sustainable run rate that we should be thinking about going forward?","Dow R. Wilson","Frankly, the radiology market has been flattish. So the market has nothing to write home about. But the -- our game in this business, though, is growing our served market, and that business has done just a terrific job at introducing new products and signing up new customers. We had several new product launches last year. By the time you get a customer signed up and get it designed into the product and rolling out, it takes a while. We're starting to see that impact and we have a whole bunch of new products we're introducing again this year. So we're very encouraged. We've got a new replacement tube for CT scanning. Our tubes are optimized for the new digital panels. That could drive a new replacement cycle in the tubes business. We've got a new wireless panel. Anyway, a whole bunch of new products coming out of the X-ray business. So I think we got a game here for the next little while. They're doing well, and that game is going to continue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Palmer with CLSA.","Jonathan J. Palmer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Dow, I was hoping if you could maybe just dive a little deeper in the 10% U.S. order growth. How much of that is coming from the freestanding clinic market?","Dow R. Wilson","That's a very small -- that's, I'd say, very small.","Jonathan J. Palmer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then, when do you expect that to pick up after we get the ruling here?","Dow R. Wilson","Oh, I'll tell you after that I hear about the reimbursement decision. So I think that market has been quiet, frankly, all year, but especially the second half of this past year, it's been very quiet. And if reimbursement remains flattish, I think we'd see it pick up a little bit. There has been -- we are seeing the hospital market -- just kind of stepping back from a market standpoint, we are seeing the hospital markets being more aggressive in really trying to go after the business that they've lost over the last few years.","Jonathan J. Palmer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then, for Elisha, how should we think about the margin progression throughout the year? I mean, looking at the order growth in international, should we assume some continued pressure on gross margins?","Elisha W. Finney","Well, if you look at the guidance for FY '13, the sale is up 8% to 9%. And I do want to mention that, that includes some significant proton revenue. So 80%, 90% -- $80 million to $90 million in proton revenue in the fiscal year. So if one of those deals were to fall out, we would be on the low end of that range; if it all materializes, towards the higher end of that range. But the gross margin for the total company, if you exclude the excise tax next year, is about flat at 42%. So despite higher proton revenues and this continued shift to the international deliveries, we're going to still be able to maintain margin roughly flat with the FY '12. Again, that excise tax does take the margin down by about 0.5 point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dalton Chandler with Needham & Company.","Dalton L. Chandler - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","I just want to follow up, Dow, on your comments about seeing these multi-unit orders. I know there's -- to some extent, there's always an upgrade cycle going on. But you're sort of implying that maybe you're seeing an acceleration in that. Is that the case? And if so, why do you think it's happening right now?","Dow R. Wilson","I'd say we always have a few. We did have maybe more this quarter than we usually see. I don't know if that's a trend yet that I could say, Dalton. A, we always have more orders in the fourth quarter anyway, so it ends up being what? 28% of the year-ish. And I don't know that, that there's a market trend that we could point to at this point other than let's hope it keeps going.","Dalton L. Chandler - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. And then, just on your $0.06 to $0.08 impact guidance from the excise tax, I'm having a hard time getting to a number that low, could you just walk us through how you get there?","Elisha W. Finney","Sure. Well, it's 2.3% tax on FDA-listed devices that excludes service. You can deduct installation. So there's a few things that you can deduct. You can also deduct freight. So a very, very high level of math, Dalton. If you take Oncology sales in the U.S., U.S. only with no service, call it roughly $750 million, you take out 7% for installation, freight, that gets you close to $55 million. You tax effect that at 2.3%, and it gets you right at about $4 million a quarter, $3.5 million to $4 million per quarter. The $10 million to $12 million for this year, again is only 3 quarters are covered in FY '13.","Dalton L. Chandler - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So the -- like the X-ray tubes that you sell to OEMs, you don't pay tax on that?","Elisha W. Finney","Very little in panels because they are sold for further manufacture because they are components. They are not included in this. And then, I should also mention, on protons, while the dollars are high, it's also very a high installation cost that we get to deduct and we contractually pass the tax onto our customers in our contracts for protons.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla with Citi.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wanted to just, Dow, dig a little bit deeper into the U.S. Oncology performance and see if you could just piece out a little bit about the Siemens' contribution as well as the multi-unit orders that were kind of above and beyond what you'd normally see. So maybe you could just help us, Dow -- and maybe what percentage of the U.S. orders this time around were different than the past, and how sustainable that would be?","Dow R. Wilson","As I said, I think that's an event. I think it's, kind of, in a normal range. We always have, I'd say, significant multi-unit orders. So that's not a change. We maybe saw a little bit more this last quarter than usual, but I don't think it's anything abnormal from what we've normally had. The U.S. market as well as the Siemens, we are seeing some Siemens install base trade out. We have not really been able to launch our Siemens partnership in the U.S. Our GE partnership expires right before ASTRO, this week, in fact. And so, we'll really be launching that -- yes, it expires at 26th of October, so we'll really be taking off our Siemens\/Varian relationship in the U.S. at ASTRO. Outside of the U.S., I think the Siemens partnership has helped us out a little bit, and we've also helped them out a little bit. So I think that we -- I did point to a couple of customers in the U.S. that were Siemens units, but that was largely without their help at this point.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Is it sustainability, Dow, on what you're seeing right now in the U.S.?","Dow R. Wilson","Well, it's -- we are -- we love what we saw. I think, at this point, it's too early to decide is this a trend or an event, but we're -- the funnel looks pretty good and the freestanding market is still very quiet yet, but we were certainly very pleased on the quarter.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just -- if I could sneak a quick one in for Elisha, in the guidance, if you look at the low end of your earnings range at the 8%, that component, you're getting very little leverage. So can you just talk about the leverage components? I know you gave gross margin already, but talk about expenses and tax, how you're thinking about those in the low end of your guidance versus the high?","Elisha W. Finney","Sure. Yes. So again, gross margin, flat at about 42% for the full-year, ROS also about 21% for the full-year. We do have the restructuring charge that Dow mentioned, the excise tax, obviously, goes into that as well. Tax rate of 28% to 29% helped by the share repurchase program that we've done to get to that range. We also put a range on there, a fairly broad range, because of just the unprecedented euro fluctuation that we saw in the last year. So we've run this at $1.20 to $1.30 and everywhere in between and we just have to be -- at this -- I think we have to be prudent this early in the fiscal year to assume that the euro won't necessarily stay right at the $1.30 it is right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I want to kind of follow up on a question a minute ago and just kind of the strength in U.S. market. Obviously, it's a lot better than people were expecting. Can you just talk to where you saw -- you were most surprised relative to your own expectations? And how much of what you're seeing, you think, is a function of share shift versus other factors?","Dow R. Wilson","I'd say, I think our share was up. We haven't seen everybody's results, but I'd say we probably got a couple of points market shares in the fourth quarter. We usually don't get too excited about quarterly movements, and we're not always sure how much we should celebrate even movements in orders. When you look at a year back on a sales basis, we do see our share growing on a revenue basis. And as we like things that we can put in our wallet; that tends to be the way we can measure it. In terms of the market conditions and what surprised us, we were obviously pleased at the results in the Q4 U.S. performance. We do have a new sales team. I think that was part of it. We've got a very energized sales team, and we're very pleased with how that is going. The -- maybe there are some external factors. Again, I'd rather wait a quarter or 2 before commenting on that. We've talked a little bit about the big IT spends that has been happening in healthcare, maybe a lot of capital dollars have been allocated in that direction, might we see some come back to revenue-generating capital investment, we're obviously hopeful. But I certainly haven't seen any data yet to suggest that, that's the case. We are seeing our treatment planning and information system products are getting very good traction. We've had new releases of both of those products, and people are excited about that. We'll cover that some more in Boston at the Investor Event, but that's exciting. Anyway, it was really kind of broad-based with the exception of the freestanding market. So that was encouraging.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then since this is your first call in the CEO role, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about your priorities and maybe some of the initiatives we should think about you -- you're taking in, in your first year? And I know you obviously mentioned the restructuring charge as well, can you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about the cost structure?","Dow R. Wilson","Sure. I'd say -- first of all, we're going to be who we've always been and that is we're an innovation-driven company. And it's new products that drive our growth to being more than a $1.5 billion of growth. RapidArc's $600 million of growth. The terrific job that Bob Kluge and his team have done in X-Ray Products with flat panel. Just a number of stories like that. We're an organic-driven growth company. That's who we've always been. That's who we're going to be. So our R&D investment is very important that we get juice out of that investment. We think we have something very exciting to show you in Boston on Sunday. So come see what some of that investment is buying us. Going down the list, I think in terms of things that will be changing a little bit, clearly, emerging markets are very important for us, both in terms of distribution and service investment as well as having the right product at the right price points. So that's going to be continuing and an important theme for us. Our software and services businesses are both great platforms. We want to -- they've been growing well. We want to keep growing them. Our service business is now almost 1\/3 of the company, $750 million of orders, I think, I mentioned on the call, still growing at double-digit rate. Our software business -- now, some of that is double counted in our service business, but our software business overall is a $500 million business. I think we've got continued big opportunity there. We were -- it was a small thing we said in the script, but really one of the most important things for us in the quarter was the wins that University of Michigan and Memorial Sloan-Kettering for our treatment planning product just really demonstrates the great strength of our software products and their ability to do what customers want them to do in the most demanding of environments. We also won in the oncology information system space, a conversion at the Mayo Clinic. So again, a huge endorsement of our software business. So I think -- anyway, software and services is going to be a big initiative.","Protons is -- we've got some big milestones next year. So we want to get San Diego, first patient done next year. That's probably our single biggest proof statement for our ability in protons next year. So watch this space about next summer time. And then, on the productivity side, it's -- and I think we've got a little wake-up call 6 months ago with the markets changing and shifting and the shift to international markets. We clearly want to drive gross margin, so we've got a number of initiatives. We talked -- we have talked on this call in the past about TrueBeam. We are seeing the traction on TrueBeam that we would like to see. So that's good, and we're now extending those efforts to the rest of our product line. The restructuring is really pretty small. We're offering an enhanced retirement package and we're really kind of looking at how do we redeploy some of our resources to those markets. That's the game for us as we go forward. It's really do we have the right resources in the right place given where our growth is, especially in the emerging markets.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. I just have one quick one for Elisha, and then I'll hop off. You have a lot of your cash offshore. Can you just talk about your ability to fund repurchases given [indiscernible] cash?","Elisha W. Finney","Yes. I would say 90 -- 98% of our cash is offshore and as we continue to grow more internationally, I don't see that really changing any time soon. But given the very strong cash flow that we have in an extremely conservative balance sheet and an almost 0 interest rate environment right now, both on the borrowing and on the investment side, you should assume that we will continue to deploy a significant part of our cash flow into share repurchase. We have an 8 million share authorization that will carry us through calendar year 2013, and we will not be afraid to take on a prudent level of debt in order to execute under that authorization.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to pick up on a topic that Tim had brought up earlier this year. And I believe, over the last 3 calls, had chosen to proactively address -- and it's product pricing. I didn't hear about it on this call. Is that a signal that your product pricing is less of an issue than it was before? I think the skeptic would say that when we had to a big-order quarter, there could be a pricing dynamic there. Could you help us understand how things are evolving?","Dow R. Wilson","Good question. I'd say -- first of all, I don't think in the quarter, pricing was any more intense than it's been in the past. So I don't think that was a lever that we used to drive share in the quarter at all. In fact, I would say that our order pricing is stabilizing. We have repositioned some of our products. This goes back. It wasn't something we did in the quarter, but we did some repositioning 6 to 9 months ago with some tweaks over the last quarter to -- of our product line to make sure we were achieving the margin targets that we needed in markets. So I -- we're actually hopeful that, that helps us go in the -- in a positive direction. I'd say competition has still been tough. We've got to be disciplined about the way we price. We focus on capability, reliability, throughput. We do a lot of training of our sales force. We're as committed as any organization to sales training as anybody out there. We want to really make sure we've got people who can sell the value at each price point. And as we've said a little bit in the past, we also want to be careful about how we offer price and terms. In this environment, everybody wants terms and that's okay, and clearly we've got the balance sheet to do that but we don't want to be in that position where we're offering terms and price. So Elisha and her team have a good process. The sales team and Kolleen Kennedy, who runs the Oncology business, have a good escalation system, so that we're monitoring this as we go. So I think -- you know what? It's a good question. We're looking at it. I would say as the take away, stable.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","All right. And another topic that I'm sure you're really enjoying talking about as CEO is reimbursement. I want to ask a question in a different way. Are we all making this out to be a bigger risk, financially, in terms of the order patterns for the company than it really is? Let me say it in another way. If the rule, let's say, comes in with some sort of moderation as you suggest, say it's minus 12 so that's minus 20 over a 2-year span, what does that really mean for orders over the balance of the year? Are we too concerned about it?","Dow R. Wilson","I'll start with I haven't done the regression, so I couldn't tell you what the r squared is on this, but when you stand back and look at the overall picture, there is some good news. The good news is hospital reimbursement is up 2%. So in a 0 inflation environment, they get a price increase. Two, we've got this thoracic code coming with the single most exciting thing that's happening in our business is radiosurgery to treat lung cancer. Not so driver for everybody. And now what happens in the freestanding market, as I said, it's 10% of our global orders. It's just not that important anymore. So I'd say in the short-term, yes, I think it probably is a little bit overplayed.","Operator","And your next question comes from David Roman with Goldman Sachs.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was hoping -- i know we didn't [ph] pick up on things Tim said in the past. I know we obviously have you now as the CEO, but one thing that was sort of a topic of discussion over the past year or so was M&A. But in a response to an earlier question, you made it pretty clear that organic growth was going to really be the crust of the growth profile going forward. If you could maybe talk about your latest thoughts on acquisitions and how that fits into your business, particularly in the context of the solid numbers that you've just put up?","Dow R. Wilson","We'd love to do more quarters like the last one. That's kind of where we are, and we've got a new product coming out at ASTRO. We've always been an organic growth company. We've got lots of opportunities. Our big challenge in allocating our R&D investment is not looking for the next opportunity. It's really which ones are we going to fund and not fund. That's our biggest challenge going forward. So I'd say we're always looking. If there's a good acquisition that comes in, we'll take a look at it. But it's going to be product, technology and probably small and accretive quickly. That's what we want to look at. So I -- Tim is smarter than I am, so I'm not going to talk too much on this one. But the -- I'm -- we're going to be conservative on this.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.","Spencer R. Sias","Okay. We want to thank you very much.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Spencer Sias, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications for Varian Medical Systems. Thank you, Mr. Sias. You may now begin.","Spencer Sias","Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Varian Medical Systems\u2019 conference call for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. With me are Dow Wilson, President and CEO; Elisha Finney, CFO, and Clarence Verhoef, our Corporate Controller. Dow and Elisha will summarize our results, and we will take your questions following the presentation.","To simplify our discussion, unless otherwise stated all references to the quarter or year are fiscal quarters and fiscal years. Quarterly comparisons are for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 versus the first quarter of fiscal year 2015, references to financial results for orders are to gross orders unless otherwise indicated.","This discussion includes non-GAAP financial measures in order to provide quarter-over-quarter comparisons of operational performance excluding unusual items. A reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure is included in our earnings release which can be accessed on our website. Please be advised that this discussion contains forward-looking statements.

While we believe them to be reasonable based on information currently available to us, these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.","Some of the important risks relating to our business are described in our first quarter earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements in this presentation and discussion, because of new information, future events, or otherwise.","And now, here is Dow.","Dow Wilson","Good afternoon and welcome. Varian is reporting revenues and earnings above our expectations for the first quarter of fiscal 2016, while managing through some challenging conditions in our markets and we\u2019re raising our earnings guidance for the year.","In summary, we are reporting non-GAAP net earnings of $0.99 per diluted share and $0.91 per diluted share on a GAAP basis. Revenues of $757 million, up 3% in dollars and 7% in constant currency. Soft orders in our Oncology Systems business, we expect the declines in Imaging Components orders and revenues and good news on the tax fronts with a permanent R&D tax credit and the suspension of the medical device excise tax.","Focusing on operational highlights in our oncology business, gross orders totaled $533 million for the quarter, down 5% in dollars, and down 1% in constant currency. Gross orders in the Americas for the quarter increased by 3% in both dollars and constant currency with the fastest growth in Latin America. Gross orders in North America rose by 2% in dollars and constant currency.","In EMEA, gross orders declined by 14% in dollars and 5% in constant currency. Gross orders in APAC declined by 12% in dollars and 7% in constant currency with continued market contraction in Japan and a modest decline in China.","Global markets have been weakened by ongoing political unrest, weak oil prices, and economic uncertainty. In EMEA, for example, Russia announced further delays in its cancer plan, Germany scaled back investments, and the Middle East was negatively impacted by political unrest and falling oil prices.","On a positive note in EMEA, we received an order from the UK\u2019s National Health Service for our further 10 TrueBeam systems during the quarter. The National Health System has now ordered more than 50 TrueBeams in the last few years for its cancer programs. Economic uncertainty was also a prime cause of weakness in Japan, which led to an overall orders decline in APAC.","In China, gross orders declined slightly. As of the end of the first quarter, we continue to see hospitals in China aiming to invest in advanced radiotherapy and radio surgery systems for their cancer patients. We booked several orders for EDGE radiosurgery systems in China during the quarter.","In the Americas, the multi-million dollar Siemens replacement project in Argentina and a key Ministry of Health in Chile drove the growth in Latin America, while North America continued to move forward with investments, and our new product platforms to replace aging systems.","We\u2019re focused on global market development through our Access to Care Initiative. And educational program that\u2019s fixed the bridge the gap between the growing need for a modern radiotherapy treatment machines in developing countries and a lack of trained personnel to operate them. This program is already working in Africa and Vietnam, and we took steps during the quarter to initiate this program in India through an educational partnership with Apollo Hospitals Group. This program will train radiation technologist in India.","We made good progress with our software business during the quarter. Licenses for RapidPlan, our tool for enhancing efficiency and quality in treatment planning has tripled since the end of the fiscal year and are now installed at over 50 sites. Clinical networks, including a healthcare system in Victoria Australia that took for licenses during a quarter are rebuilding treatment capabilities around RapidPlan.","Turning to our Oncology Service business, orders were up 1% in dollars, but up 6% in constant currency compared with a strong year-ago quarter.","Let me turn now to Imaging Components, where orders shrink by 22% to a $127 million for the quarter, and revenues fell by 150% to a $141 million. Again, in the second-half of last fiscal year, this business has been confronted with currency-related pricing pressures, weak market conditions for security and infection products, and enforcing at a major panel customer. These challenges together with excess tube inventory at a key customer contributed to the declines in this business during the quarter.","Volumes for tubes were down in the quarter, while demand for our higher margin dynamics fluoroscopic panels increased and led to a sequential improvement in the gross margin for Imaging Components. Our recent acquisitions MeVis and Claymount gained momentum in the quarter and are performing well. As a remainder, we\u2019re aiming for about $50 million in revenue from these newly acquired businesses this fiscal year.","Moving to protons, we make good progress with installations. During the quarter, we turned over the first room of the Maryland Proton Therapy Center for a clinical commissioning and first treatments are slated to begin next month.","We have successfully extracted beam from the Cyclotron at Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital, where patient treatments are scheduled to begin before the end of the year. Installation is also underway at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland, and we are scheduled to begin installations at sites in Holland, Russia, and Saudi Arabia later this year. Proton order activity was quite in the quarter, but our prospects for booking several more systems this year continue to look good.","Before I hand it over to Elisha, I would like to say how proud I\u2019m that Varian has been honored for its commitment to sustainability by being included for the second year in a row on the Corporate Knights Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations list, which compares to sustainability performance of some 4,600 companies globally. This was announced last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Elisha.","Elisha Finney","Thanks, Dow, and hello, everyone. Dow has already covered gross orders, so let me start with backlog. We ended the quarter at $3.3 billion, up 7% from the year-ago period. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled $55 million, bringing net orders for the company to $617 million.","Now, let me walk you through the P&L. First quarter revenues for the total company increased 3% in dollars and 7% in constant currency. Oncology posted a 5% gain in revenues during the quarter with a 9% gain in constant currency. So with a significant geographic mix shift towards international revenues, which grew 21% in dollars and 31% in constant currency versus a year ago quarter, while North American revenues declined by about 10%. International business constituted 55% total oncology revenues in the quarter.","Imaging Components posted a first quarter revenue decline of 15% with decreases in tubes, panels and security, and inspection products. Our Particle Therapy business posted revenues of $27 million, up $18 million from the year ago quarter, as we continue to make progress on projects and backlog.","The total company gross margin for this quarter was 41.1%, down as expected by a little more than 3 points. Oncology Systems gross margin also fell by about 3 points to 42.4% due to geographic and product mix shift, as well as minor currency effects. Imaging Components gross margin for the quarter fell by about 1.5 points to 30.7%, due largely to lower pricing and volumes.","First quarter SG&A expenses were $124 million, or 16% of revenues, an improvement of about one point as a percentage of revenues with the year ago quarter. First quarter R&D expenses were $60 million, or 8% of revenues equals to the year ago quarter as a percentage of revenue.","First quarter operating earnings totaled $128 million, or 17% of revenues, down about 2 points as a percentage of revenue from the year ago quarter and in line with our expectations for the quarter.","Depreciation and amortization totaled $19 million for the quarter. The effective tax rate was 24.8%, down almost 4 points in the year ago quarter, due largely to the geographic mix of profits and the R&D tax credit that was reinstated in late December. We now expect that the tax rate will be about 26 to 27% for the year.","Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased almost $4 million from the year ago quarter to $97.8 million, due to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted EPS was $0.99 for the quarter.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $953 million, debt of $728 million, and stockholders\u2019 equity of $1.6 billion. DSO at 99 days was up significantly from the year ago quarter, due to a lower mix of Imaging Components business, a higher mix of proton business, and the timing of collections and oncology.","First quarter cash flow from operations fell slightly from the year ago period to $77 million. Primary uses of cash for $27 million for CapEx and a $192 million for the repurchase of 2.4 million shares of stock.","At the end of the quarter, we had 7 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar 2016.","Now, back to Dow for the outlook.","Dow Wilson","Thanks, Elisha. Including the effects of the R&D tax credit re-enactments and the suspension of the medical device excise tax in the U.S., we now believe that for fiscal year 2016 total company non-GAAP earnings will be in the range of $4.55 to $4.65 per diluted share. We continue to expect that revenues for fiscal year 2016 will increase by about 4 to 5% over fiscal year 2015.","For the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, we expect revenues to be up 1 to 2% from the year ago quarter in dollars. We expect non-GAAP earnings for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 to be in the range of $1.06 to $1.10 per diluted share.","We\u2019re now ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Johnson from Robert Baird.","Jeffrey Johnson","Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Can you hear me, okay?","Dow Wilson","Hi, Jeff, yes.","Elisha Finney","Hi, there?","Jeffrey Johnson","Hey, great. So, Dow, one question for you and one question for Elisha, and let me start off with the question for you, Dow. So it\u2019s not a little bit maybe more cautious on some of the European and given that the Middle East and your European number on your oncology side a little more cautious on Europe and APAC. Is that the right read here? And I guess, as I look back over the last several quarters, we\u2019ve seen oncology orders in both those markets in negative territory, I think three out of the last four quarters. Is that kind of where we should level set, I know you don\u2019t guide the orders. But just given your comments in terms of last several quarter trend line, is that kind of where we should be still hanging out with our thoughts for the year?","Dow Wilson","Let me say that maybe this is going to cast it in a broader view for a second, Jeff, and then kind of comes from the regional data\u2026","Jeffrey Johnson","Sure.","Dow Wilson","When you look at the last 12 months in oncology, in dollars, it\u2019s down 2%, in constant currency, it\u2019s up 4%. I mean in the first quarter, it\u2019s not the greatest growth that we have ever had. Our funnel remains very good. So, we like what we see.","The fourth quarter was huge for us in Europe. Constant currency and dollar growth in Europe was outstanding in Q4. So, our Q4 was 12.5% constant currency growth last quarter. So, maybe there was a little bit of quarter-over-quarter balancing going on. So I think the 12 months trailing is kind of what we are seeing right now. Clearly, we are reading the papers like everybody and some of the macroeconomic weakness in Europe is real. I mean, we did have a light Q1.","But I think we\u2019re \u2013 we still see markets growing in that low to mid single-digit range at this time. We haven\u2019t seen anything that would pull us off that. Japan has been the ongoing structural change in Japan. In China, we did have a win in the quarter that was protested.","So, I mean, we\u2019re very close to flat in China. Our funnel remains very good in China. So I think Japan is probably going to be more of the same, that\u2019s been a pretty consistent story over the last few quarters. But I do think China will come back. The order that was protested was up a fairly large order. So, that was in our numbers that China would have been great. But anyway, I mean, those are the kinds of things that\u2019s happened around a quarter, I would say over the long haul within the last 12 months, we haven\u2019t seen anything that would at this time pull us off of market growth number in that kind of 3 to 5 range.","Jeffrey Johnson","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And, yes, the 4% you cited is a trailing 12 months you\u2019re referring to that worldwide.","Dow Wilson","Yes.","Jeffrey Johnson","So kind of mixed wise we think North America a little bit stronger maybe than others going forward, is that fair?","Dow Wilson","Yes, last \u2013 when you look at it in pure dollars, Americas last 12 months is at 4.5%, and international was down 6.5% in dollars. Constant currency adjust the whole thing at 4% up. So that\u2019s kind of, I mean, last 12 months is that kind of the market that I think we feel \u2013 we\u2019re still feeling.","Jeffrey Johnson","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then Elisha, the question now for you just around EPS guidance. Since you guided back in October, the euros kind of works a little bit more against you, I think a little bit stronger dollar against the euro since you guided some of the emerging market currency still go in the wrong way.","So if I look at as a dime raised to guidance here, how much was net debt tax in R&D driving that dime raise? How much kind of in the guidance number is coming from those two things? How much of an incremental currency headwind was there, if any included in your guidance? And then maybe how are you thinking about the core underlying business? So just trying to bucket kind of those three areas on what contributed to the dime change in guidance?","Elisha Finney","Sure. So, Jeff, the simple answer is, if I take the R&D tax credit and the medical device excise tax together, it\u2019s a dime for the year. So and that\u2019s roughly even at about $0.05 each. So we got a benefit of $0.04 in Q1, so those two impacts. And what we\u2019re saying is the additional $0.06 is going to come from Q2 to Q4. So essentially we took the benefit from those two things impacted onto the prior guidance and got it to the 4.60 midpoint.","Jeffrey Johnson","Okay. Then underlying then kind of the core business, I\u2019m trying to figure out if currency I thought was an incremental headwind since you last guided. Does that imply that your core expectations have improved a little bit?","Elisha Finney","Well, I mean, in certainly Q1, we feel good about and in terms of what I would refer to as an operational bid if you take out the $0.04 related to the tax impact, we had about a nickel deep. And that was due to higher oncology revenue and frankly very good cost controls on SG&A little bit on share repurchase is a little bit more than we\u2019ve historically done, but in line with that 1 to 2 million shares per quarter.","I think your next question is going to be why don\u2019t you get into that nickel? And I\u2019m still a little black and blue after Q4, frankly. And when we miss on that revenue number, it\u2019s very early in the year. And I think that just had to do with some timing and I think oncology did a fantastic job and probably pulled a little bit revenue forward from Q2 and Q3 to make sure we didn\u2019t have a repeat performance.","But for the year, we \u2013 it still looks good with the revenue guidance and the EPS from where we stand today. Currency from when I last guided has been relatively stable. I mean, it may have heard us, I don\u2019t know, I think I was at 112 versus 109, but again we built some of that into the range for the guidance when we give it.","Jeffrey Johnson","All right. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Hazan from Citi.","Amit Hazan","Hey, good afternoon, guys. Can you hear me okay?","Dow Wilson","Yes, yes, good morning.","Elisha Finney","Yes.","Amit Hazan","So, good afternoon, so\u2026","Dow Wilson","Good afternoon, yes.","Amit Hazan","Start on the gross margin line maybe a question on oncology gross margin. So I was looking back just kind of taking a little bit several quarter view, and if I strip out service just kind of look at your product gross margin on the oncology side. It kind of implies a pretty big decline over the past year. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s about 36% in fiscal 2014 down to 31% in fiscal 2015.","And as it\u2019s obviously just the product side, so I\u2019m wondering if you can share with us whether that trend continue this quarter first of all and what the drivers here might be outside of FX? But you kind of actually had a nice big shift in revenue towards the U.S. up until this quarter. And so I\u2019m wondering byproduct margins in oncology would be down as much as they were?","Elisha Finney","Yes. So Amit the biggest impact on Q1 was just the geographic mix shift. We had a 7 point shift international deliveries and particularly the Middle East and Eastern Europe, which are lower margin countries. I mean, I would just say some schedule delivery base. So we fully anticipated we were going to have margin declines in oncology and for the total company, and I think that was reflected in the guidance that we gave last quarter.","So for the year, I still expect even with the \u2013 we still had some currency impact in Q1. We will have a little bit in Q2 and then it should anniversary. For the year, we still think Oncology is right in that 43% range, so holding in line with our long-term expectations. I would point out, so this was a bigger proportion in the year ago quarter and not as one of our highest margin product lines. So that impacted it as well. But I think Oncology is performing well at this point.","Amit Hazan","And just to reiterate nothing outside, anything outside of FX is hurting the product side of gross margin in oncology, that would seems to be down over the course of a year now?","Dow Wilson","It\u2019s a region mix.","Elisha Finney","Region, yes, the region mix, the geographic mix. Yes, so, international went from 48% of total revenue in the year ago period to 55% is just a very big geographic mix shift. But on an apples-to-apple basis, it\u2019s really just the geography that was impacting it. And again, less service as a percentage of the total.","Amit Hazan","Let me jump to Imaging, just a couple of questions on that. Number one, I\u2019m wondering if you are reiterating kind of the guidance you laid out in fiscal year was, I think it was about flat or so on Imaging revenues?","And then secondly, specifically has your assessment of the risk around losing more business in flat panel and into \u2013 changed at all since the earnings call last quarter?","Dow Wilson","I think maybe the one difference we have here is, Toshiba announced during the quarter that they\u2019re selling their medical unit. Otherwise, I think it\u2019s very much consistent with what we guided a quarter ago. The challenges continue that the security and inspection business is stabilized \u2013 stabilizing currently at the lower revenue levels.","The panel pricing decline should anniversary in the second-half. And we are still absorbing the loss of major \u2013 of a major customer that went insourcing on flat panel. That said, we\u2019re probably not going to \u2013 that\u2019s happening every quarter to us and then probably doesn\u2019t have anniversary until Q4ish.","Toshiba\u2019s volume, the good news is most of that business is a service business. So that is going to continue to need to be replaced. But their ongoing forward production with the uncertainty around their sale and kind of who picks it up et cetera. We might see a little bit of volume adjustment there. As I did say in the script, they do have some inventory that they\u2019re working through as they kind of manage through this whole thing.","The good news is that in order the medicine claim on acquisition seem to be performing for us. So we are looking for a return to growth. I think consistent with what we said before in 2017 and 2018.","Amit Hazan","All right. Thanks very much, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies.","Anthony Petrone","Thanks. Just a couple of questions, maybe on proton\u2026","Dow Wilson","Hey, Anthony, how are you.","Anthony Petrone","Good. A couple of questions on proton, I will begin with proton and then we can follow-up with some of the geographies as well on oncology. So maybe just an update on the potential to hit the $0.15 swing factor in proton specifically. So I think it hinged it on the Emory deal. And then in your prepared comments, Dow, you mentioned potentially an installation in Russia, but you\u2019ve also touched upon some dislocations in that marketplace. So maybe just proton overall, the potential to hit the $0.15, where Emory is and how Russia plays into that?","Dow Wilson","Sure. I mean, the sites I named were all in our guidance. So that their orders that we have and no mystery around those. We have not guided to Emory. It is not a books order yet, and until the financing is complete, we won\u2019t put it in the guidance. If that were to happen, it would be a nice upside for us.","Elisha Finney","Yes, we lived that problem\u2026","Anthony Petrone","Same guidance there.","Elisha Finney","We are not doing that. And it\u2019s just, it\u2019s our customer who was securing the financing. We all working with them, but it really is somewhat outside of Varian\u2019s control and we are monitoring it closely.","Anthony Petrone","Great. And then just on geographies that you touched on China a bit, but Brazil is also sort of in the headlines out there with struggles. And can you just update on that specific tender, I think, if you go back it was 50 linux [ph] several of which had already been sort of shipped and installed. Can you maybe just update on that specific tender?","Dow Wilson","We\u2019re seeing the Ministry of Health is continuing their program that, I mean, that obviously that order was placed with us a year ago. But we\u2019re completing first installation this year and it is going as expected. So from a backlog point of view, we haven\u2019t seen it a change in their approach on these, so that\u2019s good. Markets are a little bit quiet there, but it hasn\u2019t been bad.","Anthony Petrone","And then just the last one for me just on software specifically. So last year that really seem to be a driver particularly on share gains, I think both on information management and even treatment planning. So maybe, do you see that as still a share gain story for 2016? And maybe Dow an update on how many RapidPlan has served? How many eclipse users have migrated to RapidPlan at this point? Thanks.","Dow Wilson","Yes. The \u2013 I mean, first of all as the overall \u2013 for the overall soccer business, it continues to be very well. We just got news that couple weeks ago that both eclipse and Aria got top ranking from class. Classes the \u2013 Gartner of our industry, independent organization that evaluates products for customer.","So we were very thrilled by that external validation. The \u2013 and then in terms of RapidPlan, as I said in the script, it\u2019s now installed over 50 sites. I would have to get you the exact number of orders, but it\u2019s well over 300 now. So the momentum continues there. I think from a overall differentiation point of view, our treatment planning position is terrific. I think we\u2019re way ahead with our knowledge base tools.","And then in Aria, our workflow tools and our informatics are a very good differentiators for us. And we continue to see very strong competitive take out with both of those products.","Anthony Petrone","Thanks, again.","Dow Wilson","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Roman with Goldman Sachs.","Dow Wilson","Hey, David.","David Roman","Hey, guys, how are you? Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to start with a clarification on the proton. I understand that Emory is not in the guidance and with the historical context why you did that? But our Russia and Saudi Arabia, they talked about are, to what extent are those reflected in the forward guidance?","Dow Wilson","They\u2019re very small amounts. They are in the guidance.","Elisha Finney","So all of our \u2013 under the percentage of completion, all of our projects where we have actually identified material specific to our customer we\u2019re taking revenue on those projects. So\u2026","David Roman","Got it.","Elisha Finney","So Saudi and Russia would be included in that umbrella.","David Roman","Okay, understood. Thank you.","Dow Wilson","Our Saudi, for example, I know we already took film out last year.","Elisha Finney","We\u2019ve taken about $33 million in total and Russia about $25 million in total.","David Roman","Okay. And then maybe a more strategic question. Dow, obviously we focus a lot on a quarter-to-quarter order trends, and how you\u2019re doing by region? But as you kind of take a step back and think about your growth rate and how things have progressed the past several quarters versus where you kind of want them to be? How much of the forward outlook depends on factors over which do you have control and kind of invest to drive those versus being dependent on macro factors or sort of end market conditions?","Dow Wilson","I mean for the whole company, I think, the cancer business remains at a terrific business for us. Our constant currency growth last year of 5%, 6% in oncology, very strong fourth quarter, a little weak this quarter. But our funnel still looks good. And we think that the cancer business unfortunately whether it\u2019s economic downturns. I mean, people get cancer regardless of economics. And if you look back when economic times were bad, we weathered those storms pretty well.","It\u2019s not to say that we might see something in our orders, if the economy really turns south. But there was this nice external validation of that last quarter with the global task force on the utilization of radiation oncology as published in the Lancet journal, that called for a thousands more machines, basically a 2.5 times in the installed base that we have today. And really asking the international organizations to help countries develop cancer plans.","So, especially outside of the U.S. a huge focus on utilizing radiation therapy for cancer. I think one of our big challenges I mentioned in the script there is making sure the people side of that comes along with it, because we\u2019ve got to have the people to be able do the work. But I think, as you look at the long-term health of the oncology business, the franchise is in as good a product position as we\u2019ve ever had. And I think the market remains in the long-term very, very solid.","Now, on the Imaging business, we\u2019re fairly going through a big storm right now. And we still like the fundamentals of the business. We do think it\u2019s an industry that has an consolidation opportunity and we\u2019ve got to \u2013 kind of got to figure out how to pay that hand a little bit. But the \u2013 as we get through the insourcing of this one customer is kind of short-term Toshiba probations and look for the long-term, the digitization of \u2013 but specially the radiographic market remains a huge opportunity and we like the long-term fundamental there.","David Roman","And then maybe just a last one maybe sort of a follow-up to that. As you\u2019re thinking about the opportunities that sit in front of you. What was sort of the thought process around and what to do with the medical device tax in million dollars, it\u2019s not all that material for you compared to some of the other companies in the group. But why not plow some of those savings back into the business and how should we think about your spending patterns on a go-forward basis to support some of that growth?","Dow Wilson","Yes, I mean at a high level let me take first crack at this and will have Elisha walk you through some of the detail. But at a high level, we have actually taken up our R&D and as a percent of sales over the last couple of years. So we\u2019re investing a lot in the business if we\u2019re going to make sure we get pop for that growth. So we\u2019re challenging the spend as we do it, as we want to see the growth kind of linking it to your previous question. But we have taken up the R&D investment as a percent of the total over the last couple of years. So we were never making R&D decision as a result of our tax impact. I mean, clearly, it would have been a little easier if we didn\u2019t have to pay that. But we\u2019re making that independent of the tag making that decision independent as a tax stuff.","Elisha Finney","And I would just add, I mean, our roadmap is kind of set for the year. We\u2019ve got the people, the projects. It maybe more disruptive to try and even accelerate some of those things at this point. And the last point is, when we increase R&D, it comes from people and that tends to be permanent in nature whereas this is only a reprieve for two years as drafted at this point.","David Roman","Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Wittes from Brean capital.","Jason Wittes","Hi, thank you for taking the questions everybody.","Dow Wilson","Hi, Wittes.","Jason Wittes","Hey. But I just want to ask first off, in terms of the security business, I think you said about $25 million of the revenues related to security are service related?","Dow Wilson","That\u2019s right.","Jason Wittes","And that \u2013 is that most of the revenues we should expect this year, or should we also expect some orders on top of that?","Dow Wilson","No, I mean, that\u2019s that maybe not quite half, I mean, a little bit more than half of the total revenue we should have on the year.","Elisha Finney","Yes. That\u2019s about right.","Jason Wittes","Okay. And then just to understand Toshiba, they are looking to sell that business. I assume, they are one of your larger customers. And I assume they are still a decent percentage of the imaging business? Is that the right way to think about it?","Dow Wilson","Yes.","Jason Wittes","And I guess the presumption would be they are right now working down their inventories, but they will have to start reordering at some point whether or not that\u2019s after a sale or not, I guess is harder to determine?","Dow Wilson","I mean, here is what I can tell you. They are our largest customer, in fact, they are terrific customer. They account for about $150 million of our Imaging Components revenue. The split on that is $125 million to about $25 million in panel. We expect to continue supplying high-end CT tubes to whoever it is that buys Toshiba. We\u2019re designing future products for them having very good conversations. So, we think that I mean there\u2019s obviously kind of uncertainty as it go through that process, but we are well designed in and I think that that will continue whoever the new owner is.","Jason Wittes","Okay that\u2019s very helpful. And then maybe to switch to proton, I mean you mentioned sort of global turmoil impacting your core oncology business. Should we assume that the proton business should may also be impacted this year?","Dow Wilson","No I mean it\u2019s tough to say, when we look at our funnel, our funnel remains positive, we have had one or two fallout. I don\u2019t know how much of that some of that I think some of their own decisions. I don\u2019t know how much of that was kind of macro economy. We are competing on a number of compact units, and I do think we\u2019ll see our first compact orders this year, so we\u2019re encouraged about that.","There remains to be a lot of customer interest I know and I guess I would say that versus in 2009, 2008 \u2013 2009 when we went through this, we were just selling big systems. So that market dried up. Now when you look at our funnel, our funnel has a lot of compact units, and customers were hanging in there, we are having a lot of conversations. And so funnel remains pretty good and our objective is to see if we can win few of those single room orders this year.","Jason Wittes","So Just to get clarification. The large centers, there\u2019s really not much of a market this year for them? It is mostly compact centers that people are looking at right now?","Dow Wilson","Well that was a comparison to 2008 \u2013 2009.","Jason Wittes","Fair enough. Sorry. Yes.","Dow Wilson","2008 \u2013 2009 that\u2019s what the market was, when you are looking at $50 million to $90 million of expense into that kind of recession that market just went away during 2008 \u2013 2009. We are not seeing that. There is still a good multi-room market out there, but we\u2019re also seeing a very good funnel of these compact rooms. We\u2019re competing on both, but just to say that in terms as it relates to kind of a global macroeconomic environment. I think these contract customers are hanging in there little more in terms of the funnel, the strength of the funnel.","Jason Wittes","Very helpful I\u2019ll jump back in queue.","Dow Wilson","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.","Tycho Peterson","Hey. And maybe just a higher level strategic question on some of the emerging markets that you called out is being kind of problematic. I mean given that a lot of issues here are kind of structural rather than cyclical in some of these markets, does this change your thinking around how you address these markets, the resources you put to them? Any change in where you are placing incremental efforts internationally based on what we have seen the last couple of quarters?","Dow Wilson","Let me kind of underscore one of the things I had pointed out in the call weaken Japan, weaken Europe. The emerging markets weaken Russia for sure, but we had some Latin America activity that wasn\u2019t too bad. China as I mentioned was down. But we kind of have a timing issue with that fairly large protested orders. So we actually think China is going to be a okay.","The long term is where we still think these markets are going to grow we\u2019ve built that market development team. We\u2019re investing in our access to care program to bring new, operators into the business and we are still bullish about the long term opportunities I mean to replace somebody that leaves as fast as maybe we used to, while we go through maybe some downturns, maybe not. But we were clearly looking at this very opportunistically and strategically for the long-term.","Tycho Peterson","And any hope on Japan turning, I mean I know you talked in the past about only 20%, 25% of patients receiving radiation there. So clearly, there is a clinical need?","Dow Wilson","Yes there\u2019s I mean a clinical need remains I just think between the currency movement their market restructure it\u2019s we are investing a little bit in government affairs they are to kind of get the government a little bit more supportive. But at least for kind of market outlook this year. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019ve seen anything that dramatically changes what we\u2019ve been seeing over the last few year anyway.","Tycho Peterson","And then you called out the Edge orders in China. Just, I mean, any thoughts on how the mix there evolves, TrueBeam, Edge, others?","Elisha Finney","I think it\u2019s been pretty consistent.","Dow Wilson","It\u2019s a bi-mobile market. There is a value market that\u2019s aggressive, where people are looking at entry level products. But there\u2019s also a high-end market. Edge is part of that. We\u2019re really glad to get those three Q1 Edge orders. And then one of the exciting piece of the news is that TrueBeam, the TrueBeam volume there still remains pretty good. It is a category A product.","So puts it in a little more \u2013 a little bit more of a regulatory process to get through, but sort of limited licenses to that end of the market. But I\u2019d say our mix of products remains pretty consistent. And the high-end of that market remains a really important market for us. And we\u2019ve been expanding our share in China over the last 18 months. So we\u2019re doing that by winning in the value market.","Tycho Peterson","Backlog declined a bit this quarter. Was that just the order slippage from last quarter? And any thoughts on backlog stability, I guess, going forward?","Elisha Finney","So versus a year ago quarter backlog was up\u2026","Tycho Peterson","Sequentially.","Elisha Finney","Sequentially.","Tycho Peterson","Sequentially, yes.","Elisha Finney","Yes. So, I mean, we came in ahead \u2013 a little bit ahead on oncology revenues and the orders. So that\u2019s all it is.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. Two other quick ones, I guess, on kind of the software initiatives, Dow in the past you talked about a $300 million opportunity over the next couple of years. Can you just give us a sense of the magnitude of the growth you think you can capture from all the initiatives, RapidPlan and everything else you\u2019ve been highlighting over the last couple of quarters that you can capture this year?","Dow Wilson","Yes, and I think the RapidPlan is certainly our single biggest opportunity. We maybe talking about it in terms of units. If we have \u2013 if we\u2019ve taken 300 to 350 units, there\u2019s probably an installed base of 3,500 to 4,000. So we\u2019re just nicking that. And I think what encourages me is the early evidence both for clinical outcome and the productivity is outstanding. So I think it really helps us to make the economic case for people to invest. And the, of course, the ASPs, the selling prices and the margins there remain very good.","Inside of analytics and our kind of the transition to coordinate and care on Aria is maybe not as far as advanced the product was released a little bit later. But we also really like the progress there, and we do think it\u2019s driving share. We\u2019d really like to see where it drives a little bit more volume.","We are investing in some software sales resources outside of the U.S. to kind of help us attack the markets that we haven\u2019t maybe attack as aggressively on the software side. Much of our software business is still frankly U.S. based. So we\u2019re trying to drive that that piece as well. But I \u2013 we\u2019re still \u2013 we\u2019re very encouraged by what we see, and both in terms of kind of the market opportunity and the share opportunity by our software product.","Tycho Peterson","And just lastly, obviously there has been a lot of news earlier this year on the cancer Moon Shot program and a lot of developments in liquid biopsy. Does any of that change your view on the long-term outlook on the U.S. market in particular with better and earlier detection?","Dow Wilson","The short version is we love it. We do know that there has been some reach out to some of our customers in that radiation therapy is going to be part of that. So that\u2019s sort of frankly any other clarity beyond that is difficult. But we\u2019re encouraged that at least our thought leaders are at the table.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. Thanks.","Dow Wilson","Thanks, Tycho.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley.","Steve Beuchaw","Hi, good afternoon, and thanks for taking the questions.","Dow Wilson","Hi Steve.","Steve Beuchaw","Just a few housekeeping items from me at this point. I guess, first up for Mevis and Claymount, that do you have a sense of what the contribution was in the top line from those specifically for the quarter? I know we have the number for the year, I don\u2019t know that we have it for the quarter?","Elisha Finney","Yes, it\u2019s roughly $15 million.","Steve Beuchaw","$15 million, okay. And then on the protons financing, now you guys have a little bit more of that on the balance sheet. Do you have a sense of what the contribution was on the P&L in the quarter?","Elisha Finney","The total interest income was like $1.7 million, so or the $1.5 million maybe. I don\u2019t have that number right in front of me Steve, but that\u2019s close enough.","Steve Beuchaw","Got it, and then last one from me is, I\u2019m thinking back to the fourth quarter call. And the delivery slippages, I think Tycho, might have alluded to this.","Elisha Finney","Yes.","Steve Beuchaw","But there was a $0.10 impact from deliveries I believe that was predominantly TrueBeam\u2019s slipping from the fourth quarter. Did we recapture that in the first quarter? Is there more in the second quarter? How do we think about those layering in here?","Elisha Finney","Well, I think you should, just assume that was built into our guidance for FY16 and the bulk of that in Q1. So we took that into account when we set the guidance for Q1.","Steve Beuchaw","Perfect, and thanks so much all the guys again.","Elisha Finney","Thanks Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charley Jones from Dougherty Markets.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, good afternoon this is Jon.","Dow Wilson","Hey Jon","Unidentified Analyst","I want to go and put some numbers around some comments you made around software Dow. And then I had a questions around some comments that Elisha had around the guidance for the year end revenue. And so wondering if you could cheese out, what the growth, well I think this is kind of a $500 million service offer business.","If you could kind of breakout how much of it is maybe just software only? And then particularly I\u2019m interested in trying to figure out the opportunity of this. I was guessing it was going to be international and I was curious Elisha if you could talk about the growth rates of service and software for 2015 kind of between international and U.S. and how that\u2019s going to change in 2016.","Really trying to understand what this business can look like if we did get into a lower unit kind of environment? And that goes to my second question around the guidance of revenue. It seems like you are putting a lot in the fourth quarter if I\u2019m reading you right about pulling revenue out of the third quarter Elisha in the second quarter.","So I am curious where does that come from? Is it more oncology or proton or x-ray? And I think Dow last quarter you said maybe we get a little bit of growth from x-ray as we went through the back half of the year. But I\u2019m curious if you have any better visibility on that as well? So those are my questions. Thanks.","Elisha Finney","Okay hope you like to remember all that\u2026","Dow Wilson","Let me start on that.","Elisha Finney","Sure.","Dow Wilson","After further thing I meant for logistic theground is our service business is about $1 billion business. Our software business is about $0.5 million business much of, which is equipment and much of, which is service. So, well it\u2019s kind of gets double counted if you look at it, because there is a software service agreement paid fees that goes into our service business.","And then the upfront licenses that we sell as product the customer getting into the business there are ongoing equipment transactions as booked in our equipment business. So, did you know it as we have said that the service business historically has been a double-digit business. I think constant currency adjusted last year was 9%.","Elisha Finney","9%","Dow Wilson","9% and that it was constant currency adjusted growth in Q1\u2026","Elisha Finney","6%.","Dow Wilson","6% so I think on the year it\u2019s we clearly kind of see at high single-digit\u2026","Elisha Finney","Yes.","Dow Wilson","Kind of growth range and now if we stretch everything goes as far as it will be a double-digit business but that\u2019s that kind of overseeing on the software business and the service business. But software is a big piece of that growth in the service business and the software business itself has about $0.5 billion business call it 50-50, 50%ish equipment 50% ongoing service agreements with their service installed base.","Last year that business grew a little faster than the average. So with the constant currency growth in oncology last year was 6% that was call it 7% or 8% and so we\u2019d love to stretch that business get double-digit growth that\u2019s what we love to see, I think it will be stretching to get there, but right now we\u2019d love to see it grow a little bit faster than the oncology average.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes.","Dow Wilson","At least you can fix all that.","Elisha Finney","No, I\u2019m reluctant to get a whole lot of breakdown on our guidance. I mean, this is again, we\u2019re in Q1 we\u2019re looking out at the full-year. We\u2019re confident from where we sit today. I think you\u2019re correct that more growth is going to come in the second-half. But the reason for that is, we anniversary two really big effects of last year. The first thing effects, we\u2019ll still have a little bit at quarter-over-quarter impact in this second fiscal quarter that we\u2019re currently in. But as we assuming currency stay where they\u2019re today that impact gets reduced significantly if we go into Q3 and Q4. And so obviously, we expect the dollar growth rates are going to be higher in the second-half of the year.","The other thing that we anniversary that was huge last year is the pricing impact on particularly the flat panel business. And all of the declines that we saw there, which again were late in second quarter and really large in Q3 and Q4. So, our hope is that we\u2019re going to get a little more linear in our \u2013 on our oncology business, as we go through this fiscal year. And if you look at the guidance for the third cap versus the full-year, it\u2019s right around at the midpoint 45% of the year and that is very common with historical performance having about 45% of our EPS in the first-half.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you very much. Maybe I can just follow-up, I guess, on the question around x-ray. You made comments last quarter, Dow, about maybe seeing some stabilization in x-ray. Obviously, you talked about Toshiba and there\u2019s an unknown there. But if you look at what\u2019s happened to your currency and some of these other Korean different suppliers into that business. Do you feel like your position is a little bit better and you\u2019ve got more visibility or stability, or are you still in this kind of unknown position there as you look forward?","Dow Wilson","I mean, I guess if kind of as I said [FIP] is stabilizing. The security business is stabilizing, we like that as Elisha said. Panel pricing probably anniversaries Q3ish. We\u2019re still absorbing a loss of a major customer that\u2019s going on. I think the only thing has changed from last quarter has been this Toshiba announcement and with that some readjustment of their inventory in order level, I think that\u2019s probably going to go on for a while as they adjust.","So that would be the one piece of new news. We still think that it\u2019s a good business and look for its return to growth I think in terms of whether it\u2019s stabilizing or not where the numbers aren\u2019t great, we have at least made our internal goals for the business and we feel good about that.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you for the time.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Brandon Henry from RBC.","Brandon Henry","Yes. Thank you for taking my question. You guys have been reporting pretty strong order numbers in the EMEA in Asia Pacific regions over the last couple of quarters. But it looks like the gross order number for oncology systems in those two regions was a little weaker this quarter. So just help me understand how much of this is market related versus market share related? Have you seen any change in the competitive dynamics or pricing with Electra in either one of those markets?","Dow Wilson","I mean, I think as I talked a little bit about the market side last quarter, we were very gratified by the European volume we saw at the end of last year. And frankly, we\u2019d love the market to perform at that level all the time, as we look forward, we didn\u2019t think that kind of 12%.","Elisha Finney","The 25% on Q4 constant currency.","Dow Wilson","Yes, 25% constant currency growth, 12% that real dollar growth last quarter. That\u2019s just not going to continue it, probably is a mid single digitish market. So that\u2019s probably the European market. There was one other part of the question that my jet lag is not helping me remember.","So, yes competitively I mean our share is up as we reported the last quarters, when you look at last 12 months, our share is up pretty significantly. So and it\u2019s worldwide, we\u2019re seeing share growth literally in every geography. So some of it has come from share growth. We obviously like that. We have seen Electra be a little more aggressive, especially at challenging tenders that are awarded. And also that maybe is a little bit different competitive practice than we\u2019ve seen in the past. And not quite sure why they\u2019re doing that. I think that hurts them with the customers frankly. But anyway, that might be the one competitive change that we\u2019re seeing a little bit.","Brandon Henry","Okay. And then on the Imaging Components side, can you talk about some of the strategies longer-term after we see some stabilization that you are looking to kind of reaccelerate this business? Is it something that can be done internally with the product pipeline, or will it require M&A? And also can you give us an update on kind of the strategic review process for the security inspection business? Is that a business that still fits for Varian?","Dow Wilson","Yes, sure. The \u2013 in terms of the strategy, it remains at a product development business. So I alluded to the fact that with Toshiba, we started some new product programs. This remains a very innovation driven segment. And especially in tubes, it\u2019s innovation driven. In flat panel, it\u2019s innovation and cost reduction driven. So one of the things that we\u2019ve got to come in, we\u2019ve just announced and it\u2019s being working to our customers the supply chain a new low-cost flat panel. I think that gives us both a margin opportunity as well as some share play. So we would like to see that come back.","As I mentioned in last quarter in the call, the security business on the one hand we\u2019ve seen that the volume come down, its profitability still remains very, very good. So, even though we\u2019ve gone from $80 million, $85 million to $45 million, $50 million, it\u2019s still a 20% return on sales business. It\u2019s technology that we leverage throughout our product line both in imaging and in oncology. So that\u2019s, were continuing to look at it, but replacing that revenue and profit is not an easy thing.","Brandon Henry","Okay. And then one last question for me. On the service side for Oncology Systems, can you kind of talk about what the installed base for you guys? How quickly that\u2019s growing? And then in the medium term, how do you grow the services business? How do you continue to grow the service business high-single digits kind of above the growth in the installed base, just talk about that strategy?","Dow Wilson","Until now the short version is the installed base is growing. Our unit volume remains very good. As we\u2019ve said before, the U.S. market remains replacement market. But outside of the U.S., it\u2019s \u2013 we still get very good socket growth and the TrueBeam percentage is still quite high, I\u2019m sorry the TrueBeam percentage is so quite low. When you look at TrueBeam as a percentage of our overall installed base, I\u2019d say I\u2019m guessing now here, but call it maybe 20%, 15% to 20%.","So the \u2013 and we get a big price adjustment as we go through that. So that\u2019s true in the U.S. and it\u2019s even more true outside of U.S. So between the installed base growth, the price growth and then the software opportunities that we get in the service, we think that high single-digit growth number constant currency is very doable.","Brandon Henry","Okay.

My name is Anissia, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Spencer Sias. Please proceed.","Spencer R. Sias","Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Varian Medical Systems Conference Call for the Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2012. Participating in this call are Tim Guertin, President and CEO; Elisha Finney, CFO; Dow Wilson, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Tai Chen, our Corporate Controller. Tim and Elisha will summarize our results, and we'll take your questions following the presentation.","To simplify our discussion, unless otherwise stated, all references to the quarter or year are fiscal quarters and fiscal years, quarterly comparisons over to second quarter of fiscal 2012 versus the second quarter fiscal 2011. ","Please be advised that this presentation and discussion contains forward-looking statements.

Some of the important risks relating to our business are described in our second quarter earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements in this presentation and discussion because of new information, future events or otherwise. ","Before we start this call, please mark your calendars for our mid-year review meeting with investors in New York at 11:30 a.m. on Monday, May 7 at the Intercontinental Hotel Times Square. We'll issue more details on this meeting and webcast tomorrow. ","And now, here's Tim.","Timothy E. Guertin","Good afternoon, and welcome. Today, we're reporting results for the second quarter of 2012 with healthy growth in revenue, net orders and backlog but with mixed margin results. ","Earnings were $0.94 including a $0.02 restructuring charge associated with the realignment of resources to support our ongoing growth in emerging markets. I will comment on the operational highlights for the quarter as well as our exciting newly announced global collaboration with Siemens, and Elisha will walk you through the numbers. ","To summarize our second quarter 2012 results compared to the year-ago quarter, company revenues for the quarter rose by 11% to $720 million. Net orders were up nicely in all of our businesses and our backlog increased by 18% to $2.7 billion. Excluding proton, order backlog was up 12%.","Our company gross margin dropped by more than 3 points with a record margin in our X-ray Product business that was more than offset by reduced margin in our Oncology business and higher-than-expected proton revenues that were booked on a 0 profit percentage of completion basis. ","Turning to our Oncology Systems business, second quarter revenues were $565 million, up 11% from the year-ago quarter. However, margins in this business declined to an unusually low level in the quarter due to a significant geographic mix to lower-margin countries, weaker pricing in those markets and slower-than-anticipated progress in product cost reduction programs. These programs should begin to show results during the second half of the year when we expect margins to recover somewhat to more historical levels. ","Net orders totaled $565 million, up 9% with a 14% increase in North America and a 4% increase in our overall international market, which accounted for 55% of the total orders for this business during the period. Second quarter orders in the North American market, which experienced some push outs in the first quarter of this year, included a major win at Montreal General Hospital which replaced an -- which, excuse me, which placed an order for several TrueBeam systems. Several other sites placed orders for multiple TrueBeam units during the period including the Thomas Jefferson University Hospital system and New York-Presbyterian Hospital. ","Software orders in North America were also strong, including competitive replacements or treatment planning and information systems at several sites. We are particularly pleased to have achieved double-digit growth in North America on top of double-digit growth in the comparable prior year quarter. ","In the international market, compared to the second quarter of last year, net orders rose 30% in Asia on an easy comp and increased 1% in Europe on a tough comp. In the rest of the world, net orders declined versus very strong growth in the year-ago quarter. Second quarter orders in China rose by more than 50%, reflecting a successful effort to revitalize and restructure our sales force there. Thailand and Taiwan also drove the strong orders performance in Asia. We booked our first TrueBeam orders in Japan and Taiwan and installed our first TrueBeam systems in Korea. We are hopeful that this platform will become a growth driver in this important region. ","In Europe, we had mixed results, many countries growing and others, quiet. At this time, it's difficult to draw any conclusions regarding the impact of financial and banking worries on the European market. It appears the market has continued to invest in better clinical capability, albeit, in a sporadic and somewhat lumpy fashion. ","TrueBeam comprised more than 45% of our high-energy machine orders during the quarter. We booked more than 60 TrueBeam orders during the quarter, and we now have nearly 490 orders for this system since its introduction 2 years ago. It is gratifying to see the total accelerator unit order volume was up versus the year-ago quarter even as TrueBeam becomes a higher percentage of orders compared to our other high-energy models. We now have more than 230 installations complete or in progress around the globe. ","As you know, our goal is to help save more lives every year by advancing the clinical capability of our technology. So I would like to update you on key studies that have been published in the last quarter. We believe that these types of studies play an important role in driving long-term market growth. The use of IMRT for prostate cancer treatment has been the subject of much debate. I'm pleased to report that a study published last week in the Journal of the American Medical Association supports the use of IMRT for this disease. ","Another prostate cancer study at Memorial Sloan-Kettering showed that image-guided IMRT is superior to IMRT without image guidance. This data appears in a paper that is in the process of being published by the International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology and Physics, or the Red Journal, as it is known in the industry. ","Moving on to tumors of the brain and spine. Clinicians at the University of Alabama at Birmingham have published 2 articles on their use of Varian technology for radiosurgery. One group reporting in practical radiation oncology found that it could treat up to 4 brain metastases simultaneously using RapidArc radiosurgery and that it could do it within 15 minutes, an order of magnitude faster than is possible with conventional cobalt and robotic surgery systems without any sacrifice in the position or quality of treatment.","A second group, which published its results in the Journal of Radiosurgery and SBRT used the fast-dose delivery speed of our TrueBeam STx system to treat tumors of the brain or spine in an average time of 11 minutes. Typically, these demanding procedures can take upwards of an hour at lower dose delivery rates, which is not only hard on the patient but also very expensive. These studies mark the progress that is being made in the fight to control cancer with radiotherapy and radiosurgery and enhance efficiency of these treatments methods. I recommend that you read them to fully appreciate the work that is being done in this field. We expect to see more of these studies as trials for lung and liver treatments get underway. ","Coincident with issuing our second quarter earnings performance, we announced a major new partnership with Siemens today. This is an exciting development that will enable Varian to enhance and expand its clinical offerings to the benefit of cancer patients around the globe. By developing strong software connectivity and new architecture, linking Siemens and Varian Systems together, we can give clinics an important new options for imaging and treating patients. ","Another key objective of this partnership is to accelerate innovation and provide more efficient and effective solutions, particularly in emerging markets. Varian will represent Siemens diagnostic imaging products, such as CT, PET-CT, or MRI, to radiation oncology clinics around the world beginning immediately in most international markets and expand it in North America later this year. ","Siemens Healthcare will similarly represent Varian equipment and software for radiotherapy and radiosurgery within its offerings to its healthcare customers. This will enable the companies to offer comprehensive solutions to support the entire clinical workflow from imaging to treatment. Siemens will continue to service and support its global installed base of approximately 2,000 medical linear accelerators. This agreement will give Siemens customers more choices for therapy equipment as aging accelerators are due for replacement. I believe this partnership will expand the growth opportunities for both of our companies, and we're very pleased to be working with Siemens in this endeavor. ","Our X-ray Products business appears to be recovering from a weak first quarter when Japanese customers slowed purchasing in order to adjust their inventories. While the second quarter started slowly, it ended on a strong note, signaling that the inventory adjustment in Japan appears to be behind us. The business achieved record margins as the result of product mix, improved quality performance and cost controls. Net orders were $130 million, up 5% from the year-ago period and revenues rose 4% to $123 million. Sales of high-powered CT tubes in Japan were particularly strong. ","Orders in our somewhat longer-cycle plant panel business were up in double digits with strong demand for our digital radiography products. We have now completed our previously announced acquisition of InfiMed, thereby adding imaging processing workstations, hardware and software to the X-Ray Products portfolio. The addition of InfiMed's products and technical expertise will enable Varian to better serve our X-ray customers as a one-stop shop for X-ray tubes, flat panel image detectors and workstations. We expect that we will be able to offer more fully integrated X-ray component solutions that can be incorporated more easily into our customers' X-ray imaging systems. It should help our customers to achieve improved performance and time-to-market for their equipment. ","Our Other category had a very good second quarter, both in the Varian Particle Therapy business and in our Security and Inspections Product business. Combined net orders for the category were $168 million with $124 million in 2 orders for our ProBeam Proton Therapy Systems and $44 million in net orders for Security and Inspection Products. As was reported earlier in the quarter, we booked an order for ProBeam system at a center that will be built in Saudi Arabia and another order for a proton clinic that will be built in St. Petersburg, Russia. Since September of last year, the Varian Particle Therapy business has booked $212 million in orders. We're delighted to see a gain momentum. ","Our ongoing installation at the Scripps Proton Center near San Diego is going well. And I'm pleased to report that we hit a historic milestone last week when we successfully accelerated and extracted a $250 million electron volt proton beam from the superconducting cyclotron that we have installed there. Our installation work is continuing, and our next steps will be to commission the beam transport system and the gantry treatment rooms with a goal of enabling Scripps to commence patient treatments in 2013. The cyclotron is one of the key elements of the system and the realization of this milestone on schedule helps to validate the production, testing, transport and installation processes that were implemented over the past year.","You also may have seen media coverage last week at the groundbreaking on a new proton therapy facility at the University of Maryland. We expect to book an equipment order from this center when the financing package of the project is complete. Orders in our Security business increased as customers won public tenders for more compact high-speed cargo screening installations with our materials discrimination technology in locations around the world. ","And so now here is Elisha to cover the financials.","Elisha W. Finney","Great. Thanks, Tim, and hello, everyone. Typically, at the outset, I talk about constant currency growth rates. But this quarter, there is no need to discuss that as the U.S. dollar and constant currency growth rates for orders and sales are virtually identical for the quarter and year to date. ","Second quarter revenues increased 11% to $720 million. Oncology Systems posted an 11% increase with strong revenue growth in Europe and rest of world. Revenues rose sharply in our emerging markets including BRIC countries, Turkey, Ukraine, Saudi and South Korea, while the U.S. revenues were up in single digits. Japanese revenues were down significantly from the year-ago quarter when we benefited from stimulus-generated delivery. ","X-Ray Products posted a gain of 4% as revenues picked up in March with renewed spending in Japan. Revenues from businesses under the Other category increased by 42% including $14 million of revenue for the Scripps Proton Therapy contract. The Scripps revenue was above our forecast for the quarter as all of the remaining equipment was delivered on site. And for the year, we now believe that our total proton revenue could approximate $60 million. ","The second quarter gross margin for the company fell by more than 3 points to 41.2%. Oncology Systems' gross margin declined by 3 points to 42.2% due primarily to a significant geographic shift away from our high-margin countries to our lower margin countries. For example, in Japan, where our customers tend to buy our most sophisticated equipment, revenues were down nearly 40% quarter-over-quarter, while the previously mentioned lower margin emerging market revenues were up nearly 30%. Additionally, in certain international markets, we are experiencing some competitive pricing pressure. For the second half, oncology margins should return to a more normal historical level of 44% to 45%.","X-ray Products' gross margin hit a new record, climbing almost 3 points to 43% due largely to product mix and improved quality cost. The gross margin for the Other business and the total company was negatively impacted by the Scripps contract under which revenue is being recorded using the percentage of completion method. Under this method, revenues are initially recognized equal to cost, with the expectation that profits will be recognized toward the end of the project. ","The Scripps contract negatively impacted the company's second quarter gross margin by nearly 1 point. For the year, we now expect that gross margin for the total company will decline by about 1 point from last year to between 42% and 43%. Second quarter SG&A expenses were $106 million or 15% of revenues, up slightly as a percentage of revenue from the year-ago quarter. SG&A was impacted by our $2.5 million restructuring charge, which involved a work force reduction in North America in order to support a realignment of resources and put more emphasis on sales and marketing activities in our emerging markets. For the second half, we expect to see higher than previously anticipated SG&A expenses due largely to increased legal expenses as well as start-up costs associated with our Siemens partnership. Second quarter R&D expenses were $47 million or 7% of revenues, down slightly as a percent of revenue with the year ago quarter. ","Moving down the income statement. Second quarter operating earnings totaled $144 million, down 3 points to 20% of revenues. Excluding the restructuring charge and proton revenues, operating earnings for the quarter were 21% of revenue. Depreciation and amortization totaled $14 million for the quarter. The effective tax rate was 25.3% for the quarter, down about 6 points from the year-ago period due almost exclusively to the geographic shift in earnings toward lower tax jurisdictions. While the geographic shift had a negative effect on our gross margin, much of this effect is offset in a lower overall corporate tax rate. For fiscal year 2012, we now estimate that the tax rate will be approximately 28% for the third quarter and the full fiscal year. ","Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased significantly from the year-ago quarter to $114.5 million due largely to our ongoing share repurchase programs. Including the $0.02 restructuring charge, diluted earnings per share rose 9% to $0.94. ","Turning now to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalent of $617 million, debt of $162 million and stockholders equity of 1.4 billion. Subsequent to the close of the quarter, we have continued to pay down short-term debt under our revolving line of credit. And as of today, our total net debt is about $130 million. DSO increased by 4 days from the year ago quarter to 83 including a 5-day impact from the Particle Therapy business. ","Second quarter cash flow from operations was $105 million, roughly equal with net earnings. Primary uses of cash were 75 million to repurchase 1.1 million shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 6 million shares remaining under a repurchase authorization. ","Now, I'll turn it back over to Tim for the outlook.","Timothy E. Guertin","Thanks, Elisha. Overall, in the second quarter, we had a lot of good news including strong growth in company revenue orders and backlog, 2 new proton system orders and a record gross margin in our X-ray Products business. We're now facing some margin challenges in our Oncology business as we invest and move into -- more aggressively into emerging markets and pursue product cost reductions. ","Including the impact of oncology's gross margin, as well as increased costs for legal proceedings and start-up costs associated with the new Siemens partnership, we're now adjusting our outlook for the remainder of the year. For fiscal 2012, we now expect earnings from continuing operations to increase over fiscal 2011 total by 9% to 12% to a range of $3.76 to $3.84 per diluted share. Annual revenue should increase over the fiscal 2011 total by about 10%. For the third quarter, we expect earnings per share to increase by 10% to 14% over the prior year quarter to a range of $0.91 to $0.95 per diluted share. Revenues for the third quarter should be 9% to 10% over the third quarter of fiscal 2011. ","Thank you for your attention, and we're now ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Jeremy Feffer with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","I wanted to ask first on the margin issues from the quarter. What is giving you comfort that it was just a one quarter hiccup in the geographic mix and price reduction, things like that, will rebound in the second half?","Elisha W. Finney","Sure. Well -- I mean, we had a -- really, an unprecedented geographic shift in the second quarter where emerging markets up nearly 30% and our highest margin territory, Japan, where they tend to buy very rich feature set machines, being down almost 40%. We have -- historically, we've gone in, and when we look at the backlog, we look at region, and we can apply some averages for Europe, for Asia, for North America. What we have now done is we've gone into the backlog, machine by machine, and we're really looking at it based on the profitability and getting more granular in terms of going into these emerging markets and really looking at the margin impact. So when we look out into Q2 -- into Q3 and Q4, it's not going to be at the margin level that we had first anticipated because of all of the issues that we've talked about. But we do think it's going to get back to a -- closer to the historical range of the 44% to 45% levels for oncology.","Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","And then staying with oncology, when Elekta reported its January quarter, they noted some particular weakness in Asia. You guys, obviously, saw some strength. Can you comment on the general market share trends there? Are you -- is this affirmation that you are picking up share in Asia?","Timothy E. Guertin","Well, I think that everybody is seeing the same thing in Japan, which is that Japan is way down from the stimulus a few years ago. And as Elisha mentioned earlier, we were down -- I think, it was 40% from a year ago. So I think everybody was impacted by that, Elekta and Varian. I think we are doing better in China than people expected. I think we're doing better than anybody expected us to do in China, and that's good news. I think our new team is doing well, and that may be probably a majority of the explanation for the way Siemens -- I mean, excuse me, Elekta looks at it and the way Varian looks at it.","Elisha W. Finney","Yes, and let me just clarify to make sure that Tim and I aren't confusing you, that the 40% decline is in revenues reflecting the prior year ending of the stimulus program. The orders for Japan and the Far East in general were very strong this quarter.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A quick one on gross margins. Understanding, of course, that the geographic mix is a critical driver. Could you speak to the trends in terms of gross margins in developed markets over the last quarter, let's call it 2 quarters. I mean, has there been any breaking trends there? And then on the COGS programs that you referenced, how much would you expect these to contribute in terms of dollars or a fraction on margin?","Timothy E. Guertin","Yes. Well, what we're seeing is that some countries are okay; other countries, other territories are not. And what's happening is it depends on the competitive profile of those countries, and it depends on the budgets in those countries. What we're seeing is that some of these locations, they just don't have the budget, but they still have an appetite for our very high-end machines. And so our sales forces are having to accommodate this in order to get this business. And so that's put pressure on certain countries. And so what we've seen in Q2 and what I think we're going to see more in Q3 and Q4 than we thought 3 months ago is we're seeing more of these shipments to these kinds of countries than was expected just even 3 months ago. And so as our backlog is filling up for the year, it helps us to get more and more accurate as the year goes on about what's going to happen. But as we fill out that backlog, it's becoming clear that countries like the United States and Japan, that formerly were a big part of our business and had -- and where people bought favorable mixes of machines are being replaced by locations where the mix is not so favorable. So that's kind of the general picture.","Elisha W. Finney","And I don't want to break the cost reductions down to exactly how much we're going to get, Steve, but suffice it to say that we're going to be aggressively going after it. We're going to be chipping it away, chipping away at it little by little, and this is something that we'll continue into next year as the plan is to put some more engineering resources on cost reduction areas, as it's becoming apparent that certain markets just aren't going to pay full price for some of the features that we've come out with.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great, that's really helpful. And then one on TrueBeam. Could you comment on how the TrueBeam mix has trended in the developed markets, specifically over the last couple of quarters? And then that Montr\u00e9al order that you mentioned, you said it was several systems, I take that to mean 5 or 6. Am I off base there?","Timothy E. Guertin","So you're talking about orders and not sales?","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's right.","Timothy E. Guertin","Okay. The Montr\u00e9al system was -- I'm trying to remember, 5, something like that, 5 or 6. Boy, it's embarrassing that I don't know that number. And in the TrueBeams in Europe -- and you got to remember, we just -- only --  it wasn't very long ago, we got permission to sell TrueBeam in some of these countries like Japan and China and places like that. And so now, of course, we're seeing a marked rise in that business. I don't -- I can't calibrate it for you exactly at this moment to give you how many TrueBeams in these developing territories, but all I can tell you is, it's quite a bit more because last year, we were just getting started in these territories.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then on the U.S. in particular, given that there's more of a data to build the trend on?","Timothy E. Guertin","I think our take [ph] rate of TrueBeams in the United States is about what it was before.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla with Citi.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Elisha, a question for you. I mean, if I look at the guidance, you're taking the midpoint from your prior previous guidance down by about $0.15. And if you gross that up, that's about $20 million to $25 million of additional expense between now and the end of the year between the 3 points that you laid out: oncology, legal and Siemens start-up. Can you break that amount between the 3 of those categories and talk to us about how long going forward these added expenses are going to take place?","Elisha W. Finney","Sure, well, to give the 50,000-foot answer, Amit, is it's about 50-50 of that $0.15. But let me kind of give you the guidance walk, if you will, from where we are today versus where we were last quarter. The sales number in total is really not changing at about that 10% increase. However, what we're seeing is that the sales shift, we've got a lower, about $10 million sales coming across the board from our businesses, a little bit in oncology, a little bit in X-ray, little bit in Security, offset by $10 million of proton revenue carrying a 0 margin. So that alone has, call it, a $4 million impact. The gross margin, down about a little more than a point from what we had previously thought is largely due to oncology and all of the issues that we've mentioned. And then when I look at the operating expenses, that includes the risk charge, it includes Siemens start-up cost, we have a break-up penalty, we have training we're going to do, we're hiring people to support this agreement. We have some additional legal cost over some of the losses that you're aware of, as well as the acquisition of InfiMed, which is increasing the SG&A cost as well. It's dilutive to the bottom line, but it is increasing SG&A. A lot of that is in offset in the tax rates so that you get to your Delta that you mentioned of the $0.15 to $0.16.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So let me understand. I mean, you guys have been pursuing an overseas strategy because that really is where a lot of the growth in the market is coming from. Are we entering kind of a new normal for profitability for the company going forward?","Timothy E. Guertin","Well, I think that there is -- the strategy of the company dictates that more and more of our business over time is going to come from international. If that international mix comes from territories like Japan and certain countries in Europe, especially Northern Europe where the mix tends to be good, that's -- then that's great. If it's going to be coming more and more from BRIC countries, then we're going to see margins affected. So the consequence is what do you do when you know that you're going to go into territories where you're not going to have this favorable a mix as you've had in the past? Well, to some extent, that is going to impact gross margin. The way you deal with that is you do cost reductions, you try to add features that you think you will be appealing in those markets, you try to add new services that you think will be appealing in those markets, you try to build sales forces in those markets that can get proper value for what you're selling. And so it's a combination of new products and services and cost reductions in order to deal with this. Now, will this benefit the bottom line? Yes, over time, I think that this has a good effect on EBIT, and it has a good effect on EPS, but it will make gross margin more challenging in the future. I think we all knew this. I don't think anybody here expected 3 months ago that the effect would be this strong in 2012 for this. But in our long-term strategies we recognize that this was a situation we're going to have to cope with, and we're putting those plans into effect. So you'll see this speed of some of our plans and probably slow down some other things to try to make -- take this into account.","Elisha W. Finney","And I just do want to reiterate that if you exclude the proton revenue for the full fiscal year, the total company margin decline that we're talking about is about 1 point. We're still at 43% to 44% and it was small...","Timothy E. Guertin","Yes, the proton effect was pretty -- what was it, $50 million -- $60 million of proton sales with 0 margin? That was a real anchor on gross margin percentages. Now, ultimately, I think the Proton business is going to be great for the company. It won't be great at the gross margin level. It will be great at the EBIT and EPS level. So there's businesses like this that we think we have to get into, that it's appropriate for us to get into, that were going to give us a lot of revenue and are going to give us rapid EBIT, but temporarily, they're producing effects like this.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I apologize with the follow-up, but I really just need to understand, at the operating margin level, do you still feel comfortable that the company is in the low 20s, or is there the potential that the operating margin of the business can deteriorate further from where you are at this quarter?","Elisha W. Finney","Well, again, if you exclude the proton business, and there is some proton revenue in FY '11 in Q4 that has to come out as well as what we -- what -- the $60 million in FY '12. The RoS, once you pencil this out, is going to be about 21.5%, so it's still, I would say, low 20s. But we have, we've gone back, we've scrubbed. It's the best we can predict at this point based on all of the information that we have. But that's not saying what we're going to do going into next year. I can tell you that the biggest torque we're going to get on it going forward is that we can get this proton therapy business profitable as opposed to being significantly diluted that it is today.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone with Jefferies.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of housekeeping and then a little bit more on the margin and the North American trends in the quarter. The service revenue growth, I don't know if that was actually given in the prepared comments, and if it was then I apologize, but do you have that number handy?","Elisha W. Finney","It was in line with the overall Oncology growth rate in the quarter.","Timothy E. Guertin","Yes, it was pretty good.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. And then just on last quarter, Tim, you had mentioned, or Elisha, that a couple of orders in North America were delayed and you're expecting perhaps those to hit in this quarter or some of the following quarters. Did those orders hit this quarter, or are you still expecting that in the second half of the year?","Timothy E. Guertin","Yes, that's why you saw the nice 14% growth in North American orders for Oncology, because a number of them hit.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So if we go back, I think it was about 3 deals that slipped, and so all of those were booked this quarter. Or do you still expect...","Timothy E. Guertin","No, no, not all were booked. But some of the ones that I really wanted to hit in the first quarter hit in the second quarter, but it's never perfect like that.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Sure. And then I guess one on Siemens, on the collaboration. I don't know if it's clear at this point, but are you going to receive distribution fees on their MR and CT placements? And likewise on, conversely, the Siemens, is there any distribution fee that goes to them when they place a Varian linear accelerator?","Timothy E. Guertin","Yes and yes.","Dow R. Wilson","Yes. Just a little clarity on the former: We'll get a distribution fee when it goes into radiation oncology driver [ph], not in a radiology customer.","Timothy E. Guertin","Right.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","All right. So is part of that -- is it too early to suggest that part of that is already being reflected in the gross margin, or...","Timothy E. Guertin","Oh, no. We just signed this agreement yesterday...","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","But as we look in the guidance that you have for this year...","Timothy E. Guertin","No, there's -- the only effect this year is actually -- is preparatory. In the United States, we have a current arrangement that is going to take 6 months to expire. So this will have no effect in the U.S. which is, of course, where the bulk of our sales efforts were -- for -- and so we're -- there'll be no effect in the U.S. and we're just going to be in getting started mode in Europe, so -- and our revenue, it comes when those units are -- I mean, our -- any payments would come when those units are installed, which is not likely to be this year. So I suspect this is going to have a positive effect on 2013, but it has an, I don't know, like a $0.02 effect in -- a negative $0.02 wind in 2012.","Dow R. Wilson","Yes, the big win for us in this deal is we get connectivity between the Siemens installed base and our ARIA oncology information system. That's access that we have not had in the market before. Siemens customers have not been able to connect to the ARIA installed base, so we are very encouraged about that connectivity. And that's where the real driver both from a top line and a margin perspective are going to be for us in the long term with this relationship.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So last one for me and I'll get back in queue. So just to clarify, the entire Siemens base will eventually get ARIA as definitively. Or does the sales force have to go and offer up that option and then they have that option to add in ARIA? And then ultimately, how do you see this deal benefiting Varian as it relates to the newly freed up linear accelerators that are going to be on the market?","Dow R. Wilson","We do have to sell it. So it is -- there is -- Siemens customers either have no information system or something called LANTIS, which was a joint venture between Elekta and Siemens. And as they upgrade -- especially in multi-Linac departments, as they upgrade, they want new information systems. LANTIS is quite old. They need new functionality especially for managing imaging and new advanced features, so they have to upgrade. We've really not been able to participate in that market historically. That's what this opens up for customers, and we're very excited about that.","Elisha W. Finney","Of course, our global footprint and bundling of orders when it's -- it's bundled with diagnostic imaging.","Dow R. Wilson","They have 2,000, around 2,000 machines in their installed base. Most of those customers are -- those customers have years to replace those machines. But generally, when a company exits under these circumstances, a fair number of customers will try to replace those machines faster than they otherwise would. So if they try to replace those machines faster than they otherwise would and we can now interface with Siemens' machines that remain in the department and we have the cooperation of Siemens sales and management team in these situations especially at those hospitals where hospitals that favored Siemens diagnostic equipment, it gives us an edge that we just simply did not have before. So we are very pleased about that.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Sean Lavin with Lazard.","Sean D. Lavin - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Congratulations on a nice quarter and the Siemens agreement.","Dow R. Wilson","Thank you.","Sean D. Lavin - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask about Siemens. On one hand now, you're going to be working with them, but at the same time, we know some hospitals may be walking away from their backlog. How do you compete for those machines and also juggle partnership?","Dow R. Wilson","I guess my view of it, Sean, is Siemens has just signaled who their preferred partner is, yes. We got to go compete on it. It's not a done deal per se, but...","Sean D. Lavin - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","So they don't mind you stepping in there with kind of past orders of theirs?","Dow R. Wilson","Well, on their backlog, they clearly liked to deliver their backlog. I'm sure, if you were to call them and ask them to deliver their -- what their backlog position is, they'd still love to deliver their backlog. But if they have a customer that wants to get out of their backlog's position, we'd certainly have a shot at it. And this is really -- I think our perspective is, as Tim said before, there's 2,000 units out there. Their backlog is actually not that big and we -- we're -- our interest is competing on those 2,000 machines and making sure that we've got the best alternative for those customers.","Sean D. Lavin - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And then as you talk about software for those 2,000 potential machines, what kind of revenue would upgrading a machine kind of entail?","Dow R. Wilson","Well, that's, of course -- the biggest piece is the machine trade-out and that would be depending on the configuration sold anywhere between $1.8 million and $3 million for the machine itself. And then the software, you have the software cost depending on the configuration of what's there. It could be anywhere between $75,000 and a couple hundred thousand dollars, depending on the configuration. And then of course, there's treatment planning in play as well as service tail that is very profitable.  So it's -- over time, it's a very interesting opportunity for us.","Timothy E. Guertin","There's another element here too, which is that right now the impact piece, the piece that was sold by Siemens, is a software under license to Elekta. If -- and so we want to see that replaced by ARIA because right now whenever we add a new machine, Elekta gets a certain amount of money to that new machine. And this way, revenue comes to us instead of Elekta when Varian gets the machine, and I think that's nice to see.","Sean D. Lavin - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Is this deal with Siemens exclusive such that they couldn't do something with Elekta?","Timothy E. Guertin","Well, they have commitments to Elekta that they have to fulfill under their existing agreement, but we are their preferred choice, going forward, for information systems and for linear accelerators.","Dow R. Wilson","This really levels, if not tilts the plane, the field in our favor. Before, this is access we did not have. We could not talk to these machines. It was a major weakness in our oncology information system strategy.","Sean D. Lavin - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And then my last one is on -- I guess, since Siemens has left the business and you're moving towards a duopoly, have you seen Elekta make any changes in their pricing strategy?","Timothy E. Guertin","I would -- I'm going to ask for more time to answer that question because the -- I only have one quarter's worth of information on this. But frankly, I don't think a duopoly has made Elekta any less of a discounter. If anything, it may have made them go the other way. I think Elekta is now seeing the possibility of more business and they want to get that more business, and they see the growth possibilities. So ordinarily, in a situation like this, you would hope for different behavior, but I think we're just going to get more of the same.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I apologize, I'm going to ask you one on Siemens as well. But I'm just trying to understand the thought process here: Was this out of kind of necessity or opportunity? In other words, Siemens has been an ineffective competitor for a long time. You know where their Linacs are. I understand you need the connectivity, but couldn't you do that through a software collaboration and not at the distribution component which is presumably going to be lower margin?","Dow R. Wilson","We think this is a huge opportunity. We've talked about the installed base. The other thing is Siemens' presence has been very good in international and emerging markets, so this is a very exciting opportunity for us globally. And it also helps us in that part of the market where there's good growth. And this installed base has some age to it. So we want every opportunity we can get to sell into that installed base.","Elisha W. Finney","And on the margin side, I -- just to be clear, in many instances, we're actually just replacing an existing distributor relationship with Siemens, so this is not dilutive to margins in that case, and clearly opens up a big white space for us to go after in terms of just a much bigger global footprint.","Timothy E. Guertin","And just dealing -- going back to the comment you made earlier: It was not possible to talk to Siemens machines without the cooperation of Siemens. They have to provide test facilities. They have to provide interface specifications and all of those specifications were kind of co-controlled by Elekta and Siemens and they were closed to us. So a lot of deals in Europe. This was not all that much of a problem in the United States, but it was a big problem for us in Europe because Dow and I would go to meetings in Europe and our salespeople would point out to us: \"Hey, we can't sell ARIA to this customer. We can't sell our RV system.\" And so our most advanced clinical capabilities that we might sell on our machine are not available to this customer, so it effectively enables -- you can sell this great machine and our customers can't fully use it. And so this was a very frustrating situation for us. And it required a partnership with Siemens to do it and that partnership was not possible until we created this arrangement. Also, Siemens is planning on improving these things. We have given Siemens information and feedback on how we'd like to see the new interfaces, designs. And they're very cooperative with us on this, so that's very good. And the last I want to point out, unless we lose track of it: Siemens is an incredibly advanced imaging company. And they would like to build stronger relationships with us in a variety of ways so all of -- we've only talked here about linear accelerators and interfaces and connectivity and selling information systems. The fact is, this is a wonderful imaging company and they have technologies that I think would be very useful to radiation oncology customers and they want to work with us in those areas. So I think that, although specifically we're not talking today about what those things might be, I think that there's great possibility for nice enhancements to product lines in the future.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then on the margins, Elisha, I think you had mentioned in your comments some of that was obviously geographic mix, but then you mentioned, I think, slower progress and some product cost programs. Can you just elaborate on that latter point? I mean, how much can you kind of control in the margins by working down manufacturing and input costs?","Elisha W. Finney","Well, again, this is just going to be something, Tycho, that we just constantly are going to start chipping away at. I mean, it's -- I mean, we're looking everything from freight to what can we do in terms of our purchasing and vendor pricing. I mean, we are -- it's an all-out program to just attack this $5,000 at a time until it gets to the point where it's significant. So I can't just point to one thing and say that's the magic bullet. Again, we're going to be increasing engineering resources in this area to specifically focus on how do we cost-reduce this product line.","Timothy E. Guertin","Yes. To give you an example: On freight alone, because of higher fuel cost, we've seen about a $0.02 -- I mean, excuse, a $0.01 impact to us this year just on fuel costs alone. And I'm not going to make the machines lighter so that we won't solve the problem that way, but it's an example of the kind of thing that's motivating us to look at everything we can. So we're -- we have projects that are underway. I would've liked them to come into play in the second half of the year, but I think we're going to see them come into effect later in this year and in 2013.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then last one, Tim or Dow. Do you want to just talk on dynamics in the freestanding market? I mean, you talked about some of those order delays from last quarter coming through. But just in general, how do we think about the underlying dynamics for freestanding clinics?","Dow R. Wilson","I'd say, in the quarter, we did see some life there, so that was a positive event in the quarter. I'm reluctant to point and say that's a trend, but we did see some life in the second quarter freestanding market.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So is that market back to growth, then, you think, for the year, or...","Dow R. Wilson","I -- Tycho, I'd be really reluctant to say in a one quarter a trend mix.","Timothy E. Guertin","And we're going to have to come back to you on that next quarter. We did have -- again, it was positive. We're going to just put a dot on the graph and we'll come back to you next quarter and connect the dots and tell you what we see.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And just, how about to elaborate one -- for one second, just the dynamics between freestanding centers and hospitals clinics? I mean, can you just talk on that, where we are in that process of hospitals kind of building out outreach clinics and then competing with the freestanding centers?","Dow R. Wilson","I think as we said last quarter, we're seeing that trend continue. Hospitals are strong. The strong are playing aggressively, especially. And we are seeing them do more community outreach than we've seen in the past. So I'd say that trend is maintaining.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Dalton Chandler with Needham & Company.","Dalton L. Chandler - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","You touched on this a little bit already, but you did cite pricing pressures as one of the issues driving down margins in the quarter. It sounded like it was specific to the emerging markets, but can you just elaborate on what you're seeing there?","Timothy E. Guertin","It's certain territories in the world. And yes, emerging markets tend to be those more than other places. I guess I'm not shocked that the BRIC countries and other countries would have this problem. I was just -- I think we continue to be struggling with strong competition with our few remaining competitors in terms of getting business in those countries. And this is a kind of a land grab here, everybody's going to fight it out, and that's what's going on. In addition, these people have more limited budgets than other people do. So part of what we're trying to do is to adapt what we offer and to the situation so that we can improve and get better margins than we're seeing on these deals, going forward. Some of that's going to be product changes and some of it's going to be just doing a better job of selling.","Dalton L. Chandler - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Would you say you're seeing stable pricing in the established markets?","Dow R. Wilson","We're definitely seeing stable pricing in North America. We are -- as Tim said earlier, we are seeing a little bit of richer product mix but stable pricing in North America for sure. And Japan, I'd say stable as well in that market.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Jason Wittes with Caris.","Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","A couple of follow-ups here. First of, I know you saw signs of life on the freestanding clinics in the U.S. Does that have any relation to slightly better optimism on the reimbursement front, or is that reading too much into it?","Dow R. Wilson","It think that's -- we would love to read that into it, but I don't think we can at this point.","Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Do you have a read, by the way, into that at this point?","Dow R. Wilson","No, no. It's still way too early.","Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of proton, I think you've increased it to $60 million in revs this year. I guess, first, that assumption is that's all coming from Scripps. That's not an additional project going online. Or how do I think about that?","Elisha W. Finney","No, it is -- it's about half is Scripps, roughly speaking, and the rest we're assuming that Saudi and\/or Russia. We will get the project started at which point revenue will start. So there's still some big assumptions in there, for Q4 in particular, but we would expect that at least one of those projects will start in this fiscal year.","Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","But the $10 million increase is basically half due to Scripps being ahead of schedule and half due to Saudi, is that right?","Elisha W. Finney","Roughly, roughly.","Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just a follow-up to that, and that would be: Are you still thinking about a 2-year installation time? Or are you a little bit more optimistic it might be a little quicker than that, given you're a little ahead of schedule at this point?","Elisha W. Finney","About 1.5 years...","Timothy E. Guertin","The building is 12 months. And so from groundbreaking, usually the building is about 12 months. And then we're...","Dow R. Wilson","[indiscernible] 1.5 years.","Timothy E. Guertin","And the machine is about a 1.5 years. And obviously, we're going to be trying everything we can to get that down.","Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. But that's a slight improvement over, I think, your initial 2-year assumption?","Timothy E. Guertin","Yes.","Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's good to hear. Also, obviously you can't speak for Elekta, but you can speak to your own strategy here. You're obviously making a pretty strong push into emerging markets. And it's not that you haven't been there in the past, but I don't think you've been as aggressive as you have this year. And obviously, it looks like early results are good, especially in Asia. So I guess my question is -- one, I know, Asia, you've done -- you've put a lot of focus in. Are there other areas where we should expect an increased focus from you? Number two, I assume you are being more aggressive in pricing than you have in the past, given you do kind of look at this as a land grab situation. And so I'd just be curious to get your thoughts on what's going on over there.","Dow R. Wilson","I'd say, in terms of focus, we're really looking at a number of theaters. It's not just Asia. Yes, Japan and China have been a focus for us, continue to be. That will not change, but Southeast Asia is -- we're growing there and adding resources and seeing more of a market. Middle East has been terrific for us the last 18 months, and there's always some lumpiness that goes with that market. These markets tend to be tender-driven large markets and so it's kind of comes and goes. But the overall trend is very positive in the Middle East. Brazil is a major focus for us, Turkey, Eastern Europe. So those are, just kind of going around the board, those are some of the places that we're playing. Northern Africa, actually, there's some action in Northern Africa, which we typically haven't had them on the list but that looks very, very good for us. I'd say that pricing environment in -- it depends in each country. So I mean, Elisha and Tim talked about the geographic mix hitting us pretty hard this quarter as we do have some different pricing largely driven by what feature sets that people want and whether especially they want to pay the premiums for stereotactic radiosurgery and some of the advanced capabilities that we have on the machines. So those tend to be the markets that are a little bit more aggressive where folks maybe don't value those -- they're not doing those capabilities.","Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Right. But also just based on comments you guys have made in the past, I know in Asia you've set up some training facilities. I don't know, have you done similar -- have you set up similar training facilities in other regions? I mean, it seems as if that was a big success at least very early on, seeing it.","Dow R. Wilson","We have training facilities in Japan, China and India, and we are looking at adding incremental training facilities as part of this theater strategy that I briefly mentioned. And Brazil will be a major focus of that where we're very committed to the Brazilian market. We haven't put that training facility in yet, but we're committed to it and see a big education capability growing in Brazil, as well as probably the development of some local manufacturing capability in Brazil.","Timothy E. Guertin","We see Brazil and other parts of Latin America as just beginning large -- well, Brazil is well advanced along this growth, but other countries are beginning a big potential growth spurt. And they're going to want more radiation therapy equipment. And so this is a big opportunity. So our -- the things that we're looking at in Brazil are an example of what we're going to have to do a lot of in Latin America over the next few years.","Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","One last question, then I'll get off -- jump off, For proton, you had 2 orders basically materialize this quarter, which were not expected. I believe you still at this point -- if you -- you have about 3 in the wings. And how do we think about it in terms of the pipeline of potential products? And what's a good expectation for what we should expect to see on an annual basis for proton orders right now in the first couple of years?","Timothy E. Guertin","Well, I am hoping to get -- I would love to get 3 to 4 deals a year. And what will those deals be? I think that we might be able to see 100 -- less -- somewhat approaching $200 million in business per year in this, not counting services. And of course, once the centers are up, we'll get additional service revenue over that. Long term, I'm aiming for $250 million a year.","Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, but $200 million seems like a pretty reasonable bogey.","Timothy E. Guertin","Yes, I think it is.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Tim, just a couple more questions on the pricing comments, the margin outlook  that you've put out there. Is there any change going on in the orders that are in backlog? I mean, typically, your backlog visibility is very high. I'd be surprised 2 quarters in, that you have -- all of a sudden you're hit over the head with this geographic mix issue. You hadn't realized that some of these margin pressures were going to hit. So it's my sense that this might be kind of a book-and-ship order kind of thing, just some of the orders that are coming in right now that you still expect to translate to the P&L later this year are the ones that are coming in at -- with some of the pricing pressure or maybe the less rich feature set.","Timothy E. Guertin","Yes. I -- our ouija board has been pretty good for 13 years on this stuff, but I will say that forecasting is a complex task around here that takes a lot of effort. Book-and-ship clearly is one aspect of what has happened to us as, in the second quarter as we look at our book-and-ships, certainly that has an effect. Our mix by territory matters, the pricing and competitive behavior, the delivery timing. Every time we go through backlog, I can tell you, when we go through backlog at the beginning of a quarter and then look at what actually shipped in that quarter, 90 days later it's often quite different than what we expected. Product cost and the cost of accessories, depending upon where they came from and we use a lot of expensive materials to build these machines so that can have an effect: the locally supplied vendor parts that we have to get, and those parts can vary by where we are. And then there's turnkey activity in some of these deals and then there's deal packages. There's what all they want, as part of the deal, and then to top it all off, there's currency effects. So when you roll all of these together, I would say that our models have worked well for us, but it is clear that short-term effects, going forward, are having a stronger effect than we've seen them have before. And so we're going to do our very best to analyze things and keep you up to date on that. But the nice thing now is we're halfway through this year, and at least for this year, the backlog picture is clarifying, and that makes us feel better about our forecast for this year, although there's still some variation, which we've shown you in the way we've constructed our guidance, and -- but we're going to have to get into October before we really know what next year looks like.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","All right. Let me ask one follow-up there and then I have one modeling question for Elisha. But you've been a staunch advocate, I think, over the last few years that you're just not going to sell on price, that you're going to sell on features, and if others want to sell on price, so be it. But it sounds like that has changed a little bit. What in your mind has -- I'm assuming some of these discounts filter all the way up to your level. Where -- what has changed in your mind to sign off on some of these discounts?","Timothy E. Guertin","Well, I think what happens is -- and I will admit that I try not to keep every piece of paper in the company from coming to my office. But I would say that, if you're talking to a customer who has $2 million and he wants to buy $2.5 million worth of stuff, he's not going to get everything he wants. But -- and then competitors are going to come in and so there's going to be -- it's going to be a difficult conversation. And so that's when deals get complicated. It's -- so I would say, a combination of budget limitations and just competitive pressures, especially in these countries where all of us want to take higher share. At least now, we're down to 2 companies or 2.5 companies that want higher share, and so we're going to try and get that any way we can. But you're right: I am going to push for higher prices. Mr. Wilson is going to higher -- push for higher prices. Ms. Finney is going to push for higher prices. And we have ways to do that, that I probably shouldn't go into too much more detail on in this call.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then, Elisha, just the modeling question. So it looks like you're trimming the guidance range by maybe $0.15 or $0.16 or so, and obviously, $0.02 of that was the restructuring this quarter. I think you explained well that $0.01 or $0.02 may be the lower oncology revenue is offset by the higher proton revenues. I think Tim made a comment that the Siemens relationship is maybe $0.02 or so. The last couple of buckets I just can't fill in is the litigation side.","Timothy E. Guertin","Litigation is about $0.02.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Litigation is about $0.02. Is there -- in that litigation -- I'm assuming that's the UPMC. Is there any presumed royalties on RPM or Trilogy clinic sales or anything that you're now starting to kind of assume in there?","Elisha W. Finney","No. We're assuming we're going to fight this.","Timothy E. Guertin","We're assuming ultimate victory in it. And I want to make it clear: it's the University of Pittsburgh, not UPMC. We're not in a battle with UPMC. They're a customer. The University of Pittsburgh is the university.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Right, yes. No, that's fair. So that's $0.08 there, and so the rest of the bucket is just kind of this lower margin and pricing issue.","Timothy E. Guertin","Yes.","Spencer R.

Participating in this call are Tim Guertin, President and CEO; Elisha Finney, CFO; Dow Wilson, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Tai Chen, our Corporate Controller. Tim is on travel and participating remotely. Tim and Elisha will summarize our results and will take your questions following the presentation. ","To simplify our discussions, unless otherwise stated, all references to the quarter or year are fiscal quarters and fiscal years, quarterly comparisons over the first quarter of fiscal 2012 versus the first quarter of fiscal 2011. All results are for continuing operations, which exclude the sale of research and in proportion of ACCEL.

We assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements in this presentation and discussion because of new information, future events or otherwise. ","And now, here is Tim.","Timothy E. Guertin","Good afternoon, and welcome. Today, we are reporting results for fiscal 2012 first quarter with revenue and earnings in line or ahead of our expectations, but net orders challenges in all of our businesses. ","To summarize our results, revenues for the quarter rose by 8% to $625 million. Our gross margin dropped by 3% as anticipated due to a tough year-ago comparison, product mix and the Scripps Proton revenue recognition, which had 0 margin. ","Net earnings were $0.79 per diluted share, down 1% from the year-ago quarter, but well ahead of our guidance for the quarter. Our quarter ending backlog, including the Proton business, expanded by 14% to $2.5 billion. I\u2019ll focus now on orders and operations in each of our businesses. ","Oncology Systems' first quarter net orders totaled $485 million, up 6%, with a 22% increase in the overall international regions that more than offset an 11% decline in North America. This is in stark contrast to the year-ago quarter, which had a 20% increase in North America and a 6% decline in international markets versus the first quarter of fiscal 2010. ","Compared to the first quarter last year, net orders rose 27% in the Far East driven by gains in China, Thailand and Malaysia, as well as in Japan where we have just announced the establishment of a new training and education center. I believe we've gained market share in this region, and we continue to see a healthy pipeline of potential business in China where we're [indiscernible] from a larger and revitalized sales force. ","In Europe, net orders increased 18% with the help of key wins in Sweden, The Ukraine, Turkey, The Netherlands, Egypt, Finland and Russia. Net orders in the rest of the world, including Latin America and Australia, grew 37% versus the year-ago period. Growth in Latin America was led by Argentina, Chile and Brazil where we have won all 3 of the last public tenders. New technology, a broader product line, unmatched service capability and new educational programs have enabled us to strengthen our position in all international regions. ","In North America, which comprised 42% of the net orders for the quarter, we were impacted by several order push outs. We fully expect that we will book these orders in this fiscal year. While the sales funnel for this region looks healthy for our hospital customers, we're seeing some continued reimbursement uncertainty and slow purchasing activity among freestanding clinics. ","On a global basis, the number of accelerators ordered in the quarter was up from the year-ago quarter driven by strong demand in international markets for both low- and high-energy accelerators, including our TrueBeam platform for radiotherapy and radiosurgery. The take rate for TrueBeam almost doubled in Europe, showing that it is gaining traction as a product with a broad clinical appeal and a driver for future growth in all parts of the world. ","TrueBeam continued to comprise about 40% of our high-energy accelerator orders in the quarter despite the order push outs in North America, which has been the strongest market for this product. Since TrueBeam was introduced in 2010, we have now booked some 425 orders for the platform and we now have about 100 installations complete or in progress. ","The strength of our international business during the quarter also resulted in strong orders for our UNIQUE accelerator, which is a cost-competitive, low-energy system capable of delivering image-guided RapidArc IMRT. Customer demand for our other radiosurgical systems, including the Trilogy and Novalis Tx platforms was also up during the quarter. Demand for the onboard imager upgrades and RapidArc products rose during the quarter as more clinics position themselves with the technology needed to meet the new standards for delivering efficient image-guided treatments. ","Our service business grew strongly, expanded by about 15% versus the year-ago quarter. Given the varying methods for reporting orders and acquisitions by our competition, objective measures of market share are different  -- excuse me, difficult, our analysis of the quarter shows that we held our own in North America while gaining share of the available accelerator business in emerging markets. This bodes well for our future growth as emerging markets become a more important driver of global growth. ","There's been a lot of discussion in the market about Siemens exiting the accelerator business. And while it represents a growth opportunity for the rest of us, it's too early for anyone to claim that Siemens' decision has resulted in additional business for them. A typical sales cycle is about a year long. That said, Varian has been selected to replace more than 50 Siemens units within the last fiscal year and of course, of serving the normal replacement market and we're now pursuing additional opportunities. ","We saw continued progress  --  excuse me, continued clinical progress in the fight against cancer during the quarter. As an example, clinicians at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the Humanitas clinic in Milan, Italy, showed a fast-dose delivery using high-intensity mode on TrueBeam, makes it possible to deliver radiosurgery in a normal radiotherapy time slot. This unmatched capability is designed to reduce the extent of tumor motion during treatment, as well as patient time on the table. This should also help to lower the clinic's cost per treatment. ","Clinicians at the Palo Alto Medical Foundation have noted that they've been able to use RapidArc for stereotactic radiosurgery on brain lesions greater than 7 millimeters in diameter in addition to performing radiosurgery on smaller lesions. It's great to see that this radiosurgical capability could give clinics more options for treating large lesions. ","Clinicians at the Humanitas clinic in Milan also showed that our new Acuros XB  algorithm is capable of calculating highly accurate RapidArc treatment plans for stereotactic surgery. This should help streamline clinical workflow while maintaining excellent treatment planning precision. ","Finally, we're encouraged by an increasing number of physician-related clinical studies on using stereotactic radiosurgical techniques. Studies like these will encourage others to continue exploring and developing regular surgical techniques, and all of these studies support continued use of Varian technology in the fight against cancer and our mission to save another 100,000 lives every year. ","Our X-ray Products business had an uncharacteristically weak quarter for both tube and panel products. Net orders were $110 million, down 2% from the year-ago period, and revenues rose 1% to $113 million. The principal cause of weak revenue growth was soft demand in Japan, where several customers appeared to be adjusting inventory levels to be more in line with their normal imaging equipment production rates. We believe this is a delayed reaction to the recovery efforts from last year's earthquake and tsunami, and we are expecting that our business will return to more normal growth rates as the fiscal year progresses. ","While there was weakness in demand during the quarter, there were some bright spots, including strong customer interest in the new products that we will bring to market later in the year. Several large customers are currently working on integrating new products such as our wireless radiographic panel, our mammal panel and our new cone beam panel into their next-generation products. We also expect growth in X-ray tubes later in the year as we ramp up production of a new high-tier replacement CT tube that was recently exhibited at the RSNA meeting in Chicago. ","Switching now to our Other category. Combined net orders were $12 million for the quarter, down $10 million from year-ago quarter. Demand for our security products was soft compared to the year-ago quarter when we received a large order for border screening products. ","In our Particle Therapy business, we continue to make good progress for the installation of our ProBeam system at the Scripps Proton Center in San Diego. Subsequent to the close of the quarter, we signed a contract and booked an order from the Saudi Particle Therapy Center to supply the King Fahd Medical Center in Saudi Arabia with a $77 million system for a proton center in Riyadh. This facility, which will be the first in this region, will include our ProBeam system for 5 treatment rooms, as well as 2 of our TrueBeams. Equipment installation is expected to commence in 2013. This agreement will also include a multiyear service contract that should commence as the installation is completed. ","We believe that more and more proton centers will want to employ the full suite of Varian products and technology for radiotherapy and radiosurgery, as well as particle therapy for world-class cancer treatments. The combination of these technologies based on 60 years of innovation plus Varian -- puts Varian in a unique position to help advance clinical care for patients around the world. ","As a reminder, Varian is also been selected to provide equipment for their new proton centers at the University of Maryland and in Mestre, Italy, where a new center is planned to open in 2015. Furthermore, we've been identified as the preferred provider for a new center at Emory University, which just received its Certificate of Need. We are continuing discussions with several other groups who are planning to build proton centers. ","And now here's Elisha to cover the financials.","Elisha W. Finney","Right. Thanks, Tim, and hello, everyone. While Tim has already covered net orders, I want to briefly talk about the constant currency growth rates for the quarter. In comparing quarter-over-quarter exchange rates, the euro was pretty stable and the yen was slightly stronger, so the FX impact in the quarter was minimal. ","Oncology grew net orders by 6% in dollars or 5% in constant currency. Oncology's European net orders growth rate was 18% both in dollars and in constant currency, and the Far East was up 27% in dollars and 23% in constant currency. ","First quarter revenues increased 8% to $625 million with constant currency growth of 7%. Oncology Systems posted an 8% increase in revenues. X-ray Products posted a gain of 1%, and revenues from businesses under the Other category increased by $9 million or 56%, including nearly $9 million of revenue for the Scripps Proton Therapy contract. ","The first quarter gross margin for the company fell as expected from the year-ago record quarter by 3 points to 43%. Oncology Systems' gross margin declined by 2 points to 45% due primarily to a product mix shift. X-ray Products' gross margin also declined about 2 points to 40%, primarily due to a mix shift to lower margin products within our line of X-ray tubes. ","The gross margin for the Other business and the total company was negatively impacted by the Scripps contract, under which revenue was being recorded using the percentage of completion method. Under this method, revenues are initially recognized equal to cost with the expectation that profits will be recognized towards the end of the project. The Scripps contract negatively impacted the company's first quarter gross margin by 60 basis points. ","First quarter SG&A expenses were $96 million or 15% of revenues, down slightly as a percentage of revenues from the year-ago quarter. First quarter R&D expenses were $44 million or 7% of revenues, up slightly as a percentage of revenue from the year-ago quarter. First quarter operating earnings as expected fell 6% to $129 million or 21% of revenues. Depreciation and amortization totaled $14 million for the quarter. ","The effective tax rate was 30.2% for the quarter, up slightly from the year-ago period when we benefited from a reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. The tax rate for the first quarter of this year is lower than expected due to a change in Japanese tax law. For the fiscal year, we expect that the tax rate will be about 30%. Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased from the year-ago quarter to $114 million due mainly to our previously announced share repurchase programs. Diluted earnings per share fell by $0.01 to $0.79. ","Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $606 million, debt of $188 million and stockholder\u2019s equity of $1.4 billion. DSO increased from an unusually low year-ago quarter to 86 days, including a 4-day impact from the Particle Therapy business. First quarter cash flow from operations was $53 million with increases in inventory as well as somewhat slower collections on accounts receivables. Primary uses of cash were $10 million for the purchase of Calypso and $8 million for CapEx. ","Now I'll turn it back to Tim for the outlook.","Timothy E. Guertin","Thanks, Elisha. We remain confident in our growth outlook for fiscal 2012 and expect our businesses to strengthen as the year progresses, with annual revenues growing by about 10% and earnings per diluted share rising by about 15%. ","For the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we believe that revenues could increase by about 8% over the second quarter of fiscal 2011 total and that net earnings per diluted share could rise by 12% to 13%. This brings us in at about the midpoint of our previous guidance for the year and it reflects the softness in the Japanese imaging equipment market, as well as our push outs in the North American Oncology business. ","Thank you for your attention, and we're now ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Jason Wittes of Caris.","Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","I have a couple of questions. First off, the way you characterize push outs from oncology orders, is that something that you -- is not necessarily next quarter but sometime this year? Is that the right way to think about it? And was there a specific reason surrounding why there would be a delay in those orders other than traditional capital equipment cycles?","Timothy E. Guertin","This is Tim. I'd just say that when you see larger -- when we talk about push outs, obviously we're talking about orders of some size. And when an order of some size moves, sometimes it just moves a short distance and sometimes it can move a quarter or 2 and that's generally the case.","Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So basically it's a big order but hard to say whether it's this quarter or the following but sometime this year\u2026","Timothy E. Guertin","Yes. I would be reluctant to say at this point when it will happen. It's just -- you make forecast based on what you know at the beginning of the quarter and your customers sometimes change their plans.","Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Understood. And also on X-ray orders, I understand what you said about Japan. How much visibility do you have in terms of when this sort of inventory levels normalize and you can get back to your normalized growth rate there?","Timothy E. Guertin","Well, let me comment first, and then Dow, I'll see if you have anything to add. We constantly get information from our suppliers. We have some sense of what their inventory levels are. When this has happened in the past, it's generally persisted 1 or 2 quarters. Dow, do you have any additional insight on this?","Dow R. Wilson","No. And I think that's -- we do have some visibility into their inventory levels. We've seen this kind of call down before, not recently for sure. But we think of what we're seeing is really kind of a rebalancing from some of the activities that happened in Japan last year with the earthquake and tsunami.","Elisha W. Finney","Yes. And we see this about every 3 to 4 years. It's just the nature of the beast of being a component supplier. I would just tell you that once you pencil out the guidance, Q2 is probably going to be in the high single-digit growth rate for X-ray and with double digit returning in the second half of this year.","Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And by the way, if I split out Japan, what would the order rate look like? Is that something    a figure you could give us?","Dow R. Wilson","Not something that we looked at.","Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just want to quickly ask about Particle Therapy as well. My understanding is -- and you guys have been pretty open about business. There's a fair amount of dilution resulting each year as a result of doing the R&D to get your Particle Therapy business up to speed. I assume that's somewhere around 10% to 15%, but I also heard that you guys thought with your first real installation going forward it could get a little bit higher. Is that still the way you perceive it?","Elisha W. Finney","No, Jason. It's closer to about 5% of the total year EPS estimate.","Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","I meant $0.10 to $0.15 not 5...","Elisha W. Finney","That is correct. Yes, not 15%, yes.","Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Sorry. And the new order, the order that you just put in for Saudi Arabia, that's a net orders. But it sounds like that won't really actually  -- there won't be any revenue recognition till next year, and when that happens, I think we can assume that it's going to be neutral to earnings based on how you account for it. Is that correct\u2026","Elisha W. Finney","Well, we're still analyzing the contract in gory detail at this point to really lock in the revenue recognition. You can assume it will be under project accounting, and really the revenue can start when the project starts. So we have not started the project specific to this deal at this point. So in fact, I am assuming that there will be some revenue in this fiscal year. For the total year, as we mentioned last quarter, this is between $50 million and $55 million of proton revenue. And yes, it will be at, if not 0, very low margin for the first couple of transactions.","Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","But that $50 million to $55 million does include -- would it -- did anticipate something like the Saudi Arabia order? Is that...","Elisha W. Finney","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla of Citi.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Question -- I want to start with on North America oncology. In general, it's unusual to see your book to bill fall below 1, and you are saying that you're expecting orders to come back. But can you talk specifically about freestanding clinics? I know you mentioned in your prepared comments, and it does sound like freestanding clinics have taken kind of a permanent step down. So why do you think that there's going to be kind of a bounce back? And how do you think freestanding clinics play into the North America outlook?","Dow R. Wilson","I would say that our overall funnel looks pretty good, so let's just start with that. That would include hospital business and the freestanding clinic business. We are seeing strength in the hospital segment, so that's encouraging to us. In the freestanding market, it is down. I think there is still some residual concern about reimbursements and also some concern about raising capital. So that's what we're seeing out there. I'd say our volumes in that segment have been light 2 quarters in a row.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So the bounce back you're expecting has kind of nothing to do with freestanding clinics, is that fair?","Dow R. Wilson","We do see  -- as I said, our funnel looks very good. It is mostly a hospital market funnel. There is some reimbursement maybe in February. We get this reimbursement decision made and maybe that takes some away -- some of the uncertainty away in the freestanding market. But really what we're seeing is a hospital market rebound.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And the second thing here, just to clarify on proton. Last quarter, when you, Elisha, you talked about $50 million to $55 million. About $20 million of that was coming from Scripps and $30 million was coming from Maryland. But now you're saying that, that also includes Saudi Arabia. So did some of the Maryland revenue fallout?","Elisha W. Finney","It's all depends on when we began a project as to when the revenue and the cost began. And so when the $30 million was basically just order number 2 regardless if it was Maryland or Saudi, and Saudi is kind of first in at this point. So a combination of what we see right now gets us to about $50 million to $55 million for the year.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So Maryland  -- you say order number 2. So order number 2 is Saudi, and that the means...","Elisha W. Finney","Correct.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Maryland is not necessarily as  -- you're not assuming Maryland right now?","Elisha W. Finney","Well, we are -- I mean, we firmly believe we will be booking the Maryland deal as soon as the financing is complete. And so there is a contingency, and so we have not booked it even though we have announced and they are out raising funds as we speak.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And is there any assumption that you have full year guidance for Siemens contribution?","Spencer R. Sias","Amit, again, and to all of you, please limit yourself to one question so we give everybody a shot at participating in this call. Much appreciated.","Timothy E. Guertin","But I'll answer the question. Siemens we've always been able -- I mentioned in the conference call that we've been able to take some business from Siemens from their installed base, and we would expect that other customers will be looking at who are in Siemens' backlog will be looking at making decisions. But what you have to remember is Siemens was strongest in China and Eastern Europe and a number of countries like that, and so some of those locations may take a little while to make their changes. And so I wouldn't expect anything over time immediately, but we'll expect an effect over time.","Dow R. Wilson","Maybe just a little more color. We do believe that they represented about 8% of the market, so it does represent an 8% market opportunity for us. To Tim's point, that is global market opportunity. We think it's probably a little too early to impact anybody's current orders whether ourselves or anybody else. And as Tim mentioned in the conference call, we did last year win more than 50 Siemens sockets. So we've already seen to some degree that installed base moving over to us, and we're encouraged at looking at additional replacement opportunities in fiscal 2012.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Roman of Goldman Sachs.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Could you give us just an update on -- I think you said there are about 110 TrueBeams installed as of this quarter and 425 orders booked. If -- I don't think you gave those numbers last quarter, but I believe 2 quarters ago you said there were around 100 installs complete or pending. What's happening on the conversion rate? And is that -- are those numbers in fact slowing?","Timothy E. Guertin","David, it was 175.","Elisha W. Finney","175.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. Sorry. So I misheard that. So there's -- order installations continue to track basically one to one?","Timothy E. Guertin","Yes, we're doing fine.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then any impact on [indiscernible] -- follow-up question was around order cancellations, whether you were seeing anything to that effect. Philips they'd talked about that in their profit warning, and they had cited some markets in Western Europe as well. They weren't that specific, but they did talk about a slowing rate of conversion from backlog to order. So just wondering if you're seeing anything similar to that across any of your franchises?","Dow R. Wilson","Nothing outside of historical basis, no.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Feffer of Cantor Fitzgerald.","Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","I just wanted to come back to Siemens very quickly. You mentioned 50 units that you've replaced in the last few years of theirs. Was that prior to their announcement or is that since?","Dow R. Wilson","That would have been 50 orders, I'd say 90% prior to their -- that was our fiscal year, that was our fiscal year '11. So...","Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then just...","Dow R. Wilson","We we've got announcement just after the fiscal year or so, yes.","Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Right. Okay. And then just quickly back to the North America. I think this quarter you said about 40% of these high-energy orders were TrueBeam. Last quarter, it was 70%. Can I then assume that most of these order delays, are these all TrueBeam orders?","Dow R. Wilson","The 40% is the global number, and that's consistent with our historical performance. North America is much, much higher than that.","Elisha W. Finney","Which we were actually thrilled to maintain a 40% take rate on TrueBeam given that virtually all of the orders growth came outside of North America, and we saw Europe basically double -- almost double their take rate. So to maintain 40% with the North American market down was very good.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vivian Cervantes, Kaufman Bros.","Vivian Cervantes - Kaufman Bros., L.P., Research Division","Switching back to X-rays. I appreciate your comment that you've got some visibility into customer inventory levels. Having said that, did you get a sense that maybe production is back in order, in which case there's going to be normal usage and therefore expectations for a return to ordering is in line with what you were expecting?","Dow R. Wilson","We think it was just an overstocking and rebalancing of their inventory. So as Elisha mentioned, it's probably going to be a second half bump for us where we see the run-up, and we've got a very good product pipeline as well for the second half, including new replacement tubes for CT, some new filmless imaging X-ray tubes and then a number of new products in our panel business as well. So we're encouraged about the new product list we can get in the second half.","Vivian Cervantes - Kaufman Bros., L.P., Research Division","Understood. So there's -- I guess I'm thinking rolling blackouts, things of that nature, manufacturing disruption, you're not seeing or hearing anything of that kind?","Dow R. Wilson","That was kind of last year's news, and what we're really hearing is about a rebalancing of their overall inventory.","Vivian Cervantes - Kaufman Bros., L.P., Research Division","All right. That's helpful. And if I may just sneak in one more. Smart Segmentation received FDA clearance recently. Can you provide us with some feedback on how that's being taken in the marketplace?","Dow R. Wilson","Smart Segmentation will really be viewed as a very positive productivity and effectiveness play for our customers. I'd be very encouraged about the ability to do treatment planning faster and the ability to contour quickly, get recommendations and make their treatment planning decisions much, much faster and achieve really outstanding treatment planning. So the initial reception has been excellent on Smart Segmentation.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just wondering if you can talk to the sustainability of the trends you're seeing in Europe. I mean I know some of what you saw this quarter was again some easier comp, but you obviously had high teens, low 20s order growth the last two quarters there. So just talk about the sustainability of some of those order trends in Europe.","Dow R. Wilson","I think -- let me cast it overall. I think it really points to the -- we didn't have a great quarter in North America and yet we delivered 6% growth overall and it talks to the great balance that we have globally right now. We had a terrific quarter in Asia, we had a very solid quarter in Europe and Australia and Latin America and we had a bad quarter in U.S. If we can pull the U.S. up, we're going to rebalance this just fine. With Southern Europe, we saw some softness already last year. We don't see that improving right away. Tim, would you like to add anything else there?","Timothy E. Guertin","No. I think you've covered the waterfront.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then just to follow up on the U.S. comment, how contained were the delays or push outs? I'm just trying to get a sense as to whether these were a few larger centers and mainly on the TrueBeam side. Or can you just give us a sense of how widespread the push outs were?","Timothy E. Guertin","Dow, why don't you take that?","Dow R. Wilson","I'd say it was concentrated really in 2 or 3 big sites and the high end of our product line, so TrueBeam and maybe a few Trilogy and other high-energy systems.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone of Jefferies.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just to -- one on -- just to say on actually oncology service revenue. I don't know if I'm doing the math correctly here, but based on my math, it grew a little bit over 7% this quarter and that's down from last year's growth rate. It's been decelerating for a few quarters. Is that just the result of the light bookings in North America over the past few quarters? Or is there something else going on there, perhaps lower ASPs on new contracts? And then one follow-up on the North American orders. So it sounds like it was a hospital customer. Is there any look into actually why they pulled back? Was it a function of credit accessibility budget concerns or similar reimbursement concerns that some of the freestanding clinics had?","Elisha W. Finney","So Anthony, let me take the service question. I'm not positive where your math is coming from, but our service on revenue was up in the mid-teens and the net orders was in the high teens. So we had a fantastic quarter in our service business.","Timothy E. Guertin","On the delays, it's none of the above. It's just internal processes.","Elisha W. Finney","Signatures.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson of Robert Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Dow, I want to go back to a point you made where you talked about Siemens accounting for about 8% of the market and that you've been taking about 50 orders a year from them. What's your sources? Or how do you guys break down how many, maybe, Siemens linear accelerators are coming up for bid each year? My sense is that number is around 200, but that you and some of the others are already taking maybe 100 of those combined each year. So how big is that kind of incremental opportunity of Linacs that you're not already taking share from?","Dow R. Wilson","We think that their overall market share has been 8%. I don't know that our science is as accurate as yours is, Jeff. But I think your number of about 100 systems sounds pretty good.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So that would be 100 systems maybe that you haven't and nobody else has been taking, that they've been kind of rebooking each year, even though maybe 200 of their systems are coming up for bid each year. Is that fair?","Dow R. Wilson","Yes, and I think it's -- it'll be interesting to see how it evolved a little bit. I would say they've had some markets historically where they've done very well, but they've also been the low-priced guy in those markets. So I think that will be kind of interesting. China, they've done well; some other Eastern Europe markets where -- Middle East markets where they've done well. And in the U.S., they tend to do well in the enterprise accounts where they're providing all the diagnostic imaging and IT. So I think those will be the markets where it opens up.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","All right. And just a follow-up question for Elisha, some housekeeping here. Just what was the Calypso contribution in revenue this quarter? And can you remind me last quarter what you were guiding to for tax rate? I know this year -- or this quarter you took that to 30% I think, if I go back to my notes. But just what was it last quarter implied in your guidance?","Elisha W. Finney","We -- I said 30% to 31%. So it's about a 50 basis point improvement for the Japanese tax law.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And Calypso revenue?","Elisha W. Finney","Well, look. I don't want to get into breaking out revenue. I can tell you it was pretty much in line with our expectation. It was low, it's under $5 million and that's exactly what we expected because again, Varian's distribution channel, we are going to sell more through bundling. And so the revenue is going to follow a year later.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Junaid Husain of Dougherty & Company.","Junaid Husain - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division","Tim, just one question for you. I know that over the past couple of quarters, you've been spending a good deal more time on business development. You pulled the trigger on at least one small deal. Are you still spending about that same amount of time on business development?","Timothy E. Guertin","I've got Dow in the COO job now, and so he's doing a lot of things for me that's given me more time. So I'm kind of wondering around the building looking for work, and so I'm spending more time on business development, yes. Whether you should read anything into that in terms of its implications, I probably not. It's just I have more time to spend on it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","One housekeeping item, Elisha. Was there any impact of currency movement on earnings in the quarter or the outlook for the year?","Elisha W. Finney","Well, we would prefer a weak dollar obviously and it's not moving in the right direction. So what happens is we are pretty naturally hedged. It's never perfect, so there is a little bit of impact. I don't have an exact number for you. But obviously, on the top line, as the euro has been strengthening, that impacts the guidance that we gave for the full year. So we would love to have a weaker dollar. Unfortunately, I don't think that's going to be happening the rest of this fiscal year from where we sit today. We do have the proton business, which is European-based, which is helping us to become more naturally hedged.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then Tim, put it simply, I mean the last 2 quarters in the North American oncology market has frankly been tough. And I think the mid-single digit growth profile in that market has been a key to the overall organic outlook for the company. So given that, can you give us a sense for where you think that order trend could go over the next 12, 24 months and given the outlook for the overall organic growth profile for the company and what are the drivers of any rebound that keep you comfortable with those expectations?","Timothy E. Guertin","In general, I think that the organic -- that the North American market is going to grow. And that given any individual quarter is more of an event rather than a trend right now, I think there is growth in the North American market. But I think it's in the single digits. And in some quarters it's going to be down, and in other quarters it's going to be up. But I don't think in the long run -- and I'm not talking about this year; I'm talking about in the long run. In the long run, I think the North American market is going to grow, but the major source of growth for the company is going to be outside of North America. So it's very important for us to get companies like TrueBeam and -- at higher take rates outside of North America. That's what we saw happen in this quarter, so it fills me with confidence that we're going to get additional growth. Plus, we've done well in some recent deals around the world in these small territories and growing territories. So all of those things I think are very important. The U.S. market is more and more a replacement market. That's not -- that probably means is not -- we won't see stupendous growth. But what we can get is if we can speed up the replacement market, that would be nice. We still have a huge number of machines in North America that are quite old. And so if we can continue to stimulate that market, I think that we can still see in the single digits for North America. Outside of that, the big business will be elsewhere. Also another key driver that I should remember is stereotactic radiosurgery in North America. If we can get lung and liver indications to take off, that is if we can get operable lung cancer patients and if we can get operable liver and learn how to treat them with radiation with stereotactic radiosurgery and get that to be widely accepted in the United States, it will be a huge boost to our business here. So there's some upside possibilities as well, and don't forget protons.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Dalton Chandler of Needham & Company.","Dalton L. Chandler - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if you could maybe put some quantification around the order push out? For example, you are down 11% in North America. If the orders they come in as expected, where do you think you might have been?","Timothy E. Guertin","Dow?","Dow R. Wilson","I think probably as specific as we want to get is, Dalton, it was 2 or 3 big customers.","Timothy E. Guertin","Yes, I don't think we can be more specific than that, and you can look at our history and judge what big customers are like.","Operator","No further questions at this time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mike Bruff, Vice President of Investor Relations for Varian Medical Systems. Thank you, Mr. Bruff. You may begin.","J. Michael Bruff - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to Varian's second quarter fiscal year 2018 conference call and webcast. Joining me today on the call are Varian's President and Chief Executive Officer, Dow Wilson; and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Bischoping. Dow will share his thoughts on our results and long-term strategy and Gary will cover our operating and financial results in more detail.","On the Varian Investor Relations website, you can find our fiscal second quarter press release and web deck, which are intended to provide additional perspective and details. Included in these documents is the reconciliation of the differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. We report non-GAAP earnings to provide comparisons of operational performance, excluding unusual items. Unless otherwise stated, all financial results discussed are non-GAAP and from continuing operations, all growth rates are year-over-year and any references to orders are gross orders. All references to trailing 12 months refer to the trailing 12 months ending on the last day of our most recently completed fiscal quarter.","Also note that we may provide growth rates in constant currency allowing assessment of the business excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. As a reminder, Varian adopted Revenue Accounting Standard Codification 606 at the beginning of fiscal year 2018. The results that we disclose today, including fiscal year 2017 results and any forward-looking statements, include guidance, reflect this new standard. During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are predictions, projections, and other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in today's earnings release, this conference call, and our SEC filings. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.","And with all that said, I'll turn it over to Dow.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Mike, and good day, everyone. Today, I'll share the key milestones we achieved this past quarter and how they contributed to our long-term strategy. First, let me touch on our results. Total company revenues of $730 million increased 10%. Oncology revenues grew 10%, driven by our integrated platform with best-in-class hardware, software, and services. Our Particle Therapy business grew 2%.","We saw some currency tailwinds that helped us in the quarter and Gary will provide additional detail on constant currency growth rates in a minute. Operating earnings of $129 million or 17.6% of revenues grew 22%. GAAP EPS of $0.79 grew 6% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.15 grew 28%. GAAP EPS was impacted by acquisition-related expenses and an impairment charge related to the expected refinancing of the Maryland Proton Treatment Center. Gary will discuss these in more detail as well.","Cash flow from operations was $66 million, up 104%, driven by operating income performance and working capital efficiencies. In terms of our long-term growth and value creation strategy, we made progress across our three growth initiatives. First, strengthening our leadership in radiation therapy. Based on public filings, the radiation therapy market grew 3% on an orders basis over the trailing 12 months ending in December 2017. Varian grew gross orders 6% over that time, growing worldwide share and extending our market leadership.","In our Oncology business, orders grew 5% in the quarter and 6% through the first half of the year. Our worldwide net installed base is now 7,954 units, up 3% or 263 units. On the hardware side, we're pleased to announce that TrueBeam, our fully integrated system for image-guided radio therapy and radio surgery, was named category leader for radiation therapy by KLAS, an independent research firm, in its 2018 report.","Additionally, we made progress with our global roll out of Halcyon and have now taken 81 orders since our May 2017 launch, including 19 new orders in the second quarter. Most of the orders since launch have been incremental and greater than 40% are for greenfield sites. Additionally, Halcyon has succeeded in replacing a growing number of competitive machines with take-outs representing over 25% of orders this quarter. Included in these take-outs were replacements of tomotherapy and cobalt systems.","Over one-third of orders were in North America and the field is reporting growing interest and momentum as the product installed base grows along with papers and publications from leading institutions. Operationally, the team has executed well and about 20 sites worldwide are now using Halcyon clinically, with some sites treating 80 to 100 patients or more per day. For example, at Clinique Charcot in Lyon, France, Halcyon achieved beam on from start of installation to ready-to-treat in just eight days and is now treating approximately 80 patients per day.","We're also pleased to provide an update on kilovoltage cone-beam CT imaging, a valuable extension to the Halcyon platform. The first human kV cone-beam CT images on a Halcyon were acquired at Washington University with positive feedback on image quality, speed of image acquisition, and processing. In this study, imaging was done in 17 seconds, half of standard cone-beam CT image acquisition times, enabling an easy breath hold technique for a compromised patient and improved image quality. We launched Halcyon 2.0 with kilovoltage imaging last week at ESTRO in Barcelona.","On the software front, we continue to see strong demand and positive feedback for our software solutions. Software revenues grew 7%. The number of unique Varian software customers grew 5% and the installed base for RapidPlan grew approximately 80%. RapidPlan continues to make a positive impact on the market. For example, at Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney, Australia, 80% of patients are now planned with RapidPlan and 87% of RapidPlan generated plans are approved by the attending radiation oncologist without any replanning. In terms of time savings for gynecological cancer, planning time was reduced from four days to just two hours.","Also in the quarter, our ARIA oncology information system and Eclipse treatment planning system were both selected as category leaders in the 2018 Best in KLAS Report. Eclipse has now been named the top oncology treatment planning system for five straight years. KLAS's recognition of TrueBeam, ARIA, and Eclipse validate that our commitment to provide clinicians and patients with the most advanced integrated solutions is resonating in the market.","The capabilities of Eclipse treatment planning were further demonstrated when customers using the software placed the highest in the overall category in the first-ever World Championships of Treatment Planning hosted by ProKnow. In addition to the top four and six of the top 10 positions in the overall category, Eclipse customers also had the top three scoring VMAT plans. Additionally, ARIA received the most recent edition of Certification of Compliance with the requirements of the U.S. government's Quality Payment Program. This designation allows our customers to meet meaningful use requirements to qualify for an incentive bonus payment from CMS under the ongoing EHR adoption program.","Finally, in February, we acquired a small privately-held quality assurance software company, Mobius Medical Systems. We have long provided high-quality QA for our products and view Mobius' market leading software, including Mobius3D and DoseLab as key enhancements to our existing portfolio of patient treatment plan QA and machine QA technologies. We look forward to leveraging Mobius technology through our global channel to impact more patients with software solutions designed to assure the quality of treatment.","Our services revenues grew 10%, driven by our growing installed base and higher mix of newer machines which typically have a higher attach rate and contract value. Varian services were also recently recognized in China where we won the Best After-Sales Service Performance Award for Radiotherapy Products. This was awarded by one of the most influential medical industry performance evaluations conducted in China. We look forward to continuing to innovate to provide superior and efficient services worldwide.","In our Particle Therapy business, we did not take any new orders in the quarter. In the trailing 12 months, we've taken six proton orders and our sales pipeline remained solid. Our seven operational sites are executing well and have been operating at over 96% uptime. We recently announced that Varian and the University of Maryland School of Medicine reached their first educational milestone at the Maryland Proton Treatment Center as more than 150 medical professionals have now completed training there.","Education and training remain a vital component in the continued growth of proton therapy around the world and partnerships like the ones we have with Maryland and the University of Pennsylvania allow Varian customers to learn from experienced proton clinicians how to best deliver treatments and build successful proton therapy practices. And in March, we announced the first patient treatment at the St. Petersburg Proton Therapy Center in Russia, an important step in expanding access to proton therapy around the world.","Our second growth initiative is to extend our global footprint. Our global market share growth was driven by orders-based share gains in EMEA. For example, Varian was awarded a contract for eight TrueBeam systems at the new Karolinska Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden, with installations expected to begin in the coming weeks. In addition to a multi-year service agreement, we will also provide our ARIA and Eclipse software solutions. Varian is committed to building on the strong legacy of partnership with this global luminary and we look forward to fulfilling our commitment to provide the most advanced technologies and best-in-class support services to Karolinska.","Elsewhere in Mexico, the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social selected Varian to equip seven treatment centers in the country with Varian systems. The deal includes six VitalBeam systems, Mexico's first Edge system for image-guided stereotactic radiosurgery, plus a full suite of Varian's treatment planning and oncology information software. All installations are expected to be completed by December of 2018.","On the Halcyon front, global momentum continues to grow. Of the Halcyon orders taken since launch, over 40% have been from emerging markets and over 80% of these have been for incremental units. Lastly, our third growth initiative is to expand into other addressable markets and we made meaningful progress on this front. First, in January, we signed an agreement to acquire Sirtex, an Australian-based company focused on interventional oncology therapies for approximately AUD 1.6 billion. This transaction is expected to close by the end of May. The acquisition of Sirtex is consistent with our long-term value creation strategy as it enables us to enter the fast-growing interventional oncology market.","Second, to enhance the capabilities of Varian 360 Oncology care management platform, we announced the acquisition of Evinance Innovation, a small, privately-held Montreal-based company specializing in clinical decision support software. With this acquisition, we will use the 360 Oncology platform to more tightly integrate clinical workflow and decision support based on leading cancer care guidelines, a key challenge for physicians around the world.","Additionally, we received 360 Oncology orders, including one from UT Tyler, which is affiliated with the MD Anderson network. Installations will begin over the coming months. Overall, we are pleased with the progress we made in the second quarter of our fiscal year 2018. We made meaningful strides towards our long-term strategy to become a global leader in multi-disciplinary integrated cancer care solutions.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Gary who'll provide more context on the second quarter financial results.","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Dow. As always, I'll consistently frame my comments in the context of our long-term growth and value creation strategy, which includes balancing growth, profitability, and liquidity. So let me start with growth. Company-wide revenues were $730 million in the second quarter, up 10% in dollars and 6% in constant currency.","In Oncology, revenues were $698 million, up 10% in dollars and 6% in constant currency, driven by growth across hardware, software, and services. Year-to-date revenues grew 12% in dollars and 9% in constant currency. Orders were $664 million, up 5% in dollars and 1% in constant currency. On a trailing 12-month basis, orders grew 5% in dollars and 4% in constant currency. We ended the quarter with $2.6 billion in backlog, up 7%.","Taking a closer look at our Oncology business results, in the Americas, based on lumpiness in revenue timing, revenues declined 3% in the quarter in both dollars and constant currency. Year-to-date revenues in the Americas are up 6% in both dollars and constant currency. We expect revenue growth for the full year and growth in the back half of this year for the region. Orders were $341 million, up 2% in dollars and in constant currency. On a trailing 12-month basis, orders for the Americas grew 1% in dollars and in constant currency. And in North America, orders grew 2% in dollars and in constant currency.","Asia-Pacific revenues grew 2% in dollars and was flat in constant currency. Year-to-date revenues grew 8% in dollars and in constant currency. Orders were $123 million increasing 3% in dollars and 1% in constant currency. On a trailing 12-month basis, orders for Asia-Pacific region grew 2% in dollars and in constant currency. Greater China continued its growth and strong share performance as we continue to lead the market there. And in Japan, we saw growth for the second consecutive quarter. We hope to see this trend of a modest recovery in the Japanese market continue.","In our Europe, Middle East, India and Africa geography, revenues grew 44% and 29% in constant currency. Year-to-date revenues grew 26% in dollars and 16% in constant currency. Orders were $199 million increasing 11% in dollars and flat in constant currency. On a trailing 12-month basis, orders grew 15% in dollars and 11% in constant currency. Our Particle Therapy business posted revenues of $32 million in the quarter, which is up 2%.","Turning to profitability, total company gross margin was $320 million, up 16% at a rate of 43.8% of revenues. This was driven largely by our Oncology business where we continue to see solid revenue growth across hardware, services and software as well as margin rate expansion. Oncology gross margin of $319 million increased 15% and the rate was 45.7%, up 168 basis points. This is primarily driven by revenue growth across hardware, software and services and margin rate expansion in Europe from pricing discipline and ongoing operational excellence.","Looking at Particle Therapy, gross margins were $1 million, up $2 million. Companywide SG&A expenses were $132 million or 18% of revenues were up $15 million or 12%. The increase was primarily driven by additional sales team and infrastructure investments to support business growth. Investment will continue to be a key driver of our long-term growth and value creation. In the quarter, R&D was up 10% to $59 million, investing 8% of revenues into organic innovation programs.","On a GAAP basis, depreciation and amortization was $17 million. Company operating earnings were $129 million or 17.6% of revenues increasing $23 million or 22%. This quarter, we had two significant items that impacted GAAP earnings. First, acquisition-related expenses totaled $20 million for the quarter, primarily driven by $16 million relating to hedging the Australian dollar purchase price for the Sirtex acquisition.","Second, we took an impairment charge for $11 million related to the upcoming refinancing of the Maryland Proton Treatment Center. The charge is due to the expected difference in value between the security currently held by us and the value of the new security that will be issued to us in exchange as part of the expected refinancing. The amount of the impairment is approximately the accrued interest on the security held by us. As the refinancing goes as planned, we may recognize some gains from our investments in the second half of the year. Overall the Maryland Proton facility continues to perform well, treating up to approximately 100 patients per day.","Turning to taxes, you may recall the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted in December of 2017, had a significant impact on our GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter. It continues to have a significant impact on our year-to-date GAAP effective tax rate and as expected had some impact on our effective tax rate for the second quarter. After impacts of the new legislation, our resulting GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 23.4%.","Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 17.9%, which includes tax expenses due to the repatriation of foreign earnings and lower corporate tax rates impact on the deferred tax assets. Similarly, our non-GAAP net earnings per diluted share also exclude these items. GAAP net earnings per diluted share was $0.79. Our non-GAAP net earnings per share was $1.15 with related diluted share count of 92.6 million shares in the quarter.","Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $740 million and debt of $255 million. In April, we replaced our existing $600 million credit facility with a new $1.8 billion credit facility. We intend to use a portion of the credit facility along with cash on the balance sheet to fund the acquisition of Sirtex.","Cash flow from operations was $66 million, up 104%, driven by operating income performance and working capital efficiencies. This brings our trailing 12 month cash flow from operations to $529 million. Oncology DSO decreased by 15 days from 118 days to 103 days in the quarter. In addition to R&D, other investments in the quarter included $9 million in CapEx and $36 million to repurchase shares of our stock. As of the end of the quarter, we had 4.4 million shares remaining under existing repurchase authorization.","I will now turn it back over to Dow who will discuss our updated fiscal year 2018 annual guidance.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Gary. With respect to our annual guidance, we continue to maintain a pragmatic approach and have considered the following factors regarding our fiscal year 2018 guidance: first, continued projected market growth; second, our products and solutions continue to resonate in the market driving our share gains; third, recent tailwinds in the currency markets; and fourth, the impact of the tax cuts and their implications to our tax rate. After careful consideration of these factors, we believe it is prudent to update our fiscal year 2018 annual guidance to the following.","Revenue growth range of 6% to 9%, which now includes the impact from currency for the remainder of the year. Non-GAAP operating earnings as a percentage of revenue range of 18% to 19%. Non-GAAP effective tax rate of 20%. Weighted average diluted shares of 93 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share range of $4.43 to $4.53. Cash flow from operations range of $475 million to $550 million. This updated guidance does not reflect the impact of the Sirtex acquisition which is expected to close by the end of May.","Thank you. And now, operator, let's go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Our first question is with Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC","Thank you and good afternoon. Maybe, Dow, I'll start a little bit with guidance and a couple questions on orders and then just one on Sirtex. So just on guidance, 6% to 9% from 4% to 7%, maybe just to segregate out what actually is currency and where the constant currency range settles within the revised guidance you issued here today?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah.","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. Anthony, let me grab that one quick. So the 6% to 9% basically catches about 2 percentage points from currency, right. And so that's kind of what we saw in the first half and equivalently capturing the same here for the second half. And so that 6% to 9% would basically come back to 4% to 7% on a constant currency basis to answer your question.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC","And I guess just going to backlog on the quarter, the 9% growth in just the rate of revenue recognition from backlog to revenue, the cadence of that. So that number was a little bit better than we were expecting. It seems like it's a cleaner number now, pure hardware. So, where is the installation cycle trending and how do we sort of look at that 9% backlog growth as it relates to say the back half of the year potential for revenue growth? And then I'll have one on Sirtex.","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Sure. And just so we clean it, we're talking apples-to-apples here, right. Oncology backlog is up 7%. Overall company backlog is up that 9% you referred to. So as it relates to oncology, we really saw good progress out of Europe with the order to revenue cycle. We've seen some good quality orders there. We've seen an acceleration of revenue in the period from prior six months orders versus the prior year. And it's good discipline, good operational discipline and good sales discipline as we take those orders and then flow it through into revenue. So really the acceleration has been out of Europe and you saw that in the revenue growth rate in Europe reflected as well.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC","That's helpful. And last one for me is just on Sirtex. I know we're approaching the close, but maybe, Dow, just a little bit on the strategy with the clinical pipeline. So there was a read out in HCC. The study design, I think, had high hurdles. But maybe what is the outlook for HCC and just the broader clinical pipeline going forward for Sirtex? Thanks again.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. Maybe just starting at the highest level, we really like this from a radiation medicine point of view. It strengthens our position in radiation medicine. And two, it enables us to build out an interventional oncology channel, which it'll be of growing importance in our market. Just as a reminder for everybody, Sirtex is \u2013 I think their guidance for their fiscal year is about $180 million-ish with about $50 million-ish of EBITDA, so a very good franchise and position.","In terms of the news on their trial, there was really no new news there. That was all in their marketplace and kind of should have no impact. Certainly, we were aware of it as we conducted our due diligence. Product has great position for colorectal mets to the liver. We've got some work to do to provide evidence for primary liver cancer. We do like some of the things that we see there and we're going to have to work on ongoing evidence.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is with Amit Hazan with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Amit Hazan - Citi Research","Thanks. Hey. Good afternoon, guys.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Hey, Amit.","Amit Hazan - Citi Research","Just on the order side \u2013 hey. I'll start on the order side; maybe tackle the Americas and the APAC pieces. If you kind of take the last 12-month trends, I think, up 1% in Americas, now up 2% in APAC. So it's a slowdown and I'm wondering if you think that's the right market growth. And then, secondly, just a sense or some more color around what's going on with those two markets and why they look like they've slowed in the last 12 months?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","I'd say, first of all, when you look at the overall, our overall trailing 12-month order rate is 5%. There is nothing that we see in the quarter that's changing that. We've got some lumpiness going on. Funnel remains very, very good. So I'd say we don't see much in terms of overall change. On the specific geographies, maybe the one piece of color is we might have a little bit of weighting for Halcyon in Asia, but otherwise the market and the market funnel we continue to be pretty bullish about our funnel and what we see there.","Amit Hazan - Citi Research","Okay. All right. And so if I kind of move over back to guidance and maybe look at it from a cash flow perspective, I think this is the second quarter in a row now you've raised guidance but no change to cash flow guidance for the year. And I'm wondering whether that's an implication that the (28:00) is more non-cash related in some way or where the offsets are that you're somehow not seeing that flow through to cash flows?","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. Amit, as we grow faster in dollars or local currency, we use more working capital. Receivables and inventory are growing faster than payables. And so we'll see the lift as you saw in our earnings per share guidance raise. It's just there's more usage of working capital as you grow faster. It's not any more complicated than that.","Amit Hazan - Citi Research","Okay. And then last quick one for me is on your SG&A comment; just a little bit more color as you talk about additional sales and infrastructure investments that you're making. What specifically are you doing there?","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. I would say good investment in the sales activity both around software and around the India sales teams to take advantage of growth options that are there. And, look, we see that as greater returns for us and we'll continue to invest as we capitalize on the growth options we see both in software and across emerging markets, but specifically India this past quarter.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","I mean we'll also have a small piece from the small acquisitions.","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah.","Amit Hazan - Citi Research","All right. Thanks, guys. I'll jump back in queue.","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is with Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks. Maybe on Halcyon, Dow, can you just talk on \u2013 you mentioned China, maybe there's still some pent-up demand. Any update on timing there and does this kind of trade war dynamic kind of hold things up further?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. No, I'd say plan is still on track. We've finished our clinical study. We're turning things over to the regulatory bodies. We've kind of said end of this year if everything goes well. I think we're still end of this year. There's some uncertainty around that depending on how fast they move. But we're still on track with our plan to end of the year.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. And then similarly in Japan, post-approval there, I mean, how do we think about the opportunity? I think you've talked in the past about the fact there's potentially big replacement cycle that could happen, but it hasn't yet. So how do we think about...?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. We haven't seen it yet. I think one of the things about that market is there's a lot of single vault customers in that market and a lot of them have very old equipment. So, especially with the really high turnover of the machine and the short installation cycle, I was very hopeful. We did just have the ITEM trade show. That's the Japan radiation oncology trade show. And we had very high interest in the product. So that was very good to see.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. And then, two quick ones for Gary. On Sirtex, is there anything \u2013 well, could you comment on what's included in guidance as we get near the close next month?","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. As we stated, there's nothing in guidance for Sirtex.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Nothing. Okay. And then, did you guys book anything on the Flatiron sale to Roche? You had an equity investment in them, right?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","No.","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","No. I don't believe we did bookings.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That was just the partnership. Okay.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. It was just the partnership. There was no equity.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is with Brandon Henry with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Hey, Brandon. We can't hear you.","Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Can you hear me now?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","There we go. We got you.","Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right. Thanks for taking my question. The company raised fiscal year EPS guidance. Can you just discuss the factors that led you to raise that range and how much of that was from FX? And then I just have a couple follow-ups.","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. There was a couple of things, which Dow outlined. We are seeing the market growth that we had talked about for the year. We are seeing our products continue to resonate and therefore taking share. I think there is \u2013 the factors here are clearly currency as we talked about with the opening comment. That's certainly part of it and then tax rate. So it's kind of the combination that we see, good strong revenue growth, 6% to 9%, as we outlined, driven by market and our solutions in the market.","We have seen some margin rate expansion, but we continue to invest, Brandon, investing in the sales capacity that we talked about, investing in the software capacity we need in order to move 360 Oncology forward. And then we'll continue to invest at the right rates from an R&D perspective. So it's balancing the short-term and the long-term and making sure we're making the right structural investments in order to deliver the right level of long-term growth. And so you've seen us so far in the first half. I believe, our operating income as a percent of revenue was 18.1% and that reflects the investments that we've made here in the first half as we've outlined and that's kind of what's embedded in our guidance as well.","Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And just on the operating margin side, just help me understand that the guidance was reiterated there. The range looks pretty wide for the full fiscal year and you guys are halfway through the fiscal year or so. Just kind of help me understand the factors that would get you to the kind of the lower or the upper end of that range for the back half of the year.","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. I would tell you that the margin rate expansion has been nice to see. That usually happens in a currency-driven market like this and good pricing discipline to hold on to that favorability we see on the currency front. So that's definitely a tailwind for us. I think the headwinds are what we've talked about which are investing in the ongoing sales and growth options we see and ongoing innovation in R&D. And so like I said, we've performed at 18.1% in the first half here and we'll continue to invest in growth options over time.","Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right. And just a couple quick other questions. The President Trump have obviously come out with the 25% tariffs on certain medical devices and equipment and some other items for goods imported from China. Can you spend some time discussing Varian's potential exposure to those tariffs?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Sure. We're monitoring it very closely and are working with AvMed (34:24) and other industry organizations to address the issue and clearly preserve access to potentially lifesaving cancer treatment. It is important to note that the U.S. trade representative list is still in proposal form and has not been finalized. They are seeking comments on that. And, clearly, we're advocating for the removal of medical devices and component parts as part of that.","At this stage, the U.S. trade representative list is only a proposal. Remains to be seen what final products are that will be included. So it's a dynamic environment and we continue to watch it. I guess from kind of a really broad perspective, don't see it having a big impact on market, nor our market share. How it impacts tariff cost, et cetera, is in play and we're going to have to watch that as it moves through the process.","Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right. And then just last one for me on Sirtex. You guys have had a couple months post the announcement to kind of think about the financial impact from the deal. Can you help us understand how you're thinking about ROIC targets for the deal and then any thoughts in terms of the mix of cash versus debt to finance the deal? Thanks.","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. Let me grab the last two financial points here real quick and turn it back to Dow here for some broader comments. But, look, we think over time this will be value accreting clearly and we think about our weighted average cost of capital in the 8% or so range. And so over time, we see our ability to beat that number. As it relates to how we're going to fund this, it'll be some combination of credit facility and the cash we have on the balance sheet and we'll know more about that clearly when we close. We'll communicate it then. Dow, anything else to add?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Maybe just the regulatory steps have been completed. So we like that. It's progressing. We're working through the Sirtex shareholder vote. Haven't seen any surprises there. And we expect the acquisition to close late May. And as we get to that point, we'll be in a position to talk a lot more about where we see it going.","Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","And, Brandon, just before you jump, I just want to come back to your guidance question and the basic assumption around currency for second half basic, we've looked at spot rates at the start of our third quarter and kind of use that to imply what we think the currency impact will be for the second half.","Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is with Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So, maybe, Dow, just one on revenues, really strong revenue quarter. But if I just look at the installed base growth versus how product revenues have been trending, right, I know last quarter you guys had this mix where a higher proportion of revenues came from developed regions. It feels like the backlog has been burning at a fast rate. Like does this have any implication on future revenues, right? I guess what I'm asking is if we end up in first half of next fiscal and if the same proportion of revenues are not being recognized from developed regions like is that sort of an issue because emerging market revenues are \u2013 maybe they get converted \u2013 those orders get converted at a slower clip?","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Vijay, thanks for the question. I think what I stated earlier is kind of a synopsis. One is it's lumpy out there, right. And orders in Europe were really high quality and turned very fast here that we took in the last six months versus the ability for us to turn those orders in the prior year. And that's good like I said operational execution, quality order and sales process and we turn that over pretty quick. I wouldn't read a trend into that one way or another because things are lumpy in any given quarter. So, we'll continue to stick to our booking process and governance around having to have an actual delivery date within the next 24 months and that ongoing governance will continue. So again nice execution across Europe, really like to see it. But I wouldn't read a trend and things are lumpy.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","No, that's helpful, Gary. And on Halcyon, I don't know if I caught the number. How many Halcyon orders do we have currently?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","We had 19 on the quarter, 81 since launch.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Thank you. And, Dow, like just given historical sort of if we look back in a TrueBeam adoption curve or how those orders trended, right, within year-one, is this now Halcyon like are you guys happy with how Halcyon is trending or is this just a function of maybe we need the China approval and then we see an inflection?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Hey. Where we are is it's on track to our plan. We were very confident about the product. We remain very confident about the product. The regulatory approvals have happened right on the plan that we said at the beginning. So it is achieving what we want. We love the fact that the sites are all incremental or not all, but a huge percentage of them are incremental. And so it's expanding our installed base, setting up physician for service. We're especially pleased to see the emerging market growth.","Again new sockets grow in the installed base of our business enhancing our position to leverage our service and software business and upgrade business down the road. As I mentioned on the call, we had Halcyon 2.0 introduced at ESTRO last week. The reception was outstanding. We now have kilovoltage cone-beam CT in that product. If anything, that will attract more developed market customers and give us an upgrade to sell as well to the 80 orders we've already taken. So we're very confident about the product. It's right on the plan that we had for it and we kind of love seeing the momentum that it's achieved in the marketplace and believe that that is growing.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Understood. And then, Gary, one last housekeeping. The Mobius acquisition, does this acquisition have any revenues and, if so, can you give us what the contribution is?","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. It certainly does in the quarter. It's pretty small overall relative to the size of the company, so we're not going to disclose the actual number, right. But it's strategic, it's part of what we see as a nice space for us to leverage across our channel and grow rapidly via that channel with the QA product. So we're excited about it, team's been great, really good integration, off to a nice start.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question is with Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you. Good evening, guys. A couple questions here and I've been jumping between calls, so hopefully I'm not repeating anything here, but wanted to ask an MR Linac question. Saw a large number of abstracts at ESTRO here over the past week and I think we've got a multisystem order for Elekta out of the UK recently. ViewRay, I think, has over 50 orders at this point. I mean just any updated thoughts on MR Linac market. I know you've been watching it, but any change in the last few months at all on how you feel Varian needs or doesn't need to compete in that market over time?","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","We continue to watch it, Jeff. It's clear it's got an academic niche. What its long-term play is in a broader market that's stressed for value-based pricing and cost effectiveness is a big question mark. I would say that our position has not changed. Our market share is growing in spite of. Those orders are included in our market share numbers. So we're seeing our share growth continue even without that performance.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. That makes sense. Thanks, Dow. And then, Gary, just a question for you on interest rates. We've seen them start to rise here. Is there a rate of change? Is there an absolute level, anything we should be thinking about when you've historically seen hospitals get a little hedgy on capitally purchases, anything like that or we're still near historical lows right now, so are we a long ways away from having to worry about any of those kind of issues?","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. I would say the nature of the yield curve too, Jeff, kind of matters here and where hospitals are funding. And you hit the nail on the head, overall historically very low, and I don't see access to capital as a constraint here, for sure.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. That makes sense. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question is with Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. I wanted to spend a little more time on Halcyon. If we were to kind of spend some time on the order book that you have in North America, I think, Dow, you kind of mentioned earlier that there are almost \u2013 or a large percentage of those orders are incremental customers. Just want to clarify that that was for the global order book or in the U.S. versus O-U.S., just trying to get a sense of in the U.S. who the incremental customers have been.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Well, the numbers I gave earlier were global. And I think the other point that I'd make is we're seeing it in both markets, U.S. and outside the U.S. And one of the places that we're seeing it in the U.S. market is with competitive take-outs. So we are seeing that impact in the U.S. market. Of the 19 orders we took in Q2, we believe 15 are incremental and 60% of them were taken from emerging markets.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just an update on software; I know you guys have a lot of people working on that and maybe not something that's super impactful to this quarter, but would appreciate an update on the strategy there. Where you guys spent your resources this quarter on building up that part of the business? Thank you.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. We continue to invest aggressively in software. The growth rates are positive. We do have a little bit of a model change going on as we go from a historically strong license business to more Software-as-a-Service business. But both are growing and, in the meantime, the Software-as-a-Service is growing faster.","Our investments in treatment planning continue to pay off big for us with our multi-criteria optimization, RapidPlan and other features in that product. And we also have a big penetration opportunity. We got 80% of the installed base yet to sell to, so nice opportunities there. Our ARIA product continues to see very good momentum in the marketplace. Relative to Oncology 360, it's really the kind of vision story. It describes how and where we're going. It's resonating very well with customers. We're still installing those and getting the evidence to kind of drive the enterprise sale.","As I mentioned on the call, we did receive Best in KLAS, kind of the third-party Gartner of our industry, for both Eclipse and ARIA. So we've got a very good competitive position. We continue to invest strongly in those markets. We did announce acquisition. It's a pretty small acquisition of Evinance, but the capability there is very important. It has clinical decision support tools that keep people on track for guidelines. So this is going to help drive the variation out around the standard of care and help people more consistently and efficiently deliver the right kind of quality. We're excited about having that product on our Oncology 360 platform and working guidelines into the product.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks for all the detail. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question is with Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC","Maybe just a quick follow-up on overall margin progression, just in light of the increased SG&A investments and that, Gary, you announced here today. I mean I think the sort of multi-year target was to be get to 20% and over time I think it was almost three years, but maybe just to revisit on the multi-year outlook for adjusted operating margin in light of the increased spend that you announced here today. Thanks.","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. You know what the overall gross margin profile is encouraging to see, right. And some of that's attributable to currency environment that we're in, but also it's good operational execution and pricing discipline to take advantage of that out there in the field. And we chose to take some of those dollars and invest it into future growth options, which I think is the right answer here. We've got to be able to sustain that growth rate that we've talked about over time in order to get to where we want to be. So here we've talked about investing in sales and R&D. We're going to continue to invest in sales and R&D to drive the sustainable top-line growth. Anthony, long-term we still would think we can get into that 20% range, but we want to make sure we can do that while growing at the right rate.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah.","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","So, it's that ongoing balance of profitability and growth that I talked about that will work our way through here over time.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","But no change in the long-term goals.","Gary Bischoping, Jr. - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","No.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session and I would like to turn the call over back to management for closing remarks.","Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you, operator. I'm very pleased with the strides we've made in the second quarter towards executing on our long-term value creation strategy. We continue to strengthen our leadership in radiation therapy, extend our global footprint, and are enthusiastic about entering faster-growing markets beyond traditional radiation oncology. Our recent signing of the agreement to acquire Sirtex will position us as a leader in broader radiation medicine outside of external beam radiation therapy and enables us to enter the fast-growing interventional oncology market.","Mobius expands our software portfolio and enhances our quality assurance capabilities. And, finally, Evinance enables us to improve on the development of our existing 360 Oncology care coordination product. Looking forward, we'll continue to focus on our growth initiatives and remain committed to innovating new technologies to drive towards the ultimate victory, a world without the fear of cancer.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Spencer Sias, Vice President, Investor Relations for Varian Medical Systems. Thank you. Mr. Sias, you may begin.","Spencer R. Sias","Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Varian Medical Systems conference call for the third quarter of fiscal 2013. With me are Dow Wilson, President and CEO; Elisha Finney, CFO; and Clarence Verhoef, our Corporate Controller. Dow and Elisha will summarize our results and will take your questions following the presentation.

Please mark your calendars, and we hope to see you there.","And now here's Dow.","Dow R. Wilson","Good afternoon and welcome. We're reporting third quarter results with several positives, as well as some challenges that impacted our performance.","Net earnings per share grew ahead of expectations for the quarter. Revenues for the company grew, but we're short of our objectives for the period principally because of a sharp decline in the yen and unexpected weakness in our X-ray tube business.","To summarize our results, our net earnings per diluted share increased 7% to $1.03. Revenues were $726 million, up 3% on a reported basis and 4% on a constant-currency basis. Our backlog grew 4% over the year-ago quarter to $2.75 billion, including 6% in the oncology backlog -- 6% growth in the oncology backlog. Net orders in our Oncology Systems, X-ray Products and Security businesses totaled $725 million, up 5% on a reported basis and up 7% on a constant-currency basis.","I will cover the operational highlights for the quarter and let Elisha walk you through the details of the P&L and balance sheet.","In the third quarter, Oncology Systems grew net orders by 4% to $582 million. Net orders outside of North America grew by 8% on a reported basis and 12% in constant currency. Currency had a huge impact in Asia, where oncology net orders decreased by 6% on a reported basis, but increased by 5% on a constant-currency basis. Meanwhile, EMEA grew by 21% in dollars and 22% in constant currency. Net orders in North America fell by 1%. Overall, markets outside North America comprise 57% of oncology's net orders during the quarter. EMEA was the big driver with substantial wins in the U.K., Poland, Turkey and North Africa.","Our 2 biggest markets in Asia continue to perform very well. Net orders in both China and Japan were up over 20%. In China, I'm pleased to report that we made 2 package deals with Siemens imaging and Varian treatment equipment. In Japan, growth was driven by strong interest in our tubing systems as well as upgrades. The rest of the Asia region was down on tough comps.","As you probably know, the large tender to equip public cancer centers in Brazil has been delayed further with no auction date currently set. Meanwhile, purchasing continued in Brazil, where we generated solid double-digit net order growth over last year.","The North American oncology market experienced slower capital spending amid reimbursement and concerns over Health Care Reform. Subsequent to the close of the quarter, CMS announced its initial proposal for 2014 reimbursement rates in the U.S. Generally speaking the proposal increases reimbursement for hospitals, while calling for a reduction for freestanding clinics, which now represent about 5% of our global oncology business. There are some real positives for hospitals in the CMS proposal with recommended increases for newer and more efficient treatment advances. As an example, under the proposal reimbursement for a single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery for both linear accelerators and Cobalt-based systems would rise and continue to be equal. This should help encourage replacement of older technology with newer and more efficient systems.","As a reminder, the rates for 2014 will not be finalized until November, and we can expect to see a lot of debate and some changes to the current proposals. In any case, we expect long-term pressure on reimbursement rates to place a premium on fast, cost-efficient delivery of both radiosurgery and radiotherapy. This continues to be a Varian strength, because we believe we offer greater performance and value than any of our competitors.","We believe the need for better and more efficient health care is creating a market trend towards consolidation, integration and standardization across multisite networks. Customers need better cost productivity, higher quality and measurable outcomes. This can lead to larger and more complex deals. As an example, shortly after the close of the quarter, we received a multimillion dollar order from a customer in the southeast of the United States, which is integrating a consolidated 5-site network. They will be equipping the network with 6 new Varian Linacs, including 2 tubing units as well as our full suite of treatment planning and information management software.","Like a lot of our customers, they used to provide standalone solutions in each of their sites. Now they'll be updating their equipment and transitioning to one common patient database with common standards of care across their entire network. This customer is also purchasing Varian's innovative full-scale program, which will allow us to maintain and update the network's full software and hardware IT infrastructure through a private cloud.","During the quarter, we booked multiple orders for the new EDGE radiosurgery system, and several other customers ordered EDGE radiosurgery products, accessories and software for their existing treatment machines. Customer interest in this technology is high and the sales funnel for our radiosurgery solutions looks solid. We hope to see this business accelerate further once we receive Shonin and CE Mark to sell EDGE outside of the U.S.","Our service business remained the growth driver with a 12% rise in net orders. Service comprised 36% of oncology's net orders for the period and year-to-date. This business contributed to healthy margins for our oncology business.","Turning to X-ray Products. Third quarter net orders grew by 2% to $123 million and revenues grew by 7% to $135 million. In a light volume quarter, this business did an excellent job managing operating expenses. Net orders and revenues were impacted by customers in Japan who began reducing excess tube inventories. We have experienced similar inventory adjustments in the past and business has typically normalized after a couple of quarters.","Flat panel revenues grew 10% in the quarter as the market continued to adopt digital X-ray solutions. While analog X-ray equipment sales have been soft for the last several years, a continued trend towards the adoption of digital imaging technology enabled Varian to gain share, and we continue to see growth opportunities here. As an example, we saw increased customer interest in our solutions that integrate panels, workstations and image processing software. As well, emerging X-ray systems manufacturers in China and Korea are designing our digital imaging components into their products and setting the stage for further growth.","Net orders for the Other category were $22 million for the quarter versus $7 million in the year-ago quarter helped by a $12 million order from Smiths for 25 compact accelerators that will be used in their mobile cargo screening systems.","Third quarter revenues for the Other category were $30 million compared with $32 million in the year-ago quarter. We're excited about new product developments in the Security business that we expect could lead to more growth in this business in 2014.","On the proton therapy front, work continued on the Scripps installation in San Diego, where the first patient treatment is slated to begin later this calendar year. We did not book any new orders for proton therapy installations during the quarter. The pipeline continues to look good, but the timing of financing for deals is very difficult to predict.","Now, I'll turn it over to Elisha.","Elisha W. Finney","Thanks, Dow, and hello, everyone. Dow has already walked you through how net orders were affected by the sharp decline of the yen. I'll simply add that there was a negligible effect from the euro and other currencies.","I'll focus now on revenues and the rest of the P&L, as well as the balance sheet and cash flows. Third quarter revenues for the total company increased 3% in dollars and 4% in constant currency. Japan is our second largest national market, and virtually the entire effect of the yen decline was felt in our Oncology business, where we sell in local currency. Our X-ray Products business sells almost exclusively in dollars.","While we're on the topic of the weakened yen, we estimate that EPS was negatively impacted by about $0.04 in our third quarter and could total about $0.06 for the full fiscal year.","Going back to revenues, oncology Systems posted a 3% increase during the quarter, with 53% of revenues coming from outside North America. In BRIC countries, oncology revenue growth was a strong 25%. For both the quarter and year-to-date, BRIC revenues represented about 10% of the total oncology business.","X-ray Products posted a revenue gain of 7% with low double-digit growth in panels and mid-single-digit growth in tubes. X-ray tube revenues were lighter than we expected due to the previously mentioned inventory adjustments among Japanese customers. Revenues from businesses under the Other category decreased by $3 million. We recorded $7 million of proton revenue as percentage of completion accounting continued for our projects at Scripps, Saudi Arabia and Russia.","While I'm talking about the Proton business, let me update you on our expectations regarding the balance of this fiscal year. As I mentioned in last quarter's call, we estimated annual proton therapy revenues of about $80 million including $40 million of higher-margin revenue from the project in Maryland. Given that our customer there has not yet completed financing for this project, we are removing this from our revenue projections for this fiscal year and estimating that this will reduce net earnings per share by about $0.06 for the year.","Returning to the P&L walk, the third quarter gross margin for the company was 42.8%. Oncology Systems gross margin was 43.7%, down from the year-ago quarter by 60 basis points but includes the $3 million impact of the medical device excise tax. Year-to-date, even with higher revenue growth outside North America and the impact of the yen, Oncology Systems gross margin is 43.5%.","X-ray Products gross margin for the quarter was 39.8%, down almost 6 points from the record year-ago quarter. X-rays margins were hurt by a tube warranty issue that we believe has largely been resolved, as well as continued pricing pressure in our flat panel business. Year-to-date, the X-ray Products gross margin is 41.3%.","Third quarter SG&A expenses were $102 million or 14% of revenues, an improvement of 1 point as a percentage of revenue from the year-ago quarter. Third quarter R&D expenses were $53 million or 7% of revenues, about even as a percentage of revenue with the year-ago quarter. Year-to-date, combined operating expenses have been running at about 22% of revenue.","Moving down the income statement. Third quarter operating earnings totaled $155 million, up 1% from the year-ago quarter in dollars and down 0.5 point to 21.3% of revenues. Year-to-date, the operating margin was 20.6% almost even with the year-ago period, a big win considering the impact of the restructuring charges in Q1 and Q2, the excise tax and the yen decline.","Depreciation and amortization totaled $15 million for the quarter. The effective tax rate was 27.6% for the quarter, and for the full fiscal year, we estimate that the tax rate will approach 29%. Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased by 3 million shares from the year-ago quarter to 109.8 million due to our ongoing share repurchase program. Including an estimated $0.04 impact from the weakening of the yen and a $0.02 impact from the excise tax, diluted EPS rose 7% to $1.03.","Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $766 million, debt of $174 million, and stockholders' equity of $1.7 billion. DSO at 84 was up 4 days from the year-ago quarter, but down 3 days from the previous quarter as collections were strong. Third quarter cash flow from operations was a record $198 million, significantly higher than net income due to working capital improvements stemming from accounts receivable and advanced payments. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations was $300 million.","Primary use of cash during the quarter, was $95 million for stock repurchases. At the end of the quarter, we had 4 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2013.","Before turning it back to Dow, I want to let you know that Varian's board has approved negotiations to secure a $500 million 5-year term loan, which we expect to execute in our fiscal fourth quarter. This loan will be in addition to a $300 million revolving credit facility. The proceeds will be used to pay down our existing credit facility, to fund ongoing share repurchases, and for general corporate purposes.","Now I'll turn it back to Dow for the outlook.","Dow R. Wilson","Thanks, Elisha. We remain confident in the strength of our core businesses. However, the sharp decline in the yen as well as uncertain timing of revenues from a proton therapy project in Maryland that has not completed its financing are leading us to adjust our expectations for the balance of the year. We now believe that for fiscal year 2013, total company revenues could increase by about 5% over the fiscal year 2012 total. Net earnings per diluted share for fiscal year 2013 could be in the range of $4 to $4.04.","We're now ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Amit Hazan of SunTrust bank.","Amit Hazan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask the first question on stereotactic reimbursement. I think there's still a lot of confusion out there kind of maybe disbelief out there, so I want to ask you to clarify the point. And as I look at what CMS did, it seems to me that they essentially consolidated cobalt, robotic and Linac into a new set of codes. And in doing so, if we think about where these codes were last year, so not including the fiscal cliff deal, cobalt and robotic got something like a low-single digit increase, but Linac-based stereotactic, which was significantly lower previously, is now lumped into the same cobalt, robotic category and will get something like 50% to 100% increase because of the lumping in. Is that essentially correct? And if so, how much more comfortable does it make you as you think about the next year in the North American market?","Dow R. Wilson","That is correct, Amit. And I guess, from the top I should say that this is a proposal, and there will be debate and dialogue on these proposals in Washington until they're finalized in November and implemented January 1. If they do stand, yes, you're absolutely right. That would be a fairly big increase for Linac-based SRS. So if it remains, I think it's very good news, and we're hopeful that it also may help encourage a replacement of older technology that these kinds of treatment applications are difficult to do on and drive an upgrade cycle. And of course, it also -- it's consistent with what happened in law earlier this year, and that is a premium between -- premium for cobalt systems goes away and it equalizes Linac versus cobalt-based reimbursement. And that is of course, what the law was requiring earlier this year.","Amit Hazan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then I just want to ask -- I know you're not giving fiscal '14 guidance yet, but maybe just a general modeling question as we think about how to think about that year. If oncology backlog is up mid-single digits, which seems to be up about 7% right now, and obviously, it does not include much service, which is obviously growing even faster, is it fair to assume that, that's going to be kind of the leading indicator for how to think about growth next year? It's based on those metrics and also maybe a little bit of the proton now moving to '14 as well?","Elisha W. Finney","Yes. I mean, I think it's fair, Amit, that you obviously consider the backlog because the time in backlog on average is about anywhere from 12 to 18 months. But I think if you use 12 months as a general rule, that's great. Of course, currency can impact that pretty significantly. But if you have the backlog, it's 6% for oncology and then services growing faster than that. I believe our X-ray Products business over the long term will return to double-digit growth. We're seeing a temporary inventory adjustment in our tube business, but we feel very confident about that business over the long term. And then same -- and same with SIP, and then of course the wildcard is proton therapy. We feel confident about that business going forward over the long term. It's just the timing of revenues can be very, very difficult to predict given percentage of completion and financing.","Amit Hazan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just one last question on gross margin. Obviously, the oncology gross margin was very good considering the geographic mix. And I'm just wondering, as we think about that over the next 12 to 18 months, I know the international orders have been growing faster, so in terms of the mix within that international, is that something that you're concerned about at all, or relatively speaking, should we be thinking about a similar gross margin profile for the oncology business going forward?","Elisha W. Finney","Yes, but as we've said once we hit the reset last year, we believe -- I mean the goal is that oncology can maintain their gross margin in the 43% to 44% level as service and software grow fast, and as we have this continued shift to emerging markets. I mean, to have 25% growth in BRIC in the quarter and to turn in their gross margin was really, really good performance. If you look at for the full fiscal year, again, we think the margin is going to be about even with the year-ago period despite $8 million of excise tax, the impacts of the yen. So they have done a really good job at reducing variable cost and being able to maintain the gross margin even as we become more of a global company.","Dow R. Wilson","Yes. And I think when you kind of step back and look at the overall initiatives of the company, 2 of our big 5 are exactly what we're talking about. Globalization and expanding in emerging markets is a big deal for us. We're putting up good growth in those markets. We want to keep feeding that and growing that. And then of course, as a piece of that, is we want to work on the margin rate, and our oncology business has got very good traction at driving some variable cost productivity and getting cost, but frankly, all of our product down. I think, probably about a year ago, we talked a little bit about our TrueBeam product cost and some of the initiatives that we had there. We've got good traction on TrueBeam, and we're translating those initiatives across our product lines. So we're hoping to offset some of that margin difference between our emerging market business and the U.S. business by increased focus on productivity. And then as well across the business in the X-ray business, we saw some margin pressure this quarter, and overall, they're looking at viable cost productivity as well as base-cost productivity and have done a very good job at managing cost.","Operator","The next question is from Amit Bhalla of Citibank.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Question just on oncology in the quarter. Can you just help me reconcile the revenue performance? Was it all yen related, or was there any delays in acceptance of systems in the oncology business that led to the miss in revenue?","Elisha W. Finney","No, it was -- the lion's share of it was just yen. The entire effect of the yen was felt in our oncology business. If you look back at Q3 revenue guidance versus where we came in, roughly -- if I take the midpoint, about a $25 million short, of which the yen was $10 million, our X-Ray and SIP business combined was $10 million, and the rest of it's just a rounding error in oncology.","Dow R. Wilson","Yes, and I think we said it in the script, but it's probably worth emphasizing. Our X-ray business prices all of its product to Japan in dollars, so we don't see the yen currency impact in our X-ray business.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then, secondly, on the order book, as you move into the fiscal fourth quarter now that reimbursement is proposed, and that's not lingering right now, how do you think about fiscal fourth quarter for oncology orders?","Dow R. Wilson","We're going to go after every one of them. I mean, I think -- what are we seeing? When you kind of stand back and look at it, the reimbursement is good news. Obviously, it is a proposal. It's not final, so there's a fair amount of uncertainty about that. The freestanding market has been very, very quiet for a long time. Our view is that impact is more less anniversary-ed in the business now, but we are having more and more discussions with customers on SRS and SBRT. Whether those -- that reimbursement rate sticks remains to be seen, but it's still good news in whatever form it comes back. It's good news for Linac-based SRS and SBRT. And I'd say that we're having a lot of conversations with customers around new technology. And that's a positive thing. And I think the thing to remember is this is application based. People are excited about the developments that are happening in lung cancer and in some of these new areas. And the evidence, the clinical evidence is growing, and that's a very positive thing for our industry.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Elisha, can I just clarify one point? You just talked about -- you just talked about backlog in oncology is up 6% as a leading indicator, but how do you reconcile that with oncology orders looking to be down about 1% for the year? How is that not part of the leading indicator?","Elisha W. Finney","Yes, well, I mean, because the revenue was coming a little lighter than expected as well, given some of the currency issues. So I mean backlog is a cumulative number, so this is looking at cumulative orders minus cumulative revenues, different baselines. And now, it remains to be seen how we end Q4 with the backlog, but as we sit here today looking 12 months out, I think that 6% is a fairly good indicator of systems sales for oncology.","Operator","The next question is from Jeremy Feffer of Cantor Fitzgerald.","Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","First, I just want to come back to sort of bigger picture on the U.S. hospital situation. I mean obviously, we've seen the same trends pretty much all 3 quarters now. What -- I guess, in very broad terms, what do you see as the inflection point? I guess now we have a little more clarity on reimbursement. We'll be heading into a new budgeting cycle for a lot of hospitals certainly this quarter or next. Where do you see the inflection point? And how do you see this thing turning around?","Dow R. Wilson","Here's kind of my view of it, Jeremy. I think the long-term trends are all very, very good. There's a lot of old equipment out there. There's new applications going on. I think in the long term, even in the U.S. we're in very good shape. We've seen some independent studies done that suggest that SRS and SBRT are driving a long-term buying cycle and people are lining up budgets on a long-term basis to invest in new technology. So we're encouraged about that. In the short term, there's a lot of consolidation going on. People are -- like the example I cited in the call, people are looking at more integration in their networks. I think there's still some uncertainty over what long-term health care reform means, and how that's going to impact our industry in the short term. The freestanding market is very, very quiet. I don't see that changing in the short term. Maybe as the reimbursement decisions finalize, maybe we'll see some change there. But anyway to kind of go around the horn, I think North America is going to be very much the kind of market that we've seen for this past year. We might be seeing a little slight thawing of not a great market. We've seen pretty good strength out of Europe, and we had a very good quarter this past quarter in the U.K. That's going to be hard to repeat, but we have seen continued strength in the Middle East, in Northern Africa and in Eastern Europe. So that's positive. Asia, we had a very good quarter in both Japan and China. We had a very tough comp in kind of the rest of Asia but -- and then of course, you heard about the yen issue. But I think the Asia business is going to continue very strong for us. Emerging markets for us are up double digit, and we think we can continue to drive that. So I think that the overall for oncology, when you net that all out with a good service business, it's probably a mid-single-digit grower. With the X-ray business growing long-term double digits, some upside in protons. Obviously, we've got this emerging market growth, and then maybe some risk around currency. We think it's a mid- to high-single-digit target scenario that we're looking on for total company.","Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay and then just following up quickly on the hospital side. Comment a little bit, if you can, on the pricing environment, because you talked about facility consolidation, obviously, delays in purchasing decisions. You have a new competitor or a competitor with a new product out there. How does the pricing environment look from where you sit right here?","Dow R. Wilson","Pricing is holding. We're comfortable with the price levels. And as Elisha said, we've managed, from a margin point of view, our gross margins are holding, excluding the excise tax. And we're comfortable where the price levels are.","Operator","The next question is from Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Dow, in your commentary, I didn't catch it, but I wonder if you have one, an estimate of what in the proposed rule the hospital reimbursement basket might be up. Did you guys put a figure to that?","Dow R. Wilson","I mean it depends on everybody's mix, so we've been encouraging customers to kind of take their own mix through the model. The bottom line is SRS and IMRT are up and could even be at a double-digit kind of rate. And then there's other puts and takes. What we like about the proposal is it encourages more conformal, advanced treatments, and that's the deal. There's very substantial evidence on the advantages of IMRT, and especially in prostate and head and neck, and this supports those advantages. And we think in the market that we're looking at, if these hold, it will really help us on a replacement cycle basis.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And so I guess, as you take a step back and you think about the packaging initiative that CMS has spoken to, I got the sense from reading that they were looking for budget neutrality across the program. Is this a signal that they want to treat radiation oncology differently relative to the overall basket? And if so, is that a function of the clinical arguments you're making, or is there some other driver?","Dow R. Wilson","I'm reluctant to speak for them. I think at a very high level across all the baskets, I think that's what they were trying to accomplish. I think as I said, we like very much the proposal as it relates to the support for new technology and treatment applications that are demonstrated with clinical effectiveness, and that's the world that we're going into. So on that basis, I think it's consistent with the other kinds of things we've heard from CMS about comparative effectiveness and actually support some of the initiatives that they're trying to drive.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's very helpful. Then just a couple on housekeeping. I mean one in software, last quarter it sounded like the growth there was, I don't know how to be too precise, but maybe mid-single digits. Was it similar in this quarter? Any better or worse?","Dow R. Wilson","It's pretty close. We are the clear leader in treatment planning. So in treatment planning from a share point of view, doing very, very well. In oncology information systems, it's neck-and-neck with us and Mosaic. We're confident this market will keep growing. There's been some noise around the ARRA-HITECH incentive, and, yes, customers have been taking advantage of that. But there's a couple opportunities that we see in the future. One, there's going to be other ARRA-HITECH levels that people have to qualify for. Second, all of this conversation around comparative effectiveness is driving an informatics discussion. And then third, we have a huge opportunity outside of the U.S. where frankly, oncology information systems have been diffused at a lower rate than the U.S. So we think we still have opportunity in the software business to grow this at double-digit rate.","Operator","The next question is from David Roman of Goldman Sachs.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I know that there have been a few attempts to kind of get at an FY '14 number, but I wanted just to try...","Dow R. Wilson","Want to try one more time?","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I got to try at least one other way and I certainly can appreciate the comment down the longer-term growth in the mid-to high-single digits and you can certainly see that materializing through a combination of more favorable geographic mix, as well as the continued growth in X-ray Products and development in Security and Inspection. But it is sort of a, I guess, a 2-part question, but if I just look at year-to-date orders and backlog, it seems like growth over the immediate term sounds -- is more like a mid-single-digit type number. And then if you're -- if sort of the revenue growth rate were sort of in the 4% to 6% range, what would that sort of portend for the earnings outlook? I mean, can you grow double-digit earnings below 6% top line? And where are the flex -- what are the levers there that could get you through the P&L?","Elisha W. Finney","Yes, so David, let me take a stab at this without giving you guidance into FY '14. I don't see any material changes in the tax rate. It may vary a point up, a point down depending on a geographic mix of products. But you're not going to see a drastic change in the tax rate. What you will see is that the diluted shares outstanding should continue to go down. We announced the $500 million debt facility that we are about to negotiate, we have some commitments for. We plan to pay down the revolver and use the balance to continue with our ongoing share repurchase program, which is somewhere between 1 to 2 million shares per quarter is what we've been averaging. So you should expect that, that will continue and so we will get some leverage on the P&L through our -- through returning capital to shareholders.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then on the gross margin side, X-ray, obviously, took a big step down this quarter. You did cite a onetime dynamic in your prepared remarks, but you also talked about underlying pricing pressure. I know that the margins there had sort of spiked up pretty significantly. What sort of -- is the trend -- can you keep X-ray margins kind of flattish from the year-to-date level? Or are those going to have a downward bias to them?","Elisha W. Finney","Well, that's our goal. They have a lot of cost controls and they've had a lot of quality improvements in the X-ray business. We were at a record level in the year-ago period. It was unsustainable at 45%. I think the low 40s is something that we can expect to continue as we go into FY '14 in this business. It is a volume business. So as sales start to pick up, you do see that fall through their gross margin quite nicely. And that's both true in tubes and panels. So while we do have some pricing pressure in panels, it is still a higher-margin product line than the tube. So if it grows faster than the tubes as we expect, it should also help the gross margin balance overall. So I'm pretty confident that in the low 40s, we should be able to maintain that.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then just to make sure I understand the crosswalk between the prior earnings guidance and the revised earnings guidance, I think you cited $0.04 from -- before I think, $0.06 from the Maryland order and then -- or a couple of pennies from currency. Is that the entirety of the delta from your prior expectations?","Elisha W. Finney","Well, so there for the full year, we believe the impact of the yen is about $0.06 versus the prior guidance that we gave, and that would be in Q3 and Q4. And that the Maryland project is also $0.06, so a total of a $0.12 impact from those 2 items. You'll see that we've taken the midpoint, the low, the high and the midpoint of the guidance down by $0.10. So what we're saying is if it weren't for these 2 things, we think we would be at the top end of our prior guidance or slightly ahead. The temporary issues that we're facing in X-ray, we think we've covered through pretty significant cost controls and -- as a total company. And you saw SG&A came down as a percentage of sales in the quarter, should tick back up to about even year-over-year. So we -- if the only thing we were dealing with, were the X-ray temporary problems, we would have that more than covered, but these 2 other things are pretty significant.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then last one, just for Dow, on the deal you signed in the Southeast, can you maybe just talk about how you think that type of selling strategy or that type of market dynamic plays out over time? And it sounds as if -- first, I think that you've highlighted a specific deal of that nature on the call. Maybe -- are we very early in that transition? Maybe -- how does that -- does that change market dynamics? And how should we think about the opportunity there?","Dow R. Wilson","I think it's a continuing trend, David. We have been talking a little bit about consolidation and integration. Those would be the 2 trends. Consolidation on the customer side, for those of you in New York City, Mount Sinai and Continuum of -- got their merger approved this week. That's more on the hospital side, but even then they have a network. And as they bring their networks together, they will be interested in sharing information across their networks to drive informatics and comparative effectiveness. This particular customer in the southeast was a combination of hospital and outpatient settings. And I think, on the one hand, it makes the negotiation tougher because they kind of lengthen out. We don't love that part of it. But on the IT side, it actually gives us a very good opportunity, and we like that aspect of it a lot because people are really looking at how do they integrate their systems so they can get better productivity and efficiency in their departments. And we are the productivity, versatility and efficiency leaders in the industry and so that aspect of it, I think, actually is very favorable to us. It does make negotiations a little longer and more complex, but I think at the end of it, it's very good for us. I think in the software space, you heard me briefly mention this new product we call FullScale, which is kind of a private cloud for our customers. It variablizes [ph] their hardware investment and we kind of manage the department for them in the IT space. It's not a perfect kind of SaaS, software-as-a-service, model but pretty close and our customers are responding very well to that, and I think we'll see a lot of that as we see this kind of consolidation and integration trend come together.","Operator","The next question is from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question on the proton. Was this purely a financing issue or were there other factors there? And maybe can you just address kind of the need for more clinical data around proton and how you think about your role in maybe facilitating studies and trials?","Dow R. Wilson","Sure. I mean, it is purely a financing issue. There's nothing else at play there and just kind of stuck on timing of pulling that financing together. The -- in terms of our role long term, we think there are some indications where proton is very well indicated and a lot of the conversation in these centers is around those indications. It's clear that as we move to a comparative effectiveness world, playing a big role in -- bigger role and a big role in clinical studies that demonstrate that effectiveness better. Whether it's proton, SBRT, SRS, IMRT, image guidance, Calypso beacons or otherwise, we're going to have to demonstrate that clinical effectiveness better than we have in the past and it will be a growing investment area for us.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Can you talk a little bit about EDGE, what the order book looks like and just in terms of mix of customers? Are these competitive swap-outs? Are they neurosurgeons versus rad oncs? And talk about timing on CE. I think you'd said by year end. Is that still on track?","Dow R. Wilson","Yes. I think we're -- again, as I said in the call, right now it's pretty much a U.S. market discussion. We do not have the CE Mark yet and we do not have Shonin in Japan, so we're still working on those. But in the U.S., we're seeing very good uptake. We have seen some CyberKnife replacements so we're thrilled about that. We are seeing growth over our historical BrainLAB business and pretty substantial growth over our -- over last year's offerings. So we're up there. And we're also seeing very good traction in the upgrade market as people upgrade. So it's -- it is the most efficient and cost-effective SRS tool on the market. With the new reimbursement, maybe we'll see expanded growth there next year, depending on how that's finalized. And we are seeing also -- we're having a number of conversations with thoracic surgeons as they figure out what this means for lung cancers. So we're -- I mean, we're still kind of in the market development. We have seen some good traction and it's growing based on historical business and pretty substantially. And in the U.S., we're kind of right where we thought we'd be, if not a little bit ahead, and we'd like to get the global traction going and are working on the regulatory approvals for that.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Then you called out China in the comments. Can you talk about the size of your installed base now in mix? How much of this is TrueBeam? And obviously, you've got UNIQUE approved there now, too. Is that starting to get some traction?","Dow R. Wilson","We're growing very well in China. We had another double-digit quarter in China, so we're pleased with the growth there. We've got a new leadership team in China that we're very encouraged about. So we're expanding distribution. And I think we're going to keep growing. We do have approval for UNIQUE and TrueBeam in China. We -- the prospects are good and we see continued growth in that market. The installed base, it's off the top of my head, our installed base, 300-ish units. If I'm really wrong, I'll send out a note, but the -- it's about 300-ish units and most of these are in new vaults. So it's all installed base growth and we're starting to see some service growth in that business as these units come out of warranty. The TrueBeam penetration in that market is still fairly small, so there is a high end of that market. So I'd say we're selling a couple every quarter or so TrueBeams in that market, and we're seeing nice traction. We do think there's a few more regulatory hurdles for us to address with TrueBeam and some of its new products like EDGE. And as we get that regulatory approval, we'll even see further expansion of that brand in China.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And 1 or 2 quick ones for Elisha. With SG&A down, were there additional cost cuts? Or can you just maybe talk to the SG&A being down here?","Elisha W. Finney","I'm sorry, I'm having a little bit of a hard time hearing you, Tycho. You're talking about the variability in the SG&A, yes.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, the fact that it was down.","Elisha W. Finney","Yes, we did a lot of variability. If I'm going to take a guess, that we're roughly 60% fixed, 40% variable costs. And depending on hiring, trade shows, travel, legal, you name it, FX, you can get some pretty big shifts. I think what happened is, as you know, we had a restructuring charge in Q1 and Q2. We had 80-some-odd people and we didn't hire all of those replacements on day 1. It was kind of a slow build as we went through the quarter. So I think you're going to see it go up in Q4. We have our largest trade show in Q4 this year and it's always just bigger because with commissions and whatnot. So I think for the year, it will be maybe a little bit of leverage but pretty close to what we had in the last fiscal year as a percentage of revenue.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then with the term loan, it sounds like -- you did mention potentially additional share repurchases. Any thoughts on whether you would do an ASR? And you did mention dividends, but I assume that, that's something that's...","Elisha W. Finney","Well, I said we were going to use it to do our typical share repurchase program, which is that 1 to 2 million shares per quarter. We have been using virtually all the cash that we generate in the U.S. on our share repurchase plus drawing down under our revolver. This gives us the ability to pay down the revolver, use those proceeds going forward and keep our $300 million revolving line of credit as it should be, kind of as an insurance policy. We have done ASRs in the past. It's kind of the best of all worlds. You can mirror a traditional buyback over some period of time. You get a discount to the weighted average purchase price. We reduce shares up front. And in the very low borrowing environment we're in today, it really kind of makes sense to pay that in advance. So to be determined, we have not decided anything along those lines so this is not an announcement by any means. We should finish our negotiations and have the debt in place by the end of Q4 and we'll know more after that.","Operator","The next question is from Jason Wittes of Brean Capital.","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Dow, I want to revisit -- you got a lot of questions on reimbursement, but one thing that you did say which piqued my interest is that if the codes stay as they are, especially at the hospital level, or specifically at the hospital level, we could actually see a resurgence or replacements of -- as people move towards SRS. Is that kind of your feeling? And is that something that we should be looking for in November when the rates finally do get finalized?","Dow R. Wilson","We're all going to be looking hard at the rates as they close out. If they remain as proposed, it looks like a double-digit increase for SRS and SBRT, at least Linac based, and that would be positive news for our customers. So these things always take a while to kind of work their way into budgets. Most of our customers are on a 1-year budget cycle and how this impacts them and what timing they push given the the broader capital health care environment is kind of the question. I think, from our point of view, if these remain, that will be a positive thing for our customers in replacing -- especially some of this older technology that you can do SRS or SBRT on, but it's very slow and very inefficient and you can do it much better with modern technology.","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","When you say modern, you're just talking about TrueBeam or...","Dow R. Wilson","TrueBeam and EDGE, yes.","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","And EDGE. So that would be -- mean -- basically, I would assume something like 80% of the installed base would look to potentially upgrade. Is that a fair estimate?","Dow R. Wilson","Maybe even higher.","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just to touch on that as well. Your comments last quarter about, basically, a year of sort of 0% growth in the U.S., it doesn't -- it's probably too early to make a call as to whether these reimbursement proposals will make a difference in that. Is that a fair assumption?","Dow R. Wilson","As you know, we don't give orders guidance. I mean, just -- we talk markets a little bit. I think the U.S. market, at least in the short term, we don't see changing dramatically from where it's been. We think Asia is going to remain strong. Europe, we're always kind of watching Western Europe to see what it does. We've managed to hold or even do a little bit better. We had a terrific quarter this quarter in Europe. We're a little measured about what that is long term. But we've seen very good growth in Eastern Europe, very good growth in the Middle East, very good growth in Turkey. And so if Western Europe can hold, our map of Europe should be okay. So the U.S. market is -- it's a question mark, and at least at this point in time, in the short term, it's -- our performance so far this year is probably a pretty good indication of where the market is in the short term.","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just one quick clarification. For the proton order, which is delayed due to financing, that, I assume, is still a near-term event, something that should happen in next couple of quarters? Or how should we be thinking about that?","Dow R. Wilson","Yes. The financing is not complete so we haven't booked the order yet. The construction is in progress, so there's a very nice building in Baltimore underway. They're nearly ready to receive the equipment. It's a fairly large order for us and -- but we're not exactly share when they'll complete financing. So we've obviously got to think through that as we complete our guidance calculation next quarter but with, hopefully, over the course of the quarter, we'll have some new information to give us a little better feeling about where to guide that order.","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","But I guess just -- it sounds more like a question of when as opposed to if. Is that fair?","Dow R. Wilson","We're hoping.","Operator","The next question is from Anthony Petrone of Jefferies Group.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","A question just on the guidance you issued for the full year and how that plays out for the fourth quarter. I think if you go ahead and model out 5% growth for the year, you're calling for about 2.5% growth for the fourth quarter. And so in dollar terms, it's about a $55 million delta relative to consensus where it stands now. And Elisha, you called out a $40 million impact in proton. So I'm just trying to reconcile how the balance shakes out when we look at FX again, specifically. And on -- in U.S. Oncology, is there anything in there in the way of softness for the fourth quarter as well?","Elisha W. Finney","Right. So you mentioned it, Anthony, $40 million for Maryland, which will presumably come out of fourth quarter. The temporary issues in X-ray, we're assuming, are going to continue at least partly into the fourth quarter. Based on our history, these things tend to last 1 to 2 quarters. So between X-ray and a little bit in SIP, I'm assuming down $10 million. The yen is probably another impact of maybe $5 million. Most of our Japanese sales occur in Q2 and Q3. We do have a large service business though, so we will see some impact in the fourth quarter. We're thinking about $5 million. So that kind of -- that bridges the delta as to where we are and where we thought we would be for the quarter.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Fair enough, fair enough. And then maybe just another question that relates to margins for next year, Dow, you mentioned last quarter that about 300 TrueBeams would be out of warranty over the next 18 months, so we're 3 months into that. So how many TrueBeams have come out of warranty and are on the higher-priced service contracts? And assuming we do get all 300 out of warranty into next year, what do you think the impact on gross margin could be?","Dow R. Wilson","We haven't looked at it recently, but what I can tell you is that we have basically a TrueBeam coming out of warranty per workday over the next year. So that's the math. That business is now $700 million, $750 million-ish and so we see it growing at a continued double-digit rate. And the team's doing a great job chasing the contracts, and our contract capture rate on TrueBeams is very high, 75% to 80%-ish.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And the premium on TrueBeam service contract is relative to...","Dow R. Wilson","It depends how it's configured. But in general terms, it's probably 15% to 20% higher.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Great, great. And this is just a question, actually, on the freestanding clinic. So I'm full well understanding it's only 5% of the business now, but you have OnCure filing for bankruptcy in the quarter, and it seems that Radiation Therapy Services is close to consolidating that company. Is that represent a potential order next year? Or how do you think about the consolidation?","Dow R. Wilson","I don't think it'll represent an incremental order for us. I think you'd have to talk to the guys at 21st Century, but I think that they'll -- this is a good acquisition for them and expands their network and gives them an opportunity to think about some of their own -- I think it's another example of some of the consolidation trends that we're seeing out there, and clearly, they're interested in same-store sales and they're interested in incremental stores. And this will give them an opportunity to kind of consolidate their position in some of those markets and look at where they may have duplicative services and can drive efficiency or look at those places where they can try to get a bigger footprint in the market. So I think it's something that, in this particular segment, we've seen for a while so I actually -- OnCure had some specific financial aspects to it, but in terms of the consolidation that's going on in the freestanding market, that's not new news. We've seen a fair amount of that over the last 2 or 3 years.","Operator","The next question is from Jeff Johnson of Robert W. Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Dow, most of my questions have been answered. Let me just ask, I guess, 2 follow-ups. One, going back to some of the reimbursement stuff, you've hedged it about every way you can. You just sound a little skeptical to me on whether or not you think some of these big increases, especially maybe on the SRS side, maybe on the IMRT side, are going to stay in place so they don't get rolled back in November. So just wondering kind of your thoughts there.","Dow R. Wilson","I'll apologize to our international listeners, but I'm from Missouri and I'm -- in the Show Me State, you got to see it, and this is a proposal. And so yes, we are hedging a little bit. We like what's come out. We think it's good but we'll feel a lot better when it's final. So it's -- there's always a little bit of uncertainty around these. We've seen a move in the past a little bit and we just want to be conservative about how we feel about this and, at least in the short term, as I said at the beginning, we are seeing some SRS, SBRT movement in the market. My own gut is that's as much clinical as it is reimbursement-driven. This is the right thing to do. We got a good approach for lung cancer. There's a growing body of clinical data. We've got some data from some independent sources that say people are looking at purchasing, that -- there's an IMV study out there that people are looking at SRS and SBRT purchases and they're also looking at replacements of IMRT devices. And it's kind of some encouraging news and, frankly, that survey was done before the reimbursement news came out. So kind of put that together with the reimbursement news, there is reason to be optimistic. I think our customers are from Missouri and so they're going to wait and see what happens in the final ruling, and if this sticks, it will be very positive news.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And maybe it's a naive question, but when we get those November final rates and you kind of read-through who was pro; who was con; why they argued different sides of it. Who's going to be arguing against higher rates?","Dow R. Wilson","I'm not sure.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I mean, why would it maybe get rolled back significantly? I can see when the lobbying groups go out there and argue against the rate cuts. But when CMS proposes some rate increases, I guess, I just have a harder time figuring out who might be on the opposite side of that.","Dow R. Wilson","I mean, there's a number of things at play here. Clearly, one of the aspects with SRS and SBRT is maybe you'll get lower costs by doing fewer fractions. But clearly, the initiative here is on the payer side, who is going to pay for this? And that's Congress, CMS, insurance companies. Those are the folks that are looking at, okay, there are some increases here, how are we going to pay for this in the context of everything that's going on? And as we've said here before and continue to believe, radiation therapy is a terrific approach for cancer care. It's very economic, very low cost, relatively noninvasive on patients and a growing body of outstanding clinical evidence in new cancer sites. So we think there's a reason to support it, but it's going to be, how do you pay for it?","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","All right. Fair enough. And then we have heard some rumblings maybe under a bundled initiative like you're seeing, if hospitals aren't sure who's going to get paid for the daily TQ or whatever you call it, the daily physics that are performed on these machines and all that, that there could be some pushout. Just purely a -- not necessarily on orders, but on order acceptances in the near term, any truth to that? Or how do you feel the revenue side, not the order side, could play out in the near term until we get some finalization there?","Dow R. Wilson","I've seen no impact from that and I haven't even heard a whisper from our customers, da nada [ph].","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. And Elisha, just one quick follow-up for you. Just if yen was a $0.04 hit relative to last time you guided $0.04 hit this quarter, $0.02 hit next quarter, at least in my math the yen is going to be an even bigger drag year-over-year next quarter than the third quarter. So why is the incremental impact only $0.02 next quarter versus $0.04 this quarter?","Elisha W. Finney","Because most of our sales in Japan occur in Q2 and Q3. They take delivery of their machine around their fiscal year, which is the end of March, and so we get a lot of shipments and installations in that period of time. And then that's where we saw the drastic 20% reduction -- decline in the yen. If we moving into Q4, it's probably closer to $0.02 because, again, it's really just our service business that's going to be impacted as opposed to a lot of equipment sales.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And not that you're guiding '14, but would it be the same kind of 1, 2? It looks like the year-over-year drag is going to be about the same from change a yen. So would the Q1 hold as well?","Elisha W. Finney","Until we anniversary, and hopefully, we are back at 80% by Q3 next year. It's just a lot of variability right now. Unfortunately, we saw it with the euro last year. That has now tended to stabilize and it's holding. Hopefully, we will start to see some stability in the yen as well.","Operator","The next question is from Charley Jones of Barrington Research.","Charley R. Jones - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","So I have about 6 questions, but I'll try and keep it to 2 here. The first one is, I guess, a little bit of history, if you wouldn't mind spending it on reimbursement. When I think back about reimbursement, I think about these 40% decreases proposed that always get cut in half or 1\/3 and it's been going on for a decade, it seems like. And yet they increased it double digits this year. So I don't know how much you talk to them but I'm a little bit confused in this. I think it's probably the differentiation of SVT and radiation and whatnot, but did they overshoot on the downside and so we are kind of due for some increases in reimbursement? Or what clinical studies have been done that would really validate a double-digit increase?","Dow R. Wilson","I think the...","Charley R. Jones - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","And if you wouldn't mind spending [ph] a little bit of history, has there been any decreases in reimbursement in these line items over the last 5 years?","Dow R. Wilson","There's been -- the general decline over the last several years has been, call it, 2% to 5-ish percent and so that's kind of been the history. It's -- I think for SRS and SBRT, there's a -- there's growing clinical evidence. For lung cancer, this could be a cheaper way, as you compare it to alternatives, although we have not been party to any of those studies. So short version is we don't know exactly what CMS' thinking was other than, in a comparative effectiveness world, these are new treatment paradigms that are very effective and lower cost. And when you look at it, especially on a cost per patient basis over time, it's probably very good for them. So we are not party to that conversation. So this is pure Dow conjecture, just for the record, but we do talk to them regularly, but we don't always know. The system isn't overcome with transparency, but I see on these new treatment sites, they're trying to support the new technology, especially where it makes a cost comparative impact, and that's certainly what this new proposal shows.","Charley R. Jones - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then real quick follow-up on that. You guys had some kind of confusing information out there a little bit ago about costs that rolled up into their reimbursement equation for proton. So curious if there's any update there. But my real -- really, my second question was about Elekta. We didn't really talk about it much. They had decent growth. Just curious, are they acting kind of more rationally and recognizing -- just kind of curious how you see your growth relative to theirs and -- on any geographic basis and whether or not it seems like a more reasonable environment is starting here?","Spencer R. Sias","So before Dow tackles those 2 questions, we'll just say those are the final 2 questions that we've got. We've overrun the call here. And so Dow, take it away.","Dow R. Wilson","Yes, on proton reimbursement, the proposal is up from where it was revised downward to last year but doesn't return all the way to where it was the year before. So it's mixed positive news. In terms of Elekta, I think both Varian and Elekta are winning share from replacing the Siemens share that's gone out of the market, as well as Accuray and TomoTherapy. We continue to see them be aggressive and that's probably what I could say at this point in time.","Spencer R. Sias","So thank you all for participating.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Spencer Sias, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications for Varian Medical Systems. Thank you, Mr. Sias. You may begin.","Spencer Sias","Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Varian Medical Systems conference call for the first quarter of fiscal year 2015. With me are Dow Wilson, President and CEO; Elisha Finney, CFO; and Clarence Verhoef, our Corporate Controller. Dow and Elisha will summarize our results and we will take your questions following the presentation.","To simplify our discussion, unless otherwise stated, all references to the quarter or year are fiscal quarters and fiscal years, quarterly comparisons are for the first quarter of fiscal year 2015 versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 represents to financial results for orders are to gross orders unless otherwise indicated.

Some of the important risks relating to our business are described in our first quarter earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements in this presentation and discussion, because of new information, future events, or otherwise.","And now, here is Dow.","Dow Wilson","Good afternoon and welcome. We are reporting solid results for the first quarter of 2015 with healthy revenue, orders and earnings growth. In summary, we are reporting net earnings of $0.92 per diluted share including $0.07 restructuring charge. Revenues of $738 million up 4% or up 6% on a constant currency basis, expected oncology service revenues of $254 million and 81 basis points improvement in the company\u2019s gross margin of 44.3% of sales strong orders in our major businesses and 13% increase in our quarter ending backlog to $3.1 billion. Oncology Systems order totaled $562 million for the quarter up 5% or up 8% on a constant currency basis on a trailing 12 months basis worldwide reported Oncology orders grew by 5%. Consistent with recent geographic re-organization of the oncology systems business will consolidate the rest of world region into three geographic regions. The Americas, APAC and EMEA for comparison purposes the earnings release contains a table providing quarterly results for these regions for 2013 and 2014.","In the first quarter of 2015 oncology orders grows 17% in APAC and 12% in EMEA while declining by 2% in the Americas. In North America orders sell by 3% versus strong 13% growth in the year ago quarter. Robust APAC order performance is driven mainly by China where orders grew by 42% with the help of a tender win with the CLA. Market in China appears to be returning to more typical investment levels on the period of delays and uncertainty. During the quarter, the SSDA ran an approval for Varian to supply our Edge radiosurgery systems to customer in China. This opens the door for Varian leading technology to address the growing lung cancer burden there. Looking as whole as BRICA of countries of Brazil, Russia, India, China and Africa we achieve first quarter order growth of 30%.","BRICA again accounted for more than 15% of total oncology orders in the quarter. A strong performance in Africa where we booked more than $20 million in orders from project in Algeria, Egypt and South Africa helped our EMEA geographic region achieve orders growth of 12% or 18% on a constant currency basis. Elsewhere in EMEA we saw strong orders performance in France Turkey and Hungry. Turning to Latin America ongoing demand from the private market in Brazil was low as purchases in Columbia helped to drive order growth in the region. ","As I mentioned at the outset, orders in North America decline slightly versus very strong first quarter performance last year with a consolidation in this market we\u2019ve seen great quarter to quarter variability. On a longer term trailing 12 months basis, North America oncology orders grew 4%. At this point the sales funnel looks good. Orders in our oncology service business were robust rising by 14% to $254 million representing 45% of the total oncology systems business during the quarter.","This puts us on course to exceed our goal of reaching $1 billion of service revenue this year. We also made great progress in our software business during the quarter with double-digit growth in treatment planning and oncology information system. We hit a big clinical milestone during the quarter when rapid plan was used for the first time, to planning advance volume our key treatment for 76 year old prostate cancer patient in the UK. Rapid plan makes it easier and faster for clinicians to generate higher quality treatment plan. We\u2019re taking orders for more than 100 rapid plan installations to date.","During the quarter we\u2019re pleased to see a promising new lung study showing improved survival rate using stereotactic body radiation therapy or SBRT in combination with the chemotherapy agent called erlotinib. The study by senior author Dr. Robert Timmerman of UT Southwestern Medical Center in Texas which was partially funded by Varian hit an overall survival times extending from historic six to nine months to 20 months. Result of this Phase II clinical trial involving 24 patients with stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer were published in the journal of clinical oncology of the American society of clinical oncology.","Turning to our imaging component segment, orders rose by a robust 34% to $163 million versus the very week year ago period when orders declined. We saw specially strong growth in our panel business where orders rose by 65%. Among the highlights in our panel business was a big multi-million dollar win with the customer in Korea. We also started commercial shipments of our new customized veterinary and imaging package that includes both panels and workstations. You can see in our 2014 annual report, these wireless panels are being used in the sound echo and portable systems to image thoroughbred horses.","At quarter end, we announced our intention to make an approximate 32 million euro public tender offer to acquire all the shares of MeVis Medical Solutions in Germany. The tender was formally launched yesterday, MeVis develops and supply image analysis software due to screen breast, lung, liver, prostate and colon cancer. We\u2019re about to complete the tender process early in our third quarter, this will be an important step in our strategy to expand the imaging component to software portfolio. The company\u2019s other category comprised of the Varian particle therapy business and the Ginzton technology center recorded orders of $1 million, the sales funnel continues to look good and we submitted five new proton tenders during the quarter.","We made progress on our active proton projects generating $9 million of revenue, our customers financing of the Maryland proton project was not sufficiently completed to enable us to book it during the quarter. ","Before I hand it over to Elisha, I\u2019m pleased to report that as the world economic forum in Davos last week, Varian was included in the global 100 ranking of the world\u2019s most sustainable companies. Varian is a top ranked healthcare equipment company included on the list, we\u2019re proud to be recognized for our commitment and sustainability. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over Elisha.","Elisha Finney","Thanks Dow and hello everyone. While Dow has already covered growth orders I want to talk further about the constant currency growth rate for the quarter. In comparing quarter-over-quarter exchange rates of euro and the yen weakened significantly against the dollar which reduced our total company order growth rate by about two points. Total oncology orders for the quarter increased 5% in dollars and 8% in constant currency. Oncology\u2019s EMEA orders include 12% in dollars and 18% in constant currency. Oncology APAC orders increased 17% in dollars and 23% in constant currency primarily due to the yen.","There was no currency impact in the Americas. The company ended the quarter with a $3.1 billion backlog up 13%. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled to $34 million bringing net orders for the company to $692 million. First quarter revenues for the total company increased 4% in dollars and 6% in constant currency. Oncology posted a 4% gain in revenues during the quarter with significant shift for North America and services. North America constituted 52% of total oncology revenues versus 42% in the year ago quarter. Service revenues grew by 14% over the year ago quarter.","Imaging component posted first quarter revenue growth of 3% with growth in panels and security and inspection products partially offset by declines into. The total company gross margin for the quarter was 44.3% up 81 basis points, oncology systems gross margin improved by 68 basis points to 45.6% due to favorable geographic and product mix. ","While we\u2019re pleased with the margin performance in the quarter, we continue to believe that oncology can sustain long term gross margins in the 43% to 44% range. Imaging component gross margin for the quarter rose 85 basis points to 42.2% due to a higher mix of panels as well improved quality cost. First quarter SG&A expenses were 140 million including an $11 million restructuring charge to reduce headcount. This charge increased SG&A as a percentage of revenues by a 140 basis points in this quarter. SG&A was also impacted by a $5 million increase in our bad debt reserve in the quarter to reflect uncertainty and our ability to exchange our Venezuelan bolivar collections into dollars. First quarter R&D expenses were $57 million or 8% of revenues equal to the year ago quarter as a percentage of revenue.","Moving down the income statement first quarter operating earnings totaled $130 million down from the year ago quarter due in large parts to the restructuring charge. Depreciation and amortization totaled $17 million for the quarter. The effective tax rate was 28.5% down almost three points from the year ago quarter due largely to the R&D tax credit extension granted in late December. We continue to expect that the tax rate will be 28% to 30% for the fiscal year.","Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased almost 6 million from the year ago quarter to $101.6 million due to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted EPS was $0.92 for the quarter including the $0.07 restructuring charge. ","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of 904 million, debt of 525 million and stockholders\u2019 equity of 1.6 billion. ","DSO at 85 improved by nine days from the year ago quarter. First quarter cash flow from operations increased significantly from the year ago quarter to $79 million or 85% of net income. Primary usage of cash was $22 million for CapEx and a $126 million towards the repurchase of 1.5 million shares of stock. AT the end of quarter we had 4.75 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization at expensive calendar year 2015. ","Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Dow for the outlook.","Dow Wilson","Thanks Elisha. The company got up to a good start in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 with revenues and earnings coming in ahead of expectations. Our outlook for the full fiscal year is heavily impacted by the recent dramatic swing in currency exchange rate which we believe will significantly reduce revenues and earnings in the balance of the year. We now believe the total company revenue for fiscal year 2015 will increase about 5%. ","Given our earnings momentum in the first quarter, we believe that we can maintain our prior guidance of $4.16 to $4.26 per diluted share for the fiscal year despite significant currency headwinds. ","Given current exchange rate and the expected timing of shipments in the year we believe total company revenues for the second quarter should increase by about 2% versus the year ago period. Net earnings per diluted share for the second quarter could be in the range of $0.98 or $1.02. ","Our guidance excludes contracted proton projects that are not yet financed or booked into backlog. If these projects are booked during the year, the potential upside in revenues and profits could be significant. We\u2019re now ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Amit Hazan from SunTrust.","Amit Hazan ","Okay. Just a couple of questions I wanted to start with the guidance, if I think about adjusted EPS guidance 5% to 7% excluding the one-time of course that implies essentially negative leverage I think year-over-year giving your share buyback and if I think about how you describe last year is an investment year, why should we see that within the model this year.","Elisha Finney","So Amit when you go through the guidance we\u2019ll be at about sort of full fiscal year 19% operating margin including the $11 million restructuring charge. Once you exclude that we should get closer to about even where we were with the year ago period, understanding that our revenue is coming down significantly due to FX and we don\u2019t get the full offset. So that has something to do with it as well. But, excluding the effects of FX and the restructuring charge we would get leverage in the P&L this year. ","Amit Hazan ","Okay. And maybe let move to currency with sales guidance going essentially from the 5% to 6% growth last quarter, now you have 5%, little bit hard to tell what exactly the currency impacted versus a very nice outperformance, is that would have taken guidance higher, can you walk us through the dollar or the growth impact to expect from FX -- expected last quarter when you gave guidance what that dollar or growth impact is now on a top line, and can you then just to remind us how that goes through your P&L?","Elisha Finney ","Absolutely, so let me give you the walk from the prior guidance to the new guidance and let me preface by saying to simplify it out at start of the midpoint and the year ago guidance and take it to the midpoint in the quarter ago guidance and take you the midpoint today. Just the 50,000 foot level, we\u2019ve really had a double whammy a recently win the Yen and Euro where we have significant revenue in both of those currencies and we can buy 8% to 10%. Added to that, this Swiss franc strengthened by about 20% and we don\u2019t have much revenue in franc but we have a significant amount of expenses in Swiss franc.","So when you put all together we start to support 21 which is the midpoint of the prior guidance and you assume we beat the midpoint by $0.14 in Q1 and then we have a negative $0.20 impact EPS for the balance of the year due to FX and come back and talk a little bit more about that. That gives you the 4.15 and then we believe as we lookout as the momentum that we had in quarter and the gross margin and the geographic mix and product mix along with the some cost controlled initiatives that we will be able to get an additional $0.06 or so for the balance of the year and that gets you back to the $4.21.","So let me just say in a minute on how we get to the $0.20 impact from FX, the revenue for Q2 for Q4, we\u2019re estimating just based on what we\u2019re expecting shipments to be and where current exchange rates are to be down about $50 million. And we\u2019re roughly 50% naturally hedged, so we have a $25 million net impact from that loss of revenue and then on top of that our Swiss cost we\u2019re expecting are going to go up between $5 million to $7 million based on the stronger franc and when you tax effect that it gets you at a midpoint of $0.20 for the balance of the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Robert Baird. ","Jeff Johnson","Dow, maybe want start on the U.S. hospital FX environment, I obviously understand that you have the tough comp in American oncology orders this quarter and frankly I think you guys probably in the fiscal first quarter never pushing quick as hard as they\u2019re in the fiscal fourth quarter just on a yearend number standpoint. The number this quarter not overly surprising but maybe you talk about underlying trends that you\u2019re seeing in the U.S. it sure sounds like from a lot of companies we\u2019re talking the U.S. CapEx environment is getting better or do you feel that is true in some of the discussions you\u2019re having?","Dow Wilson ","I mean first at the back, North America orders were down 3% versus 13% growth a year ago quarter. They had a drift trailing 12 months is 4% growth. I not only believe too much less than 12 months orders trends that\u2019s when what we keep our eye on around here, but even when you short out six month it\u2019s north of the 4%. So I think we\u2019re seeing a small move in the market that\u2019s good. We still believe that North America is a low to mid-single digit market and our sales are going to look pretty good. We\u2019ve seen the same capital improved rate with everybody else. I think you know the surveys are usually ahead of where people actually send the money, but I would say our performance looks good.","Jeff Johnson","All right that\u2019s helpful and then at least maybe a question on SG&A even a high adjust for the restructuring charge just for the $5 million above our right off adjustment that you made, SG&A still up in your 17% of revenue and historically we haven\u2019t seen a 17% SG&A number until going back to 2007 or so and typically in the first quarter you\u2019re close to 15, 15.5, so what else is driving maybe that SG&A higher in the quarter?","Elisha Finney ","Yes, what really sets us because we had our reduction in headcount a bit at the end of the quarter, it will start to turnaround and should approximate closer to 15% as we go forward on Q2 through Q4. So here we just see effects of the investments that we made last year on a quarter-over-quarter basis. You\u2019ve mentioned the riff and the retirement plan as well as Venezuela. We will normalize going forward closer to 15% of revenue.","Jeff Johnson","All right that\u2019s great and then just my last question, we\u2019ll follow up on the detail maybe off line later tonight. But it sounds like the incremental FX headwind is around $0.20 and that\u2019s incremental since you last updated or not and we can talk about that offline, but if you\u2019re absorbing that in guidance, it seems like fundamentally the year is obviously coming in stronger already one quarter end you fundamentally feel better about the year, so when I first saw the stronger margins in the first quarter you talk about the positive revenue mix, it sounds like maybe that was just pulling into first quarter and out of the second quarter specially then second quarter guidance being little lighter than most model. But obviously fundamentally you must be feeling better and I am just trying to figure out fundamentally is it the strong growth you see in imaging as is it the software and services side of oncology just where fundamentally you\u2019re feeling better maybe today than you were there months when you first gave guidance?","Elisha Finney ","So Jeff, you\u2019re absolutely correct it\u2019s about the impact from the last guidance to today\u2019s guidance and is really helpful of course that we got the 14% lead in Q1, so largely it make up for that. First we do think just given the geographic mix and the margin performance and the service growth and these cost control initiatives that we took late in the calendar year that we will have a little bit more that we added to guidance for the balance of the year. If I could you mentioned the Q2 guidance, let me just do a very quick one, because at first it looks like it is very low relative to the year-ago period. And some of this is just timing about let\u2019s see the tax is going up about three points versus a year-ago quarter this is just the timing of the geographic mix of profits in the year that negatively impacted Q2 EPS by about $0.05 and then the FX impacts for Q2 is about $0.06. So if you were to strip out those events we would have high single-digit growth quarter-over-quarter for Q2. ","Operator","Our next question comes from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. ","David Roman ","Good afternoon, thank you for taking the question. Elisha I just had a quick clarification on the guidance. I know that you are much more purist when it comes to reporting your numbers and don\u2019t have the adjustments that lot of your peers do. So, is the 416 to 426 guidance on a basis you did $0.92 in Q1 and $0.99 in Q1?","Elisha Finney ","On a GAAP basis which we report $0.92 if you were to exclude that restructure target it will be $0.99. So my 416 to 426 is GAAP that does include the $0.07 charge. ","David Roman ","Okay, got it, thank you. And then just on the emerging market side Dow in your prepared remarks as you discussed China, I think you made a reference to the market coming back to more normalized levels of demand, and I know you had a nice tender win there, but maybe could you just talk about the underlying operating dynamics in China specifically and maybe in the emerging markets more broadly. I think you are one of the first companies that reported as part of fairly strong numbers in those regions. So maybe just help us walk through what are the key underlying drivers there?","Dow Wilson ","I think across the emerging market, first of all from high-level a 15% oncology orders. We believe that we will continue to see double-digit growth in the emerging markets and quickly doing this claim China as we talked about last year that we are purchasing aberrations. So not a lot of volume coming from government, they retooled the purchasing processes. We are seeing those trading out which I think the good news is that means they are little pent-up demand there. So I think we will see that come. The Africa continues to be kind of a surprise for us I would say three years or four years ago it was really low number and we have a terrific year last year and we started out this year very good in Africa as well. ","Maybe one other things that just going back to China one of the thing that we are seeing besides the kind of government trends, is we are seeing the emergence of a private market in China and I think that\u2019s something that other diagnostic imaging is going to around for long-time leases historically we have seen a little bit of that but not a lot. I think we are starting to see a little bit more of the private market emerge in China. Latin America the first quarter was okay, better in terms of growth but we still had a good growth in the first quarter, we grew 5% in the first quarter in Latin America that I think will keep growing there. We feel there is a lot of volatility and uncertainty with exchange rates and what\u2019s going on how does that impact Latin America but we haven\u2019t seen that yet in those markets. ","The one market that\u2019s quite is Russia, that\u2019s we have not seen much there at all. India I would say on the year looks really good. ","David Roman ","Maybe speak little more here on the U.S. There obviously been a just a moving parts in the U.S. the past couple of years with consolidation among the freestanding clinics and potentially some pent-up replacement demand. Where do you think we are in sort of that handoff where a lot of that consolidation and freestanding clinics are going to cleaned up and we move more into the natural replacement cycle that you should be enjoying now?","Dow Wilson ","I think we are still going to see some more consolidation. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s over yet. The good news is I think the strong players looking at this an opportunity to grow and invest. So we are seeing some growth from some players on both the freestanding side and in hospital market. And I think last radiation oncology is valuated treating cancer. And I think from an overall point of view the trends that we are planning to really good uptake radiation of oncology over the few years in that cancer play.","Operator","Our next question comes from Raj Denhoy from Jefferies.","Raj Denhoy ","What if could ask about proton. I think you mentioned at the Maryland facility is not yet progress to where you\u2019re ready to book again. But I am curious do you have any update or any I think you offer in terms of timing on that installation.","Dow Wilson ","The short version this isn\u2019t over and talked over. We\u2019re not going to book it and sell it and now we have seen some progress on the quarter and that could. But it\u2019s not done until it\u2019s done and Elisha do you want add anything.","Elisha Finney ","No I think that\u2019s it.","Dow Wilson","The short straight version.","Raj Denhoy ","Well in terms of, can you remind us again in a way it does happen. What sort of implications are in terms of revenue to get a release from that.","Elisha Finney","It will be a significant amount Raj it\u2019s probably North of $70 million or so given that the project has continued under percentage of completion to progress and as you recall when it did not refinance in the fourth quarter there was about $0.17 impact. And again as we progress on the installation it could be a little bit north of that wants this thing finally and we\u2019re confident that\u2019s going to get financed, it\u2019s just a matter of the timing which is impossible to predict. ","Raj Denhoy ","Okay and then just continuing on proton I believe you mentioned that there was five new tenders you completed for in the quarter anything you offer in terms of size of those installations where those might be in terms of.","Dow Wilson ","No I would say most of them are three and four room centers for a large center. Flight wise 50 days 75 configurations are all different each one of them. But I\u2019d say in a 50 to 75 range.","Raj Denhoy ","Okay and just lastly I think you ultimately comment around how service in the quarter was about 45% of oncology revenues. I\u2019m curious if you could put that number in perspective without percentage in perspective in terms of where you think that never ultimately go I know you guys targets a billion is in service but where we are in that past and then also if you could kind offset something similar in terms of where software are at this point will be helpful as well.","Dow Wilson","On service side we\u2019ve growing double digit for the last several year. This business is getting really big and hard to grow with double digit rate. But I\u2019d say we\u2019re going to be if not double digit really close to it. So it was all a bit stronger in the quarter then we usually see as another will 2014 and the service business but we should be in that double digit range. What is driving it is really everywhere it\u2019s forgetting installed based throughout any emerging market and so got product coming out warranty driving the emerging key market if got truly which we\u2019re actually celebrating our thousandth TrueBeam this next quarter. It is the most successful product in both the history of the product and the industry where four and half years get to a thousand in it. The capture rate on TrueBeam is higher and the price is little bit higher. So that\u2019s driving service content and then we move to lot of our kind of software as a service to the service business and for that part of the growth there, as well, which is a nice transition to our software business. Our software business has had two very good quarters in a row the business we\u2019re investing in aggressively both organically and inorganically with some of things that we did last year. The velocity is making a nice addition to our product line and we saw very good orders grow in our software business in both fourth quarter and the first quarter.","Raj Denhoy ","And if you said what percentage of revenue oncology revenue was this software at this point.","Elisha Finney","We could saw to $500 million business when you include both the licenses and software.","Dow Wilson ","On a pro forma basis it\u2019s about 500 million some of that equivalent come in the slide.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. ","Tycho Peterson ","Thank for taking the question. Wanted to kind of go back to one on the international market that I appreciate kind of walk you did earlier here on under different geographies thinking about the fact that a lot of value exposure I think 150% Brazilian rush to wind our commodity sensitive market. Can you just talk about how much you are taking in around macro issue which would be under control and you are thinking that lower oil and prices and things that potentially could have macro impact scenarios like Russia, Eastern Europe, Brazil, Venezuela.","Dow Wilson","We actually talked a lot about it this last week clearly some of growth we\u2019re seeing in Africa is from oil producing countries you haven\u2019t seen that slowdown so far? That\u2019s a reasonable question to ask. Some of the growth that we\u2019re seeing in Africa is we\u2019re seeing a lot of growth in Sub-Saharan Africa. And with the exception on Nigeria there is not of oil in the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa. So that\u2019s kind of good news on the rest of the African continent we did see some big volume in Eastern Europe, Russia in 12 to 18 months ago we take a big order in tons on and we maybe have seen that tail off a little bit as here recently but I think Russian we didn\u2019t much the good news is they need radiation oncology, they\u2019re still competitive, and they\u2019re pumping oil like crazy and we\u2019ve seen continued investment there, we haven\u2019t seen that tail off yet it will be interesting to watch Brazil, I think that market have remained strong and we\u2019ve got obviously the big tender we won year ago but we continue to see the private market which tends to buy a higher configuration but it will be interesting to see where the market goes there?","Elisha Finney","And Tycho, while it obviously impacts their ability to buy based on the foreign currency we feel in dollars in all of those countries.","Tycho Peterson","And actually two more question for Japan, I mean given that - one rate - and how do you think about the risk in that market for you guys this year?","Dow Wilson","I mean to some degree it\u2019s kind of in that in the P&L already. We had weak orders a year ago and we\u2019re seeing that flow through a little bit that\u2019s part of the weaker guidance you got for Q2 revenue that Elisha talked about. We did have a very good market share quarter in the first quarter but the market was down. So, we think some of its driven and there is macroeconomic issues but we also think that some of it is driven as well by consumption tax change that maybe had people pulling in some volume little more than a year ago.","Tycho Peterson","And then with the realignment of the reporting by geography obviously get better granularity on the revenue line, can you maybe just give us an update on cost structure, changes that you\u2019ve made U.S. versus OUS and where is your US versus OUS cost mix go two to three years in that?","Dow Wilson","I think the bottom line on this line is the intent that what we\u2019re trying to do is get our team closer to the customers. So we feel very good about that I think we\u2019re already seeing really good empowerment, really good ownership in the field, on the quarter we saw very good orders with revenue execution. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to get, from the cost point of view that side of it is really small. Last year most of the investments that we\u2019re making, there is a little bit of SG&A that most of the investments we\u2019re making on the R&D side as we look at some programs to drive some top line.","Tycho Peterson","Okay, and then two quick follow up. Elisha, I think did you gave the net order number and can you also just comment on annual translation.","Elisha Finney ","I did, given that order number 692, which was up 14% over the year ago period. So why don\u2019t you do the calculation, you will see the adjustments in the quarter were 34 million for the total backlog adjustment going from gross to net orders.","Tycho Peterson","And then last one for Dow, you talked about [indiscernible] data potentially driving a cycle around therapy capable machine, is that actually happening, are you seeing that drive dedicated equipment purchase?","Dow Wilson ","I\u2019m sorry, say that again Tycho, the first part of your question kind of broke up.","Tycho Peterson","Lung screening mandate.","Dow Wilson ","We think, I\u2019d say at this point we haven\u2019t really seen it flow through I think there is a lot of conversation about it I think that, that\u2019s happening for sure but I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019ve seen material increase yet. Well, I mean the increase is material but if on such a small base it\u2019s kind of hard to characterize but we continue to - I talked about the new [Tim Merman] paper, it\u2019s kind of small patient dataset but very encouraging results and just another example of the clinical research that\u2019s happening with really good news and more and more patients are having access to that and asking their physicians about it and that\u2019s what causing the change. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really kind of in the market yet but very encouraging progress.","Tycho Peterson","Okay, and then actually Elisha just to clarify that, net order I was looking for oncology not net?","Elisha Finney ","That was net orders overall. So, what you do Tycho, you start with the prior quarter ending backlog, add gross orders for the total company subtract revenue for the total company, that should be the ending backlog and any difference from what we report backlog as is the net adjustments. So that\u2019s total company of which about 30 million of that was related to oncology.","Operator","Thank you, our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from ISI Group.","Vijay Kumar ","Hey guys, congrats on the quarter. Maybe I just want to follow up on the guidance question and I apologize for asking this. The guidance we\u2019ve - on the revenue and EPS right, so basically the way I was looking at it was you had FX which went incrementally worse off. Does that mean that top line is coming in a lot better than expected or you expecting margin to be much better? What was the math behind the EPS guidance, if you will, and do you have any proton orders baked into that?","Elisha Finney ","No. So, Vijay as we mentioned just on FX alone we think we\u2019re going to lose close to around $50 million in top line Q2 through Q4 and so if the exchange rate has not changed we would be guiding closer to 6% top line growth the prior guidance was 5% to 6% we are now guiding closer to the 5% growth. We were able to maintain guidance where at the prior level largely because of the Q1, which offset that $0.20 impact as well as we do see some improvements from operations and cost controls and margin going forward into the balance of the year of about $0.06.","Vijay Kumar ","So basically you are saying incremental FX headwinds you\u2019re receiving in the model about 100 bps, right, from the time you gave the last guidance is that correct one.","Elisha Finney ","Correct. ","Vijay Kumar ","Actually, and maybe one in that gross margin clearly phenomenal pull-through on the gross margins, and obviously we don\u2019t have the segment details, is this all sort of coming in from -- sort service also on the oncology system side or sort of how the schedule is there I guess the gross margin pull through.","Elisha Finney ","Sure. So oncology I mean obviously we were very pleased with the 45.6% gross margin in the quarter which is well ahead of our long-term margin expectations for oncology and that was driven by product mix shift in service and software clearly driving that as well as a 10 point shift in revenues in North America. So we had kind of the perfect good stone for a change where both the products and the geographic mix that moved largely in that, in our favor. For the year what that means is based on that Q1 performance I think oncology will come closer to a 44% margin rate which means for the balance of the year we continue to think we\u2019ll be in that 43% to 44% range. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Wittes from Brean Capital.","Jason Wittes ","Hi, thanks. So, if you could remind us again what the proton assumption is for this year in the guidance you provided?","Elisha Finney","Sure. So the assumption is revenues are roughly 65 million so that does not include the Maryland or the Emory or UT Southwest potential deals that are not financed yet, but those are existing proton deals that we are working on with a growth profit of maybe high single digits very low double digit somewhere in that range.","Jason Wittes ","Okay. And you mentioned there is five tenders ongoing at the moment, are those potentially things will be here about in this fiscal year or are those something we\u2019ll hear more about or pushed into next fiscal year.","Dow Wilson","One you have to hear it when we award it and two you have to hear it when they\u2019re financed. So I think there is a good chance that we hear some news on most of those this year and if there is any financing continue to deal all -- before we\u2019re looking. I think the good news is most of these are outside of the U.S. so there is not financing continuity.","Jason Wittes ","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And also about the Brazilian tender offer that starting to hit this year, is that a two year process that you fill those orders, how we think about that and how it flow through?","Dow Wilson ","No, it\u2019s probably and short version is three quarters of it is slightly over two years but we do think it will be three and maybe even for by the time there all done. We\u2019re beginning shifting in the second half of this year.","Jason Wittes ","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. It also sounds like the other, the private side of Brazil is also doing well it sounds like is there way that happen at this point?","Dow Wilson ","Probably little less than half, that market as we\u2019ve said before pricing is maintaining and by configuration so it\u2019s a good market.","Jason Wittes ","And if I can just ask one on software I appreciate you broke out its roughly $500 million run rate for software right now, but you guys done a lot of investing in also -- in expanding our offering I think quite a bit last three years, is there any assumption that the general sort of package that a typical side will double or triple at some level over the next few years that part sort of built into your assumption and kind we\u2019d like to maintain double digit growth.","Dow Wilson ","I mean clearly we\u2019re bringing new offerings to the market so we do hope that with every socket there is more opportunity. So that\u2019s clearly a big piece of what we\u2019re driving. And I\u2019d say in the short term the single biggest opportunity is rapid plan and rapid plan we think is $200 million to $300 million over the next three years. It get a 100 orders so far I mentioned on the call we\u2019ve just done our first treatment, we really like that. One of the big investments we\u2019re making is into data analytics, that\u2019s our product called instigative and that\u2019s really good. I think the other kind of exciting thing is, lots of these products are relatively Greenfield outside of the U.S.","So Asia and Europe have big opportunity and then of course in the U.S. at least for things like rapid plan, InSightive and our new QA product huge upgrade opportunity in those markets. So this continues to be a big focal area for us and I think a really good opportunity for the company strong double digit growth last few quarters and we want to keep going.","Operator","Thank you our last question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley.","Steve Beuchaw ","Good afternoon, thanks for let me speak on to the wire here. Elisha, lot of good granularity on the impact of currency, would you mind giving us the spot rates that you\u2019re using on the euro and the yen for your calculations of that incremental impact?","Elisha Finney","Sure, now and understand there is a kind of the midpoint so obviously we got so much volatility going on right now but our assumptions currently as of the euro that 1.14 began at 1.18 and the Swiss franc at 0.87. I think that was yesterday\u2019s rates were very close to ours.","Steve Beuchaw ","Perfect, thank you and then on the tax rate with the R&D tax credit in the original guidance for fiscal \u201915?","Elisha Finney","No, so that obviously until it happen we just didn\u2019t want to count on it. So that did help Q1 by about $0.02 to $0.03 and had a significant impact on Q1 because the entire affect have to be taken in that quarter, once you smooth that R&D tax credit over the fiscal year, it impacts the total tax rate - by about 40 basis points.","Steve Beuchaw ","Got it, and then a strategic one for Dow, I\u2019d agree with Jeff\u2019s view I mean the U.S. has been a really nice market for you guys likely so when I look at the numbers, my observation is really more that it\u2019s about market share not relative performance. It is really helpful to hear you reflect on the last 12 months or so, and what as you think you\u2019ve done that, that\u2019s really working as you drive in competitive situations in the U.S. and how you see that playing forward?","Dow Wilson","I think it starts first with that product out there to being one of the best product when we introduced it, we think the second best product in the market - and both products has just gotten better in last four years. So we are in terrific market position and high end of the market just if we\u2019ve had the number of customers here to Palo Alto and singing phrases of our TrueBeam product so I think we really have a terrific position on TrueBeam. One of the things that customers are looking at is total cost of ownership and on total cost of ownership isn\u2019t always about price. It\u2019s about throughput, it\u2019s about versatility, it\u2019s about volume, it\u2019s about brand and reputation in the market and then it\u2019s also by cost and we\u2019ve I think done a really nice job in our sales team of pushing the differentiation of the product from the total cost point of view. And on the software side, from our software products just keep getting better and better and I think we\u2019re really beginning to turn some heads, I think we\u2019ve been turning heads for a long time in treatment planning, our treatment plan with physician is terrific and I really think over the last 6 to 12 months in oncology information systems especially with the investments we\u2019ve made in our ARIA product and now these new expansions for QA and analytics really getting some traction there.","Steve Beuchaw ","Hospital consolidation it hasn\u2019t been a positive for you, do you have an incrementally stronger position do you think in the hospitals there are on the buyer side in those transaction?","Dow Wilson","I think we\u2019re equally strong on both sides. I don\u2019t have my market share in front of me but I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty close in both hospital and non-hospital.","Operator","Thank you, I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Spencer Sias for closing comments.","Spencer Sias","Thank you for participating.

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions)","As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Spencer Sias, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Thank you, Mr. Sias. You may now begin.","Spencer Sias","Thank you. Good afternoon. And welcome to Varian Medical Systems conference call for the second quarter of fiscal year 2014. With me are Dow Wilson, President and CEO; Elisha Finney, CFO; and Clarence Verhoef, our Corporate Controller. Dow and Elisha will summarize our results and we'll take your questions following the presentation.","To simplify our discussion, unless otherwise stated, all references to the quarter or year are fiscal quarters and fiscal years.

We assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements in this presentation and discussion because of new information, future events or otherwise.","Before turning it over to Dow, let me remind you that we are holding a Media Review and Webcast for investors in New York on Tuesday, May 6th, details are available on our IR site. And now, here is Dow.","Dow Wilson","Good afternoon and welcome. For the second quarter of 2014 we generated good order growth. Revenues that came in slightly ahead of expectations and solid margins before accounting for the settlement of patent litigation. Quickly summarize our financial results for the second quarter versus the year ago periods.","Revenues rose 1% to $779 million, our gross margin grew nearly 60 basis points to 42.2% and earnings came in at $0.88 per diluted share, including a $0.16 per share charge related to the settlement of the seven-year patent dispute with the University of Pittsburgh regarding our respiratory gating technology and our quarter ending backlog rose to $2.8 billion with the help of about $60 million in proton orders.","Turning to operational highlights, Oncology Systems grew gross orders by 6% to $613 million with strong gains in Latin America and Australia, 3% increases in both North America and EMEA and a 3% decline in Asia, where the weaken offset constant currency growth of 3%.","In North America, we see hospitals continuing to consolidate and hospital administrators focusing increasingly on system purchases that enabled cost efficient quality care with the best clinical practices. This is our strong suit.","As an example we entered into two new multiyear agreements with large hospital systems to supply them with packages of accelerators, accessories, software and services, portions of these agreements were booked in the second quarter and the reminder will be booked over the five to seven-year terms of these agreements. We have more of these type deals in the sales funnel.","In EMEA, we booked roughly half of the $51 million multi-machine Algerian order that we announced early in the second quarter. We also booked sizable orders in Italy, Spain and Switzerland.","Subsequent to the close of the quarter we exhibited at the ASTRO meeting, Indiana, where attendance was up and where we saw heavy booth traffic with a lot of interest in our RapidPlan software and in radiosurgery solution.","In Asia, Japan had double-digit order growth with the key win in Hiroshima and good replacement business from conversations of aging Siemens and Mitsubishi unit. We grew gross orders slightly in China. In the meantime interest in radiotherapy is rising in other Asian markets including Vietnam, the Philippine and Myanmar.","Growth in rest of world including Latin and Australia was particularly strong during the quarter. In Brazil, we received orders for several treating unit, as well as the software systems which were outside of the 80 machine tender that we won earlier this year. We have not yet booked orders relating to this tender. Columbia, Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador were also active during the quarter. We received numerous orders in this region for our cost efficient low energy unique accelerator with RapidArc capability.","In Australian, we received a sizeable order from Genesis care network that included 10 TrueBeams that will be delivered over the next three years. In total, TrueBeam comprised more than 60% of our high energy accelerator orders during the quarter. This product has generated more than $2.5 billion in gross orders since its introduction just four years ago.","Siemen's replacement business contributed to our Oncology order growth in North America, EMEA and Asia, the strategic partnership has gained momentum and is working well for our business. Siemen conversations have accounting for more than $80 million in gross orders this year.","We also landed new business in the Philippines working with Siemens. Thanks to their help, Varian will supply accelerators to the first three of eight planned radiotherapy centers at some of the country\u2019s leading hospital.","We also made good progress during the quarter with our Edge radiosurgery offerings. We have booked nearly 100 orders for Edge, upgrades and systems. We reached an important radiosurgery milestone during the quarter when Champalimaud in Portugal commenced the world first treatment with our Edge platform.","Champalimaud\u2019s first Edge radiosurgery patient was a 53-year woman with operable stage one non-small cell lung cancer. Physicians there also treated the 67-year-old man with two metastatic brain tumors. He received radiosurgery for both tumors in a single session that took less than 10 minutes.","To my knowledge there is another system that matches the combined precision and treatment time of our Edge radiosurgery platform. Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit recently became the first center in the United States to commence treating patients with Edge radiosurgery.","Turning to Oncology services, we expanded gross orders in this part of the business by 11% during the quarter. Year-to-date, service orders represented almost 40% of the total oncology gross orders.","As was recorded earlier, we completed our acquisition of Velocity asset, including software design to help clinicians, make more informed treatment decisions by organizing patient data and making it available in one place. This acquisition supports our commitment providing clinicians with tools for data-driven clinical decision making.","The Velocity software enabled healthcare professionals to use oncology patient images and data to plan and assess treatments, collaborate with colleagues and share clinical knowledge. We expect this to play an important part in the movement towards evidence based medicine.","I\u2019m pleased to say that the skilled clinicians who developed this software are joining Varian to help develop and commercialize this product on a broader scale. This software is already in use at over 200 centers around the world. And we believe we can achieve faster and deeper market penetration for this product to our global sales, marketing and service network.","Let me turn to our new imaging component segment which is comprised of our X-ray flat panel detectors to and security products. We consolidated these product lines into a single segment as a result of an organizational change that puts them under the management of Sunny Sanyal, our new Imaging Components President.","Growth orders for this segment increased 14% to $205 million, driven exclusively by very strong demand for our panel. As we mentioned on the last call, this business benefited to some extent some catch-up orders that flipped from the first to second quarter of this fiscal year.","X-ray equipment manufactures have designed our panel into a new C-arm surgical imaging system and new digital mammography system and into a digital radiography system that was the winner of sizable public tender in India. As sales of these systems ramp up, it should contribute to the continued growth of our panel business.","Gross orders for X-ray tubes and security products were soft compared to the year-ago quarter. Two purchases were slowed in part due to improved quality and lifecycle. Demand for security products remains healthy but competition and pricing pressure impacted security business during the quarter.","The company\u2019s other category which is comprised of the Varian Particle Therapy business and Ginzton Technology Center recorded growth orders of $60 million in the second quarter. The Varian Particle Therapy business booked two orders during the quarter and approximately $50 million order for a new proton installation at at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital and approximately $10 million order from the Paul Scherrer in Switzerland for technology and equipment. We look forward to additional clinical research.","Before closing on protons, I\u2019m pleased to report that treatments are progressing at Scripps where they have permission two rooms and are treating as many as 36 patients a day for range of disease including prostate; lung; head and neck; and breast cancer. Average treatment time is 26 minutes with the faster treatment session completed in just 10 minutes.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Elisha.","Elisha Finney","Thanks Dow and hello everyone. While Dow has already covered growth orders, I want to briefly talk about the constant currency growth rates for the quarter. In comparing quarter-over-quarter exchange rates, the weakening of the Yen and the Aussie dollar was mostly offset by the strengthening of the Euro and other currencies.","Oncology growth orders increased 6% in dollars and 7% in constant currency. Oncology\u2019s North American growth order was up 3% in both dollars and constant currency. EMEA growth orders increased 3% in dollars and 1% in constant currency. And in Asia, where the Yen weakened by roughly 15% quarter-over-quarter, that region was down 3% in dollars but up 3% in constant currency.","Oncology growth orders in rest of world region including Latin America and Australia rose by 71% in dollars and 82% in constant currency. The company ended the quarter with a $2.8 billion backlog, up 2% from the year-ago quarter.","As a reminder, both growth and net orders were shown in the consolidated segment of earnings attached to our press release. Second quarter revenues for the total company increased 1% in dollars and 3% in constant currency.","For the first half, total company revenues were up 3% in dollars and 5% in constant currency. Oncology systems posted a 4% gain and revenues during the quarter, bringing the revenue growth for the first half to 3%.","Imaging components posted a second quarter revenue gain of 2% with double-digit growth in our flat panel products, largely offset by declines in our security and inspection products. For the first half, imaging component revenues were up 4% from the year ago period with similar headwinds from the security and inspection business.","Revenues for the other categories fell significantly from the year ago quarter, when we started to report revenue under percentage of completion method for both the Saudi and Russia for proton therapy project.","Total company growth margins for the quarter, rose 57 basis points to 42.2%, driven by a smaller percentage of lower margins proton revenue. Oncology systems gross margin equaled the year ago quarter at 42.8%. For the first half, Oncology\u2019s gross margin increased nearly half a point to 43.8%.","The imaging component gross margin for the quarter declined by 80 basis points to 41.5%, due largely to pricing pressure in X-ray tubes and volume declines in our security and inspection products. For the first half, imaging component gross margin fell 20 basis points to 41.4%.","Second quarter SG&A expenses were $140 million or 18% of revenues, including a charge related to the $35 million Palo patent litigation settlement. Let me take a moment to walk you through the accounting for this settlement.","The settlement expense includes $5 million that was reserved in a prior year and another $25 million or $0.16 per share expense that was booked to SG&A in the second quarter. An additional $5 million will be booked in our current third quarter on the balance sheet as a prepaid royalty that will be amortized over the next two and a half years.","The patent settlement added approximately 3 points to SG&A as a percent of revenues in the second quarter. SG&A was further impacted by about a $5 million increase in our bad debt reserve in the quarter to reflect uncertainty in our ability to exchange our Venezuelan Bolivars that we have collected into dollars.","Second quarter R&D expenses were $61 million or 8% of revenues, up 1 point as a percentage of revenue with the year ago quarter, as we continue to invest in our global strategies and execute on our product roadmap. For the first half, R&D expenses also rose 1 point as a percentage of revenues to 8%.","Moving down the income statement, second quarter operating earnings totaled $128 million, down 18% from the year ago quarter. The patent litigation settlement reduced the operating margin by more than 3 points to 16.4% for the quarter.","Depreciation and amortization totaled $15 million for the quarter and $31 million for the first half. The effective tax rate fell slightly from the year ago periods to 27.6%, with about half a point of benefit related to the patent settlement. Given the ongoing geographic mix shift of profits to outside North America, we now believe the tax rate for the full fiscal year will be approximately 28%.","Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased from the year ago quarter to $105.4 million, due largely to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted EPS was $0.88 for the second quarter, including the $0.16 per diluted share litigation settlement charge.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $939 million, debt of $469 million and stockholders\u2019 equity of $1.7 billion. DSOs, day sales outstanding at 95, was up 8 days from the year ago quarter with an approximate 10-day impact from the proton therapy business, where deferred payments terms are not yet due, but revenue has been recognized under the percentage of completion method.","Second quarter cash flow from operations was $126 million, significantly higher than net income, primarily due to working capital increases and accrued expenses and customer deposits.","Primary uses of cash were $159 million toward the repurchase of 2 million shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had 4 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2014.","Now back to Dow for the outlook.","Dow Wilson","Thank you, Elisha. The company is continuing to execute well, and our businesses remain on track to reach our fiscal year 2014 growth targets. For the fiscal year, we continue to believe that total company revenues could increase by about 6% to 8% over the prior fiscal year. We expect net earnings per diluted share for the fiscal year, including the $0.16 effect of the patent litigation settlement, to be in the range of $4.06 to $4.18. We expect total company revenues for the third quarter of fiscal year 2014 to increase in the range of 5% to 6%. We expect net earnings per diluted share for the third quarter to be in the range of $1.06 to $1.10.","We are now ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Question, on net orders, you guys came up a little bit late versus the street [5.59% versus 5.83%] (ph) I think can you maybe just talk through some of the dynamics there and then Elisha you want to breakout net orders in oncology, North America versus international?","Elisha Finney","Yes. So Tycho, we had two what I would say rather unusual items in the second quarter. First because of the situation that I mentioned in Venezuela, we took roughly $5 million out of backlog relating to deals that we had previously booked there as well as we had kind of an unusual and what we believe to be one-time cancellation in flat panel of another about $5 million from both the Chinese and the Korean customer. So if you -- that said, for the first half, typically, if you look at it as a percentage of backlog, it\u2019s 3% to 5% in any given year. And if I look at the first half, we are about 4%. So if we assume the backlog will continue to grow throughout the year, I think for the full year we still have a shot at being at 3% to 5% for the year.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","And then a color, is the North American versus international split of oncology net orders?","Elisha Finney","So net orders, yes, and I can mark you through this quickly, I am just having to refer to my notes here. So for oncology, the geographic split was 39% in North America, 61% in international versus growth that look 42. That was net.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","And then is the momentum picking up with Siemens though, I mean you hadn\u2019t commented on the conversions picking up and so is that driving most of the growth?","Dow Wilson","I think we commented last quarter that we felt very good after last quarter and I would say that momentum is continuing and we are seeing good strength with Siemens globally. Frankly, we like what we see there. Now some of that was at in the product ready and we\u2019re trying to get connectivity with the product and that\u2019s good. And I think we are going doing a nice coming there, so in their hardware, but it\u2019s really kind of the story of all the software coming together and completing that capability in our product lines next to their old install base and that\u2019s all done now and we\u2019ve got some site to take people, improve statements and clinically and I think that momentum is turning now.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Okay. And then last one given the guidance for next quarter year-over-year becomes little bit more back end loaded, could you comment on some of gives and takes in the back half of the year. I know you previously talked about hoping for recovery in China, so what are your thoughts on that and maybe some other drivers for the back half of the recovery?","Elisha Finney","Sure, Tycho. The biggest driver is as we have assumed that our Maryland proton we have been talking just at the beginning of the fiscal year. It will be ready for equipment at the end of May which doesn\u2019t give us a whole of leverage there leeway there for Q3. So we moved that into assumptions as into Q4. So that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving. If you look through the settlement and my lawyer told let me do the math for you, but if you do the math, you will see that the guidance is essentially unchanged from the prior year. We simply moved Maryland into Q4 but the full year remains where it was.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Okay. And now you are still confident China getting better back half of the year?","Dow Wilson","","No. Our funnel remains very strong. We were positive. It wasn't as biggest as we hope this last quarter, but it was still positive. We do believe we're getting some share in China. So that's good. But we do see a pretty strong second half in China.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Okay. Thanks. I\u2019ll hop off.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from David Roman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to maybe start with something came up in your prepared remarks regarding Brazil, I think, I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t remember you gave exact number, but you did talked about having some strong orders for proton now we are outside of the 80 unit tender you had won and that you haven\u2019t booked any orders on the tender. To what extent do you think that having the tender might be helping your access to some of the private market and your own ability to perform well in Brazil versus just general strength in the end market and the fact that you're kind of already the market leader?","Dow Wilson","","Let me start by saying, we had a very good position in Brazil before the tender win. We are finally the market leader in that market. So we always had a good position in Brazil. Winning the tender has certainly helped us. It has reinforced that leadership position.","So I think there has been maybe a little bit of a halo effect. This is the private market. I think our product is very well-positioned. We've got a very good distribution for this team down in Brazil and we think we are very well-positioned for both the short-term and the long-term.","I guess maybe what especially given from investor point of view is the new tenders both government and non-government are not affected by the MOH, Ministry of Health pricing. So we're seeing good pricing on these other orders as well.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","And then maybe just go to kind of a follow-up which is just on pricing in general. Could you maybe give us some sense as to how pricing is trending globally? I mean, if I look at the gross margin, which was, I think, pretty flat, it was just flat in the quarter that would suggest to me that pricing is also pretty stable given your shifting mix of business. Maybe you just sort of help us understand pricing trends by regions specifically in Oncology?","Dow Wilson","","On the quarter, well, on the half, for that matter as well, pricing has been stable. So our pricing is definitely holding and we're please about that. On the quarter, we did have -- our unit volume was up and our mix was a little more of kind of international mix, we had more unique and usual and we had a little bit more of kind of value segment mix for that. But product-to-product with year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter pricing is effecting very stable.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","And maybe I just sneak one more in here just on the U.S. Well, I know this market is seen some variations past several quarters around uncertainty and reimbursement and look like things are kind of coming back last quarter and I know you briefly talk about some of the issues around consolidation the U.S. where you thought that was a competitive advantage for Varian. But maybe just kind update us on your latest thought regarding the U.S. market and maybe sort of help us draw kind of the trend line to kind of transcend what's been some volatility over the past couple of quarters?","Dow Wilson","","Sure. The good news is that volatility has measured in the last two quarters, sorry someone sneak here a little bit, last -- measure in the last few quarters, we've had good U.S. market performance and that's, for us have -- we had together, it's been a tough market as you said, David. But our orders on the half or very good year-to-date gross orders were up 8%, gross orders in the quarter were up 3% as we said.","Yes, the market is consolidating and the free standing clinic market is pretty quite, but we are seeing the hospital market to be pretty aggressive. In terms of outlook, the funnel looks good and I would say, we're looking for kind of mid single-digit market growth out of U.S. and frankly that's a part of positive outlook as we\u2019ve had on that market in the long-term.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Amit Hazan of SunTrust Bank. Pleased go ahead.","Amit Hazan - SunTrust Bank","First, I just want to go back to the difference between growth and net orders and in quality side. I'm getting the number -- the printed number is about $54 million, which is a actually a little bit bigger than normal. I know Elisha you touched on it in the prior question, but some of that what you touched on was not inside of oncology. And in particular, if I apply kind of majority of that to the net order for the North American line, I get a pretty weak North American order number -- net order number despite a really weak comp?","Elisha Finney","Yes. I mean, most of the cancellations and dormancies are in North America. We did have some of the international market as I mentioned particularly in rest of world related to Venezuela this quarter. But you\u2019re going to get variability in any given quarter. I just want to come back to in terms of history, 3% to 5% of backlog is typically adjusted. You just haven\u2019t seen it really up until this point for this year, but this is very typical to what we historically have seen. Every single year it\u2019s been 3% to 5%.","Amit Hazan - SunTrust Bank","Can you confirm what was the change of growth rate for net orders in North America?","Elisha Finney","It was down slightly mid-single digit.","Amit Hazan - SunTrust Bank","Okay.","Elisha Finney","And it was up in international market. And then you get a lot of variability within the international market.","Amit Hazan - SunTrust Bank","Okay. Thank you for that. And just I want to ask a question about Edge, and to one of your competitors. Just kind of going -- thinking through SRS in particular, but some of your Edge related comments in the past couple of quarters, seeing one of your big competitors missed numbers due to GEMini weakness. I\u2019m just wondering if you guys can set a little bit of color on whether there is a direct link to the new imbursement changes there that happen at the end of last year to the extent what we\u2019re seeing maybe a change in the marketplace where the traditional neurosurgeon call point for a GEMini type product is now being rolled into the oncology suite. Is that helping you at all? Just any color on what\u2019s happening on the SRS side, where it kind of look from very short term numbers that you might be gaining some share?","Dow Wilson","No, I would say it\u2019s a combination of factors. You named the number of them, but certainly the reimbursement was helpful to get those on the same footing now as the big deal, if we were substantially lower than GEMini for reimbursement before for radio surgery and those are now reimbursed at same level. So that\u2019s one help. Two is clearly on the environment that we\u2019re in. Administrators are particularly looking at making their purchases go farther, and when you look at the number of patients and indications they can threat with Edge versus what they can threat with GEMini. Testing with the single largest trend in radiation therapy being SDRT with lung, liver and pancreas growing, it\u2019s having the flexibility and versatility of the Edge is a big deal.","And then last of all, Edge, as I said in my prepared remarks, is the combination of the most precise and fastest delivering method to threat this indication. And it has obviously a throughput impact, but also has a patient impact. Now these patients are sick and having to in some cases, sit on a table half hour to an hour for complex treatments on Edge. They can have that completed in 10, 15 minutes and they\u2019re set to go. So I think it\u2019s really kind of combination of all those factors and I do agree. I think we are seeing some momentum there with that product from a relative little competition point of view.","Amit Hazan - SunTrust Bank","Okay. Thanks very much guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jason Wittes of Brean Capital. Please go ahead.","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Actually, I wanted to ask about the gross margins and specifically, Dow, I know that when I spoke to you recently, you discussed some investments being made in terms of your emerging market product offering and how that might translate into better gross margins in outer years. Can you just talk about the spend you\u2019re doing now and sort of how that might translate into the outer years margin improvement?","Dow Wilson","Yes. I think from an R&D point of view, we\u2019re kind of three significant areas where we\u2019re spending this increase in R&D. One is software. We think there is a big opportunity where as a market leader in Eclipse, we will continue to invest in algorithms in Eclipse and you\u2019ve seen things like RapidPlan for us, that will continue. ARIA is a terrific product. We\u2019ve had to make investments this last year for the Siemens connectivity and things like that. We continue to bring a lot of enhancements to that product and look forward really to evolving that product in the informatics space and in globalizing the product, so that\u2019s some of the investments there.","And then for the rest of the product line, emerging markets are a big piece of our product line more and more and that's where we have a big chunk of our investment going that will yield products this year, next year and beyond. So we're investing aggressively in those areas.","As we already, as we said on the call, we're pretty comfortable with the margin rates on the quarter and pricing holding. We continue to invest a fair amount as well in operational program to drive productivity across our business and have made pretty good progress on the variable costs of our TrueBeam platform as well as on, our cost of quality and built our X-ray component business as well as Oncology.","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital","Okay. But I guess, what I was trying to get at was, I thought there was some effort to bridge the gap between emerging market and developed markets in terms of gross margins by product mix, is that?","Dow Wilson","","Absolutely. I mean, from a long-term point of view that's absolutely what we've got to do and that\u2019s -- in terms of new product, we want to deliver products that deliver what the customers want from a feature performance point of view and match our requirements, our shareholder margin point of view and so we are -- so that is where our significant piece of our investment is going.","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital","Okay. If I could just do one follow-up in terms of the U.S. market, you had mentioned that there was some consolidation I think there was some other questions about it. But you also mentioned that the funnel was strong, does that imply partially seen your guidance as well that there is going to be some backend loadedness in terms of obviously, a revenues or even order rates as well, they were held back for some of the consolidation this quarter?","Dow Wilson","","As you know, we don't guide the orders and I will say that second half of last fiscal year, we had a pretty good funnel and their results weren\u2019t that great.","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital","I see.","Dow Wilson","So, I think part of what we're seeing is the yield on the funnel is good. So we continue to see a very good funnel, yield on the funnel recently has been good and I'll stick to the comment I made before and that is, we are kind of seeing market outlook in the -- for long-term in the mid single-digit.","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you management guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Toby Wann of Obsidian Research Group. Please go ahead.","Toby Wann - Obsidian Research Group","Hey, good afternoon everybody. I just wanted to ask quickly, kind of, about rapid plan market adoption, kind of, how the pace of that, how that\u2019s been received both domestically and across the globe?","Dow Wilson","There is a lot of enthusiasm and excitement for the product. We showed it at ASTRO, of course, last year as you know. It has European introduction at ASTRO, very strong global interest. We shift the first units to customer here in eight weeks or so and kind of, official commercialization is this summer.","So we've got lots of customers lined up for us. We think it's a game changer and it was a little color we will start with prostate model and then head and neck followed through shortly after that. And then we\u2019re onto breast cancer models and other cancers. And with the enthusiasm that we're seeing from our customer based both luminary and committee and outside of the U.S., we think this is -- this remains $700 million opportunity for us.","Toby Wann - Obsidian Research Group","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Sias for any closing remarks.","Spencer Sias","Thank you very much. Thank you all for participating.

Fourth Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Spencer Sias, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications for Varian Medical Systems. Thank you, sir, you may begin.","Spencer Sias","Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Varian Medical Systems' conference call for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. With me are Dow Wilson, President and CEO; Elisha Finney, CFO, and Clarence Verhoef, our Corporate Controller. Dow and Elisha will summarize our results, and we will take your questions following the presentation. To simplify our discussion, unless otherwise stated all references to the quarter or year are fiscal quarters and fiscal years. Quarterly comparisons are for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, references to financial results for orders are to gross orders unless otherwise indicated.","Beginning this quarter, the company is recording non-GAAP results in order to provide quarter-over-quarter comparisons of operational performance excluding unusual items. Our reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure is included in our earnings release which can be accessed on our website. Please be advised in this presentation and discussion contains forward-looking statements. Our use of words and phrases such as outlook, believe, expect, anticipate, could, should, will, promising, and similar expressions are intended to identify those statements which represent our current judgment on future performance or other future matters. While we believe them to be reasonable based on information currently available to us, these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.","Some of the important risks relating to our business are described in our fourth quarter earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements in this presentation and discussion because of new information, future events, or otherwise.","Before turning it over to Dow, let me advise you that given our investor meeting at ASTRO last week, as well as the information we'll be providing on this call, we're cancelling our year-end meeting that was scheduled to take place in New York next week.","And now, here is Dow.","Dow Wilson","Good afternoon and welcome. As you will have seen from the pre-release that we issued ahead of our investor meeting at ASTRO last week, the fourth quarter was marked by some earnings challenges, as well as orders successes in two of our three businesses.","In summary, we are reporting non-GAAP net earnings of $1.04 per diluted share, up from $1.03 in the year ago quarter, revenues of $818 million, up 1% in dollars and 6% in constant currency, oncology gross order growth of 5% in constant currency, orders totaling more than $135 million for three proton therapy systems, and significant declines in orders and revenues for our Imaging Components business.","Focusing on operational highlights in our oncology business, gross orders totaled $919 million for the quarter, equal in dollars, and up 5% in constant currency versus the strong year ago quarter. Orders for the fiscal year totaled $2.7 billion, equal with the prior year, but up 6% in constant currency in line with our long-term mid single-digit growth expectations for this business.","Orders in the Americas for the quarter declined by 5% in dollars in constant currency versus the year ago period when we booked the large part of the Brazil tender. For the year, orders in the Americas were up 1% in dollars in constant currency. In North America, orders grew by 4% in the quarter, and 3% for the year. In EMEA, orders grew 13% in dollars, and a robust 25% in constant currency during the quarter. For the year, orders in EMEA were even with the year ago period in dollars, and up 12% in constant currency.","Gross orders in APAC were down by 3% in dollars, but up 6% in constant currency for the quarter. Annual APAC orders were even with the prior year in dollars, and up 9% in constant currency. We gained share against the competition in all three regions of the world for the year. Our team in EMEA set a record by booking orders for over 100 accelerators with strength across the region. In the U.K., the National Health Service selected Varian to supply up to 20 TrueBeam systems. In Poland, we booked orders to supply 11 public radiotherapy centers with TrueBeam systems, and software replacing the older Siemens systems.","In India, we booked the first tranche of a five-year 18 accelerator order, including an EDGE radiosurgery system. We will book the remaining tranches when their delivery dates come within our two-year booking window. In APAC, a customer in Japan placed an order for three TrueBeam systems together with our new RapidPlan and InSightive Analytics software products.","In North America, our oncology team had several nice wins from customers, including Memorial Sloan Kettering, Alliance Oncology, and Cleveland Clinic. Competitive takeouts added to our orders for the quarter, and for the year. In North America alone, we estimate that we generated over $150 million in orders during the year to replace hardware and software products from our competitors. Over 40 sites switched from other suppliers to our Eclipse treatment planning software during the year. As you know, we have just returned from ASTRO in San Antonio. It was a great show for us with terrific customer response to our exhibit. Our booth was the busiest of the show, and we had over 800 attendees at our users meeting.","During the show, we provided a glimpse of the next big breakthrough, high definition radiotherapy and radiosurgery. This is a new 4 Pi technique that will compress more dose into the tumor while protecting much more of the surrounding healthy tissue. Clinicians working with TrueBeam's unique developer mode are using simultaneous motions of the treatment gantry and patient couch to get a huge increase in the number of beam angles available for targeting the tumor. High definition radiotherapy is under trial at UCLA, and is not yet ready for broad commercialization.","So we expect that high definition treatments, coupled with our multi-modality imaging capabilities at the treatment console will make a much bigger gain in the fight against cancer than is possible with an expensive hybrid device, combining MR imaging, and limited treatment delivery. And we also generated a lot of excitement in our booth at ASTRO.","Varian's industry leading RapidPlan software, which has already been ordered at over 300 sites, was the hit of the show. As we pointed out at our investor meeting there, numerous independent clinical studies show impressive time savings and quality that is equal to or better than plans generated manually. At the University of Michigan, RapidPlan has enabled complex spine SBRT plans to be generated in 15 to 20 minutes, instead of the usual 60 to 90 minutes.","At the Royal Surry Hospital in the U.K., the use of RapidPlan reduced treatment planning time by a factor of five, and resulted in plans that were deemed equivalent or better 90% of the time. With RapidPlan, a dosimetrist can help five times as many patients as could be done with conventional planning products. This is a product that could help new centers in emerging markets get up to speed with high quality planning very quickly.","There are nearly 4,000 cancers centers worldwide using our Eclipse treatment planning software, and each of these is a potential candidate for RapidPlan. So we expect it to help drive significant growth in software sales. We've developed RapidPlan disease site models for a number of cancers, including prostate, head and neck, and lung, and there are more to come. To strengthen our treatment planning offerings, we acquired HyperDrive software technology during the quarter to improve the quality of prescriptions, and accelerate the planning process. Our new VitalBeam product received FDA 510(k), and CE Mark approvals during the quarter.","We've received several VitalBeam orders, and early signs are this affordable extension of the TrueBeam platform will be a winner, particularly in emerging markets. TrueBeam now comprises more than 70% of our global accelerator orders, and 90% of our accelerator orders in the U.S. Before I leave Oncology Systems, I want to draw your attention to a groundbreaking study issued by the Lancet Oncology Commission, highlighting the global need for more radiotherapy equipment. According to this report, by 2035, there will be 25 million new cases of cancer diagnosed annually, and we will need to supply the world with more than 20,000 new machines to equip new centers, as well as replace aging infrastructure.","The need is greatest in low and middle income countries. The report is recommending that, by 2020, 80% of these countries should establish national cancer plans, and make radiotherapy part of their universal health coverage. Over the next 10 years, the commission recommends investing $46 billion in these countries to expand radiotherapy capacity. This will require education and training of thousands of doctors, physicists, and therapists. Varian has established a market development team that is partnering with governments, financiers, clinicians [audio gap] and patient advocacy groups to support this effort.","Let me now turn to proton therapy which drew a lot of customer attention at ASTRO. We have real momentum in this business. In the fourth quarter, we booked more than $135 million in orders for three multi-room systems, including two in the U.K., and one in New York. This brought the number of proton orders booked in the year to six systems, totaling more than $300 million.","At this point, we have 11 projects in backlog, and we are currently working on more than six installations. Treatments are expected to commence at the University of Maryland early next year, which will bring the total number of centers treating patients with Varian proton technology to four. The key to making the proton therapy business profitable are continued success in the market, reducing product costs, and scaling up the service business. We feel like we have momentum in these areas. ","Let me now turn to imaging components, where orders shrank by 30%, to $165 million for the quarter, resulting in a full year orders decline of 16% for this business. This was another challenging quarter in an exceedingly tough year, particularly in our security and inspection business. Orders for panels were down for the quarter, and for the year driven primarily by price. Unit volumes for these products were up slightly from the prior year. Our imaging components' competitors are largely European and Japanese, and they got about a 20% reduction in their cost structure due to foreign exchange movements. They're using this to grab market share.","Customers are looking for lower priced alternatives, including insourcing. In fact, one customer has elected to insource, and the impacts of this loss in fiscal year 2016 will be about $50 million of revenue. The security and inspection products business was also down sharply, with annual orders off versus the previous year by about $60 million, representing a decline of more than 55%. The security business remains profitable, and we're looking at a lot of options for getting the business back on track.","To address the ongoing challenges for the overall business, we have initiated numerous corrective actions to make our product lines and operations more cost competitive. These include a restructuring to right size the business, accelerating product developments, including our new low cost flat panel, and stepping up marketing efforts, particularly in Asia. We are opening a facility near Shanghai to support a rapidly expanding X-ray equipment manufacturing industry in China.","On a positive note, we feel very good about two new acquisitions we have made to complement our Imaging Components business, MeVis and Claymount. In fiscal year 2016, we're looking for about $50 million of revenues from these products, and they are both off to a good start.","Now, I'll turn it over to Elisha.","Elisha Finney","Thanks, Dow, and hello everyone. Before I walk you through the P&L, let me touch on the backlogs. The company ended the fiscal year with a $3.5 billion backlog, up 10% from the year ago period. Backlog adjustments during the year totaled 215 million, with approximately 50 million of that related to currency exchange rates. Just to clarify, my P&L walk is on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP versus non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our press release.","In summary, fiscal year GAAP operating earnings were approximately 27 million lower than non-GAAP earnings due to restructuring, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition related costs, and certain litigation costs. Also for comparison purposes, we have provided in the press release a GAAP versus non-GAAP reconciliation for 2014 and 2015 by quarter.","Before I walk you through the numbers, let me just say that exchange rates wreaked havoc on our 2015 results. We estimate that on a constant currency basis our reported results would've improved as follows. Orders would've been up by about 175 million. Revenues would've been up by about 140 million, and on the earnings front our operating margin would've been about one point higher. Let me point out that this FX impact was felt primarily in Oncology Systems. On top of this, as Dow explained, currency driven price erosion had a huge impact on our imaging components business, and that effect is incremental to the numbers that I just gave you.","Now turning to the P&L, third quarter revenues for the total company increased 1% in dollars, and increased 6% in constant currency. Total company revenues in the Americas were down 1% in dollars, and flat in constant currency. EMEA revenues were up 5% in dollars, but up 18% in constant currency. And APAC revenues were down 2% in dollars, and up 5% in constant currency. For the year, total company revenues were up 2% in dollars, and up 6% in constant currency.","Oncology Systems posted a 2% increase in revenues during the quarter, up 9% in constant currency. And for the year, oncology revenues were flat with the year ago period in dollars, and up 6% in constant currency.","Imaging components posted a fourth quarter revenue decline of 8%, with a 5% increase in X-ray tubes, flat revenues in panel products, and a 57% decline in our securities and inspection products. For the year, imaging components revenues were down 7% from the year ago period, with tubes down 1%, flat panels down 4%, and security products down 37%. Revenues for the other category increase from the year ago quarter as we continue production and installation of several proton projects that are in our backlog.","Total company gross margin fell by nearly three points to 38.9% for the quarter, and by more than a point to 41.4% for the year. Currency exchange rates, price erosion in imaging components, and a higher mix of lower margin proton revenue led to these declines. Oncology Systems gross margin decreased more than two points in the quarter and nearly one point for the year, due almost entirely to currency exchange rates. Given the ongoing strength of the dollar, we believe Oncology's growth margin will remain at about 43% for 2016.","The imaging components gross margin for the quarter fell by nearly five percentage points, to 38.9% due largely to pricing and mix. For the year, imaging components' gross margin decreased by more than a point to 41% also due to pricing and mix. Given the pricing pressures we are experiencing, the 2016 gross margins for this business is likely to remain in the high 30s.","Fourth quarter SG&A expenses were about 15% of revenues, down almost a point as a percentage of revenues from the year ago quarter. For the year, SG&A expenses were about even with the year ago period, at 15% of revenue. Fourth quarter R&D expenses were 69 million or 8% of revenues, up about one point as a percentage of revenue with the year ago quarter. And for the year, R&D expenses were about even as a percentage of revenue, at 8%.","Moving down to income statement, fourth quarter operating earnings totaled 135 million or 17% of revenues. For the year, operating earnings totaled 576 million or 18.6% of revenues. On a constant currency basis, the operating margin was approximately one point higher. Depreciation and amortization totaled 19 million for the quarter, and 69 million for the year. The effective tax rate was 25% for the quarter, and 26% for the year. Both down significantly from the prior period due to geographic mix of products, the use of German tax loss carryforwards, and the unusually high 2014 rate.","Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased from the year ago quarter, to 99 million shares, due largely to our ongoing share repurchase program. The diluted non-GAAP EPS was $1.04 for the fourth quarter, and $4.29 for the fiscal year. The strong U.S. dollar negatively impacted our non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.15 in the fourth quarter and approximately $0.40 for the fiscal year.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of 845 million, debt at 496 million, and stockholders' equity of 1.7 billion. DSO at 90 [ph] was up five days from the year ago quarter. Cash flow from operations was 153 million for the quarter, and 470 million for the fiscal year. The primary uses of cash during the quarter were 128 million towards the repurchase of 1.5 million shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had 1.4 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends from calendar year 2015.","Now, I'll turn it back to Dow for the outlook.","Dow Wilson","Thanks Elisha. We believe that for our fiscal year 2016, total company non-GAAP earnings will be in the range of $4.45 to $4.55 per diluted share, and revenues were increased by about 4% to 5% on a reported basis versus fiscal year 2015.","For the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenues to be roughly even with the year ago quarter and dollars. With ongoing challenges experienced by Imaging Components in the second half of fiscal year 2015 as well as the effect of year-over-year changes in currency exchange rates, we expect non-GAAP earnings for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 to be in the range of $0.88 to $0.92 per diluted share.","In summary, we believe that Oncology Systems is on the right track with continued steady profitable growth and that we have real momentum in our Particle Therapy business. We are focusing now on getting Imaging Components back on track.","We are now ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.","Vijay Kumar","Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Dow, maybe first one I think you had some interesting commentary on the overall market in terms of the spectacular market share gains you guys have been seeing, right? I guess my question is ex the market share gains, what is the underlying radiotherapy market growing within North America, right? So, I am just trying to get a sense in how long should we think about these sustained market share gains sort of going forward?","Dow Wilson","Yes. I think on the quarter what we saw in the Americas, the Americas was up \u2013 I am sorry, the Americas in total was down 5%, North America was up 4%, Latin America was down very significantly, as you'll recall in the fourth quarter of 2014, we booked a large portion of the Brazil order. So, when you kind of peel the onion on it, we were very comfortable with where we saw the U.S. market at in the fourth quarter, and all year that was kind of \u2013 we did gain from shares or maybe half of the increment is share gain and half is market growth and also markets probably in 3%-ish range, and we were coming in at 5%-6% constant currency adjusted range.","I think as you saw at ASTRO, we are very comfortable with our product portfolio and the position we have across the product line. I think it's strong as our product line has ever been. And we are very encouraged by the reception we had at ASTRO. So going into ASTRO, I have already said \u2013 and maybe we can maintain share after a pretty good share gain, but coming out of ASTRO we're more bullish than ever. So until we get a 100%, we are going to keep going after some more share gain.","Vijay Kumar","That was helpful. And maybe one on EPS guidance, Elisha, so I know that the guidance excludes $0.50 of potential contribution from Emory, right? So, I know last year when you gave the guidance, you had a similar issue with Maryland, right? And I think at that point installation was complete. It was just a question of financing being in place. Can you walk us through what are the sensitivities around the Emory recognition for this? Is this in a similar place or you've installed that, it's just a question of getting the financing in place? Thank you.","Dow Wilson","Yes. Let me make a comment, and Elisha can then add some color on the accounting. We have not shipped Emory yet. So that's very different than our position at Maryland. The building is nearly ready for installation, and the banks are working on financing. Now, Elisha can talk to the guidance impact.","A - Elisha Finney","Sure. And the reason it won't be quite as material as Maryland, because with Maryland we were much further along because we had actually shipped and begun the installation. So, under the percentage of completion, we anticipate depending on when this financing if and when it gets completed, but it could be as much as $0.15.","The other impact in the guidance this year versus last year is also we are continuing to have some FX impact in our first half, and that's really concentrated in Q1 because the FX rates really didn't change that much until we got into our second quarter last year. So we are facing a Q1 headwind on FX. That should start to stabilize as we get further into the fiscal year, and we anticipate about $0.15 on the full fiscal year '16.","Vijay Kumar","Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","David Roman","Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody.","Dow Wilson","Hi, David.","David Roman","How are you doing? Hey, Elisha. I know you gave a lot of detail with respect to the individual business operating lines on the call, but maybe Elisha you can help us maybe about the bridge from the first quarter earnings guidance through the balance of the year, particularly in light of the commentary that I think one of the explanations for the fourth quarter shortfall was a slippage of recognition revenue from Q4 into fiscal '16, and maybe just help us bridge the Q1 to the full year.","A - Elisha Finney","Sure. So, the full year remains as we talked about last week, it is a 445 to 455. For Q1, if I take that $0.90 at the [audio gap] of that $0.10 push out of Q4, and when you add that back, you'll see kind of that mid single-digit, if you were to do all of that math, mid single-digit EPS growth on an apples-to-apples basis. And I went back and look historically Q1 has always been right around 20% to 22% of our total year. That's exactly what this Q1 is. I think last year was bit of an anomaly where our Q1 given an unrealistic gross margin we had in oncology, it was a good thing that quarter, but it ended up being closer to 25% of our total fiscal year. So, it gives me confidence that we are kind of in that historical range at about 20% of our year.","David Roman","Okay. And then, maybe just coming back to the Imaging Component, and Dow, you talked about reinvesting to try to get the business back on track. At what point do you start thinking about other strategic alternatives for that franchise, particularly given some of the pressure that you've described sound more sort of structural in nature rather than cyclical?","Dow Wilson","Yes. Clearly, we are going to watch where the price goes this year. Historically, it's been a terrific business for us with very good growth and companywide best operating profit, and cash generation has also been very good. So, we still love the flat panel and tube part of the business. The security part of the business is very profitable. The profitability of that business hasn't changed, but it's very cyclical, and we get some big turns there.","We like the fact that we're the leader in digital imaging technology. And so, we've got both a strong product portfolio as well as scale in the business. And there are synergies with our oncology business. The oncology is the second largest customer of that business. About 10%-12% of the product cost of our oncology business comes from our components business; over 1500 tubes and panels a year. So, there is some vertical integration that we look at.","I think what's happened is this business experienced the FX change in a different way than the rest of the world experiencing it. Since more than 75% of the business is outside of the U.S. and largely Japan and Europe, and since it's almost entirely denominated in dollars, there was no FX constant currency adjustment to make into the business. And so, the way that was felt was in pricing, as I said in the script.","So clearly, that's what we are going to be watching where this business goes. But we had one customer insource as I said on the call and we've been through the rest of our pipeline. We have got contracts with everybody else. We feel like the rest of the business is secure. We are working very hard on some new products that will drive some feature and benefit. They have a full chance to hit the price as well as give us some cost reduction. And you've seen some acquisitions from us in this space this year. Those acquisitions are enhancing the portfolio, giving us some scale, and they are executing ahead of our internal plans by a little bit. They are 150 [ph] million together, Claymount and MeVis. So it's not huge, but we like what they are doing for us.","And I think the key for us to watch here in 2016 is where does this price go? It's pretty stable in the dynamic sections of the market. In the radiographic piece of the market, there is a lot of competitors, there is need for some consolidation in this market, and we are going to watching that over 2016.","David Roman","Okay, terrific. Thank you for all the perspective.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Wittes with Brean Capital. Please go ahead with your question.","Jason Wittes","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Listen, clearly the oncology business is trending along very nicely. I think a lot of investors are obviously a little bit concerned about what's going on with the visibility on imaging, and I appreciate there has already been a few questions on this. But if you could just walk us through how you got to your assumptions for this year in terms of how you think this bad market will grow. You said there is about $50 million of revenues that are going away this year. I know you mentioned currency. I imagine there is some acquisition in there, but what other issues might drop and what else is baked into the assumptions that you put out there?","Dow Wilson","I mean, the pricing assumptions we kind of let's go through, we do have this one of our large customers coming out, that's worth about $50 million. I think Elisha can comment on margin rate. We do have the two acquisitions that are positive 50 million of revenue for us, and I think at a high level those are the assumptions we're looking at.","A - Elisha Finney","Yes. I think one difference this year versus last year, Jason, is when we had our security business fall off 56% in one year, that was unprecedented, and frankly a surprise to all of us. That business today \u2013 I don't think we can go a whole lot lower, because half of it today is service. So, I just don't think you are going to see the steep decline that we experienced last year in SIP. If you just look at tubes and panels last year how many orders, they were down in the single-digit on a combined basis. So, I think we could have weathered a good bit of that, but when our highest margin product line fell more than 50%, that was just something that was hard to get over.","Dow Wilson","And maybe we did say the business would be flat a few percent. So that's kind of \u2013 with the acquisitions in and out, that's kind of what we're looking at the high level. And the other thing that I mentioned in the script that we probably ought to highlight as well is that we have done a restricting in the business taking out about 10%-ish the headcount in the business.","Jason Wittes","Okay. And my understanding is that flat panels is clearly where there is a large increase in competition, what percentage of the imaging business is flat panel at this point?","Dow Wilson","It's about 50-50, flat panel and tubes. Yes\u2026","Jason Wittes","And the last one on security \u2013 thank you. And the last question on security, I know that the price of oil has impacted that business. In your understanding, how that business might shape up in 2015 or something is not right now?","Dow Wilson","We had forecasted it flat, so no improvement. It is lumpy. So, maybe there is a blue bird that happens in the year, but we have not forecasted. Markets remain \u2013 I mean most of this business is in oil-based economies. We've seen very little tender action. So, with the visibility we have is that there will be no improvement in that segment of the business in 2016. Coming back to the earlier question, this is the place that we will at a high level look at strategic options.","Jason Wittes","Very good, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Steve Beuchaw","Hi. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking\u2026","Dow Wilson","Hi, Steve.","Steve Beuchaw","Hey, Dow, I would like to follow-up on the commentary you made early about your reflections on ASTRO. You talked about the durability of share gain, I wonder if you could just spend another minute on it. What is that that you think in 2016 has the company still well positioned? Is it more about software or is it more about distribution? What do you think in '16 the key to the share gain storyline?","Dow Wilson","I mean, I think our strongest point at ASTRO was our treatment planning product, RapidPlan. You have to be able to plan the treatment, and there is nobody that does that better than we do. The efficiency \u2013 I think for me, the most exciting part about ASTRO was to see these papers coming out, documenting what we marketed the year before. So, we launched this last year. We felt very good about it. But to see these papers that I mentioned in the script come out documenting both the efficiency improvement as well as the quality improvement have been dynamite, and that's a big deal.","Second, as we go into an environment that's uncertain from a reimbursement point of view, total cost to ownership is everything, and Varian advantage there is \u2013 there is nobody close to us with that. There will be some niche products out there that probably get some play in some segments, but I think people are still going to be looking at value for money and how to stretch their capital dollars. I think the strength of our product line from top to bottom on the hardware side is very good. And then, our software products are as good as ever. People really responded well to the insight of analytics and some of the population informatics \u2013 population health and informatics tools that we have. And then, coming back to where I started is I think our treatment planning is dynamite. That's how the treatment planning process starts. And given the advantages we have on the hardware side to be able to take advantage of it, you have to have a great treatment planning product, and that's what we do that nobody else is even close to.","Jason Wittes","And then maybe dovetailing with that lot of commentary, I wonder if you could talk about VitalBeam and how you see VitalBeam playing overall in the portfolio? You kind of little bit further than I originally anticipated in terms of geographic product registrations on VitalBeam, where do you see that's sitting in the portfolio over the next year or two?","Dow Wilson","I mean it's a product that we think of is great for emerging markets and is really going to help us expand the market. It's an entry point for value markets and a chance to sell up. One of the truly important roles in the portfolio is to price protect the high-end of the product line in those markets, and it's doing that very well, and we really like what we've seen. We have seen good price stability on the TrueBeam as VitalBeam is coming into these markets. And we're starting to get some pretty good uptick on product.","Jason Wittes","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Tycho Peterson","Hey, thanks. Dow, can you maybe just add a little bit more on the TrueBeam delays? I understand a lot of those have already come through, but I guess if we think about some of the larger deals, longer term deals you are signing, you had one back in 2Q you called out, should we expect maybe a little more lumpiness in order shipment?","Dow Wilson","I'll say first of all that none of the delays had to do with a large order. These were all one-offs. So, while \u2013 I am not going to deny the consolidation of the market on the revenue side of the business that we haven't seen any impact related to a consolidating market for our revenue. This is about site readiness and acceptance testing, and getting all the documentations on and kind of punching it through. I think as we said, we have $25 million in TrueBeam and related software slip out of the quarter, and those were all one at a time, and each one was very painful.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. Are there lessons learned from your perspective around understanding customers better or\u2026","Dow Wilson","A lot of lessons learned that \u2013 so we have looked at both some of the process things we do and we have made some pretty significant changes in our organization since the quarter to make sure that we are strengthening it and enhancing it, so that this doesn't happen again.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then outside the U.S., EMEA big quarter, maybe just talk to the sustainability of trends and other things that we should be keeping an eye on in some of the emerging markets that could maybe mix or some quarter-to-quarter volatility?","Dow Wilson","EMEA had a terrific quarter. So, we really liked what we saw there. It was broad based. In the script you heard me mention the U.K., Poland, and India. So that was very good. I would say that on an ongoing basis, there still is very significant opportunity in India, and we talked about Africa in the past. I would say in 2015, Africa was quiet-ish, and so there is a lot of \u2013 I would say the pipeline there looks pretty good, so maybe we'll see that market come back. There's still a lot in Eastern Europe. I'd say the funnel looks pretty good in Eastern Europe. The core markets of the Middle East were pretty good in 2014, a little quieter in 2015. I think the funnel there looks pretty good in 2016.","China, it's still hanging in there. I mean, it's not \u2013 if we were growing close to 20-ish % in \u2013 fell 13, 14s \u2013 last year it was lower than that for sure. But we're not seeing a tank by any stretch. So, it's probably in the five to 10 range.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then last one on HDRT, it's still years away, but can you maybe help us think a little bit about the development costs. How should we think about R&D trending over the next couple of years? I know it was up kind of 1% here this quarter, but how do we think about this on a go-forward basis?","Elisha Finney","That's one operating expense, Tycho. I think you should just accept we will be about equal at the percentage of revenues. So we did a step-up to, I think it was years ago, from 7% to 8%. You should anticipate it should be roughly 8%. If we get a bolus of proton orders or sales in any given quarter it'll be a little lower, but all else equal, about 8% of revenue.","Dow Wilson","Yes, I think one of the things that really resonated with our customers at ASTRO was the overarching vision that we had around it. There wasn't product as that relates to products, and ref wreck, and income statement things, there's a variety of things that come this year. There are some things that'll come in '17, and a few things that'll come even after that. For example, this idea of any image you take you wanted the treatment console to help drive a hypofractionated treatment. We can do a lot of that with our Velocity product today. So part of the vision, we think we'll get some update by the way with our Velocity product. We've seen a very good reception to that product since we acquired it, 18 months ago or so.","And it's made a nice role for itself in the product portfolio, and in the family. The image quality improvement for cone beam CT, we should see in the next year-ish. And I think people are very excited about that. And then the first phase of the 4 Pi we can actually do no existing hardware. So we're not going to have to introduce \u2013 and we've heard the stock since 2010, on the strength of the TrueBeam platform and the amazing capabilities, and especially the speed of those capabilities. These are all things that we designed in from the beginning. There is software work to be done, but a lot of this can be leveraged on \u2013 most of it can be leveraged on the existing hardware platform. So, that's the other thing, is it'll be a software capability that we can take back to our, now, 1200-ish units TrueBeam installed based.","Tycho Peterson","Understood, thank you.","Dow Wilson","And I should say this, that none of this stuff is a pipedream. A lot of this being already worked in the developer mode by our research customers worldwide.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","Anthony Petrone","Thanks and good afternoon. Maybe a couple on proton and one strategy question for Dow. Just on protons, maybe you can give us a sense on the backlog for single-room systems, and maybe what's reflected in fiscal '16 guidance? Would additional orders for the contact system actually increase to what you're putting out there for guidance? And then as you work out, do you generally see, and the noise out of ASTRO, was that protons eventually could address 20% of the market needs. Do you see that happening, and if so, over what timeframe?","Dow Wilson","I'd say, I mean for the first part of the question, the answer is zero and zero. So we have nothing in our backlog, and we have nothing in our guidance because we're not going to put anything in the guidance that's not in our backlog. We've learned that lesson, as we've discussed already.","Elisha Finney","Let me clarify, would you have 350 million of proton backlogs just\u2026","Dow Wilson","That's right. Sorry, thank you. There was no single-rooms in our backlog. Having said that, we have a very active funnel of single-room systems, and I'd be surprised if we didn't see one or a few of those land in 2016. And as that happens we'll have some ref wreck upside maybe to report. But we have not put any of those in the backlog.","As to what percent of cancer patients are indicated for proton therapy. I think since the minute we've been in this business, it was part of the first thing that we did is due diligence. We thought the number would be somewhere between 10% and 20% of all cancer patients would be indicated for proton therapy. So that number is consistent with what our assessment was in our due diligence getting in a few years ago.","Elisha Finney","And Anthony, let me just clarify one thing. Under this percentage of completion method in protons, it's a little different in that we get to essentially recognize the revenue kind of linearly over the project. So if we were to get a compact order in the year, as soon as we specify equipment for a particular customer, we buy parts, we start putting it together, and producing it. We start revenue at that point. So we don't have to wait until it's built and shipped before we get any revenue.","Anthony Petrone","That's helpful. And maybe just a strategy question in the follow-up is really on the timing of the shift to non-GAAP earnings from GAAP earnings. It seems to follow the Claymount acquisition, and I think that's valued at around EUR 52 million. So it doesn't seem like a lot of intangible creation. And so at the same time, Dow you mentioned, consolidation in imaging, and the cash balance is approaching around a billion as of the quarter end. So maybe just an update on the M&A strategy, is this sort of an indication that the company may be getting more acquisitive as time goes on?","Dow Wilson","We did a few acquisitions last year. We like them both a lot. One is a pure software play MeVis computer aided diagnosis for both breast and lung cancer. We think there's an opportunity, given our distribution channel to leverage that product globally. And we're seeing some very good development opportunities in the oncology business there with some of the image processing things that they do. So that's encouraging. Claymount is a little more hardware. It's largely a cable and connector business. It's very synergistic with our tube business. It has the same customer [audio gap] factoring costs in the Philippines. I think we \u2013 these are capabilities that we can leverage across the company.","In terms of our broader M&A strategy, I think it's the same. We're always interested in things that we can do to strengthen our oncology business. On the hardware side, I don't see a lot there just because there's isn't much that's too close to us. But on the software side and the infomatic side maybe there are some things. And then we're going to continue to hunt as well the components base. We think scale matters there as the industry consolidates. It's been a rough year, but we've had terrific growth in this business. We've now \u2013 we believe that we're the largest manufacturer in the world of tubes and panels, even given some of the insourcing that the big radiology companies do.","So we've got a strong strategic hand to play in that business. And we like, even despite some of the 2015 rocky roads that we've been through, we like the cards that we have. And think we've got a good strategic hand to play given our scale.","Anthony Petrone","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird. Please go ahead with your question.","Jeff Johnson","Thank you, good afternoon guys.","Dow Wilson","Hi, Jeff.","Jeff Johnson","Hi, Dow. So let me start, I guess, with a couple just last final, hopefully, question on oncology here. As we go into a new fiscal year, these issues have been vetted in the past, but maybe just an update as we look forward to year here. One, just any update on the manufacturing side of oncology as you push costs out closer to where some of your revenues are recognized. I know you're going through the re-org in ICB, but are there still opportunities to push manufacturing costs down on the oncology side, number one.","And number two, Colleen kind of alluded last week to some of those Brazil orders starting to come out into the P&L or maybe it was Elisha, sorry. Last week, those Brazilian orders starting to come out into the P&L in '16. How do we think about the gating at this point of those Brazil orders? Are we going to get a first bolus kind of in '16, and then a similar '17, similar '18 or is it going to build over the next few years?","Elisha Finney","It's going to build, Jeff. So we've built in one to two handfuls of Brazil shipments in the second half of the year, primarily. So, this is going to be something \u2013 it's going to take a number of years for this to all work through the P&L and the margin.","Dow Wilson","Yes. And then relative to your first question, we are looking very hard at our supply chain in oncology. I mean the cost in this business, our actual labor content is very, very small. We do final assembly and test, which testing is very, very important. You got to get that right. We are pointing radiation at patients. We want to make sure that's done in the highest-quality fashion. So, we always want to make sure that that part of the process is very robust. Today, I would say the vast majority of it's done here in Palo Alto, we have some capability in China, and we are building some capability in Brazil.","So, China and Brazil will bring the cost per unit of that down, but we are still very significant here in Palo Alto, but the real cost opportunities on the supply chain side as we made very good progress on that in 2015, and that continues to be a focus area for us. I am very pretty pleased with the variable cost productivity we are getting in oncology. We're seeing at least mid single-digit kind of variable cost productivity in oncology.","Jeff Johnson","All right. That's helpful. Thank you. Then may be two follow-up questions on the proton business; one, Elisha, maybe can you talk about the gating of proton revenue and earnings recognition this year? Is it going to be pretty consistent on a quarterly basis throughout the year? Obviously, as you get into the third quarter, you have got to dig 23 \u2013 22, 23 bolus of Maryland hurt a little bit, but Dow, I think I remember at our healthcare conference, you talked about the proton earnings contribution this year is probably going to be similar if not higher in '16 over '15. So, just trying to figure out how that gates out the model?","A - Elisha Finney","Sure. So, the earnings contribution will be negative. I know it's verbally pretty similar to what we saw in FY'15 and FY'16. I am assuming that we are going to have roughly 20 million more proton revenue this year versus last year, just given what we are delivering on in the backlog. But remember the Maryland deal was pretty profitable because of the way it was a bolus of revenue, and because it was a very large center. So it should be about even with the year ago period in terms of the impact on the P&L, and of course the big wildcard being do we get Emory, and do we get any compact that we can book that are currently not in the backlog?","Jeff Johnson","All right. That's helpful. And then, last question on proton, just with regards to the Emory deal, does the UTSW issues that are happening down in Texas and bankruptcy filings down there and some legal hassling or legal wrangling I should say between kind of one of the donors there and then I think it's between him and ATP, does that impact Emory at all? And what does that do to the longer term potential of UTSW?","A - Elisha Finney","Sure. So, Jeff, from my knowledge, I mean these are all separate legal entities with separate investors and lenders and equity players, and so, one is insulated from the other. So I do not believe that it's going to have a big impact on Emory. I can tell you that we are still engaged with banks helping answer questions, so that APT can in fact get their financing put together. And longer term for UT Southwest, I do know that UT Southwest has indicated they are very interested in still having a proton center. And so hopefully, this litigation will get worked out and we can go to work for them and get it installed. But that's a ways off.","Jeff Johnson","Yes, fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Toby Wann with Obsidian Research Group. Please go ahead with your question.","Toby Wann","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Quickly on the oncology side of the business, can you maybe shed some light on the services side, how that was during the quarter, as well as the software side of the business?","Dow Wilson","Yes. I mean both were very strong in the quarter. Services were hit from a currency point of view, but constant currency basis, it was right where we expected it would be 9%-10%. Software is equally strong largely on the backs of RapidPlan.","Toby Wann","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have no further questions at this time.

The telephone replay will be available through Friday, January 26.","Now, I will turn it over to Michael Bruff, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Michael Bruff","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to Varian\u2019s first quarter fiscal year 2018 conference call and webcast. Joining me today on the call are Varian\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, Dow Wilson and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Bischoping. Dow will share his thoughts on our results and long-term strategy and Gary will cover our operating and financial results in more detail.","On the Varian Investor Relations website, you can find our fiscal first quarter press release and web deck which are intended to provide additional perspective and details. Included in these documents is the reconciliation of the differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. We report non-GAAP earnings to provide comparisons of operational performance, excluding unusual items. Unless otherwise stated, all financial results discussed are non-GAAP and from continuing operations. All growth rates are year-over-year and any references to orders are gross orders. All references to trailing 12 months refer to the trailing 12 months ending on the last day of our most recently completed first quarter. Also, note that we may provide growth rates in constant currency allowing assessment of the business excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations.","And as a reminder, Varian adopted revenue accounting standard codification 606 at the beginning of fiscal year 2018. The results that we disclosed today including fiscal year 2017 results and any forward-looking statements including guidance reflect this new standard. And finally, during this call many statements made maybe considered forward-looking statements. Our use of the words and phrases such as outlook, believe, expect, anticipate, could, should, will, promising and similar expressions are intended to identify those statements which represent our current judgment on future performance and other future matters. While we believe them to be reasonable based on information currently available to us, these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements in this presentation and discussion because of new information, future events or otherwise.","And with that, I will turn it over to Dow.","Dow Wilson","Thanks, Mike and good afternoon everyone. Today, I will share the key milestones we achieved this past quarter and how they contributed to our long-term strategy. First, let me touch on our first quarter results. Total company revenues of $679 million increased 13%. Oncology revenues grew 14% and the particle therapy business declined 4% in the quarter. Operating earnings of $126 million or 18.6% of revenue grew 84% in part due to the non-recurrence of an accounts receivable reserve taken in the prior year.","GAAP earnings per share, was a loss of $1.22 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.06 grew 110%. Our earnings per share results reflect the impact from the new Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as Gary will discuss in more detail later. Cash flow from operations was $179 million, up 118%. Looking more long-term, we continue to make meaningful progress towards our long-term growth and value creation strategy across three initiatives: first, strengthening our leadership in radiation therapy. Based on company estimates, the radiation therapy market grew 4.5% on an orders basis over the trailing 12 months. Varian grew orders 7% over that time growing share and extending our market leadership.","In our oncology business, orders grew 7% in the first quarter and our worldwide net installed base is now 7,876 units, up 3% over the trailing 12 months. Regarding Halcyon, we continue to be pleased with the order ramp with 62 total orders taken since the launch in May of last year, including 12 new orders in the first quarter. What\u2019s meaningful here is that of the 62 orders to-date more than half have been incremental and greater than 40% are for Greenfield sites. Looking forward, we expect solid demand over the coming quarters. The anticipated growth will be driven by new scaled configurations, optimized for different customer segments, more advanced capabilities such as kilovoltage Cone-beam CT imaging and the continued ramp up of public tenders as budgets are finalized for the new calendar year.","HyperArc, our high definition radiotherapy technology, also continues to ramp nicely. With 19 new orders in the first quarter, we have now taken 57 orders since the launch in the fourth quarter of last year and greater than 60% of those orders are upgrades. We are excited about what HyperArc will mean for treating multiple metastases brain cancer cases as these sites are installed. We continue to see strong demand for our software solutions. The number of unique Varian software customers grew 4% in the quarter and we are very pleased to see the installed bases of RapidPlan Double and Velocity, grow strong double-digits. And services had another strong quarter posting revenue growth of 8% in the oncology business, which includes performance obligations for installation, training and warranty as per the new revenue standard ASC 606.","In our particle therapy business, we booked two new proton orders in the quarter, one at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and one at the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami. Both orders are for ProBeam Compact single-room systems. Today, Varian has 23 customer sites with 70 rooms installed or under contract. In the first quarter, there were clinical room handovers at the Holland Proton Therapy Center and the proton therapy center in St. Petersburg, Russia. This brings the total operational sites to 7 globally with the remaining 16 in progress.","Our second growth initiative is to extend our global footprint. Our global market share growth was driven by orders based share gains in both our EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. In the Americas, we held our market leading share position. We are very pleased with Halcyon\u2019s continued adoption outside North America. 2 months after the hospital ordered the system, the University Hospital Leuven in Belgium became the first to treat the cancer patient on Halcyon in Europe. In Australia, the radiation oncology center in Toowoomba became the first to treat a patient on Halcyon there. And now with regulatory approvals obtained in Brazil, Japan and Taiwan during the first quarter, more commissions around the world are learning about and have access to this new advanced cancer care technology. Of the 62 Halcyon orders taken since launch, almost 40% were from emerging markets and approximately 90% of the emerging market orders are for incremental units.","Our software products are being with increased demand globally as well. In December, we announced that Peter MacCallum Cancer Center in Melbourne, Australia selected Varian\u2019s Eclipse treatment planning to replace its existing systems across all 5 of its sites. The full solution includes Varian\u2019s Velocity software for adaptive radiotherapy. Demonstrating our commitment in the fight against cancer in Latin America, we announced the opening of our new facility in Jundia\u00ed, Brazil, which extends Varian\u2019s global manufacturing and training footprint in the region. Partnering with the Brazilian Ministry of Health, we are bringing greater access to advanced radiotherapy treatment in that country and to greater Latin America.","Our third growth initiative is to expand into other addressable markets. We continue to build momentum in oncology care coordination, which is part of a larger care coordination market that is expected to grow greater than 20% CAGR over the next 5 years. With ongoing feedback from customers who are using our 360 Oncology software to manage clinical workflow and digitize the multidisciplinary tumor board, we are enthusiastic about the potential of the product. We are expanding the platform\u2019s clinical decision support, imaging and analytics capabilities, building enterprise and SaaS channel capabilities and beginning to provide real world evidence for 360 Oncology applications. Overall, we are very pleased with the progress we have made through the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018 and we remain committed to long-term growth and value creation for the company and our employees, our customers and patients and our shareholders.","With that, I will turn it over to Gary, who will provide more context on the first quarter financial results.","Gary Bischoping","Thanks, Dow. As always, I will consistently frame my comments in the context of our long-term growth and value creation strategy, which includes balancing growth, profitability and liquidity. So, let me start with growth.","Companywide revenue was $679 million in the first quarter, up 13% in dollars and 11% in constant currency. In oncology, revenue was $649 million, up 14% in dollars and 12% in constant currency driven by increased linac shipments in mature markets. Orders were $620 million, up 7% in dollars and 6% in constant currency. We ended the quarter with $2.7 billion in backlog, up 7%.","Taking a closer look at our oncology business results, in the Americas, revenue grew 16% in dollars and in constant currency. Orders were $300 million, up 2% in dollars and in constant currency. North America orders grew 2% supported by key wins in the quarter, including Norton Healthcare, which purchased 3 TrueBeam systems along with our ARIA, InSightive and Eclipse software solutions to deploy in their two sites. In Latin America, orders were down 3%, primarily due to Brazil. We did have 4 Halcyon orders in the region, 2 in Brazil, 1 each in Aruba and the Dominican Republic. Asia-Pacific revenue grew 15% in dollars and 17% in constant currency. Orders were $130 million increasing 6% in dollars and in constant currency. Orders in Japan and Greater China had solid growth in the quarter. In Greater China, we extended our market leadership with key wins in Qingdao Central Hospital, Fudan University, Zhuhai People\u2019s Hospital, all buying our Edge system.","In Europe, Middle East, India and Africa geography, revenue grew 9% and 2% in constant currency. Orders grew 19% in dollars and 13% in constant currency to $190 million in the first quarter. We continue to see market penetration across the regions as illustrated by wins in Denmark for 15 total treatment machines, including both TrueBeam and Halcyon to be deployed in two hospitals in Copenhagen region and in Poland, where Varian won a public tender with the Ministry of Health for 1 Halcyon, 1 TrueBeam and 3 VitalBeam machines. Our particle therapy business posted revenues of $29 million in the first quarter, which is down 4%. And as Dow mentioned earlier, we booked two new orders both in the U.S.","Turning to profitability, total company gross margin was $304 million, up 13% and 44.8% of revenues. Oncology gross margin of $302 million increased 15% and the rate was 46.5%, up 36 basis points. Looking at particle therapy, gross margin dollars were $2 million, down $3 million due to a mix of lower margin deals in the current period. Companywide SG&A expenses of $122 million or 18% of revenue were down $28 million or down 18%. The decline was primarily driven by the non-recurrence of prior year\u2019s $38 million accounts receivable reserve related to the proton business. Excluding this, SG&A increased $10 million or 9% driven by targeted investments in product management and sales headcounts.","On a GAAP basis, depreciation and amortization was $19 million. Investment will continue to be a key driver of our long-term growth and value creation strategy. In the quarter, R&D was up 12% to $56 million investing 8% of revenue. Company operating earnings were $126 million or 19% of revenue increasing $57 million or 84%. Excluding the $38 million impact on the prior year\u2019s results related to the non-recurrence of accounts receivable reserve, operating earnings increased $19 million growing 18%.","Turning to taxes, a major event in the quarter was the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into U.S. law on December 22. Two provisions with the new law had immediate impact. First, the U.S. corporate tax rate was reduced from 35% to 21%. In the long run, this will be favorable to Varian. However, in the recorder, it requires us to remeasure our deferred tax assets, which were originally recorded assuming a future tax benefit at the 35% rate. We estimate that the total impact of this remeasurement of deferred tax assets will be about $47 million. The impact to our first quarter is a charged income tax expense of $38 million. The remainder or about $9 million will be charged over the balance of the fiscal year.","Second, as part of the transition to a new territorial system, the new law imposes tax in the unremitted foreign earnings of the U.S. company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries at reduced rates, specifically 15.5% to the degree the earnings are held in the form of liquid assets and 8% to the degree the earnings are held in the form of illiquid assets. We estimate the tax effect of this mandatory deemed repatriation to be $169 million. Companies may elect to pay this tax often called a toll charge over an 8-year period we intend to make that election. The Securities and Exchange Commission has issued guidance allowing companies a 1 year measurement period to refine their estimates of the tax impact of the new law. We fully expect that we, like many other companies, will true up our estimates of these tax impacts from the new tax legislation over the measurement period.","Other provisions of the law will take effect over the next few years, thus after impacts of the new legislations provisions, our resulting GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 191.5%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22.5%, which excludes the tax expenses due to the repatriation of foreign earnings and lower corporate tax rates impact on our deferred tax assets. Similarly, our non-GAAP net earnings per diluted share also exclude these items. GAAP net loss per diluted share was $1.22. Our non-GAAP net earnings, was $1.06 with related diluted share count of 92.7 million shares in the quarter.","Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $823 million and debt of $340 million. Cash flow from operations was $179 million. Due to the adoption of ASC 606, we restated oncology DSO in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from 95 days to 108 days. Oncology DSO in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 was 103 days improving 5 days year-over-year. In addition to R&D, other investments in the quarter included $9 million in CapEx and $57 million to repurchase shares of our stock. As of the end of the quarter, we had 4.7 million shares remaining under our existing repurchase authorization.","I will now turn it back over to Dow who will discuss our fiscal year 2018 annual guidance.","Dow Wilson","Thanks, Gary. With respect to our annual guidance, we maintain the programmatic approach. There are three new factors we have taken into account regarding our fiscal year 2018 guidance. First, the global radiation therapy market growth increased from 2% growth over the trailing 12 months exiting our third quarter of last fiscal year to 4.5% growth over the trailing 12 months exiting our fourth quarter of last fiscal year; second, our growth and share gain in the faster growing market and our operational execution in the first quarter; and third, the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.","After a careful consideration of these factors, we believe it is prudent to update and raise our fiscal year 2018 annual guidance to the following: revenue growth range of 4% to 7%, non-GAAP operating earnings as a percentage of revenue range of 18% to 19%, non-GAAP effective tax rate of 21%, weighted average diluted shares of 93 million, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $4.24 to $4.36 and cash flow from operations range of $470 million to $550 million. The updated non-GAAP earnings per share guidance reflects $0.11 related to tax rate reduction primarily related to the impact of the law change on fiscal year 2018 earnings. We intend to reinvest about half in R&D to drive organic growth. The remainder of the anticipated non-GAAP earnings per share increase is driven by our continued market share gains in a stronger market and through operating leverage.","Thank you. And now, let\u2019s get to questions and answers. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jeff Johnson, Robert W. Baird & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Johnson","Thank you. Good evening, guys. Can you hear me, okay?","Dow Wilson","Good morning, Jeff. Jeff, it\u2019s loud and clear.","Jeff Johnson","Alright, great. Hi, Dow, I wanted to start on the oncology order side. The biggest upside versus my model anyway in APAC, that 6% constant currency growth came against the strong 29% comp, so just wondering what was going on there, what\u2019s driving the strong growth in APAC on top of that tough comp. And if I look at the Halcyon orders of 12, that\u2019s about half of what you bought in the prior quarter in fiscal Q4, so I am assuming it wasn\u2019t Halcyon the drove that and maybe you could touch on Halcyon and maybe thinking we are working to get a budget flush or maybe some upside on the Halcyon number that didn\u2019t seem to come through this quarter, so just what\u2019s going on there?","Dow Wilson","Sure. Yes. I mean just going around the horn geographically, first Jeff, we had a good quarter in Japan. As you know we didn\u2019t get Shonin approval in Japan until the quarter. So there is very good interest there. So we think longer term that the funnel looks very good, but we had a very good quarter in Japan, it was up significantly year-over-year. Southeast Asia was also up year-over-year, we had very good performance on a number of geographies in Southeast Asia. Australia was really the only one that was kind of go the other way. And then we had good double digit growth in China. So even on in tough comp, we had very good performance in China. And again in China, we also don\u2019t have Halcyon approval there yet. There \u2013 the from a product point of view it was all about our Edge product had very good up-tick of Edge, Gary mentioned in his remarks as well as on VitalBeam. The other thing that we are starting to see in Asia and especially in China is some very good up-tick in the software side of the business. So historically that\u2019s been a very, very small business for us. And with both the introduction of our ARIA Qin product and longer term development with \u2013 with Ping An and others like that, we think we have got a very good cycle. As it relates to Halcyon, we are very comfortable with where we are. It\u2019s the orders are incremental, they are in new sockets, it\u2019s growing our installed base, we did surprise the market with this product, our funnel remains very, very strong. I think what we are excited about is we have tiered the product and so we really think that we can get both more aggressive, but kind of lower end price points and with the coming of kilovoltage Cone-beam CT, higher price points in developed markets. So we are very excited about where this product goes. We are seeing some activity in the tender market. Those customers try to \u2013 trying to put themselves in line and develop budgets for the product. So I think it\u2019s very much in the budget development part of the market. And we like what we see very good funnel for the product.","Jeff Johnson","Alright, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And Gary, maybe one follow-up just on guidance, it looks like your revenue guidance update implies 1% to 5% reported growth over the balance of fiscal \u201818 over the next three quarters, I have got currency in my model adding probably 250 basis points over the next three quarters, so just trying to figure a kind of flattish organic revenue over each of the next three quarters is kind of \u2013 is that you guys being just over conservative at this point, is there something where first quarter took some out of the next few quarters, just how should we think about kind of your constant currency or your organic revenue expectations for the next few quarters?","Gary Bischoping","Yes. There is no real material change from our perspective Jeff in the currency market relative to our guidance. And so we will see what the markets do maybe you know better than I do as to where things are going, but our view is that currency really isn\u2019t impacted by the guidance update that we just gave, so no new news on currency. We like our backlog. I think the teams are doing a nice job of working through conversion. And we saw some of that benefit certainly in the first quarter as we moved more towards some mature markets that came through the revenue line from our recent orders. And so that certainly is helped. But overall not a big impact in guidance for us from what we had previously discussed from currency.","Jeff Johnson","Okay. So just I understand that then with the weakness we have seen in the U.S. dollar across so many currencies here over just the past four weeks, six weeks or so, you are essentially not putting any of that in the updated guidance?","Gary Bischoping","That\u2019s correct.","Jeff Johnson","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Amit Hazan, Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Amit Hazan","Hey, good afternoon. Let me stick with guidance for a second, you just asked about the cash flow guidance maybe that can help explain some of how the P&L changes are flowing through. You are not changing your cash flow guidance, so if the implication there is that the deep and the rate is kind of more of non-cash accounting related or is there some real pull-through here that somehow kind of offset somewhere else?","Dow Wilson","Yes. Amit good question and thanks for that. It\u2019s a pretty wide range right, $475 million to $550 million. When you look at trailing 12 months our cash flow, it\u2019s actually about $500 million right now on the trailing 12 months basis, so it\u2019s a pretty wide range. But know the update in guidance in the Q1 results are strong operating margin dollars, right, driven by the top line a little bit of margin rate expansion and some operating leverage. And then from the cash flow perspective as we talked about we saw good conversion from a DSO perspective in the oncology business and PT, the PT business had a good cash flow quarter as well, so kind of hitting all cylinders to deliver that $179 million, but there is no impact from ASC or any accounting changes that you have got running around in the revenue number that we have just guided to, right. We had a separate call just for that conversation and this update is based our performance in the market and the stronger market is head outlined.","Amit Hazan","Okay, that\u2019s very clear. And then I want to come back to health because I think that would be one question people ask tomorrow and so maybe a different way is asking the question, if we look at your orders I might get in about 5% of your oncology orders or something right now and I think what you are saying about it being more in budget development at the movement and so forth, but can you just maybe give us a sense of over the next year or 2 years how do you want to characterize it, where it should be as a percent of oncology orders, what you feel about that product if you can just ballpark something for us, so we get an idea of your confidence in it, I know it\u2019s early days but where that might go?","Dow Wilson","And I think that number one thing I had pointed too here is our total installed base growth. When you look at what we are trying to do we want to grow sockets, we want to go after those 12,000 incremental sockets that the Lancet report came out with a couple of years go. Clearly, that\u2019s what Halcyon is focused on. Having said that, we introduced two new products last year both that are in the 60 unit range, we feel very good about that. Both are driving installed base growth. We have been very pleased. For us here early on, we are looking at where they are going, so when you look at the 62 orders, first of all it\u2019s almost 20 countries \u2013 19 countries have placed orders, so we like the big broad base. We still have regulatory approvals to go in some key geographies, but we are seeing 60% of those in mature markets. Frankly, I think that will come down the kilovoltage Cone-beam CT will probably have an impact and we will see a little juice there. But I think long-term the big play here is going to be in the emerging market, so 40% here early on have gone into emerging markets. 40% of the 62 are in new sights, so these are folks had not gone radiation therapy before, so that\u2019s 25, 26 customers that are new in the business, that\u2019s huge for us, we can keep that up with the product that will be very significant, growth coming back to where I started grows our installed base gives us new opportunities for upgrade software and service. We also like the competitive trust here, about seven of them have been in competitive sockets and there has been a handful 4 or 5 that were in \u2013 where we wouldn\u2019t have been able to sit and evolve before. So I think we are very comfortable with where this is. We are not as we have kind of said before. We are not guiding on kind of Halcyon units, because its part of the whole portfolio with the family, it is not replacing an existing product, it is a new product on the market. And so that kind of test of what\u2019s incremental for us is really the game here. And we like what we are seeing there and we think in a developed world as we bring Cone-beam CT into the market and then exercise these new \u2013 these new price points in the value markets, we are going to get some more juice. Funnel remains very positive. And so that\u2019s the Halcyon story. And then you have got the HyperArc story to go with it. And HyperArc, we have placed 57 or we have 57 orders placed, that\u2019s very, very good on HyperArc, as I said on that in the text 60% of those are upgrade. People are really liking this product, the upgrade prices around depending on what they order some ins and outs, but it\u2019s about $1 million for the upgrade and north of 2.5 for new systems, but the we are \u2013 we are really liking what we see here on HyperArc.","Amit Hazan","Okay. Let me just sneak one quick one in for Gary and on the next quarter I know you guys you don\u2019t guide quarterly, but is there anything you want to tell us from a modeling perspective that this kind of help us keep numbers consistent given the volatility we saw in some of the accounting changes happen with last week changes?","Gary Bischoping","Yes. Nothing material, Amit, as we look through kind of the full year, again backlog is strong, the market is better than we thought, but kind of in line with what we expect for the long-term. We have been able to take share in that market. And we saw \u2013 we saw good hardware execution in the quarter. So nothing really new news with regard to Q2 versus where we land in Q1 and our ability to continue to convert that backlog in orders is key focus area and the teams are out there winning business competitively in the field. So in the long-term, we think that turns into that 4% to 7% revenue range that we gave.","Amit Hazan","Alright. Thanks very much, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Anthony Petrone, Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Dow Wilson","Hi, Anthony.","Gary Bischoping","You might be on mute Anthony.","Anthony Petrone","Sorry about that, can you hear me now?","Dow Wilson","We got you.","Anthony Petrone","Great. How is everybody doing? Thanks. Maybe just start on installation cycles and a backlog question, I think Gary you mentioned in your prepared comments just I think installations on Edge accelerated, to how much are you seeing a faster installation cycle benefit or come through to that 4% to 7% top line outlook. And then maybe just reconciling the order backlog, it grows orders down a little growth of $3 billion, I think with the accounting change you called out $3.1 billion, so how much of that was just installations coming out as opposed to maybe age outs and cancellations? And then I have a follow-up.","GaryBischoping","Yes, so thanks Anthony for the question. So first of all, just in the quarter the way to think about what was a robust revenue growth rate of 13%, is in our oncology business from a hardware perspective, we mix the hardware. And then inside of that we have really saw an acceleration of units that we kind of booked in orders over the last six months, is a higher percentage of our overall book than we had seen in the prior year, even all of last year. And so we attribute that to some good execution in the field, but also just kind of how the order book mixed out into revenue here early in the year. So, can we keep that up, that level of consistency, it\u2019s choppy, it\u2019s choppy out there, that\u2019s part of while we went to annual guidance we are trying to smooth out some of that choppiness that we see in any given quarter. So overall we are happy with execution. We like the book of business that we took on from an orders perspective, it\u2019s 7% in oncology. We think that translates into 4% to 7% kind of revenue growth over the year. As it relates to backlog, that the backlog for oncology is something that it wasn\u2019t impacted by ASC 606 first and foremost, okay, so there is no impact from ASC 606 adoption the backlog at all. We made a change in methodology right that we had talked about on the call and there were no abnormal amounts of dormancy that we saw in the quarter from what we would see normally with regard to a percent of the overall backlog total. So, we are not seeing anything at all to reiterate from ASC 606 in backlog and the overall oncology business backlog increased 10%, sorry, the overall the Varian backlog increased 10% year-on-year and oncology grew 7% year-on-year to $2.7 billion of backlog. So, good backlog growth should translate into that 4% to 7% revenue growth hasn\u2019t moved through the year.","Anthony Petrone","Yes. Maybe just a follow-up on revenue rec, just I mean is there any if we are under the prior model, I mean would there have been a notable difference in the revenue guidance or again is this just you are seeing whether it\u2019s better installations or just share gains whatever the case maybe, is that more reflective of the 4% to 7%?","Dow Wilson","Yes, just to be really clear right, we held the call earlier in the month and that call was a pure translation of ASC 605 to ASC 606, right. So, this current guidance going from 3% to 5% to 4% to 7% is purely two things in our mind, one is the markets better than we had thought as we exited Q3, right, actually the Q3 was growing about 2% and now we see the market growing 4.5% and two is our execution in that market. So, that\u2019s what\u2019s reflected in the increasing guidance purely our market growth, the overall market growth and our ability to execute in that market nothing to do with ASC 606 adoption.","Anthony Petrone","Very clear. And the last two for me real quick would be just a quick update on Siemens, the installed base there haven\u2019t heard about that in a while, just where that is and maybe where those bunkers are going? And then just on the M&A, I think out of the spin from Varex, there was some talk potentially of tuck-in acquisitions, the company\u2019s balance sheet continues to strengthen you are approaching $900 million, it looks like the debt is going to be paid off soon. So, there is room to lever back up, so just an update there? Thanks.","Dow Wilson","Yes, in terms of the Siemens installed base, it remains a good opportunity for us. It does continue to ramp down. We like the Halcyon play in that market a lot. So, it\u2019s where we are actually seeing in the Halcyon market with prospects. A lot of these customers that have been hanging on to old stuff are really interested in Halcyon. So, these were smaller systems that were sold. Often, we couldn\u2019t get a big TrueBeam in those vaults. With Halcyon, we got a real play. It is a value market and we see that opening up. I don\u2019t have the exact count for you on the installed base. I would say that it\u2019s come down from where it was 5, 6 years ago, but it is stickier than we thought. I think when we started this thing, it was like 2,200, 2,500 unit installed base and it\u2019s certainly less than that now. But when we kind of look at the whole thing at least for Halcyon as an opportunity that IEA counts about 2,100 cobalt units, there is a whole bunch of tomotherapy units and a whole bunch of Siemens units on top of that that we would kind of view that as the prime target market for Halcyon.","And then the second part of the question was M&A, in terms of M&A as we have kind of said before, we are looking at extending our footprint in software. So first and foremost is we want to continue drive the organic investment in R&D. Second is really looking at what we can do to enhance kind of this ecosystem for cancer therapy. On the software side, we continue to value things that use radiation and is there a play for synergies with our treatment planning or oncology information system software. And then with that, we can make some other kind of capital allocation decisions as we go, but at least here as we look at the fiscal year we wanted to maintain our fire power and all the flexibility for those kind of plays as we move forward.","Gary Bischoping","The only thing I would add with regard to financial flexibility is that, over time, certainly the jobs \u2013 the tax and jobs act will give us some more financial flexibility as we work our way through getting that money to the U.S. and so but that you can\u2019t kind of do that, switch it that takes a few months to actually get the money.","Anthony Petrone","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Brandon Henry, RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Brandon Henry","Yes. Thanks for taking my question.","Dow Wilson","Hi, Brandon.","Brandon Henry","Hi. So, fiscal year \u201818 guidance still assumes kind of wide range in terms of operating margins, can you talk about what your view is the main drivers of operating margin expansion for this year and the various factors that lead you to the top and the bottom end of that range?","Dow Wilson","Yes. I think you saw some of that in the current quarter. With that stronger top line we were able to still invest and grow our investment in R&D, but get a little bit of operating leverage out of that, I think it\u2019s 10 basis points on a year-over-year basis in the quarter. And then SG&A leverage right, we continue to invest on the sales side. We like how those investments are returning for example in the software folks in Asia, that makes lot of sense and that we are starting to see early returns from that. So you will see us continue to look to invest right in R&D or organic growth options as well as on the sales line and then get a little more operating leverage out of G&A. So some of what you saw on a year-over-year basis Q1 of \u201818 versus Q1 of \u201817 is what we think we will define the high end of the range and the lower end of the range, we are going to invest. And so we are looking, there is a whole host of organic options. Now we are a pure play cancer treatment company. We are focused on the software side that will also require organic investment. Kind of throttling that as we go through the year would help the final low end of the range.","Brandon Henry","Okay. And then separately, the ramp of 360 oncology has gone a bit more slowly than we expected, can you give us an update there and kind of talk about what Varian is doing to accelerate that option of this solution?","Dow Wilson","Yes. I know I think we are pleased with the products of getting very good reaction from early customers. I think the market very much wants to see evidence. And so we are kind of very much in the evidence building phase of that product. I think it\u2019s going to take this year to kind of be able to show people both the effectiveness impact as well as the efficiency productivity related impact. We have gotten very good relationships in the UK and with Cone Health, what our folks are working this. We have had other very good luminary orders on the quarter. But I think big impact is going to be after we really got the evidence. In the meantime we are working on increased functionality for broadening the capability of the product, bringing critical decision support, the incremental tumor board functionality and I think we have \u2013 I think we have got the right product. We have also retooled our sales force a little bit to make sure we are calling on the right people. And we are bullish about where it\u2019s going. But I think in full disclosure, we do think it\u2019s going to \u2013 it is an enterprise sale, it is a little more complex sale and I think our real impact is going to be after we kind of get the evidence accumulated and demonstrated to folks.","Brandon Henry","Alright. And then just last question for me if I can sneak one more in, can you give us an update on the current balance sheet exposure both on the receivables and loan for proton therapy, so I am just asking, because I remember the Munich, Germany facility I think, went bankrupt last year and is in proceedings right now. And then also if you can provide kind of an update on how the Maryland proton facility, how the uptake is going there? Thanks.","Gary Bischoping","Yes. Just from a balance sheet perspective, where I think is about $175 million on the balance sheet in terms of the investments that we have in those \u2013 in the loans related to that. Look, we continue to monitor that MPTC is showing pretty good results relative to the patient volume. They continued to work their way through driving those with multiple initiatives, maybe Dow can help chime in there here in the second, but that\u2019s a key to success. And we have seen very good markets with regard to the municipal bond market, right. The Georgia Proton Center kind of got that started. Delray kind of followed through, we have successful refinancing the CPT Center in San Diego that\u2019s now clinically moved over to a new operator as well. So, we do see strong capital markets for these assets and that combined with kind of steady to slightly rising patient counts should help us move our way through this.","Dow Wilson","Yes, I think just on Maryland, they are doing very well. Their patient count is around 100 patients a day. So, they are getting good volumes. They are doing very interesting work. I think the medical staff is very much on board with the program, have an outstanding team and are continuing to drive it forward.","Brandon Henry","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Tycho Peterson, JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Tycho Peterson","Hey, thanks.","Dow Wilson","Hi, Tycho.","Tycho Peterson","Go back to guidance, you are guiding to 4% to 7% after doing 13% this quarter, maybe Gary, can you kind of address the question as to whether there was some pull forward this quarter or whether you are just being a little bit conservative on the rest of the year? And then can you clarify what the organic growth guidance is that there seem to be some confusion on that based on my amounts?","Gary Bischoping","Yes. So, I would say, again, we executed pretty well in the quarter. We did see more of a mix shift into mature markets on the hardware side. And as mature markets are shorter duration to get from orders to revenue that certainly helped that revenue growth, whether that continues or not over the rest of the quarter, probably not at that rate that we saw in Q1. As it relates to what\u2019s organic, what we gave is guidance 4% to 7% is organic growth rate, right and so currency, there is some benefit here that we have seen the short-term. We will see if that holds on. You saw a little bit here in Q1, but really what you are staring out there 4% to 7% is our organic growth guidance.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then I guess for Dow, did you \u2013 new rules around CapEx expensing for tax deductions change anything from your view from a customer perspective in terms of willingness to purchase?","Dow Wilson","I mean, I think we could intellectualize it a little bit, but we certainly haven\u2019t seen any change in behavior yet.","Tycho Peterson","Okay.","Dow Wilson","At least when we look at the funnels, I wouldn\u2019t say we have seen any change in behavior yet, Tycho.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And one last one that\u2019s come up is GE this morning talked on their call I guess the SEC is looking into the revenue recognition around 606 you are one of the other few companies that have changed your numbers? Is there any risk to you guys that SEC could be looking into this for you?","Gary Bischoping","We have been transparent with investors and with our disclosure approach. And look, we are not at the SEC, but we are very comfortable with how we have gone through the implementation and in coordination with our accounting teams internally as well as PwC.","Tycho Peterson","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Isaac Ro, Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Isaac Ro","Good afternoon, guys. Thank you.","Dow Wilson","Hey, Isaac.","Isaac Ro","Hey, Dow. First question is on Halcyon, no update on the prepared comments with regard to China, just curious if you still expect June or July approval timeline and if so what\u2019s baked into your expectations there, I am wondering if there is any pent-up demand that you can point to?","Dow Wilson","I mean, we have kind of said summer all along. So, I think we have had \u2013 we do have to go through a clinical trial and we are going through that clinical trial. It\u2019s accumulating slowly, but there might be a little bit of risk around that, but it\u2019s not more than that quarterish, but I would say we are still in the second half of the year. In terms of pent-up demand, what we have seen, we have seen a very good China market, double-digit again this quarter. So, we haven\u2019t seen anybody stalling plans. We do know that people are looking at the product and maybe there will be a few out there. So, we are bullish about the market and the play it\u2019s eventually going to have in the market, in part, why we have elected to manufacture it there and certainly excited about the long-term prospects of Halcyon in China.","Isaac Ro","Okay, thanks. And then maybe a second question on software, could you give us any color as to the percentage of your software that comes from planning related tools versus other applications? And the reason I ask is I am just trying to take through the path of doubling your software over the next few years for your long-term plan?","Dow Wilson","Yes, it\u2019s about 50:50. When you look at \u2013 when you look at treatment planning versus oncology information systems, the business has split about 50-50, so the treatment planning part is the significant portion of the business. The \u2013 we have good products coming out there, we also have exciting new products in our oncology information system, with new analytics capabilities, new informatics capabilities that the software that we are selling as part of a service agreement is growing nicely and remains a big opportunity there. One of the things that I mentioned briefly before in one of the Q&A is historically we have done very little in the oncology information system business in China. And you saw earlier this quarter we announced ARIA Qin, which is a new localized Chinese version of our oncology information system product and we announced this new memorandum of understanding with Ping An to kind of bring that product to those markets. So we are very excited about where China can go and at the same time some of the SG&A investment that you saw this last half has been for incremental sales people in Europe and APAC to go sell these new \u2013 these new software offerings. So we are \u2013 we remain very bullish about the software opportunity.","Isaac Ro","Thanks. Last question is for Gary, on the guidance, I just want to reconcile one more time, you guys raised revenue and EPS guidance today, but you didn\u2019t raised cash flow guidance and I am just not clear as to why that\u2019s the case, I am wondering if there is something with working capital that the factors into the guidance for cash flow?","Gary Bischoping","Got it, again appreciate the question, but it\u2019s a pretty wide range, like I had mentioned in earlier in the call $475 million to $550 million. We saw a good progress again year-over-year on oncology system\u2019s DSO. We will continue to drive our work through that progress. And then on the inventory front, we think we have opportunity as we go through the rest of the year. So I wouldn\u2019t read anything into that it\u2019s just again a wide range and we thought it was comfortable given the changes we had in revenue.","DowWilson","And with the huge increase over 2017.","Gary Bischoping","The only thing, I would point to that remember as we grow, we actually chew into working capital, right. So we raised the revenue growth was 3 to 5 to 4 to 7, so as you grow you actually eat working capital. So that\u2019s the other thing you keep in mind here is think about that $475 million to $550 million.","Isaac Ro","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar, Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","Vijay Kumar","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the nice quarter. So I had a few questions if maybe I will start with the Q1 revenue it really, really maybe strong, I guess my question is would \u2013 that 13% growth we saw in Q1, would that have still been 13% if this is the own accounting methodology, because there seems to be some confusion on what happened, what drove that 13%?","Gary Bischoping","The answer is yes, right. We restated Q1 for ASC 606 of last year and we use the same methodology in this year. So that growth rate is year-over-year, like-for-like with regard to accounting standard.","Vijay Kumar","Okay. And then what\u2019s the FX in the quarter, right, was if like couple of percentage points on the revenue so if organic is 11 in Q1 and that 4% to 7% organic that you mentioned for the guidance is that, so do we assume that there is no FX in that 4% to 7% guidance on the revenues?","Gary Bischoping","Yes. So in the quarter it was 1.5% impact on our growth rate and again to reiterate that growth we had guided to for the full year that\u2019s organic. And so if currency kind of stays where it is we will then chop that out as we get closer to realizing that.","Vijay Kumar","Okay and that\u2019s helpful, Gary. And then on the product side oncology, it was up 20% in 1Q, I can\u2019t remember last time products were up by 20%, right, so maybe some color on what happened, what drove products plus 20% because that implies in a services, which has certainly been stronger, that came in more like mid-singles?","Gary Bischoping","Yes. I referenced it a little bit earlier on the call, but it\u2019s growing into more mature markets that have shorter data going time slot going from orders into revenue. And so just for example in Q1 of \u201817 about 25% of our units came from \u2013 came from units that were the prior six months, whereas in Q1 of \u201818 that jumped up to about 35% of units. And so we saw \u2013 we saw an increase in a number of units that are growing into revenue from the prior six months of orders than we had in the prior year. So that\u2019s in large part of that mix of mature markets that we have talked about, but also some good execution by the team.","Vijay Kumar","That\u2019s helpful, Gary and that segues me into my next question, so North America, when you say mature, I am sort of thinking its North America, what was North America orders in Q1?","Gary Bischoping","North America orders in Q1 in oncology don\u2019t have it at my fingertips.","DowWilson","It was up 2%.","Gary Bischoping","Yes, 2%, yes, up 2%.","Vijay Kumar","Thank you, Dow. And then one last one, just on the quarterly EPS cadence, so if I historically, if I look back, so Q1 was the least and then usually, we have sequential step ups throughout the year, is that, but again when we look at the guidance for this year, just given the revenue strength, some of this quarterly cadence changes can you comment on the quarterly EPS progression?","Gary Bischoping","Yes. I am not going to comment on the quarterly EPS progression, we gave our annual guidance, we think $4.24 to $4.36 made sense given how we are operating and given the market we are operating in. As quarters go on, we will see trends kind of play out here, so no comment at this point.","Vijay Kumar","Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson, Robert W. Baird & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Johnson","Thank you, guys. I will be quick here and I don\u2019t want to belabor the point, but Gary, I just want to understand you are now guiding constant currency revenue, I have covered you guys I think 10 years, 11 years now and it\u2019s always been reported revenue is what the guidance is, so is this a formal change that we are now any guidance in the future is organic in our currency assumption go on top of that or should we just assume that you\u2019re just being conservative in the 4% to 7% and there is currency upside to that, I just want to know if this is formal from here on out, any \u2013 any revenue guidance you gave us is organic growth guidance? Thank you.","GaryBischoping","This is not formal, Jeff. So FX rates are basically the same as we saw at our initial budget, so there is we are not going to breakout currency here specifically, this is not formal though.","Jeff Johnson","Okay. And again not to belabor this, but I think the yen or the pound has moved like almost 10%, euro has moved 5%, the yen for 5% here in the last few weeks, so I am just trying to understand your comment that currency has it moved since, you put the budget together?","GaryBischoping","It\u2019s that is where it is Jeff at this point from a currency perspective and it\u2019s a guidance as it rolls out is like I said organic, it\u2019s not a formal change. You saw about 150 basis point impact in Q1 and we will see how that plays out over the year.","Jeff Johnson","Alright. Thanks guys.","GaryBischoping","Sure.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to Dow Wilson, for closing remarks.","Dow Wilson","Yes, I am very pleased with our first quarter performance. We are strengthening our leadership in radiation therapy, extending our global footprint and enthusiastic about entering faster growing markets beyond traditional radiation oncology. Looking forward, we will continue to focus on our growth initiatives. We remain committed to innovating new technologies for treating cancer and building solutions that connect clinical teams to advance patient outcomes or driving towards the ultimate victory a world without the fear of cancer. Thank you all for joining us."],"21658":["Varian Medical Systems (NYSE:VAR) Q1 2014 Earnings Call January 22, 2014  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Spencer R.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Spencer Sias, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications for Varian Medical Systems. Thank you, Mr. Sias. You may now begin.","Spencer R. Sias","Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Varian Medical Systems conference call for the first quarter of fiscal year 2014. With me are Dow Wilson, President and CEO; Elisha Finney, CFO; and Clarence Verhoef, our Corporate Controller. Dow and Elisha will summarize our results, and we'll take your questions following the presentation.","To simplify our discussion, unless otherwise stated, all references to the quarter or year are fiscal quarters and fiscal years. Quarterly comparisons are for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 versus the first quarter of fiscal 2013.","Please be advised that this presentation and discussion contains forward-looking statements. Our use of words and phrases such as outlook, could, believe, can, expect, will, hope, target, likely and similar expressions are intended to identify those statements which represent our current judgment on future performance or other future matters. While we believe them to be reasonable based on information currently available to us, these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of the important risks relating to our business are described in our first quarter earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements in this presentation and discussion because of new information, future events or otherwise. [Operator Instructions] And now, here's Dow.","Dow R. Wilson","Good afternoon, and welcome. We are reporting results that we believe put us on track for hitting our revenue and earnings targets for the fiscal year. To summarize our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 versus the year-ago period, revenues rose 5% to $712 million. Our gross margin grew by 60 basis points to 43.5%. Our operating margin remained about level even after a significant step-up in our R&D investments, and our net earnings grew by 6% to $0.91 per diluted share. We had several positive developments subsequent to the close of the quarter. This includes the big win for oncology in Algeria, our announcement of an expanded agreement to supply an estimated $550 million in imaging components to Toshiba and a 510(k) clearance from the FDA for our ProBeam proton therapy system.","I'll focus now on the operational highlights of our businesses in the quarter. Oncology Systems grew gross orders by 5% to $533 million for the quarter with the help of strong 13% order growth in North America, where we saw a broad-based increase in hospital purchasing activity. Hospitals accounted for the lion's share of our orders in North America. We booked $19 million in orders related to agreements with 2 large health systems in the U.S. to supply a total of $50 million in equipment and services for their consolidated networks over the next several years. The remainder of these orders we booked over the terms of the agreement.","Numerous takeouts of competitor's software and hardware products, including several aging Siemens and TomoTherapy machines, added to Oncology's growth in this market. New products, including our EDGE platform and upgrade for stereotactic radiosurgery also contributed to our orders growth in North America. Our newly introduced RapidPlan software for fast and high-quality, knowledge-based treatment planning got off to a solid -- a good start with several orders, including one that was coupled with the replacement of a competitor's accelerator.","We continue to see signs that the Affordable Care Act is causing decision-makers at treatment centers to sharpen their focus on both clinical efficacy and cost efficiency. Our oncology product line is closely aligned with this focus, and we believe our competitive position is stronger than ever.","During the quarter, health authorities in the U.S. recommended lung cancer screening for people deemed to have a higher risk of developing this disease. This recommendation could result in earlier diagnosis for a large number of cases that could be treated with lung radiosurgery. We are hopeful that this prompts more centers in the U.S. to acquire and use our radiosurgery products to help these patients.","Turning to markets outside of North America, gross orders were relatively flat in EMEA, where weak equipment purchases were offset by robust gains in our service business. The sales funnel in EMEA continues to look promising despite the ways that pushed potential deals in several nations outside of the quarter. We believe our market share in this region is stable.","In India, TrueBeam enjoyed continued success during the quarter with 5 wins, including a key placement in the National Oncology Centre at Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai. As an aside, TrueBeam constituted more than 60% of total high-energy machine orders in the quarter. We have now booked more than 1,000 orders for TrueBeam, and completed more than 600 installations since its introduction in 2010. We had a big win after the close of the quarter in Algeria, where we've entered into an agreement to supply the Ministry of Health with $51 million in equipment and service for 6 centers over the next 5 years. We expect to book about half of this order during the second quarter and the remainder as delivery sites and dates are set.","In Asia, oncology gross orders for the first quarter declined as a result of softness in both Japan and China. Slower repurchasing activity, competitive pressure, negative currency fluctuations and a tough year-ago comparison resulted in a significant decline in Japanese orders during the quarter.","In China, first quarter gross orders fell slightly versus the year-ago period due to delays in purchasing decisions. We believe these decisions will be finalized later in the year. Both TrueBeam and UNIQUE have established firm footholds in the China market, and we believe they help Varian to gain share there during the quarter.","In Brazil, we had another quarter of strong order growth even though we have not yet booked any orders from the tender we won for 80 machines. We expect to book orders relating to this tender as sites and shipment schedules are set. In the meantime, clinicians have continued to show interest in upgrading purchases to deliver IMRT, which is now being formally reimbursed by private insurers with the government likely to follow.","In total, gross orders for Latin America and the rest of the world declined by 5% versus the year-ago quarter. Service represented a record 40% of oncology gross orders in the quarter and continued to be an important growth driver for the company. The service business expanded by 15% during the quarter with particularly strong growth in EMEA.","Turning to X-ray Products. The timing of order placements resulted in a first quarter gross orders decline of 19% to $108 million. Shortly after the close of the quarter, we booked over $20 million in orders for panels and tubes. We saw a strong demand for our new mammography and wireless panels and continued interested in our bundled panel and workstation solutions. Separately, we are announcing the execution of an expanded 3-year agreement to supply an estimated $550 million of imaging components to Toshiba. Orders will be booked over the period of the agreement. As was announced earlier, we are adding 120,000 square feet to our production facility for manufacturing imaging components in Salt Lake City.","Before leaving X-ray Products, I want to take a moment to recognize the contribution of Bob Kluge, who is retiring in February from his role as Head of Varian X-ray Products and Security and Inspection Products businesses. Bob built X-ray Products revenues from $95 million in 1993 to $546 million at the end of 2013. We are indebted to Bob for his strategic vision, intelligent management and consistent execution that have propelled Varian to a leadership position in the global imaging industry. He set the stage for continued success and growth in our components businesses. At the same time, I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome Sunny Sanyal to Varian. Sunny, who's a former President of McKesson Provider Technologies, will replace Bob effective February 3. I'm sure Sunny will successfully build on the solid foundations laid by Bob.","The company's other category, which is comprised of the Security and Inspection Products business, the Varian Particle Therapy business and the Ginzton Technology Center, recorded gross orders of $14 million in the first quarter. Varian Particle Therapy reached a major milestone after the quarter ended when our ProBeam proton therapy system received 510(k) clearance. This sets the stage for commencement of patient treatments when systems are fully commissioned. With this clearance, we believe Varian has the most advanced proton system on the market. With our unique scanning beam technology, ProBeam has the capability to deliver intensity-modulated proton therapy or IMPT with the precision needed to capitalize on the power of protons. It also integrates some of Varian's most advanced technologies, including exciting elements of our TrueBeam user interface, as well as our image guidance and motion management tools. As it stands, we now have contracts to install our ProBeam system at several centers around the world, including 4 in the United States, 1 in Saudi Arabia and 1 in Russia. Now, I'll turn it over to Elisha.","Elisha W. Finney","Thanks, Dow, and hello, everyone. While Dow has already covered gross orders, I want to briefly talk about the constant currency growth rates for the quarter. Overall, currency exchange rates had virtually no effect on the company's total order growth in the quarter. However, exchange rates had a significant impact within some of our regions. For example, the yen weakened significantly from the year-ago quarter, which resulted in oncology growth orders in Asia being down 7% in dollars and even with the year-ago quarter in constant currency.","By contrast, currencies strengthened in Europe. Oncology's gross orders in EMEA increased 2% in dollars and fell 1% in constant currency. Oncology orders in our Rest of World region declined by 5% in dollars and by 1% in constant currency. The company ended the quarter with a $2.8 billion backlog, down 1% from the year ago quarter, including a roughly $50 million decline in proton therapy backlog. As a reminder, both gross and net orders are shown in the consolidated statement of earnings attached to our earnings release.","First quarter revenue for the total company increased 5% in dollars and 6% in constant currency. Oncology posted a 3% gain in revenues during the quarter with a significant increase in revenues outside of North America.","Service revenues grew by 11% over the year-ago period and represented a record 40% of oncology revenues in the quarter. X-ray Products posted first quarter revenue growth of 9%, with both tubes and panels contributing about equally. Revenues from businesses in the other category increased by $4 million due to continued progress on our Scripps, Saudi and Russia proton therapy projects.","Total company gross margin for the quarter was 43.5%, up 60 basis points from the year-ago quarter, with favorable product mix and lower quality cost in both of our major businesses. Oncology Systems gross margin improved by 1 point to 44.9%, helped by the continued growth in our service business, as well as improved quality cost. While we are pleased with the margin performance in the quarter, we continue to believe that oncology can sustain long-term gross margins in the 43% to 44% range.","X-ray Products gross margin for the quarter was up more than 0.5 point to 42.2% due to improved quality cost in both tubes and panels. We continue to believe that this business can sustain long-term gross margin in the low 40% level.","First quarter SG&A expenses were $110 million or 15% of revenues, a slight improvement as a percentage of revenues from the year-ago quarter when we incurred a $4 million restructuring charge related to an enhanced retirement program.","First quarter R&D expenses were $58 million or 8% of revenues, up more than 1 point as a percentage of revenue as we continued to invest in our global strategies and execute on our product roadmap.","Moving down the income statement, first quarter operating earnings totaled $142 million, up 3% from the year-ago quarter in dollars and almost even with the year-ago quarter at 20% of revenues. Depreciation and amortization totaled $16 million for the quarter. The effective tax rate was up slightly from the year-ago period to 31.2%. Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased from the year-ago quarter to $107.4 million due to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted EPS was $0.91 for the quarter.","Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $971 million, debt of $481 million and stockholders' equity of $1.7 billion. DSO at 94 was up 7 days from the year ago quarter, with an approximate 10-day impact from the proton therapy business, where extended payments are not yet due, but revenue has been recognized under the \"percentage of completion method.\"","First quarter cash flow from operations was $43 million, lower than net income, primarily due to working capital increases and accounts receivable and inventory versus the year-ago quarter. Primary uses of cash were approximately $155 million toward the repurchase of 2 million shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had 6 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2014.","Now, I'll turn it back to Dow for the outlook.","Dow R. Wilson","Thanks, Elisha. The company is executing its marketing and operational strategies effectively, and we believe we are on-track for hitting our fiscal year 2014 growth targets.","For the fiscal year, we continue to believe that total company revenues could increase by about 6% to 8% over the prior fiscal year. Net earnings per diluted share for the fiscal year could be in the range of $4.22 to $4.34. We expect total company revenues for the second quarter of the fiscal year 2014 to be about equal to the year-ago quarter when proton revenues were high. Net earnings per diluted share for the second quarter could be in the range of $1 to $1.04.","We're now ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Johnson from Robert W. Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Dow, I was wondering if I could start with you, 2 quick questions and then a follow-up for Elisha. For you, Dow, I guess, any update on the short cycle business. Obviously, that was a shortfall last quarter, just maybe how that bounced back, if it did at all, in the quarter. And also an update maybe on tone that you're hearing from the hospitals. The obvious -- obviously, the North American order number looked better this quarter. But do you think that's been driven by reimbursement? Just what are your conversations in the field telling you the follow-through has been since the better reimbursement rates were finalized?","Dow R. Wilson","I'll answer the North America question first. North American business was obviously very good. We're very pleased with that. 13% orders growth in North America, that's the strongest quarter we've had in over 2 years. So we like that a lot. As I mentioned in the script, we did see a couple of large deals in the quarter, and we think that, that is -- that we'll continue to see -- as the market consolidates, we'll continue to see some large orders. I'd say the short-cycle business is about the same. I wouldn't say that, that's ticked up. We did see some nice EDGE and RapidPlan activity. So that's good news. The new products are taking. We did add -- we did see some strong competitive takeouts. I think it's too early to tell whether this is -- I frankly don't think it's reimbursement-driven. I think maybe there was a little bit of a pent-up demand as people watched the -- watched Washington make some decisions. But I think it's still a little early to tell what the long-term impact is going to be. I guess our gut now it's is still kind of in the mid-single-digit growth kind of scenario, which is better than we've done in the last year or 2, so we like that. The good news is we still have a lot of product in the installed base that's aging. We've got 1,100 Linac installed base in the U.S. that's over 10 years old, so we can go after that. And then the other thing that we're curious to see how it impacts the market, it'll be positive in the long term, certainly is this new lung screening mandate that's come down. And clearly, the earlier we can identify a lung lesion, the more appropriate it is for radiation. And that will also have a positive impact on the configuration that we sell, because folks are going to want SBRT-capable, motion-managed-capable machines. So that's kind of the tour of North America.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, that's helpful. And when you say mid-single digit, do you still see it that way as -- from a growth perspective, Dow? You mean worldwide, or are you saying that for U.S., sorry?","Dow R. Wilson","Right now, for both.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","For both. Okay. And Elisha, just a follow-up for you, where is it? On the gross to net adjustment in oncology, I think last quarter you talked about that typically being a 3% to 5% adjustment. This quarter it was above that, a little north of $40 million, bigger than we were thinking. So are we still seeing you take more out of the backlog on the oncology side, more cancellations, things like that, than normal, or how do you explain that, I guess?","Elisha W. Finney","No, Jeff. This was very normal for a quarter. We had about $40 million of dormancies in cancellation, the lion's share of that being within the Oncology Systems, about a $5 million FX adjustment. That 3% to 5% is a backlog that we typically would deliver on about 95% of backlog. If you do the math, it's about, I think, 1.3%, 1.4% of backlog right now. So we're in that range. And really, I think proton impacted at our backlog, and proton was down $50 million. If that had been flat year-over-year, we'd be well within, say, the 1% of backlog range that is very typical.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Would you give a net order for oncology, a net constant currency growth rate for the quarter? Just like in the tables. We only get a reported, I believe.","Elisha W. Finney","It's -- the constant currency is the same. So we -- the yen and the euro were almost an exact offset in the gross and net.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","One housekeeping question, sorry if I missed it. But could you give us the North American and international net order figures for oncology?","Elisha W. Finney","We have -- no. What we gave was the geographic breakdown on gross orders. The lion's share of any impact of net is -- impacts North America.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So the lion's share, the 40 -- I'm sorry, $43 million, maybe 80%, 90% of that was on North America?","Elisha W. Finney","Correct.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So we can get to the number that way. Got it. I wonder, Elisha -- sorry, 2 questions for you, and one on gross margins. As you look at the quarter, clearly above what you've called out for the year. Does it imply that there's maybe some upside to the view that the right number for the full year is $42 million for the total company, and clearly, there's an embedded question there, which is could you speak to the impact of what proton means for gross margins and operating margins over the balance of the year?","Elisha W. Finney","Yes. So Steve, I mean, clearly, we were very pleased with the margin performance in both of our core businesses this quarter. That said, it's early in the fiscal year. We still have currencies moving around. What really helped both businesses this quarter was strong service in oncology. And we had lower quality cost in both our tubes, panels and Oncology business. We had a much higher percentage of revenue outside of North America. But that said, the revenues in our BRIC countries were down. So when I look at all of that together, I mean, obviously, we're pleased the product cost reductions are coming through as we anticipated. But I -- the geographic mix for the balance of the year could impact that. So at this early stage, I'm holding to that 43%, 44% for total oncology.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Hazan from SunTrust bank.","Amit Hazan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","So maybe the first question on the service business, given it was a bigger-percentage quarter and continues to grow nicely. I'm just wondering if you can lay out for us, again, as we kind of start out this new calendar year, how much visibility you have that service business can continue to grow double digit. If you can walk through some of the underlying factors you're seeing now having grown double-digits for quite some time. And then also if you can just kind of walk through what that means for service gross margin dynamic, if 50% plus gross margin is sustainable for service, if you can improve further.","Dow R. Wilson","Yes, I think the margin rate one is an easy one. We do believe that, that will continue. There's no reason to see that decrease at all. I mean, the #1 analytic that we look at inside is installed base out of warranty and our installed base out of warranty and service continues to grow. I think, as we said on the call somewhere -- middle of last year, we basically have a TrueBeam coming out of warranty. One per order day this year, and that's driving our growth. We do have -- we are seeing more TrueBeams come out of warranty, in particular, outside of the U.S. So a lot of that early TrueBeam volume went into the U.S., and now, we're kind of moving into the bubble outside of the U.S., from an installed base out of warranty perspective. We're also seeing a richer contract mix that comes with that. The TrueBeam pricing is better. And we also -- the service team, I think, has done a very good job of going after software service agreements, as well as a driving capture rates, contract capture rates in the business. So we see this kind of double-digit scenario in the service business continuing.","Amit Hazan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","All right. And the second question for me is on China. The tone has changed a lot since just last quarter, and it's within the same calendar year, really. So I just wonder if you can give us a little bit more color on what you think is going on in that country, and now in terms of orders. We saw GE come through with some weak numbers as well. And so, are you seeing something changing there in terms of how they're looking at purchase of capital equipment and why you think it's now towards the back half, back end of the year or what else...","Dow R. Wilson","Well, we have seen a slowing of purchasing activity in China. We think it's temporary. Our share was up in the quarter, as I mentioned, and we're pleased to see that. Our funnel is very strong in China, so we think it's just a timing issue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeremy Feffer from Cantor Fitzgerald.","Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","I wanted to, first, just -- I want to double check that the $19 million of U.S. orders to a couple of hospitals, were those new customers for you or were those replacements of existing systems?","Dow R. Wilson","Let's see. I think it's a little bit of both. Both of these are consolidated customers and -- so there has been some acquisitions. I know the parent organizations were both Varian customers. But in their consolidation, there's some competitive equipment that they had consolidated and that we will be replacing. And that's the $19 million is the amount that we actually booked in the quarter. The deals were -- together, they were $50 million. And as we get a little more visibility on the sites and the dates, we'll be looking the other $31 million of those orders.","Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then I wanted to come back to Japan. You mentioned that you're seeing -- I mean, beyond the obvious currency issues, you've been -- you mentioned some -- a bit of a tougher competitive landscape. Can you provide a little more color there and how you see that market developing over time?","Dow R. Wilson","I think it's -- the way we kind of view it here is we had a tough comp. We got a lot of accelerated purchases in the Q1 of last year with a little budget acceleration that they were doing in Japan. We also had some yen impact year-over-year, and so the market is soft. We still think the long-term growth in the market remains very, very good. Less than 30% of patients in Japan get radiation as part of their cancer therapy that in Western Europe, in the U.S, that number is over 50%, 50% to 60%. So we think that Japan remains a good long-term growth market. We do have a lot of opportunities in the MELCO installed base, which is gradually replacing. For those who don't know the history there, we bought that installed base a dozen of years ago or so and those products are kind of coming to the end of their life, and we're seeing a nice replacement opportunity there. Over the last year, our share has been stable in Japan. We have very high share there and we think that, that will continue in the long term.","Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. Last one, quickly. Any updates on proton reimbursement now that you have ProBeam approval? Any -- are you getting any thawing in the reimbursement -- on the reimbursement side?","Dow R. Wilson","The hospital reimbursement rate went up. As part of the reimbursement package that was approved in December, hospital proton reimbursement went up. Freestanding reimbursement in protons is negotiated with each carrier. They typically kind of follow the federal hospital guideline in protons. So we think this is encouraging news, but it's not. It still has to be negotiated center by center -- carrier by carrier.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Wittes from Brean Capital.","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Just 2 quick ones here. One, the U.S. order rate. It sounds, based from what you said, that hospitals' purchasing dynamics haven't really changed for the last few quarters, but the real driver this quarter was a big lump order? Is that the right way to think about it? And...","Dow R. Wilson","Well, in fact, no. I mean, it was only $19 million of a huge number. So yes, we got a nice $50 million order, but we only actually booked $19 million of it. So we did see broad-based strength in the U.S. market. There might have been a little bit of timing because people were waiting for some certainty with the reimbursement decision. Did we have a little bit of pent-up demand? You heard me say, our kind of forecast on the year is that this market is going to be a mid-single-digit market. That would be great news for us. That has not been a mid-single-market for a while. So we'd love to see that stability, and we're thrilled with the start that we have in Q1, and our funnel looks pretty good.","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on China, just to clarify on that as well. It sounds like you're optimistic that you got a recovery, but it does sound that'll be later in the year. So if I think about the growth rate that you guys are thinking about for orders, roughly, I think you're still saying it's going to be mid-single digit, which, again, is an improvement. It sounds like that'll be more U.S.-centric than I would have expected this year, though. If I think about the moving pieces, meaning the U.S. looks a little stronger than it was in China, looks like it's going to be back-end loaded, is that a fair way to look at it?","Dow R. Wilson","Kind of stepping back at the highest level, I think the Oncology business is in the mid-single digit range. The imaging components business is in the double-digit range, proton's kind of the wild card. We got a pretty good proton funnel. But our long-term growth in kind of the mid- to high-single digits is a pretty good forecast for what our markets are doing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Bhalla from Citigroup.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Dow, I'm just trying to foot the 2Q guidance with what you're saying about what's taking place in the regions. I guess, what's clear is that underlying your full year guidance is China being back-end loaded, but your second quarter guidance, can you walk through some of the moving parts? Clearly, it's coming in a little bit lighter than -- we're expecting both on top line and earnings.","Elisha W. Finney","Sure. So on it, for Q2, sales up 1% to 2%. And that's primarily driven by the proton therapy business will be down significantly versus the year ago quarter, where we started recognizing revenue under both the Saudi and the Russia projects, as well as a significant Scripps revenue. In the second quarter, Oncology, we're expecting, again, to be up in the low-single digits, X-ray up in the high-single digits, with half -- the second half's going to really be driven above that level by the proton business, where we're continuing to make progress, but it's just not done, at this point. On financing, it's going well, from what we hear, but we won't be able to book revenue until that is completed on the Maryland project.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And question -- I guess, question for you, Elisha, on the quality -- the product quality costs that are coming in better, you mentioned it both in the Oncology business, you mentioned it in the X-ray business. Can you put some quantification around that? And what exactly have you improved and why can't that just continue straight on out?","Elisha W. Finney","Well, we just get variations in any given quarter. It relates to scrap and warranty and rework and, of course, retrofit cost. And it was just kind of a perfect storm, if you will, on the positive side this quarter. We're hoping that holds, but again, it's just too early in the year to say that it's going to be that good for the remainder of the year. We always get quarterly fluctuations, but again, very pleased with the performance in the quarter.","Dow R. Wilson","It is a focus for us. Some of them come in lumps, which gives us some of the issues with the predictability issue. But as far as yield and scrap goes on the overall quality, it's a major initiative for us across the entire business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","A couple for you, Dow, on Oncology, one on X-ray, and just a numbers question for Elisha. You mentioned the E orders were pushed out in fiscal 1Q to 2Q. I'm just wondering if, maybe, you can quantify that, for one. And then, on the Toshiba contract, how does that stack up versus prior contracts? Is it a bigger contract? Is pricing favorable on that and how additive is that to the X-ray outlook?","Dow R. Wilson","First of all, coming to Europe, we did see strength in Southern Europe, which kind of surprised us, that was not something we were expecting. So France, Spain and Italy were strong. We were expecting weakness in Northern Europe. We had a very large order last year in the U.K., which I think we'll be explaining a little bit of that all year, in Northern Europe. Central Europe was relatively flat. We had good performance in India, and our Service business performed very well in Europe. So kind of -- Northern Europe and Central Europe was where we were down, and India and Southern Europe was where we were up. The Toshiba contract and the X-ray business, we're thrilled. Obviously, it's been a terrific partner and really driven the growth in our X-ray components business for the last several years. The contract value, the agreement value is about $515 million, which is up about 10% from the last time. So it's part of what gives us this confidence in calling a double-digit scenario in our components business.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And then, quickly for Elisha, you mentioned, also, in your prepared comments of $50 million decrease in proton therapy backlog, so maybe just a clarification on where that was, which order. And then, on the $51 million emerging market deal that Dow referenced in his comments, is that sort of similar pricing and margins relative to Brazil? Is that the way we should be thinking about that revenues?","Elisha W. Finney","Yes, on the proton therapy backlog, really, it's just -- it's a cumulative number, right, over the last 12-month period, but I'm looking at quarter-over-quarter. And it's just simply because we are getting very close on some proton orders, but we have not yet booked those orders because it hasn't met all of our order booking guidelines. And so, we've been recording significant revenue over the last 12 months, particularly as Scripps has progressed, and we have not booked an order over that period. So once an order is booked, that backlog should come back nicely for our proton therapy business. With respect to the Algeria deal that we mentioned, it is at a significantly higher margins and it is at significantly higher featured equipment, with the TrueBeam STx and a lot more software content, so much higher than the Brazil margin.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Elisha, just -- can you comment on the reclassification on products and services revenues at the bottom of the release? I'm just not entirely clear what drove that.","Elisha W. Finney","Sure. So we average -- if you look at any given quarter, we average about $25 million in parts sales. Historically, we had put that into our product category and not talked about it as part of our service business. We just simply did a reclass because it's more consistent with how we talk about our service business to The Street. Also how we monitor and look at performance in our product lines and businesses internally and, frankly, how incentive plans are structured. I just wanted to make sure that we had all of that perfectly aligned. So simply a reclass of that $25 million a quarter, roughly, of the parts businesses, which represents less than 10% of our total service business.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then, on the margins. I mean, if we look -- this quarter, 6% earnings growth off a 5% top line. I know you talked at the Analyst Day in December about 25 to 50 basis points of leverage per year. Why couldn't that be more? I mean, I understand supply chain is part of it. But there has to be other parts of the balance sheet where you can drive additional leverage. Can you maybe just talk to your level of commitment to driving leverage in the model?","Elisha W. Finney","Absolutely. For this fiscal year, and really what's driving and we're going to be down, call it, maybe 0.5 point, roughly, on operating margin, and that's driven by, really, the proton therapy business. We are expecting significant revenue out of protons this year. If you don't mind, I failed to answer Steve's second question, which was the margin on protons. If you take the total revenue for the year, it'll be at roughly a 15% margin. As we mentioned, it will be somewhere between $100 million and $150 million of proton revenue, depending on the timing of projects, I've just picked the midpoint at $125 million. So we do have, between that 6% and 8%, some significant variability, if you will, around the proton business. And then, secondly on leverage, we made a conscious decision to take the R&D up this year. It will go up about 1 full percentage point, and that's just so that we can continue to execute on a very robust product pipeline. So those 2 factors are what's driving it. If it weren't for the proton's significant increase in sales, I believe we wouldn't be getting leverage in the P&L.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then, last one. Dow, you called out software. Can you maybe just give us a sense as to how much share you think you've pulled on, on that side of the market? And are you lacking in hardware sales at this point with RapidPlan?","Dow R. Wilson","As I mentioned on the call, we did see a conversion of the hardware socket with RapidPlan, so we were glad to see that. We think that there will be more of that. We did see a lot of purer software conversions, of people converting either treatment planning or oncology information system installed base to either ARIA or Eclipse. And that's been a multi-year trend. We think we've been winning it more there than we've been losing. And I'd say that, especially with the strength of RapidPlan coming out of ASTRO, we've got a nice lead in treatment planning and -- with RapidPlan, I think, it's really hitting a chord with people, whether you're the best at treatment planning or new in the business, RapidPlan is going to help you. And I think customers are seeing that and it's really driving the conversation for both software and hardware.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then, one last quick one, if I can. On the commentary on China before, as we think about the back half of this calendar year. Are these going to be larger tenders or is it a lot of singles and doubles? I'm just trying to gauge the lumpiness of...","Dow R. Wilson","There's always going to be the PLA tender, but, otherwise, I don't think the structure of the -- I mean, it might be consolidating a little bit, but I don't think, at least at this point, anything -- I don't see any material change in kind of the structure of the China market. It happens, kind of a customer at a time and province at a time.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Roman from Goldman Sachs.","Aimie Faucett - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is, actually, Aimie, in for David Roman. I was just wondering, looking at your guidance for 2Q, and kind of going through the numbers, that's getting me to an average growth rate, in the back half, of about 9.5% to 13.5% for both revenue and earnings. So could you just walk me through what you're seeing that, that gets you there, that makes you confident that you can deliver that in the back half?","Elisha W. Finney","Yes, and again, this is -- it's going to be largely dependent on the timing of our proton therapy revenue, where we're going to see a huge increase in proton revenue once we get these -- once our customers gets the financing completed on the Maryland project. We're coming to the end on Scripps, in terms of revenue recognition, but Russia, Saudi and Maryland are all in the queue for the second half of this year to have significant revenues with them. So again, that's really what's driving the top line growth, above that midpoint that Dow talked about. If I just took our core businesses, again, Oncology is going to grow in the low single-digit range, call it the 3% to 4% range. Our X-ray Products top line should grow near the low-double-digit range with the balance coming from huge increases in protons.","Aimie Faucett - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then, maybe just as a follow-up. With so much of the revenue coming from proton in the back half, how are you thinking about gross margins, especially you were saying that you expect them to still kind of reach that 42% number. So what are you seeing in the back half that gets you there on margins?","Elisha W. Finney","Yes. So again, we're seeing that the Oncology and X-ray margins are going to hold well within the ranges that we've talked about. The proton gross margin is coming up from prior years. For the total proton business this year, we think we'll average around 15%. And what that equates to is, in the FY '13, total company gross margin was 42.5%. And again, should be just down slightly for the total business for this fiscal year. We have one more quarter of excise tax in Oncology, and then the proton revenue, at a much lower margin, driving that slight decline.","Aimie Faucett - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And if I could just squeeze in one more quick one. I was wondering if you have any guidance around the share count for the full year, for '14.","Elisha W. Finney","No. Other than -- if you look historically, we bought between 1 million and 2 million shares per quarter. We do have an existing authorization in place for calendar year '14 for 6 million shares. So we look at this opportunistically, based on U.S. cash, interest rates, share price, all of those things, but you should assume that we will continue to purchase through the balance of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Toby Wann from Obsidian Research Group.","Toby Wann - Obsidian Research Group, LLC","Elisha, quick question on the R&D, the percent of revenue. I mean, is it fair to assume that it's going to be above 8%, kind in that 8% range on a go-forward basis, given the product pipeline that's coming up?","Elisha W. Finney","Well, again, we're seeing significant increases in the oncology R&D, but because of that proton revenue increase that I've been talking about, it should be about 7% of revenues, both this year and last year. If you were to strip out the increase in proton revenue, yes, it would go up by about a point.","Toby Wann - Obsidian Research Group, LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then, cash balance in the U.S. was -- of the $971 million, about how much of that is outside the U.S.?","Elisha W. Finney","Most of it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charley Jones from Barrington.","Charley R. Jones - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","So I just want to start, I guess, with market growth. I was wondering if our growth -- I see your U.S. growth is driven more by the market improving or are you making some competitive inroads?","Dow R. Wilson","I think our share is stable to up a hair. It's not up dramatically, by any stretch, but our share has been, at least, what it's been historically. So I think most of this is, at least, that we saw in Q1, is a pretty good market. We haven't seen Elekta's results yet, and won't see them for another month or so, but that's kind our gut. When you look at the last rolling 12 months, which is probably a better way to look at it, our share is stable to a hair up.","Charley R. Jones - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","I guess, the reason for the question is, I'm thinking, after the loss of Brazil, the change in reimbursement, maybe they'd get kind of aggressive. And so I'm just wondering if they've changed their behavior a little bit. I guess, as a follow-up to that, are you seeing TomoTherapy at all anymore? And can you comment on...","Dow R. Wilson","As I said, we did have some takeouts of TomoTherapy units in the quarter, they're still out there and they win a few. But I think RapidArc and biometric arc therapy from Elekta have also made it very tough for the competitive differentiation of TomoTherapy. There was another piece to your question...","Charley R. Jones - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","I guess, there's more on Elekta right after the year...","Dow R. Wilson","Yes. I was just going to say, on the overall pricing environment is good. We have -- we've seen stability in pricing.","Charley R. Jones - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","And if I could just squeeze one more in. I guess, in general, would you say, U.S. health care reform is kind of a non-issue, as far as uncertainty within the purchasers? And you've got better reimbursement for radiosurgery to boot, so...","Dow R. Wilson","I think the good news is, the short-term environment doesn't look too bad. And the reimbursement news, at least, stabilized. The investment environment for people over the next year, I think, there's some question about where it ends up in the 2016, 2017 time period, as legislation drives to more accountable care organizations and things like that. And I think there's -- I think our customers still have some uncertainty about that. I think what we are seeing is a reinforcement of what our customers are looking for, they're looking for real clinical value. If you've got product that has a demonstrated clinical value and can help drive efficiency, you win. So I think, both radiation and Varian have a very good story in the value that we drive in healing patients.","Operator","Thank you.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. ","And with all that said, I'll turn it over to Dow.","Dow Wilson","Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll share the key milestones we achieved this past quarter and year and how they contributed to our long-term strategy as well as provide our outlook for the upcoming fiscal year. First, let me touch on our fiscal fourth quarter performance, which was the result of strong execution, both from a growth and operational perspective. Total revenues of $802 million increased 11%. Oncology revenue grew 13%, driven by our integrated platform, with best-in-class hardware, software and services. Revenues for our proton solutions business were $46 million. On a full year basis, total revenues were $2.9 billion, a growth of 11%. Operating earnings of $142 million or 17.8% of revenues grew 14%. For the full year, operating earnings of $517 million or 17.7% of revenues grew 31%. ","GAAP EPS of $1.26 grew 49%, and non-GAAP EPS of $1.16 grew 11%. For the full year, GAAP EPS of $1.62 declined 33% due to the onetime impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and non-GAAP EPS of $4.42 grew 36%. Cash flows from operations were $108 million, down 17%. For the full year, cash flows from operations were $455 million, up 14%. The U.S. China tariffs impacted our Q4 result, which Gary will discuss in more detail in his section. ","The situation continues to be dynamic, but Varian remains committed to ensuring that our customers and the patients they treat are able to achieve new victories against cancer, without any disruption in access to our leading-edge technologies. Our long-term growth strategy is working. We believe it is the right focus and that we have the capabilities to grow our leadership position. We continue to leverage our scale and financial strength to selectively broaden our portfolio as we transform our company into a global leader in multidisciplinary integrated cancer care solutions. ","In pursuit of this strategy, we recently announced changes in our leadership team. In May, we established the Oncology Software Solutions Group under Corey Zankowski, who is bringing together and aligning our global software team and strategy. In October, we were pleased to announce that Kolleen Kennedy will serve as Chief Growth Officer as well as lead the FlashForward initiative and our proton solutions business. Chris Toth is succeeding Kolleen as the new President of Varian's Oncology Systems business. Kolleen, Chris and Corey have made tremendous contributions to Varian over the last 2 decades, and we are confident that this team will provide the right leadership to deliver on our growth strategy. ","So now let me spend some time on the solid progress we have made across our three growth initiatives. First, strengthening our leadership in radiation therapy. Based on public filings, the radiation therapy market grew 8% on an orders basis over the trailing 12 months, ending in June 2018. We maintained our market leadership and worldwide share during that period. In our Oncology business, orders grew 13% in the quarter to a record $1.1 billion, the first time we have broken $1 billion in orders for a quarter. For the full year, we grew orders 9% to a record $3.1 billion. Similarly, this was the first time we exceeded $3 billion in annual orders. Adding to these impressive milestones, growth in both the fourth quarter and full year were driven by growth in every region. This success has been driven by investments in field infrastructure and industry-leading innovation. This past year, big competitive wins included MacCallum, Karolinska and now Genesis Care. ","Our worldwide net linac installed base is now 8,057 units, growing 224 units in the fiscal year. Each net new socket represents meaningful future revenue from software, services, upgrades and most importantly, more patient lives touched. ","On the hardware side, we made progress with our global rollout of Halcyon and have taken -- and have now taken 182 orders since our May 2017 launch, including 84 in the fourth quarter. Nearly 40% of these orders were for greenfield sites, demonstrating Halcyon's ability to expand the market. ","The uptick was driven by several factors. First, ongoing marketing efforts and customer endorsements have been a strong driver for new orders as early adopters have had an excellent experience treating all disease sites. Second, this was the first full quarter in which we had 510(k) clearance for Halcyon with kilovoltage cone-beam CT imaging and the second full quarter with clearance for this offering in EMEA. Kilovoltage imaging provides a more advanced solution for the mature market segment and nearly 40% of the orders in the fourth quarter were for the kV Halcyon option. Finally, the public tender process takes some time and we're starting to see tender wins with Halcyon. ","Since launch, over half of our orders worldwide have been incremental, thus growing our installed base. In August, we extended our Oncology portfolio with the acquisition of humediQ, the manufacturer of IDENTIFY, a surface-guided radiation therapy positioning and motion management system. IDENTIFY has unique patient safety tools, such as a biometric scanner, to confirm the right patient will get the right treatment every time. By 2023, we see this market as a $120 million opportunity. ","We had several exciting introductions at ASTRO this week. First, we shared details of our development work for a multimodality adaptive radiotherapy suite that's driven by artificial intelligence. This platform brings MR, PET and CT imaging together at the console to enhance clinical decision-making without compromise to high-fidelity radiation therapy delivery. ","Second, we launched Bravos brachytherapy afterloader system, which is an integrated system designed to improve the patient and clinical experience by simplifying brachytherapy treatment and providing greater workflow efficiency. Bravos is a big step-forward for brachytherapy treatment, and we are excited to advance clinical efficiencies in this space. On the software front, we continue to see strong demand and positive feedback for our software solutions. Software revenues grew 7%, and the number of unique Varian software customers grew 5% to approximately 5,000. Customers continue to adopt Varian software because of the value they derive from our full -- our fully integrated innovative cancer care solutions. ","RapidPlan, our knowledge-based planning software, had a second consecutive record quarter since launch, and we took over 250 orders. The unique patented machine learning capabilities of RapidPlan have increased quality and decreased the symmetry time for hundreds of thousands of patients. RapidPlan has now penetrated a little more than 15% of our Eclipse installed base. We still have plenty of runway for increased adoption by our Eclipse users. HyperArc, our high-definition radiotherapy solution for stereotactic radiosurgery, also had a record quarter, with 65 orders. Since launch in Q4 last year, we have taken a total of approximately 170 orders. ","Finally, Eclipse MCO, providing multi-criteria optimization for enhanced control over treatment planning, had an exceptional quarter across all geographies, with over 250 orders in the quarter. This represents a total of nearly 600 orders since launch in Q4 last year. The customer uptake and demand for our best-in-class software products results from our focus on evolving market needs and an emphasis on efficient clinical workflow, systems integration and treatment planning quality. ","Services grew 11% for the quarter and 10% for the full year, driven by our growing installed base and higher mix of newer, more advanced machines, which typically have a higher attach rate and contract value. The strength of our service offerings was also validated in IMV's ServiceTrak Imaging 2018 report, in which we ranked first in the industry in Net Promoter Score. This score represents the likelihood a customer would recommend a manufacturer to a colleague, and we're honored to lead this metric with a score of 71% as compared with an industry average of 53%. ","In our proton solutions business, we did not take any new orders in the quarter. For the full year, we took 2 proton orders, both in the first quarter. In the fourth quarter, we completed clinical handovers for 1 room each at 3 sites, representing an important future recurring revenue stream for our proton business. These clinical handovers took place at Georgia Proton Treatment Center, Danish Centre for Particle Therapy and The Christie Proton Beam Therapy Centre. ","In September, we announced the installation of the cyclotron for the single-room proton therapy system at Delray Medical Center in Florida. Varian is partnering with Proton International for the installation, and the first patient treatments are expected to start in the fall of 2019. ","At ASTRO this week, we also announced exciting new developments. First, we announced the formation of the FlashForward Consortium to study potentially groundbreaking ultra-high dose rate cancer treatments with protons, which is more commonly known as Flash. This research effort will build upon encouraging pre-clinical and translational studies that suggest Flash protects healthy tissue while maintaining excellent tumor control, thereby enhancing therapeutic ratio. We look forward to working closely with the initial 13 innovative members of this consortium to take an important step-forward in cancer research. ","Second, we introduced ProBeam 360, our new single-room proton therapy system, with a 30% smaller footprint and a 25% lower volt construction cost as compared with the previous system. This increases access to this technology and provides clinicians with a viable path to potential next-generation treatment, such as Flash therapy. With the launch of ProBeam 360 and under Kolleen's leadership, we expect renewed growth in the proton business over the long term. ","So a lot of exciting developments that are strengthening our leadership in radiation therapy. Our second growth initiative is to extend our global footprint. For context, our sales mix for the full year was approximately 50% in the Americas, 30% in EMEA and 20% in APAC. Our growth was driven by strong performance across all geographies. The largest growth was driven by our Asia Pacific region, which saw a number of key wins in the quarter. ","We signed a memorandum of understanding with Genesis Care to form a strategic partnership for cancer care research and increase the access to advanced care -- cancer care in Australia and Europe. This resulted in orders for 10 linacs in Australia in the fourth quarter. We also continue to execute well in China and Japan, with double-digit growth and market leadership. ","In EMEA, we saw our fifth straight quarter of double-digit orders growth, driven by tender wins in Spain and Scandinavia, strong software growth and an outstanding Halcyon -- and outstanding Halcyon orders of over 40 units. We also saw robust performance from upgrades of over $85 million, an increase of 30% for the quarter and 44% for the full year. Upgrades include linear accelerator enhancements like HyperArc and our 6-degree-of-freedom couch and were driven by EMEA by the hiring of a dedicated upgrade team to focus where the needs are greatest.","We continue to extend our global footprint by winning large tenders, providing integrated best-in-class products and solutions for both mature and emerging markets and by winning competitive takeouts. On the Halcyon front, global momentum continues to grow. Of the Halcyon orders taken since our mid-2017 launch, over 40% have been from emerging markets and over 80% of those have been for incremental units. One of our key ambitions for Halcyon is to expand access to high-quality radiation therapy to underserved regions around the world. We have continued to see progress in Africa, where Varian recently signed a partnership agreement with Mediheal Group of Hospitals, to expand access to radiotherapy in Kenya. This relationship included the supply of 1 TrueBeam and 4 Halcyon systems to five new radiation therapy centers across the country as well as service, training and research collaboration opportunities. ","We also recently announced the first patient treatment in India on a Halcyon system at Sterling Cancer Hospital in Gujarat. Within 1 month, the hospital began comfortably treating 131 patients per day with the Halcyon system. ","We feel very good about the progress we're making globally, but there still is tremendous runway. Finally, our third growth initiative is to expand into other addressable markets. We continue to believe that our comprehensive 360 Oncology software platform will be a driver of future growth for the company as we enter cancer care coordination, a market of large unmet need. We recently strengthened the capabilities of 360 Oncology with the acquisition of Noona Healthcare, a developer of cloud-based mobile patient engagement software designed to capture cancer patient reported outcomes or PROs. Patient reported outcomes are growing in importance for evidence-based clinical trials and translational research. With this acquisition, Varian gains new partnerships with life science companies as the Noona software application is used to engage patients, collect PRO data, manage patient communications and enable clinical studies that will test the efficacy of treatment modalities. ","Overall, we're pleased with the progress we made in the fourth quarter and full year and the meaningful strides taken towards achieving our long-term strategy to become a global leader in multidisciplinary integrated cancer care solutions.","With that, I'll turn it over to Gary, who will provide more context on the fourth quarter and full year financial results.","Gary Bischoping","Thanks, Dow, and hello, everyone. As always, I will consistently frame my comments in the context of our long-term growth and value-creation strategy, which includes balancing growth, profitability and liquidity. So let me start with growth. Company-wide revenues were $802 million in the fourth quarter, up 11% or 12% in constant currency. Oncology revenues in the quarter were impacted by approximately $4 million of contra-revenue from the China retaliatory tariffs enacted August 23, which are not accounted for in our previous guidance. ","For the full year, revenues of $2.9 billion were up 11% or 10% in constant currency. We ended the year with $3.2 billion in backlog, up 3%. In Oncology, revenues were $756 million, up 13% or 14% in constant currency, driven by growth across hardware, software and services. For the full year, revenues grew 14% or 12% in constant currency. Orders were $1.1 billion, up 13% or 14% in constant currency. For the full year, orders grew 9% or 8% in constant currency. We ended the quarter with $3 billion in backlog, up 7%. ","Taking a closer look at our Oncology business results. In the Americas, revenues grew 6% in the quarter and 8% for the full year. Orders of $506 million grew 6%, driven by 4% growth in North America and strong double-digit growth in Latin America. For the full year, orders in the Americas grew 5% and orders in North America grew 3%. Growth in North America was driven by numerous large multisite orders and healthy demand for our SRS and SBRT solutions. ","In Europe, Middle East, India and Africa geography, revenues grew 27% in the quarter and 28% for the full year. Orders were $361 million, increasing 14%. For the full year, orders grew 17%. We have seen outstanding results across the region, with 5 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth, driven by tender wins and strong performance across the geography. Asia Pacific revenues grew 9% in the quarter and 10% for the full year. Orders were $200 million for the first time, increasing 31% due to remarkable execution by the commercial teams in China and Japan, key account wins in Australia and growth from this year's acquisition of our distributor in Taiwan. ","For the full year, orders for the Asia Pacific region grew 9%. We saw mid-teens growth in Greater China in the quarter, with low double-digit growth for the year, and we continue to lead the market there. In Japan, orders grew over 50%, contributing to full year growth of nearly 20%. ","Our proton solutions business posted revenues of $46 million in the quarter, which is down 12% compared with last year. For the full year, revenues were $149 million, down 18%. ","Turning to profitability, total company fourth quarter gross margin increased 11%, driven by our Oncology business, where we continue to see solid revenue growth across the portfolio. The gross margin rate was 42.5% of revenues, relatively flat year-over-year. This included the impact of tariffs to our Oncology business, which resulted in approximately 30 basis points of negative impact at the total company level. For the full year, gross margin rate increased 114 basis points to 43.9%. ","Oncology fourth quarter gross margin increased 9%, largely driven by revenue growth, and the rate was 43.9%, down 141 basis points. Approximately 30 basis points of this decline was driven by tariffs impact referenced above and the rest of -- the rest from geographic mix that was more heavily weighted outside North America as compared with last year. Full year Oncology gross margin increased by 22 basis points to 45.5%. ","Looking at proton solutions, fourth quarter gross margin dollars were $9 million, up $5 million. Full year gross margin dollars were up 27%, driven by progress on high-margin projects -- on higher-margin projects. ","Now let me turn to our key investment areas. We remain committed to investing in our business to drive value over the long term. In the quarter, R&D investments of $60 million was up 15% at 7.4% of revenues. R&D expenses for the full year were $234 million, up 11% and representing 8% of revenues. R&D spend this year was driven by investments in software, adaptive radiotherapy and other strategic innovation programs. ","In the quarter, SG&A expenses were $138 million or 17.3% of revenues, down 71 basis points as a percent of revenues, driven by productivity improvements in the G&A functions. For the full year, SG&A expenses were $529 million or 18.1% of revenues, down 149 basis points as a percent of revenues. The decrease was primarily driven by the non-recurrence of a $38 million accounts receivable reserve related to the proton business last year. Excluding this item, SG&A spend was flat for the full year, driven by continued investment in sales and marketing, that were offset by G&A efficiencies. ","Company operating earnings were $143 million or 17.8% of revenues, increasing 14%. For the full year, operating earnings of $517 million or 17.7% of revenues increased 31%. ","For the full year, and for each quarter of fiscal year 2018, we have driven leverage in the P&L by growing operating earnings faster than revenue. In the fourth quarter, we recognized $6 million in incremental interest income from the realization of accrued interest on the Maryland Proton Treatment Center loan paid upon refinancing of the center in August. ","Turning to taxes. For the full year, our GAAP effective tax rate was 66.8% due to the onetime impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The IRS has not issued final tax regulations associated with the recent U.S. tax legislation. The impacts of the act reflected in our results, and our projection of future tax rates represent our best estimates of the impact of the act and could change as tax regulations are finalized and the laws further interpreted and applied to our facts. ","For the full year, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22.4%. This was higher than the 21% we expected primarily because of a shift in the geographic mix of earnings. GAAP EPS was $1.26 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.16, with related diluted share count of 92.2 million shares in the quarter. For the full year, GAAP EPS was $1.62 and non-GAAP EPS was $4.42, up 36%. ","An external factor that impacted our EPS was a $0.03 negative impact due to the August 23 enactment of China retaliatory tariffs, which were introduced after we set guidance. ","Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity. We ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $505 million and 0 debt. While cash flow from operations were $108 million, down 17%, the full year cash flow from operations were $455 million, up 14%. This fell short of expectations, driven by faster growth in Europe, resulting in higher receivables balance. ","Even with the increase in AR, Oncology DSO decreased by 9 days from 111 to 102 days, further demonstrating improved operational discipline and working capital management. In addition to R&D, other investments in the quarter included $17 million in CapEx. ","We are active in buying back shares this quarter, spending $50 million on share repurchases. As of the end of the year, we have 3.6 million shares remaining under our existing repurchase authorization. ","I will now turn it back to Dow, who will discuss our fiscal year 2019 annual guidance.","Dow Wilson","Thanks, Gary. With respect to our annual guidance, we continue to maintain a pragmatic approach and have considered the following assumptions regarding our fiscal year 2019 guidance. First, continued projected market growth. Second, our products and solutions are resonating, driving our market leadership. And third, we reflected the projected impact of the tariffs imposed on July 6 by the United States Trade Representative as well as the impact of the China retaliatory tariffs imposed on August 23. Included in this guidance is the net impact from tariffs of $18 million to operating earnings, down from a gross impact of $60 million. We are implementing specific actions within our supply chain and commercial operations while driving productivity in G&A and rephasing some R&D investments. In aggregate, these actions will address 70% of the impact from tariffs. ","After careful consideration of these assumptions, we expect the following for fiscal year 2019: revenue of $3.06 billion to $3.15 billion, representing growth of 5% to 8%; non-GAAP operating earnings as a percentage of revenues of 17% to 18%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.60 to $4.75; cash flows from operations of $460 million to $510 million. The guidance assumes the non-GAAP effective tax rate of 21% to 22% and a weighted average diluted share count of $92 million. The guidance also assumes foreign exchange rates as of the beginning of fiscal year 2019 excludes any future M&A activity and includes the expected impact of all currently enacted tariffs. ","As it will take several months to phase in our various mitigation efforts around tariffs, we expect our earnings performance to be more heavily weighted towards the back half of the year. ","Thank you. And now let's go to Q&A, operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Amit Hazan from Citigroup.","Amit Hazan","I thought maybe I would start with Halcyon just because it was obviously such a big change just from 90 days ago and from what we've seen really since the launch. I think I get what you're saying by some of the drivers, but I'm just hoping you could give us a little bit more color on the -- just given the magnitude of the change this quarter versus prior quarter's on what really was behind driving this? I mean, is this kind what we kind of -- is this really kV that's been driving this? Or what else did you see in the quarter that really helped you with Halcyon getting to these much larger numbers?","Dow Wilson","Thanks. A couple of things. First of all, we love the volume. I think that's something that we've been seeing in our funnel all along, ever since we introduced it, that the kilovoltage clearance, the 510(k), clearly had an impact in the U.S. market as well as the kilovoltage introduction at ASTRO earlier this year to go out and get that funnel going. Well, you heard the numbers. We had very good uptake in Europe on that product. As well for the kilovoltage product, along with some of the adaptive radiation therapy vision that we're talking about on the product, is really triggering the developed market. But I'd say, the other thing that we really like about this is one thing that's been consistent from the launch is 40% of these are incremental new sockets. So we really -- we really like that fact. We are very strong in emerging markets, 60% mature, 40% emerging markets on the year. So that's good, 40% new sites. So it's growing our installed base. And I think that's a really -- kind of to underscore that, 40% of the Halcyon orders we took in 2018 were for greenfield sites. These are folks new in the business. We're very excited about that. We also saw a fair amount of competitive takeouts, and I mean, we've been talking a little bit. We've had the question on the tender market. We've been a little bit hesitant on that, that we wanted to be from Missouri, and when we saw it, you got it. And I think that has been building some demand, and we also saw some very good tender wins on the product.","Amit Hazan","Okay. And then just a follow-up on the tariffs. You're both China and the U.S. I just wanted to get a sense from you if whether it's during the quarter or what you expect for the next fiscal year. On the top line, did you see any impact from the tariffs on the top line in terms of customer reactions, if any? And do you expect any for fiscal '19?","Dow Wilson","The short version is, you saw our fourth quarter, I alluded to our fourth quarter performance in China. We had a double-digit quarter in China. So certainly, on the quarter, didn't see any impact. In fact, it was good enough that we had some delay in maybe Q2, Q3. We've made very strong statements to that market about our strategy there. We want to continue to be the market leader. We believe our share is growing in that market and have a clear, demonstrated market leadership, great relationships, great technology. And so we're very pleased by what we saw in Q4 in China, and from at least a market point of view, we're clearly watching it. But at this point in time, we are okay. Maybe Gary can talk a little bit about the revenue side of it as it translates from a tariff point of view.","Gary Bischoping","Yes, Amit, just to kind of tease this out a little bit more and to be transparent about it. So of the $60 million of gross impact, $48 million of that is related to the retaliatory tariff from China. And so that's our products going from the U.S. and into China, and that will be treated as contra revenue. $12 million of the $60 million gross impact will be treated as cost, and that's related to our products that are coming from China to the U.S. And so that's kind of the accounting and the mechanics as to what the gross impact is for FY '19. And again, now through the operating actions we talked about, right, in terms of supply chain, commercial operations, G&A, productivity and our R&D rephasing, we can net that back down to an $18 million impact in FY '19.","Amit Hazan","And one final quick one for you Gary. Can you give us your guidance, your revenue guidance, for the year ex FX?","Gary Bischoping","Revenue guidance is 5% to 8%., and that's inclusive of all the tariffs that are enacted today -- sorry, sorry. I misheard you. So on the FX side, it's the FX rates at the start of our fiscal year.","Amit Hazan","And what would the growth be ex -- in constant currency for fiscal '19? If it's 5% to 8% reported, what would it be constant currency?","Gary Bischoping","There are some impact to it. I mean, we don't know based on current rates. It's not all that terribly material, we think, for '19. But again, it's already impacted or already accounted for in our 5% to 8% growth we talked about.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone from Jefferies.","Anthony Petrone","Maybe to start again on Halcyon, just the order flow this quarter. I was just kind of wondering, when you look at prior product cycles, TrueBeam for instance, I think that product cycle, maybe back 7 years or so, peaked at maybe 350, 375 orders for the year. I mean, based on this run rate, we would sort of be getting close to 300, north of 300 for the year. So how long of a runway do you think Halcyon is from a product cycle? And where do you think it could peak on in terms of adding more orders? And then I have a follow-up on guidance.","Dow Wilson","There is a couple differences here. When we introduced TrueBeam, we were eventually replacing our whole product line. That is not the case here. Halcyon is very complementary-focused to our product line. We want to keep both growing. We love the quarter. As I said, we had huge uptake in incremental sockets going in the installed base. That's really been the focus. So having both of these products in our product basket is just a market-leading position. It can't be beat. In terms of kind of where does it go, we're very interested to watch what happens in developed markets. The product has had a very good reception in developed markets. And the kilovoltage introduction is new here at ASTRO. Sorry, if my voice was a little gravelly. I have been talking a lot in the last 5 days. But the adaptive strategy with Halcyon is going to give us some more legs in the developed market. And then in emerging markets, I mean, even with this big uptick that we saw in Q4, we still had 40% of the actual percentage that was growing in emerging markets, is exactly what we've seen over the rest of the year. So I think -- and a very good position. I just -- kind of stepping back a little bit from -- today, is the last day of the ASTRO exhibit here. We've got the strongest debt portfolio we've ever had. When you kind of look across hardware, software, proton therapy, vision for the future, capture the imagination of our customers, I don't -- I couldn't be prouder of the team and what the -- what we've done at this year's ASTRO.","Anthony Petrone","That's helpful. And then the follow-up on guidance would be, I guess, by my math, that's about a $0.16 impact to earnings from tariffs, but I know there's a variable there in share count. So I'm just wondering if that's accurate. And in my understanding, was that there was various exemptions, pathways offered to companies, both in the U.S. and in China actually, and so, is there a potential for some of those exemptions to go through and the EPS headwind to reverse?","Dow Wilson","Why don't you talk about guidance, and I'll talk a little bit about getting the exemption?","Gary Bischoping","Yes, sure. And Anthony, you're pretty much spot on. $0.15, $0.16 is spot on to the impact. So good math there.","Dow Wilson","Yes. And then in terms of what's the likelihood of getting an exemption, we continue to have encouraging and productive conversations with key government leaders to ensure that we can bring our cancer solutions to patients around the world and especially in China. We're actively -- we filed an exemption to exclude this from the current trade dispute. We won't know until that's -- it's kind of a binary thing, yes, or no. In the meantime, we're monitoring the situation very, very closely.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.","Eleni Apostolatos","This is Eleni on for Tycho. We were wondering, can you guys remind us what adjacencies you're leaning towards in terms of your M&A strategy, heading into your next fiscal year? Is it still a string of pearls approach?","Dow Wilson","Sure. I think you saw what we did in 2018. In 2018, we had acquisitions that were both complementary to our core business and some acquisitions, though smaller, that took us out of the core business. We did have a run at Sirtex, as you know, a little bigger. We're willing to do bigger acquisitions, provided we see good return on invested capital, return on the investment we make in the acquisition and synergies with our portfolio. I would say the key areas that we'll look at are complementing our software business. You saw one of those from us 10 days ago. We acquired Noona Health. Noona Health, I mentioned briefly in the call, is a patient reported outcomes software, a cloud-based tool that looks very, very exciting. We're very pleased that it also gives us a little bit of a play in the pharma space. So we're taking patient reported outcomes in cancer across the cancer enterprise, so to speak, to evaluate how clinical trials are performing and what the patient perceives is outcome. And we're very excited about that opportunity. As we look at our treatment planning business, we see that there's an opportunity to extend treatment planning into other forms of doing radiation. And that's a nice play for us. Whether it be radioembolization, we started some of those opportunities organically. There may be some inorganic ones. We continue to look at interventional oncology as a potential play. And there might be some really good synergies in other places where radiation is used as a tool for cancer care.","Eleni Apostolatos","Great. And a question on the tariff front. We were wondering what are some of the steps you have taken to offset the tariff impact on your margins.","Dow Wilson","Yes, Gary, you want to take a crack at that one?","Gary Bischoping","Yes, like we outlined here, kind of looking at this holistically and what are the opportunities there, and then we see opportunities in the supply chain. We're taking actions around our commercial operations today, making sure that our G&A productivity holds up in this environment and looking at evaluating the R&D portfolio and rephasing some of that. That R&D portfolio we'll be rephasing will not impact kind of long-term things that we announced today at ASTRO and other things that are strategic innovation programs in the portfolio. But those are the major actions.","Dow Wilson","I think the only thing I'd add to that is, we said it in the call, but it's going to take us a couple quarters to get some of this going, and so the impact will be a little bit second half-weighted.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar","This is Vijay. So maybe just one, starting on with -- and I apologize if this has been asked, but I wanted to get back on the Halcyon orders. And then maybe, can you comment on -- like what drove this trend type? Was this -- is this now an inflection point, where I guess we're trying to understand what was one-off, what's the bulk order, or how sustainable is this?","Dow Wilson","The short version is it's 1,000 points of light here. It's -- we had a very good marketing effort over the last year since the launch. Customer endorsements have been very strong. I have -- I didn't say it in the call, but our uptime on the product has been 99%. And forget uptime for a second, what that really speaks to is the robustness of this product from its first day. And you look at other products the competitors are bringing to market, they fumble and stumble for 4 or 5 years, and finally, they get the workflow right and introduce -- and the product kind of finally works. This has been an outstanding product from the beginning. Yes, there might be a little seasonality because Q4 is our biggest quarter of the fiscal year. So I'd expect some seasonality from that point of view. We did -- it was the first full quarter where we had the 510(k) clearance, a second full quarter with the clearance for the kilovoltage imaging in EMEA. I think -- here -- we're here at ASTRO. We launched our adaptive strategy that will be linked to the Halcyon product. I think there's -- yes, there's going to be some seasonality, and there's going to be lumpy quarters and down quarters and up quarters. But I think there's very good momentum on this product.","Vijay Kumar","That's helpful, Dow. And just maybe on the guidance here. I know, in the past, you've spoken about being in talks with the administration on maybe getting an exemption on the tariff impacts. So can you give us an update on where you are relative to the, vis-\u00e0-vis, talks with the administration? And when I look at the revenues, 5% to 8%, we just had a phenomenal year, right? For you guys, from an organic revenue standpoint, why would those trends moderate, if you will? And I understand the issue of tougher comps, but then it looks like the underlying business, just given the Halcyon are sort of picking up steam, so maybe can you make comment on the revenue side as well?","Dow Wilson","For the tariff thing first. As I said, we have filed an exemption. It's totally a binary process. We're having productive conversations with everybody involved. But it is a binary process. It's kind of yes, no, and so we don't really have news until we get a decision. And there's kind of no guarantee on the timing. So we're pressing it very, very hard. We think this is related -- we're a big export -- a big net exporter in the U.S. It's 50,000-plus jobs in the U.S. that are involved. We treat almost all of the veterans administration cancer patients who need radiation and is very tied to our innovation stories. So that's the -- those are the arguments that we're making with the administration. And as soon as we hear, we'll let you know. On the revenue side, I mean, Gary, why don't you comment, and I'll make a little comment on the market after.","Gary Bischoping","Yes, Vijay, so kind of the equation that goes into that 5% to 8% is we saw OS orders of 9% on the year. Our backlog has grown 7% in OS on the year. You think about it, as I outlined in detail, there's $48 million of contra revenue running in from the tariffs in that 5% to 8%. And so when you all -- you kind of put that all together, that tells you that, that 5% to 8% seems like it's about right when you tie up that equation.","Vijay Kumar","Maybe if I could squeeze one more in guys. Can you comment on the first half versus second half in the EPS cadence? And Gary, in the free cash flow, I know that the guidance at the midpoint for free cash, that implies a mid-single-digit step-up over fiscal '18. But then it looks like fiscal '18 came in below initial expectations, right? So if this is a timing issue, maybe can you just talk about one of those free cash and maybe if there's a catch-up coming down the road?","Dow Wilson","I've been here -- as you know, we've switched to annual guidance, so we are annual guidance only. As I said in the preamble, we are second half-weighted. A lot of the tariff mitigation strategies that we're putting in place, we're putting in place over the course of the first half. So they will impact our second half, so our earnings will be a little more second half-weighted, and Gary, you can take the rest of the question.","Gary Bischoping","I think that's right, Dow. And I missed the rest of the question, sorry.","Vijay Kumar","I'm sorry. On the free cash flow guidance...","Dow Wilson","Is that definitely what you needed, Vijay?","Vijay Kumar","The free cash guidance, sorry, you said, it looks like the fiscal '18 came in below...","Dow Wilson","So we're kind of a little short, Vijay, and that's really driven by the strong earnings growth in Europe. And if you look at Europe, kind of terms and conditions, and they're just a little bit longer than the rest of the world. So just mix, and that takes a little bit while to clear through. So we like the guidance of $460 million to $510 million, and we'll continue to evaluate that and drive operating actions to continue to move working capital in the right direction.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Henry from RBC Capital Markets.","Brandon Henry","Just one question on the market growth. Obviously, what you guys kind of elected, to talk about a pickup in market growth over the last couple of quarters, can you just talk about what you think is driving that pickup in your view? And then what's given you the confidence that this level of market growth can continue over the next 12 months? And I just have a few follow-ups.","Dow Wilson","I think there's a couple of things going on. We finished the year, the U.S. -- to look in the rearview mirror for a second, our U.S. numbers, we were up 6% in the U.S., 5% in constant currency. In EMEA, we were up 17%, 13% in constant currency. And then APAC, we were up 9% on the year, up 8% in constant currency. So when you kind of think about that in the context of the markets, I'd say the exceptional one here has been EMEA. And EMEA has been across the board. Some of it is emerging markets. So we've got Africa and India and Eastern Europe in those numbers, Russia in those numbers, Middle East. I think that's going to continue. We've had very good performance in Western Europe as well, Central and Western Europe. So that's been good. I'd say, we think that market's hanging in there. It's probably not a double-digit market, but it's hanging in there, and the rest continues to grow very, very well. The other growth numbers in Asia and Americas -- Americas is -- maybe a little better than we've done historically.","Asia, arguably, we've done better. So when I kind of look at the balance, I think the markets are going to be up a little bit from what we've kind of historically talked about. We've kind of historically talked about a 2 to 4 number, and it's probably more a mid-single-digit kind of market scenario, with some upside. And we'll say this, we feel very good about our portfolio, and one of the things that we're seeing is we think the portfolio might -- the upside in the market scenario might be upgrades and finally getting people to close out, to change out, 12- to 15-year-old products to upgrade. And we'll watch that and report on it as we execute the year.","Brandon Henry","All right. And then on Halcyon, do you think there's any pent-up demand for the Halcyon kV imaging in the developed markets? And how should we be thinking about the sustainability of that kind of gross order number over the next couple of quarters? And then maybe longer-term, how do we think about the portfolio in terms of Halcyon, how you position that, versus TrueBeam kind of longer-term?","Dow Wilson","Now the two products both have a great position in the marketplace. We are very excited about the adaptive strategy that we've launched on Halcyon. TrueBeam will remain our SBRT, SRS platform of choice, the most flexible, fastest gun in the West. When you -- we have now done 1.5 million SRS and SBRT treatments over time. We still have a huge Clinac installed base to upgrade. Customers are making those choices one by one. Halcyon does not have electrons. TrueBeam has much higher dose rate, has much more flexible mechanical positions with the C-arm geometry and has the ultimate versatility in the market for doing all applications. We're beginning our adaptive strategy on Halcyon about what will extend the adaptive strategy across our entire business. Our focus is on growing our installed base. That's why we started disclosing that to you about a year ago. You've seen the tremendous uptick, 220-ish unit installed base growth and net installed base growth that we've had this last year, and that's kind of the way we are managing the portfolio as we sell it into the market. I do think that kilovoltage introduction in the developed world is material and exciting, and that linked with the adaptive strategy on that product is going to give us some significant legs going forward.","Brandon Henry","All right. And then just one last question for me. Can you talk about the factor that get you to the upper and lower end of your fiscal year '19 operating margin guidance range? And then what are you assuming in guidance for operating margins and EPS for FX?","Gary Bischoping","Yes, so as it relates to the operating guidance of 17% to 18%, the way to think about that is there's about a 50 basis point impact in there from the tariffs that we had talked about. That $18 million net in operating earnings is that 50 basis points impact. I think there's other puts and takes to think your way through. I think the favorable things going on right now are certainly -- I see we're getting some operating leverage in G&A that we just talked about. We've got our software and services portfolio growing at great rates, and those, as you know, are accretive to the company average margin rate. And then I would say, it's offset and always balanced, like I said, balancing growth and profitability over time with the investments we're making in R&D. If you look at what we rolled out today and in the last couple of days here in San Antonio, that's a tremendous portfolio of R&D and that's yielding that kind of growth you're seeing in the top line. And so we want to make sure we continue to make those investments to continue that top line growth. So those are kind of the puts and takes as you think about operating earnings in that 17% to 18%. As it relates to currency, again, the currency rates as of the end of our fiscal -- the start of our fiscal year is what we have running in our guidance. And if you look at the kind of the -- what's implied -- what that implies is a small impact from currency on a year-over-year basis, but not all that material.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Bednar from Baird.","Jason Bednar","I just wanted to start on China first. Some of the macro data in recent public company commentary out of the -- out of just some recent reports suggest that there's some rumblings of maybe an economic slowdown. Obviously, you guys are still putting up some very good numbers. But just curious if you're seeing any of that on the ground or any change in willingness to spend from customers in that market?","Dow Wilson","Not at all. The China market remains very underserved from a radiation therapy point of view. Our funnel remains very, very good. We're working through this U.S., China trade disputes. It's very important to us that, that be resolved for lots of reasons. But from a market point of view, at least so far, we're seeing a robust market environment as the government continues to invest in cancer services. I'd say, from a relative share position, we have continued to grow our share in that market. Over many, many years, we've extended our share. Our -- we have a market-leading position. When you look at the China public tender wins, we have done very, very well and growing share in each of the last 2 quarters in that market as well. One of the things that we're seeing in that market is we're seeing demand beyond hardware. So we're very excited about that. We've got some localization strategies for our software, and we're seeing some uptick in the software business as well there, which is relatively new for us.","Jason Bednar","Okay. And then just curious, Dow, or Gary, just if you can provide any more detail on what the tariff mitigation efforts really consist of? I know you mentioned alternating maybe some sourcing or some things in the supply chain. But just trying to get a sense of the -- maybe the risk profile around what some of those risk mitigation efforts are and if you have pretty good line of sight to truly mitigating that 70% of that impact?","Gary Bischoping","Taken some swift actions there in the supply chain and in commercial operations. They are going to be second half-oriented in order for us to get those into place. Competitively, and given everything that's going on, we're not going to talk a lot more detail about what the actions are that we're taking right now. But we're very transparent, right, about the $48 million and the $12 million breakout and the impact at a gross level. And look, we're going to go execute, just like we executed in FY '18 in the right operational rigor, in order to deliver on our commitments. So that's what we know and as when -- and when we know more about the tariffs, we'll share more.","Jason Bednar","Okay. And then just one last quick one, if I can sneak it in, just on Augmenix. I believe you had a minority interest in that business before it was recently acquired. Is that something that's reflected in guidance, or is that just a one-off that you will exclude?","Dow Wilson","It's a one-off. We owned a very small percentage of that company, and it will be below the line.","Gary Bischoping","Not reflected in guidance.","Dow Wilson","Yes. And not reflected in guidance at all.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs.","Frits Jonker","This is Frits on for Isaac. Two questions for me. First one on gross margin. I know you've talked about some supply chain shuffling and that software is a healthy mix. But we just appreciate gaining a feel for what's assuming your guidance for gross margin next year and kind of the puts and takes there. And then second question, on the tax rate. Obviously, it was higher than expected this quarter, part of that was geographic mix, and then again, next year, guiding above what was expected for this year. Just wondering, given the growth rate that we're seeing in your business, higher out of the United States, why is it going up in those situations?","Gary Bischoping","Yes, I'll take the last one first, on the tax rate. From a tax rate perspective, I would say, it was geographic mix, mostly driven from our hedging contracts, not really as much as the underlying business. Those hedging contracts realize value in the U.S. and so you get a higher tax on that and the underlying exposure to outside the U.S., which you can't adopt. And so that's the majority of that geographic mix in earnings, it's not really the underlying business. The second part -- or the first part of your question, again, one more time, sorry?","Frits Jonker","In gross margin, I know software is a positive benefit. You're working to mitigate supply chain cost from tariffs. Just overall puts and takes there and what you're assuming for guidance next year.","Gary Bischoping","Guide to the gross margin rate, I would say that, just puts-and-takes-wise, certainly, continuing the mix of that software and services business is favorable. I would tell you that the tremendous momentum we've seen in Halcyon will then also start to roll into the P&L here into FY '19. It's a little bit offset by geographic mix, and the more you mix outside of the U.S., you get a little bit of pressure inside the margin -- gross margin line. But overall, I think the teams are executing very well in market to sell value and to realize the right price trade-offs with growth. And so very pleased with the team's performance this past year and no reason to believe why that wouldn't continue.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, our next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone from Jefferies.","Anthony Petrone","Maybe just, in the 5% to 8% guidance, there's a handful of acquisitions, and so I'm just wondering what the contributions from the various software transactions are in that 5% to 8% guidance. And then, overall, just capital allocations. You mentioned tuck-ins. There's other areas, of course, you can move in, but you also did some buybacks this quarter. So I haven't seen you come to the market in a bit, so I'm just wondering what's reflected in the earnings guidance for buybacks.","Gary Bischoping","Anthony, and on the M&A front, it's really kind of immaterial next year. I think a lot of what we've invested in has tremendous legs in the portfolio and will yield a great benefit to us over time. Add the key tuck-ins, both in the core as well as in the software business, we're expecting nice results from. But on track relative to our business cases, but nothing really terribly material in FY '19. From a capital allocation perspective, I would say that you saw us a little more active in the market here in the fourth quarter, buying back about $50 million worth of stock versus we were averaging the $25 million to $30 million or so prior to that. We'll continue to manage to roughly a flat share count as we have included this assumption inside of that earnings per share guidance. And we'll kind of see how this plays out and go from there. But no material change in the capital allocation approach going forward. We want to make sure we maintain enough financial flexibility to take advantage of opportunities we see out there and organically. And we think we're lined up nicely right now to do that.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen,, we have no further questions in queue at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for closing.","Dow Wilson","Looking forward to close here. Wait, we've got it right here. Thank you. In closing, just a few comments. One, the strength of our business is such that we continue to compete effectively worldwide and weather the U.S., China tariff situation. As we said, the gross impact of tariffs could be $60 million, and we expect to mitigate that down to $8 million next year. The strength of our China business is outstanding. We had a double-digit growth rate in the fourth quarter, building on several years of market share growth.","Gary Bischoping","Sorry, just to interrupt, just really quickly, mitigate down to $18 million.","Dow Wilson","What did I say?","Gary Bischoping","You said $8 million.","Dow Wilson","$8 million. Sorry, from $60 million to $18 million. The strength of our China business is outstanding. We had a double-digit growth rate in the fourth quarter, building on several years of market share growth, and we remain committed to our customers and maintaining our growth in China. We look forward to having Halcyon in our product basket here soon. In closing, have excellent momentum fueled by our investments in innovation commercial infrastructure over the last few years and we continue to win in the marketplace, and we have absolutely no intention of pulling back now. Thank you for joining us today. I'm very pleased with the progress we've made in the fourth quarter and over the last year towards executing on our long-term value-creation strategy. And in everything we do, we remain committed to innovating new technologies to drive towards the ultimate victory, a world without the fear of cancer. Thanks for joining us today.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude our teleconference for today. You may now disconnect your line at this time.

Joining me today on the call are Varian's President and Chief Executive Officer, Dow Wilson, and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Bruff. Dow will share his thoughts on our results and our long-term strategy and Mike will cover our operating and financial results in more detail. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions.","On the Varian Investor Relations website, you can find our fiscal first quarter and 2020 press release and earnings presentation, which are intended to provide additional perspective and details.

We do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement.","And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dow for his comments.","Dow Wilson","Thanks, Anshul. As you all know, Mike Bruff formally assumed the role of CFO for the company on December 1 and this will be his first earnings call in that capacity. And as announced in the first quarter, Anshul is now leading our Investor Relations function. ","With that, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'll share the key milestones we achieved this past quarter and how they contributed to our long-term growth and value creation strategy.","Our first quarter results reflect continued momentum, driven by our expanding and industry-leading product portfolio and innovation cycle.","Now, let me touch on our first quarter performance. Total company revenues of $829 million increased 12%. Oncology revenues grew 11% to $782 million. Proton revenues were $28 million, down 28%, and other revenues were $19 million. ","Operating earnings of $135 million, or 16.2% of revenues, grew 13%. This includes planned investments to drive growth, as well as project mix and updated project costs in our Proton Solutions business.","GAAP earnings per share of $0.96 declined 14% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.16 grew 10%.","Cash flows from operations were $113 million, down $28 million due to investment in working capital to support our growth.","Now, let me provide some additional color on the quarter. Our progress toward becoming the global leader in multidisciplinary cancer care solutions is powered by executing on our four strategic enablers for customers and their patients.","First, innovating in radiation therapy. Second, leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning and cloud-based solutions. Third, growing emerging businesses, geographies and technologies. And fourth, improving operational, financial and capital efficiency.","First, let's review our progress on innovating in radiation therapy. We continue to extend our global market share leadership and expand our addressable market with our product innovation, comprehensive portfolio and services offerings.","In the Oncology business, orders grew 8% in the quarter and the trailing 12 months. Based on public filings, we continue to be the market share leader for both orders and revenues.","We signed an agreement with Massachusetts General Hospital for seven Varian radiotherapy systems, five will replace non-Varian systems, one will replace an existing Varian system and one will be placed in a new vault. Installation is expected to begin in 2020. ","In December 2019, we received an order for seven TrueBeam machines with six IDENTIFY systems at the National Cancer Center in Singapore. Subsequent to quarter close, we were ordered an order for one Edge system and two VitalBeam systems at the National University Hospital, Singapore.","In Brazil, we received eight orders for Halcyon in the quarter. And in China, we continue to see issuance of category B licenses as well as market share leadership in the country. ","Hardware revenues grew 2% for the quarter. Our worldwide net installed base of 8,561 units grew 363 units or 4%. This continued growth in our installed base drives future recurring revenue from upgrades, software and services.","In Africa, we continued to expand access to quality cancer care with the installation of three Halcyon systems at the Centre National d'Oncologie in Mauritania, Centre Hospitalier Nganda in Congo and the Lagos Teaching University Hospital in Nigeria.","On the software front, revenues grew 13%, driven by continued adoption of our software solutions. We remain focused on investing in innovation around efficient clinical workflow, systems integration and treatment planning quality to help close the current resource and skills gap around the globe. ","Orders for HyperArc, our high-definition radiotherapy solution for stereotactic radiosurgery brain metastases, grew double-digits in the quarter. With less than 14% penetration, this continues to be a sizable opportunity across our TrueBeam installed base.","Our services revenues grew 22% in the quarter, including the benefit from CTSI in a 14-week quarter. Excluding these benefits, services revenue grew 8%.","CTSI, which is integrated into our Oncology Systems business, continues to perform in line with our expectations. We're investing in infrastructure for new technology-enabled services to drive mature market productivity and accelerate emerging market adoption.","In our Proton Solutions business, we took one new order in the quarter. Our pipeline in the Proton business remains strong and we continue to gain global market share with customer interest, driven by our smaller footprint ProBeam 360\u00b0 and the preclinical research we are doing with the FlashForward Consortium.","As highlighted in our fourth quarter earnings call in October, we were selected by Penn Medicine to install an additional ProBeam 360\u00b0 system in a single-room configuration at the Lancaster General Health Ann B. Barshinger Cancer Institute. The center is expected to treat its first patient in 2021.","Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we were selected by China Medical University Hospital in Taiwan to install a ProBeam 360\u00b0 system in a single-room configuration with the ability to add a second gantry. The center will also use our ARIA information management system and Eclipse treatment planning system and is scheduled for completion in 2024.","We have 78 Proton rooms under contract across 26 sites globally. 38 rooms are operational, including one room that was handed over to clinical operations this quarter. ","In November, the South Florida Proton Therapy Institute, or SFPTI, on the campus of Delray Medical Center treated its first patient on our ProBeam compact single room system. SFPTI is now treating more than 30 patients per day, making it the fastest ramp of patient treatments per gantry in the world.","Turning our attention to FLASH, preclinical research and product development is progressing per plan and we are encouraged by the results we continue to see from the FlashForward Consortium efforts. As our global ProBeam footprint continues to expand, the FlashForward Consortium now has representation from all geographies, enabling future research across different regional populations.","Second, let's turn to our progress in leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning and cloud solutions. Since the launch of the artificial intelligence-powered Ethos therapy system in September of 2019, reception and excitement for the platform has been extremely strong.","During the quarter, we received three orders for Ethos. Two of the orders were from Australia, including a second order from the Icon Group and one order from Israel. Ethos is CE Marked and 510(NYSE:K) pending in the US. ","Treatments at our first clinical site in Herlev Hospital, Denmark continue to progress well. While initial focus has been on bladder cancer, the team is preparing to start adaptive therapy for new disease sites in the pelvis.","Additionally, our second center, Medisch Spectrum 20 in Netherlands went live in December and our third and fourth installations are underway in Australia at the Icon Group center in Wahroonga and Royal North Shore Hospital respectively.","Install time has been about two weeks at the initial sites and we expect the number of installs to increase in the second half.","Our Adaptive Intelligence Consortium efforts are on track for both clinical and technical publications throughout 2020. We expect to see significant publications on several disease sites. Early evaluation results show that full adaptive sessions are practical in a typical 15-minute treatment time slot.","In Europe, in 2019, we launched RapidPlan PT, our individualized machine learning treatment planning software for Proton therapy, and plan to expand the offering in other regions in the future. ","Consistent with RapidPlan for conventional radiotherapy, RapidPlan PT reduces the treatment planning time for Proton therapy from several hours to approximately 10 minutes without compromising the quality of the plan. This is extraordinary, particularly when you think about the skilled resources gap in Proton therapy and creates significant clinical efficiency for our customers.","Third, let's discuss emerging businesses, geographies and technologies. In November, we established a direct sales and service operation in the Republic of Kenya to better serve the growing cancer population in the country and the East Africa region. ","Africa continues to be a sizable opportunity for us, given the minimal access to radiation therapy and the estimated 2.1 million new cancer cases diagnosed per year by 2040. Our installed base in Africa has increased approximately 30% over the last two fiscal years.","We continue to execute and grow our Interventional Solutions business with revenues of $19 million, which are reported under the Other segment. We had solid performance in China and continue to invest in global distribution capacity and our software platform to support this global business.","With that, I'll turn it over to Mike, who will discuss our fourth strategic enabler and provide more context on the first quarter financial results.","Michael Bruff","Thanks, Dow. And hello, everyone. Our fourth strategic enabler is improving financial, operational and capital efficiency by maintaining a balanced focus across growth, profitability and liquidity.","So, let me first start with growth. Companywide revenues were $829 million, up 12% in dollars and 13% in constant currency. Organic revenues grew 8%.","In Oncology Systems, revenues were $782 million, up 11% in dollars and 12% in constant currency, driven by strong growth in software and services. On a trailing 12-month basis, revenues grew 11% in dollars and 13% in constant currency.","Orders were $774 million, up 8% in dollars and 9% in constant currency in both the quarter and the trailing 12-months. Geographic orders mix was 46% in the Americas, 31% in EMEA and 23% in APAC. We ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in backlog, up 4%.","Taking a closer look at our Oncology business results, in the Americas, revenues grew 15% in the geography and in our North America region. Orders were $360 million, up 7%. On a trailing 12-month basis, orders grew 6%, driven by continued market demand for our integrated value-based care solutions.","In our Europe, Middle East, India and Africa geography, revenues grew 11%. Orders were $237 million, up 8%. On a trailing 12-month basis, orders grew 11%. ","Asia-Pacific revenues grew 5% and orders were $178 million, up 9% led by double-digit growth in our China and our Southeast Asia\/Korea region, partially offset by softness in Japan. On a trailing 12-month basis, orders grew 6% for the Asia-Pacific geography.","Our Proton Solutions business posted revenues of $28 million, a decline of 28%, primarily driven by project mix. Service revenues of $8 million grew 54%.","During the quarter, we reduced our Proton therapy backlog by $19 million to reflect an Indian customer's decision to cancel the order that we booked in the fourth quarter of 2017. No revenue had been recognized on this order.","Turning to profitability. Total company gross margin was $369 million, up 16%, and 44.5% of revenues, an increase of 160 basis points, driven by product mix, acquisitions and tariff exclusions. This was partially offset by Proton business project mix and the $4 million of updated project costs.","Oncology gross margin of 45.4% of revenues increased 100 basis points.","Investing in R&D to drive innovation remains core to our long-term growth and value creation strategy. We invested $67 million in R&D, up 10%, which is 8.1% of revenue. ","SG&A expenses were $167 million, up 21%, which is 20.2% of revenue. Excluding the acquisitions of CTSI, Endocare, Alicon and the Boston Scientific bead portfolio, SG&A was up 13%.","Company operating earnings were $135 million, up 13%, which is 16.2% of revenues, up 15 basis points, driven by the gross margin expansion and planned investments to drive future growth. The $4 million updated project cost in the Proton business impacted operating earnings in the quarter by 50 basis points.","GAAP EPS was $0.96 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.16. ","GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 21% and diluted share count was 91.7 million shares.","This quarter, our GAAP operating earnings and GAAP EPS included an $8.8 million change in fair value of the contingent consideration related to our acquisitions of Endocare and Alicon.","In the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, GAAP net earnings and GAAP EPS included a $22 million gain on the sale of our equity investment in Augmenix.","Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $722 million and $544 million in debt. Certain proceeds from borrowings in the quarter were used to fund U.S. operations in the short term. Cash flows from operations were $113 million, down 20% due to investment in working capital to support continued growth. Oncology DSO was flat versus last year at 111 days.","Other investments in the quarter include $23 million in CapEx and $46 million used to repurchase shares of our stock. As of the end of the quarter, we had 1.9 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.","In summary, we are pleased with the solid operating performance in the first quarter, which delivered double-digit growth in both revenues and non-GAAP operating earnings. ","I will now turn it back over to Dow.","Dow Wilson","Thanks, Mike. Based on the solid operating performance in the first quarter and continued market and product momentum, we're making no changes to the fiscal year 2020 guidance given during the last earnings call. We expect earnings to be weighted towards the back half of the fiscal year as we continue to invest in future growth as considered factors that can influence the business including the strength across the portfolio, growing contribution from software and services, performance variability of the Proton Solutions segment and the mix of mature and emerging markets.","Thank you. And now let's go to Q&A, operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please state your question.","Vijay Kumar","Hey, guys. Congrats on a nice quarter here. Thanks for taking my question. Dow, just on the order front here, really strong. I'm just curious, you mentioned China. We've been hearing a variety of feedback just given coronavirus. Curious how that's going to impact you guys, if at all. And were there any pull-forward of China quota of orders in the current Q?","Dow Wilson","I'll tell you what? Let me start high and then I'll walk down to China. Starting at a high level, you saw the overall 9% constant currency growth on the quarter, 9% trailing 12-months; the America was 7% on the quarter, trailing constant currency growth is 6%; EMEA was still on a constant currency basis, a double-digit quarter, 11% in the quarter, 14% trailing 12-months; and APAC was 9% on the quarter, 7% trailing 12-months.","As it relates to China, I would say we are seeing an uptick in the incremental licenses being released. As you know, applications for the remaining category A licenses ended late December, category B licenses continue to roll out. As we said last quarter, we're really kind of starting to see that roll. I think still, though, the best way to think about this is, in the past five years, our revenue CAGR has been 17%. If anything, we've seen that accelerate a little bit. So, the market remains very good. We don't guide our China orders, as you know, but funnel looks good and our win rate for public tenders remains high.","I think maybe the other thing I'd add about China is the strength of our portfolio is very strong. We have three Proton orders in China we're executing on in Gary's business, Interventional Solutions. We also have a nice presence in China.","As it relates to the virus, we're not seeing anything yet. Good news is \u2013 our priority is to make sure we're doing everything to protect and support our employees and customers during this time. We haven't seen any impact in either of those situations at this point. I think, from a business perspective, it's too early to call. We're continuing to monitor the impact on our factory and customers' surrounding activity, of course. We're trying to be very responsible local citizen. We've made a pretty significant contribution to the local Red Cross. And like everybody, watching it carefully.","Maybe just one other thing I'd add on kind of China momentum, the Halcyon product is doing very well in China. We have over 20 orders now. So, that's flowing. And seeing \u2013 only kind of starting to see after all the regulatory wait, starting to see that uptick.","Vijay Kumar","That's helpful, Dow. And just maybe one on the margin side. Given the tariff relief, I would have expected gross margins maybe perhaps to come in better. While I understand the comments on the growth investments to support the business, I'm just curious on gross margins, if you're seeing anything at all.","Dow Wilson","I'd say, the quarter was right in line with where we were kind of expecting the quarter. I'll turn it over to Mike here and he can kind of do the walk for you on margins.","Michael Bruff","Yeah, exactly, Dow. Vijay, thanks for the questions. The tariff did have roughly around 70 basis points of impact to our gross margin. That was planned in our guidance based on the events and the exclusions that we got back in Q4. But the real story here on the gross margin expansion is the product and geo mix that's playing into that expansion. The 160 basis points of expansion at the company level, 100 of that was product and geo expansion. So, think about the strong software and services growth rates that we had.","Acquisitions, as we expected, improved the gross margin rate by around 45 bps. And then, the unexpected thing that we had in the quarter, which we called out, was the unexpected costs in our Proton business. And that impacted around 60 basis points on a gross margin perspective. But on the operating margin, it impacted about 50 basis points. ","But what I'd like to say about that is, while it was not expected in the quarter, it was something that the team identified early in the quarter. We got our heads around it. It was isolated to a project and some very specific retrofit costs. It triggered a review of all the other projects that we have in process. ","And at the end of the day, after that deep dive, the $4 million cost, we believe, is well within our tolerance range on the year. And again, I'll just kind of go back to our top line and bottom line growth rates. We are set up in a very good position to achieve our full-year commitments.","Vijay Kumar","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Please state your question.","Anthony Petrone","All right, thanks. And good afternoon. Also, congrats on the strong orders here. Maybe just to dig a little bit deeper into China. At Analyst Day, Dow, the company announced that there was 40 MoUs covering 70 LINACs. And so, just wondering, here in the quarter, if there was any activity out of those specific orders. And then, the follow-up there also would be the distinction between Class A and Class B. It sounds like certainly Class A is moving along, but an update on Class B licenses and where that sits would be helpful as well. And then, I'll have one follow-up. Thanks.","Dow Wilson","Yeah. I would say, Anthony, as it relates to the China Import Expo Meeting, most of those MoUs are long term and tend not to be executed for, call it, 9 to 12 months kind of period. So, I would say that none of those are in here at this point. We had a very strong quarter in China. So, we continue to like very much what we see. We're seeing strong equipment demand. Across the portfolio, frankly. ","I highlighted Halcyon, but we're also seeing very good traction on Edge, on TrueBeam and on VitalBeam. And believe that, when Ethos comes to market, eventually in that market, we'll also have a strong position there. So, the portfolio is well set-up.","As it kind of relates to each contract and whether it was part of that quota or not, what I can tell you is the best way we track it is it was strong double-digit growth on a tough comp. We were also a strong double-digit growth last year. And that's probably the best way to characterize it.","Anthony Petrone","Fair enough. And the follow-up would be just on \u2013 over to the US, just any updates from the company's view on the bundle, where it sits? It seems like there's just a range of expectations in terms of timing. So, maybe what the latest is in terms of discussions with CMS and where the final rule is in timing there. Thanks.","Dow Wilson","As you know, given the original time timeline, CMS has clearly been delayed. There were significant comments from customers, from the providers, from the clinical community, from the vendor community, likely led to a delay in issuing the final ruling. There's no definite guidance on timing. I've seen some of the ranges that are out there. I think that it's going to be some time in 2020 and it's not going to be delayed to 2022 as some time is out there. ","I think that, as we're really thinking about it, clearly, the portfolio, we've been designing to a value-based world for many years. So, I think the portfolio was well set up for the transition. ","And with the CTSI acquisition, we are particularly excited about having a technology-enabled services play as we believe customers will look to more outsourcing of all kinds of activities and we'll be well set-up for that growth. So, we're seeing both in the quarter.","As I mentioned a minute ago, our total Americas trailing-12 is 6%; and on the quarter, it was 7%. So, we're not seeing it impact the order rate at this point in time. Not seeing any acceleration of cancellations or anything else that would cause us to worry. And in fact \u2013 and then, when you look at the way the backlog is flowing, the Americas revenue number, as we said in the script, was up 15% on the quarter. So, we're seeing a nice flow in the geography.","Anthony Petrone","Okay, all right. Thanks, again. I'll hop in queue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with UBS. Please state your question.","Matthew Taylor","Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. The first one I wanted to ask about was Ethos and Ethos' timing. Can you give us any update on when you would expect to get approval for that in the US? And then, just on the orders in the quarter, you had three. You had really strong orders out of the gate last quarter. Can you talk about what the funnel looks like there and if you think you will see a step-up in the coming period?","Dow Wilson","Yeah. Sure, Matt. Thank you. We were very pleased with the early orders in Q4, as you know. Got out of the gate late in Q4, launch in, basically, September of Q4. Between Q4 and Q1, we've taken out 20 orders. Frankly, when we look at the ramp versus Halcyon, kind of right on. So, that looks pretty good. ","The orders are a little lumpy. Or maybe a little bit of pent-up demand or waiting for regulatory approval last quarter. As I said in the script, we do not have yet US regulatory approval. We expect that 510(k) this quarter. So, in the next 30 to 60 days, we should have it. Customer feedback remains outstanding. And frankly, one of the things that we really like is how it positions across our portfolio and gives us again something in the high end of the product mix from a pricing and margin rate point of view. So, it's still early. We do expect 510(k) approval in this quarter. We do think that this shift to adaptive radiotherapy is on the order of the kind of shifts we saw with IMRT and IGRT. So, at this point, I'd say we've seen nothing that discourages us from that and we're bullish about Ethos.","Matthew Taylor","Thanks. So, just a follow-up on \u2013 I just would love to hear more about how you're positioning it in the market. Are you kind of putting it up head to head with MRI or positioning it differently? What are some of the things that customers are telling you about your adaptive approach versus others?","Dow Wilson","Yeah. We're getting very, very positive feedback from our customers. I'd say they love the quality of the product. They love the multi-modality image integration of the product. I'd say, right at the top of the list, they love the fact that our workflow is superior to everything else out there.","As I mentioned in the script, we haven't seen anything yet that we really can't envision in a 15-minute time slot, and that's kind of sacred to our customers and sacred to patients. It leverages all the Halcyon technology for ease-of-use. I think it's very well-positioned for the APM environment that's coming, has an outstanding ROI with that kind of throughput. So, I think it's going to win on that basis. ","We're seeing a lot of people engage with us on the product, a lot of enthusiasm. Clearly, we got to get through the 510(k) in the US before we can market and sell it here. But we are, I think, early out of the gate here. We're very much perceived as the AI leader with our previous introductions with machine learning in RapidPlan, the other technologies that we have on the software side in the market and now Ethos. I think we're very much perceived as the AI leader in the market.","Matthew Taylor","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird & Company. Please state your question.","Jeffrey Johnson","Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Can you hear me okay?","Dow Wilson","Hi, Jeff.","Michael Bruff","Hey, Jeff.","Jeffrey Johnson","Hey, Dow. Hey, Mike. Good to be back. So, question for you. I think the only question I have left here is Tata. I don't know that I heard any update there. Just wondering if you saw any tailwinds here in the first quarter from that relationship and anything you can quantify there, high energy, low energy, anything like that. Thanks.","Dow Wilson","Yeah. Sure. The Tata deal continues to move along. We've had 17 books since the signature of the agreement. We had two more this past quarter. So, that's going to continue to be lumpy. Kind of, I think, as you look, last three quarters, it's something like 213.2 [ph], something like that. So, it's going to bounce around. But the framework for the agreement is for up to 200 systems. We're thrilled for how it's going. RT utilization rate in India is only 15% to 20%. We think that this is a great play. And, frankly, in the long term, kind of combination of this agreement with the position that we have on CTSI for enabling customers to get in to radiation therapy with the services approach we have, we're very encouraged by what we see in India. I'd say most of the products sold there is TrueBeam, Jeff. So, it's a good mix of product. I'd say it's going kind of how we expected. We like what we see.","Jeffrey Johnson","Yeah, understood. All right. That's all I've got. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Marie Thibault with BTIG. Please state your question.","Marie Thibault","Hi. Thanks so much for taking the questions. And congrats again on strong orders.","Dow Wilson","Hi, Marie.","Marie Thibault","Hey, hi. I wanted to ask a quick one that you called out some softness in orders in Japan. Given that's a really important market, I just wanted to hear a little bit about the dynamics going on there.","Dow Wilson","Yeah. I'd say it's kind of just normal oscillations, unfortunately, of what we've seen in Japan in the last two or three years. The overall is down a hair. So, the service business has been very strong in Japan. The equipment is down a little bit. And, overall, Japan is dilutive to our APAC growth rate because China is hitting it out of the park. The rest of Southeast Asia\/Korea has been very strong. And Japan is dilutive to the growth rate, of course, but we have a very strong service business there. We're starting to see a little software activity. We had tough comps in APAC and in Japan, in particular, in the first half last year. So, we might see a little bit more of this coming. But we've got a good team there. Service business continues to hum. I'd say, kind of no change in our outlook in China, Southeast Asia, Korea. Very strong and working hard to kind of build some recovery in Japan.","Marie Thibault","Yeah, makes sense. Okay. And then, my other question, kind of taking a look at my model, the spending on both R&D and SG&A, I understand the investments you're making there. At the Investor Day back in November, you spoke quite a bit about some of the R&D projects that are going on, like FLASH. I'd love to hear a little bit more about the SG&A spend that you did this quarter. And it sounds like the second half, some of that should peel off. So, I wanted to hear a little bit about the timing of that as well.","Dow Wilson","Yeah. Let me tee this up and I'll have Mike kind of take you through the walk. I think the first big piece is \u2013 there's a huge piece of it that's acquisition. So, between the CTSI and the Interventional Oncology acquisitions that we made last year, you're looking at $13 million of SG&A additive to last year and then $3 million from the extra week on the quarter. And then, the rest is kind of balanced between some infrastructure things we're doing, some ongoing investment in our distribution and marketing, and frankly, the kind of annualization of the build that you saw in the last half of last year. Mike, do you want to put any color on that?","Michael Bruff","I think that's about right, Dow. We said that ex the investments in the acquisitions and the acquisitions themselves that SG&A is growing at 13%. Our revenue is growing at about that rate on a constant currency basis. And so, excluding the acquisitions, we're scaling at 100% even with all of these investments that we're making. So, again, the investment is there to drive the growth, but also to support the growth that we are driving in the business. And as we play out the rest of the year, we would expect to continue to drive scale in SG&A throughout the year and, we said in our long range plan, over those five years as well. So, early days there, but the majority of this lift is acquisition related.","Marie Thibault","Makes perfect sense. Thanks so much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn it back to management for closing remarks. Thank you.","Dow Wilson","Thank you, operator. I am pleased with the strides we've made in the first quarter. Our focused execution enabled us to deliver solid oncology orders growth and double-digit growth in both revenues and non-GAAP operating earnings. ","Looking forward, we'll continue to invest in our strategic enablers and remain committed to innovating and investing in new technologies to drive for the ultimate victory, a world without fear of cancer. ","Thanks for joining us today.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a great evening."],"21589":["Varian Medical Systems, Inc.

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and a replay could be accessed on the Varian Investor website at www.varian.com\/investors.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Michael Bruff, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Michael Bruff","Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today on the call are Varian's President and Chief Executive Officer, Dow Wilson; and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Bischoping. Dow will share his thoughts on our results and long-term strategy, and Gary will cover our operating and financial results in more detail. ","On the Varian Investor Relations website, you can find our fiscal second quarter press release and earnings presentation, which are intended to provide additional perspective and details.

These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in today's earnings release, this conference call and our SEC filings. We do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement.","And with all that said, I'll turn it over to Dow.","Dow Wilson","Thanks, Mike, and good day, everyone. Today, I'll share the key milestones we achieved this past quarter and how they contributed to our long-term strategy. We're pleased to see continued momentum in the first half of 2019 and we're raising our revenue guidance for the fiscal year while continuing to invest in future growth opportunities. First, let me touch on our second quarter results. Total company revenues increased 7% to $779 million. Oncology revenues grew 7%, driven by our integrated platform with best-in-class hardware, software and services. Revenues for our Proton Solutions business were $33 million, up 2%. Operating earnings declined 6% to $119 million or 15.3% of revenues, driven by the impact of tariffs as well as the increased project costs and site delays in our Proton business in the quarter. GAAP earnings per share was $0.96 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.05, was down 9%.","Cash flows from operations were negative $13 million, down $79 million due to tax payments and networking capital impacts from revenue growth. Based on the company's strong orders and revenue performance year-to-date and our outlook for the rest of the year, we're raising our fiscal year revenue guidance from 5% to 8% to 6% to 9%. ","Now to provide some additional color on the quarter. In terms of our long-term growth and value-creation strategy, we made progress across our 3 growth initiatives: first, strengthening our leadership in radiation therapy. Based on public filings, the radiation therapy market grew 10% on an orders basis over the trailing 12 months ending in December 2018, and we grew our worldwide share during that period. ","In our Oncology business, orders grew 15% in the quarter and 13% in the trailing 12 months. This was our fourth quarter in a row of double-digit orders growth and was driven by strong growth in the quarter across all geographies, with strength in hardware, software and services. ","Our worldwide net installed base is now 8,292 units, an increase of 338 units or 4%. This continued growth in our installed base drives recurring revenue from software and services. On the hardware side, we made progress with our global rollout of Halcyon and have now taken 238 orders since our May 2017 launch, including 36 orders in the second quarter, double the number of orders from last year. ","Since launch, nearly 70% of orders worldwide have been incremental, including greenfield orders, competitive takeouts and orders for systems that require a smaller vault. And our Halcyon systems have now treated over 15,000 patients. Also on the hardware side, we're pleased to announce that for the second year since the radiation therapy category was created, TrueBeam was again selected as category leaded -- as category leader by class, an independent research firm in its 2019 best-in-class report. ","This month, The Lancet published clinical studies of the SABR-COMET randomized Phase II trial for the treatment of oligometastatic cancers. We're happy to report that the study found that SBRT was associated with an improvement in overall survival, achieving median survival of 41 months as compared with 28 months for the control group that was treated using standard of care. Varian is a global leader in SBRT treatments and our platforms are well equipped to care for patients in the protocols outlined in the study. ","On the software front, revenues grew 14%, double our hardware growth, driven by customer uptake of our new software features. Additionally, we were honored that for the sixth year in a row, Eclipse was named best-in-class for Oncology treatment planning, receiving the highest average score for overall performance. ","Orders for HyperArc, our high-definition radiotherapy solution for SRS, nearly doubled, and orders for Eclipse MCO, our multi-criteria optimization planning software more than doubled compared with last year. MCO is fast becoming a standard addition to all new treatment planning orders and a significant upgrade opportunity for our installed base. We have now received nearly 1,000 MCO orders at approximately 350 sites and have significant runway remaining with less than 10% penetration among our Eclipse. ","Given our strong orders performance, we are incurring incremental cost to accelerate our software deployment capabilities to meet demand, which we expect to drive revenue growth in future periods. We expect an incremental $2 million in these costs this year. ","Our services revenues grew 1%, including an estimated negative impact of 3 percentage points from FX. This growth was driven by our growing installed base and higher mix of newer machines, which typically have a higher attach rate and contract value. ","In our Proton Solutions business, we completed clinical handovers for one room each at the Emory Proton Therapy Center in Georgia, the Christie Hospital in the U.K. and the Danish Centre for Particle Therapy in Aarhus, Denmark. We now have 30 operational rooms at 10 sites, representing an important future recurring revenue stream for our Proton business. In Denmark, we also announced the opening and first-patient treatments at the Danish Center for Particle Therapy, and we achieved an important construction milestone with installation of the gantry for the ProBeam Compact single-room Proton Therapy Center in Singapore. When completed, this project, the first compact proton system in Southeast Asia, will expand access to proton therapy in the region. ","Our pipeline in the proton business remains strong, with customer interest driven by our smaller footprint ProBeam 360 and preclinical research we're doing with the FlashForward Consortium. We have been chosen as the preferred vendor at Shandong Cancer Hospital, an institute in China, and we're working with the customer close this -- to close this deal, which is expected in Q3. And we're optimistic about our prospects for additional deals to close in the second half of this year. ","In October, we announced the formation of the FlashForward Consortium to study potentially groundbreaking, ultrahigh dose rate cancer treatments with protons. Earlier this month, at the American Association for Cancer Research meeting, we presented publicly the first preclinical results of our research with the FlashForward Consortium, which showed reduced toxicity in healthy tissues and organs in mice. We're excited about the possible breakthrough in cancer treatment that this research could represent for patients around the world and are encouraged by these initial preclinical results. Based on this progress, we're investing an incremental $5 million this year on our preclinical research with the FlashForward Consortium, majority of which will occur in the back half of the fiscal year. We incurred approximately $1 million of this spend in the second quarter. ","Our second growth initiative is to expand our global footprint. Our global market share growth was driven by continued strong orders performance in our 3 geographies. For EMEA, this was the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit growth driven by strong performance across the region. An important milestone in EMEA this quarter was the signing of a framework agreement with TATA Trusts to increase patient access to advanced radiation therapy treatments in India. It is estimated that by 2025, there will be 1.8 million new cancer cases diagnosed per year in India. This 3-year agreement, in which Varian has been selected as the preferred supplier, provides for the installation of potentially up to 200 radiation therapy systems across the country. We expect to begin taking orders from this framework agreement beginning in the second half. ","In Africa, we announced earlier this month the opening of a new office in South Africa for local sales and service managers to support growth throughout the continent. And in Nigeria, we announced this quarter that we will replace the older systems at a Cancer Treatment Center in Lagos, with 1 Halcyon and 2 VitalBeam radiotherapy systems and we'll deploy a training center to support development of human resource capacity to expand access across West Africa. ","In our Asia-Pacific region, we delivered very strong double-digit orders growth in China, Japan and Southeast Asia. In China, our second-largest market, we continue to see strong momentum driven by the demand for SBRT. Our best-in-class product portfolio continues to resonate with the China market, resulting in a leading share position over the trailing 12 months. We also received our first Halcyon orders in China following great reception we had after launching the product at our China Users Meeting earlier this year. ","In China, over 4,000 LINACs, more than double the current estimated installed base, are required to meet the current cancer burden in the country. Today, approximately 95% of patients are treated in either tier 3 hospitals or in tier 2 centers located in cities. These facilities cannot meet the demand for cancer care in China and present a barrier to access for patients in rural areas. The Chinese government is driving an initiative to localize cancer treatment, increasing the number of county centers and migrating 70% of patients to these hospitals. This shift presents tremendous opportunity for continued growth in this important market as demand for advanced cancer care in China continues to grow. Additionally, the Chinese government's announcement of quota increase of radiation therapy licenses demonstrates China's commitment to increasing access to advanced cancer care. We're starting to see some activity in the provinces related to this announcement but haven't booked an order yet related to the quota increase. ","Lastly, our third growth initiative is to expand into other addressable markets. This month, Varian went live across Tennessee Oncology network with an implementation of our new patient reported outcomes and symptoms management and platform. We also continue to look at inorganic opportunities to leverage Varian's core strengths to reach more patients and drive long-term growth. ","Overall, we're pleased with the progress we made in the second quarter. We remain dedicated to providing customers with the full spectrum of intelligent and advanced tools to help improve patient outcomes and achieve our long-term growth strategy. ","With that, I'll turn it over to Gary, who'll provide more context on the second quarter financial results.","Gary Bischoping","Thanks, Dow. As always, I'll consistently frame my comments in the context of our long-term growth and value-creation strategy, which includes balancing growth, profitability and liquidity. So let me start with growth. Companywide revenues were $779 million in the second quarter, up 7% in dollars and 10% in constant currency. In Oncology, revenues were $747 million, up 7% in dollars and 10% in constant currency driven by growth across hardware, software and services. ","Tariffs had a 130 basis point negative impact on the growth rate. On a trailing 12 months basis, revenues grew 11% in dollars and 12% in constant currency. Orders were $766 million, up 15% in dollars and 18% in constant currency. On a trailing 12-month basis, orders grew 13% in dollars and 14% in constant currency. We ended the quarter with $2.9 billion in backlog, up 13%. ","Taking a closer look at our Oncology business results. In the Americas, revenues grew 11% with double-digit growth in both North America and Latin America. Orders were $366 million, up 7%. And in North America, orders grew 12% driven by strong execution across our integrated portfolio as well as key wins with Alliance Oncology and Huntsville, Alabama to replace 7 competitor systems and software with Varian solutions, and additional 5 system order from HCA, bringing their total Varian-ordered systems over the past 3 years to over 20 accelerators.","Asia-Pacific revenues grew 7%. Tariffs had a negative impact on the growth rate of 7 percentage points. Orders were $167 million, up 35%. As Dow discussed, we grew strong double digits in China, Japan and Southeast Asia. In our Europe, Middle East, India and Africa geography, revenues grew 2%. Revenues grew 9% in constant currency as FX had a significant impact this quarter. Orders were $233 million, up 17%, with outstanding performance across the region. This is Europe's -- this is EMEA's seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit orders growth. Our Proton Solutions business posted revenues of $33 million in the quarter, which is up 2%. ","Turning to profitability. The company gross margin was relatively flat year-over-year. The gross margin rate was 41.2% of revenue, down 260 basis points. This included negative impacts of 120 basis points from tariffs, 80 basis points from project costs and site delays in our Proton business within the quarter. 30 basis points from FX and 10 basis points from costs related to our software deployment ramp. ","Our trailing 12 months gross margin rate was 42.7%, down 60 basis points. This included negative impacts of 70 basis points from tariffs and 20 basis points from project costs and site delays in our Proton business within the quarter. Oncology gross margin rate was 43.6%, down 210 basis points. This included negative impacts of 130 basis points from tariffs, 40 basis points from FX, 10 basis points from costs related to our software deployment ramp and the remainder from product mix. ","Looking at Proton Solutions. Gross margin dollars were negative $4 million, down $5 million driven by $7 million in increased project cost and site delays in the quarter. These items as well as delays in the timing of orders resulted in not achieving our aspiration of reaching operating breakeven for the year. Investments will continue to be a key driver of our long-term growth and value-creation strategy. We invested $59 million in R&D, which is up 1% at 7.6% of revenues. ","Likewise, we are continuing to invest in sales and marketing, which grew 10% driven by investments in headcount-supporting sales for recent acquisitions and product management for our treatment planning. We are seeing leverage in the P&L when it comes to general and administrative spend with modest growth of 4% compared with robust orders and revenue growth rates. SG&A expenses were $143 million or 18.3% of revenue, a rate which is flat compared with last year. Company operating earnings were $119 million, down 6% at 15.3% of revenues, down 220 basis points. This included negative impacts of 150 basis points from tariffs, 80 basis points from project costs and site delays in our Proton business within the quarter and 40 basis points from FX. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating earnings increased 6% at a rate of 16.4%, down 60 basis points. This included negative impact of 80 basis points from tariffs and 20 basis points from project costs and site delays in our Proton business within the quarter. ","Turning to tax. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 21.7%, and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 21.5%. GAAP EPS was $0.96. Our non-GAAP EPS was $1.05, with diluted share count of 91.9 million shares in the quarter. ","Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $546 million and no debt. Cash flow from operations were negative $13 million, down $79 million due to tax payments and net working capital impacts from revenue growth. Oncology DSO increased from 103 days to 110 days in the quarter driven by strong revenue growth. In addition to R&D, other investments in the quarter included $11 million in CapEx and $51 million to repurchase shares of our stock. As of the end of the quarter, we had 2.9 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. I will now turn it back over to Dow.","Dow Wilson","Thanks, Gary. With respect to our annual guidance, we carefully considered the projected market growth, our recent orders momentum and our mitigation efforts with respect to tariffs, which remain on track. As such, we are raising revenue guidance to $3.09 billion to $3.18 billion, representing growth of 6% to 9%. ","Previously, we guided $3.06 billion to $3.15 billion, representing growth of 5% to 8%. And we are reaffirming the following guidance for fiscal year 2019: non-GAAP operating earnings as a percentage of revenues of 17% to 18%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.60 to $4.75; cash flows from operations of $460 million to $510 million. ","This updated guidance considers the following impacts to operating earnings: an increase of $5 million from the raise in revenue guidance; and a benefit of $5 million from an estimated reduction in gross tariff impact. ","Based on strong recent momentum and incremental investment of $5 million in our preclinical research with the FlashForward Consortium, continued investment in software deployment capabilities, which will result in approximately $2 million in incremental costs and the second quarter $7 million increased project costs and site delays in our Proton business. The guidance continues to assume a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 21% to 22%, a weighted average diluted share count of $92 million, currency rates as of the beginning of our third fiscal quarter of 2019 and excludes any future acquisitions. Thank you. And now let's go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Amit Hazan from Citi.","Amit Hazan","Let's start with the positive and just talk about the order growth you're seeing in the markets. And maybe just run through the regions in particular, all of us are probably most interested in the sustainability of that growth. Europe or EMEA stands out as just having been strong for longer than a lot of us expected but also obviously, China with the tender still upcoming there. Just give us a sense of sustainability of what you're seeing in those regions.","Dow Wilson","Good question. We're continuing to see very strong orders growth across all 3 geographies. As we said, we've got trailing 12 months growth of strong double digit. I'd say it's really driven by execution across the entire portfolio, hardware, software and services. Trailing 12-month orders growth in the Americas, constant currency of 8%, EMEA up 19% and APAC up 21%. So some of that is maybe a little bit above the trend line, I think, for sure. But I'd say from a funnel point of view, Asia looks very strong. In EMEA, we mentioned the Tata momentum, that's an agreement at this point in time. There will be more orders that will be booked against that. We haven't booked many orders against that at this point. We also see big opportunities in Eastern Europe. So I don't know, Europe's going to continue to be double digit, but I think we continue to see strength there. ","And then as I mentioned in the remarks, we were double digit in North America. So we're seeing a very strong U.S. market. I know there's always conversation about what reimbursement scenario's coming, but I'd say our U.S. model is really delivering right now. We've got tougher comps in the second half. So we've -- we're looking at that but I'd say the overall market is very, very strong. Gary, did I miss anything there?","Gary Bischoping","No, I think that's right. I would say that, again, just to reaffirm from a China perspective, these results do not reflect any orders from the quota increase, and so continue to see progress at the provincial level there and we're tightly aligned with kind of the undergoing -- underlying activity that's happening at the provincial level here.","Dow Wilson","Yes. Maybe the other thing I'd mention is Halcyon just continues to be a big deal here. We had more orders in the quarter in developing markets than we had in developed markets. It continues to be very strong, very pleased with the Halcyon performance.","Amit Hazan","Okay. And then secondly, you moved to the P&L and kind of some of the challenges. I think one thing we'd like to better understand is the gross margin profile from here. Obviously, I'm curious when Halcyon starts to more materially impact that, but also just to understand better, are you thinking about it for this year and next year? That was not a -- it didn't look like a great number to us and I don't know if services is a part of that, that looks like it wasn't growing nearly as fast as it had been in the past but software looked like it was growing quite fast and that's usually a good guide contributor. So just a little more color on the elements of gross margin and how you're thinking about that for the next 12, 18 months?","Gary Bischoping","Yes. Great, Amit. And thanks for the question. And the gross margin rate, as it relates to the second quarter, there is that Proton kind of site delay as well the project costs. That cost is about -- thinking about that is kind of 80 basis points in the quarter. And then we'll continue to invest in other elements of the business. But overall, that was a big part of what we saw in the second quarter was that proton -- that proton piece and then gross margin rate. ","From the services perspective, trailing 12-month growth rate is just fine there. We had a tough compare. Last year, we had a 14% year-on-year growth rate in Q2 in the services side from a revenue perspective. The business is healthy, attach rates are fine, underlying to the -- elements of that are moving along just fine. So we're okay on the services line. ","And we had strong growth in orders over the last 12 months. And so we just have to wait, also, for those to anniversary from one key perspective and to start to see the growth rate off of those what that orders trajectories are over the last 12 months. ","As far as going forward goes, I mean from a gross margin rate perspective, as you know we don't guide to that, however, some of what we talked about all throughout the year will start to roll through. One would certainly be our commercial efforts on the tariff mitigation side. That will start to pick up steam in the second half. As you think about that in the second half, it's still more loaded to the second part, so the fourth quarter of the second half. We'll continue -- as you saw, we invested in software deployment teams. So we'll continue to see, we think, nice, strong growth out of the software business, which will be accretive to the gross margin rate in the second half vis-a-vis the first half. And again just to tie it up, that proton issue that we saw or the challenges we saw with the site delays as well as the overall increase in cost, that we think we are continuing to the second quarter. And so that will be accretive in the second half as well. So good underlying dynamics that help us get comfortable with holding on to that range from an earnings per share perspective all while still investing back in the business.","Dow Wilson","Maybe just to underscore the software point. Our software growth rate is about twice our hardware growth rate and our hardware growth rate is very good. So that's kind of what that investment is laying in for us in the second half. And we should see some -- both some volume and some positive margin mix out of that.","Operator","And our next question today is coming from Matt Taylor from UBS.","Matthew Taylor","Just wanted to follow-up on the China quota and the opportunity in India. And specifically what I wanted to understand was you said you were seeing some I guess action in the provinces. When do you think you might start to see some of these orders come through? And at what pace? Can you -- do you have any updated insights there? I'll start with that one.","Dow Wilson","Yes. yes, Matt, good question. I'd say the activity that we're starting to see, we're seeing some questions, we're seeing the provinces engage. We haven't seen any published tender yet and that -- for me, that would be kind of the #1 signal when do people start issuing tenders. We do see some initial licenses in the province distributed to hospitals, so now the hospitals kind of got to pull their activity together, issue the tender and get going. I expect that we'll see a little bit of activity in the second half but that most of the real action here is going to be fiscal year '20.","Matthew Taylor","Okay. Great. And I guess same kind of question on the EMEA agreement. Congrats on that. What kind of pacing, if you have any thoughts on the potential 200 orders? Should we expect that they start here in the second half? Do you have any visibility on that?","Dow Wilson","It's a good question. We have not booked any orders yet from this agreement. We expect the initial orders will received in the second half of the year. The contract language says up to 200 systems. It's a big market that's way underserved. I talked about -- in India sits 10% to 15% of patients that have access to radiation therapy, whereas in the west, it'd be 50% to 60% get radiation therapy as part of their treatment. The Tata Trust has signed agreements with multiple states throughout India. So we do expect to see orders flowing here in the second half. We're not ready to guide on the amount yet, we want to see some -- see the color of the currency as it comes falling through. But we're very excited about it that Tata Foundation has been outstanding in this. They're very motivated by bringing cancer care to a population that hasn't had access to cancer treatment in India and, kind of, as I mentioned in the call, in smaller cities and villages. So I expect this will be a multiyear order flow and not a big onetime bolus. And again, just to underscore, that's not in the Q2 performance.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jason Bednar from Robert W. Baird.","Jason Bednar","I wanted to start with -- I just wanted to start with Halcyon. The orders here are a bit better sequentially, up nicely year-over-year. But do you think we're on the cusp of really seeing Halcyon turn a corner? I mean it just seems like a lot of things could be coming together, with China availability starting January, 2.0 having been available for 6 or 12 months here in the U.S. and Europe and 3.0 slated to launch later this year. So just curious if you agree with that assessment or if there's anything else we should be considering with Halcyon?","Dow Wilson","I would say we love the orders momentum, the socket growth is starting out nicely. Our marketing efforts are working well. Customer endorsements have been outstanding. We have really strong engagement, excellent experience with our customers. I think I said in the call 70% of the Halcyon units, we believe, are incremental. So we're -- so it is hitting. We did launch the product in the beginning of the quarter in China. And we just have a handful of orders in the quarter from China. So we expect -- as you state, we expect that to start hitting, so there should be some good growth coming in China. We have had very good customer reaction in China. Our strategy here is we just want to expand the number of sockets out there. And it really complements our TrueBeam product in the portfolio. We're seeing incremental customers come in with small vaults, resource constraint on the operating side, winning some competitive take-outs and I think we're going to have some cobalt replacements on top of that. I think we're very well positioned for continued growth with Halcyon.","Jason Bednar","Okay. And then turning over to revenue and kind of this order-to-revenue conversion maybe. I mean just wondering, you put up some unprecedented growth here just over the past 12 months. I mean when do you expect we'll see -- start to see some of that strong order growth begin translating to an accelerating revenue growth profile? And is it reasonable to think that this will track as typical with Varian and talk about maybe a 12-month lag and we'll start seeing some of that order growth convert to revenue beginning fiscal '20? Or should we have a different lag in mind for some reason?","Gary Bischoping","Yes. No, great question. And what we're seeing here is from an overall trailing 12-month growth rate in Oncology of 13%. And when you take a look at backlog, backlog grew about the same on a year-over-year basis. So we continue to move product through that, through backlog, and out into revenue at a nice clip. The conversion rate will reflect some of the nuances in the underlying mix of the product in the business. But overall, Jason, when you think about this in the long term, we still see our revenue -- our orders turn into revenue growth and convert. So the trajectory of the orders growth rate continues to accelerate. So you're going to see the revenue growth rate kind of lag a little bit here, and that's what's happening in the business. But overall, we're pleased with how the teams are operating and pushing product out the door and meeting, exceeding customers' needs and demands.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies.","Anthony Petrone","Maybe a couple on China and then one just on the U.S. momentum in Oncology. As far as China, as we look toward really, I guess, quoting now 2020, when you start to see order momentum, clearly there's a larger amount of Type B licenses out there. How do you think the Type B licenses will flow? And what level of sort of chunkiness do you expect once this starts next year? And I'll have a couple of follow-ups.","Dow Wilson","I think it's going to be small, growing linearly. I mean the one thing about this market is it's one or two at a time. We tend not to see the big like the Tata thing or the Brazil thing we had a few years ago or even Algeria or some of the other companies that we've talked about last 2 or 3 years where we get, call it, 10 to 50 units as part of an order. China is much more linear in the way it's tendered kind of hospital at a time. So I think that's the way it's going to happen. I don't think that's the way that market is as well. There are big resource needs. By the way, I think it's one of the things that we're very uniquely positioned to do well. A lot of these are going to be going into smaller cities, more rural orientation, county hospitals. They don't need just the license, they need the people, the training, the education. We have localized the software now. We have significant education resources both on the ground and in flight, so we train everybody locally. We think we're in a very, very good position.","Gary Bischoping","The only thing I would add there, Anthony, is that we've got Halcyon and TrueBeam both in that category now and didn't have that over the last 12 to 24 months as we considered that marketplace. So we've got, as Dow just -- Dow mentioned, just to put a finer point on it, well positioned to go out there and execute in these rural markets with Halcyon and TrueBeam.","Anthony Petrone","Yes. The follow-up would be just on the tariff side on exemption. Is there any update there on the China side specifically? I know the company filed for some exemptions, maybe just a quick comment on that. And then the last question would just be on the U.S. reimbursement side. We're in the proposal season here for CMS, are there any thoughts on how this year shakes out?","Dow Wilson","Yes. I'd say on the tariff side first, I mean we continue to be very engaged both in Washington and in Beijing on the issue. I'd say no major things to report. Maybe the biggest thing to report is that our mitigation activities continue to be very -- to be executed very well by the team. We're executing sustainable actions there. Mitigation efforts are on track. I know I kind of get this up, we're profiled for the year. But it's why we kind of feel good about second half is our mitigation activities, as we've kind of said all year, are really implementing in the second half of the year. And Gary, anything else on tariffs?","Gary Bischoping","No. I think directly to your question, the remaining application we have in the U.S., there's been no update with regard to the parts we're importing there and the couple of applications we have in there, Anthony. And just to reiterate, the ramp in the tariff mitigation is just that, it'll ramp not only into the third quarter but also ramp into the fourth quarter. So as Dow referenced, the profile for the year kind of isn't normally what we would expect.","Dow Wilson","On the reimbursement side, I'd say it will take as ever if we're waiting for early July proposal from CMS. Clearly, we're hearing the rumor about bundled payments for SBRT. We think that positions our product line very, very well. We are the global leader in stereotactic body radiation therapy with our advanced dose rate, our conformality, our imaging. So I think we're positioned well if that change goes into effect, and we'll kind of keep you updated as we hear more about that.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.","Tycho Peterson","Maybe on that last point, Dow, one of the things that you guys have talked about was bundling, if you could maybe kind of catalyze some of those customers that don't have SBRT capabilities to upgrade. Can you maybe just talk to how much of your installed base in the U.S. at this point has older systems that potentially would need to upgrade if the bundle goes through and talk stuff.","Dow Wilson","I'd say at least 1,000 units. That's kind of my gut reaction. I might need to get our pencil on that a little finer. But I mean our U.S. installed base is 3,500 machines, and we've got a lot of TrueBeam out there. But there's SBRT capabilities on TrueBeam as well as -- I mean it's at least 1,000 units that we have significant opportunity on. But I think it's some of the momentum we're seeing in the U.S. now. I mean you saw the numbers on the quarter, double-digit performance in North America, and I think we're seeing a lot of nice configuration mix out of the U.S. market.","Tycho Peterson","And then can you maybe touch on pricing dynamics? Your biggest competitor called out pricing pressure last quarter after you guys have reported. They've also launched a new value model. As we think about China quota, India orders, EMEA funnel, just curious how you're seeing kind of pricing level in the market.","Gary Bischoping","I think Elekta is known to compete on price. But Tycho, if you look at the country level for us, pricing dynamics are in check and in order with what we've seen historically so no major changes, kind of puts and takes here and there. But overall, we'll -- we continue to sell value because our customers are really looking for that full solution of hardware, software and services. That differentiated value proposition is enabling us to hold price at the country level, and we feel pretty good about that.","Tycho Peterson","And then, Gary, maybe just one follow-up on cash flow. I know you maintained guidance for the year. Can you maybe just talk to how you get there because it was down again this quarter? So are you assuming NWC kind of reverses? Or what kind of gets you to that full year cash flow based on what we've seen in the last two quarters?","Gary Bischoping","Yes. The second quarter is kind of what -- about what we thought in the trajectory of the cash flow for the year. We'll continue to see progress here in the second half with regard to inventory. And as we've talked about, we've talked about billings and inventory for the supply chain. You can see the strong revenue growth here, and so that will work its way through. And on the revenue side, the -- how the revenue flows in the quarter kind of has an impact in the quarter, but you catch that over time. So you'll see us kind of catch this increase in revenue growth with some nice collections in the second half of the year. So I think the teams are out there executing nicely through the supply chain. But yes, to directly answer your question, we see it coming back in net working capital as well as an increase in operating earnings half-over-half as well.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar","Maybe going back to the margin question, Dow. You gave out a number of moving parts in the Q. I mean it looks like there's incremental cost here, right? You have some benefits from tariffs, but there is more investments in the software piece, in the FlashForward, et cetera. When we think about the $48 million of savings, right, the tariff mitigation efforts, maybe can you talk about the cadence of when those savings are expected to hit? And is that more of Q4 weighted or Q3? And 80 bps impact on this Proton, is that going to come back in the back half?","Dow Wilson","Maybe let me kind of just start on that Q2 piece. Relative to the margin, right, in the Q2, as Gary said in his section, the single biggest piece was proton therapy. And so that was our biggest driver in the first half. Gary, do you want to pick up on the tariff point?","Gary Bischoping","Yes. Vijay, the timing of the tariffs, first of all, it's $42 million in mitigation, right? It was -- we talked about a $60 million down to $42 million. And the timing of the tariff mitigation efforts, as I referenced and we were referencing all year, is second half loaded. And even inside of the second half, will continue to ramp out of Q3 and into Q4 in terms of higher -- more benefit in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. So that's how we think about it. Teams are executing well out there in the field. As it relates to the proton, no cost and site delays in the second quarter. We think that's largely contained to the second quarter. I don't see it repeating in the second half, but we won't get that back in the second half, right? So that's part of how we think about the full year guidance is, we don't see us clawing that back in the second half, but it won't repeat in the second half.","Vijay Kumar","That's helpful, Gary. And just on the guidance as a follow-up. Any -- it looks like FX was worse. Any update on FX? I think the last guidance baked in some modest FX. Maybe it's coming in a little worse. So I guess the underlying growth may be coming in better? And I think the visibility on that $42 million of savings, the tariff mitigation, maybe can you just talk about the drivers here and your comfort level with that number?","Gary Bischoping","Yes. From a currency impact, no material change from what we guided to originally. If you look at rates kind of from when we guided to the start of the third quarter, there's no material change. There's a year-over-year impact that we called out but nothing really material to note versus guidance. As it relates to the tariff mitigation efforts, things are on track, and they're moving forward. I would say they're the things we talked about: commercialization, supply chain, our ability to get duties back out as some of those things are coming into the U.S., our ability to reroute how we think about invoicing on the commercial side. G&A productivity, you started to see that in the second quarter, right? G&A was only up 4% year-on-year, so you started to see scale out of the G&A line. We think that will continue in the second half. We'll continue to redeploy and reface some of our R&D investments, nothing against the major programs that are out there.","From a software perspective, we talked about an incremental investment in the software deployment capability, and that's to help to continue to drive that growth rate. You saw in the first half of the year, both in Q1 and Q2, our software revenue growth grew 14% in both quarters. And so we are looking for that investment to continue to help us grow that software business in the second half, which we like from a margin perspective. So all those mitigation efforts are in flight, and the teams are tracking to how we're operating and to deliver this guidance.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies.","Anthony Petrone","Maybe just a follow-up on margin, again unchanged here this year. And obviously there's some headwinds on the proton side. But just as you look out multiyear, next couple of years, and we start to get perhaps faster acceleration in bookings to revenue, margin benefits potentially from Halcyon and then a mix of software, over time, what are your thoughts on operating margin expansion next couple of years?","Gary Bischoping","Yes. Sure, Anthony. You hit on a lot of them already. We're continuing to march towards our aspiration of north of 20% operating margin. Clearly, the tariffs haven't helped us here. We outlined what that impact is here in fiscal year '19. That being said, the tailwinds that are running for us are software mix. You can see the accelerated growth rates there, twice what we experienced on the hardware side. Proton profitability, while still not back to operating breakeven like we talked about, but improving on a year-over-year basis. Halcyon mix will certainly help. We're starting to see that now. We saw that in the second quarter, becoming visible in the P&L. Continue to work through the upgrade cycles, we've put upgrade teams in place around the globe. They're continuing to execute well. And then we'll continue to work through the tale of the tariff mitigation. So as you think about kind of the next couple of years, that will help us continue to accrete up to that 20 points of operating earnings. Last point I would make is services certainly increasing on the installed base will be a nice tailwind as well.","Operator","We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.","Dow Wilson","Thank you. Per my previous comments, given the momentum in the business, we raised our revenue guidance. And in concert with that revenue raise, we've decided to reinvest in innovation primarily related to the FlashForward Consortium, and we remain on track to achieve our 2019 targets. Looking forward, we'll continue to execute on our growth initiatives and remain committed to investing in innovation and new technologies to drive toward the ultimate victory: a world without the fear of cancer.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Spencer Sias, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. ","Spencer Sias","Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Varian Medical Systems conference call for the third quarter of fiscal year 2014. With me are Dow Wilson, President and CEO; Elisha Finney, CFO; and Clarence Verhoef, our Corporate Controller. Dow and Elisha will summarize our results and we'll take your questions following the presentation.","To simplify our discussion, unless otherwise stated, all references to the quarter or year are fiscal quarters and fiscal years, quarterly comparisons are for the third quarter of fiscal 2014 versus the third quarter of fiscal 2013, references to the year-to-date or for the first three quarters of the fiscal year. ","Please be advised that this presentation and discussion contains forward-looking statements. Our use of words and phrases such as outlook, believe, can, expect, will, hope, and similar expressions are intended to identify those statements, which represents our current judgments on future performance or other future matters.","While we believe them to be reasonable based on information currently available to us, these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of the important risks relating to our business are described in our third quarter earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements in this presentation and discussion because of new information, future events, or otherwise.","Now, here is Dow.","Dow Wilson","Good afternoon and welcome. For the third quarter of 2014, we are reporting solid good order growth for our Imaging Components and proton businesses, some big wins in emerging markets as well as weakness in Japan for our Oncology Systems business, a 4% increase in our orders backlog, revenue and gross margin gains in all of our business segments and earnings in line with our expectations before the impairment of a portion of our existing investment in Augmenix. ","Compare to the year ago, revenues for the company rose 3% to $748 million, and net earnings were $1.02 per diluted share. The impacts of the approximately $8 million Augmenix impairment was about $0.06 per share. ","Oncology Systems' gross order came in at $620 million, down by 1% despite strong wins in key emerging markets including China, Latin America and in parts of Eastern Europe. Orders for Oncology were up by 2% in EMEA and about even in North America and down by 6% in Asia with a sharp decline in Japan where we faced tough year ago comparisons. Orders rose by 20% in China where we believe we are gaining market share. ","For the BRIC countries in total, orders grew by more than 50% during the quarter. Our business in Latin America grew by more than 30% in the quarter. We continue to generate new orders in Brazil, but have not yet booked any from the 80 machine public tender conducted in the first quarter of this fiscal year. ","In EMEA, Varian was selected to supply four TrueBeam systems for the Beatson Cancer Centre in Glasgow and its planned new satellite center at nearby Monklands hospital. We also had a key win in Germany where a hospital group placed an order to replace two of their eight Siemens machines with TrueBeam systems. This group also ordered our Eclipse treatment planning software and our ARIA oncology information software to replace their LANTIS network.","We continue to expand our business across Africa with orders in Algeria, Morocco, Libya, Nigeria and South Africa. North America generated strong order growth for service and software, while equipment orders were soft during the quarter. We had a big win in Nebraska at the Buffett Cancer Center which ordered our Edge Radiosurgery system, our TrueBeam system as well as treatment planning and oncology information software to replace competitive products. ","U.S. hospitals which today comprise about 90% of our North American equipment orders, we see positive reimbursement news at the end of the quarter. CMS has proposed a modest overall 2% increase in rates for calendar year 2015.","Hospital rates would rise for both radiotherapy and radiosurgery and a proposed new bundled rate for radiosurgery remains equal, whether the treatment is delivered with a LINAC or a Cobalt unit. All those being equal, I expect that machine versatility and patient throughput will become more and more important for buyers of radiosurgery systems. ","As an aside, a study conducted at the University of Alabama at Birmingham shows that RapidArc radiosurgery is substantially more efficient and comparable in plan quality to a competitive Cobalt system for treatment of multiple brain metastases. This study has been published online and is slated to appear in the October issue of Neurosurgery. ","We are generally pleased with the hospital reimbursement proposal which we hope will lead to further replacement of older systems with newer higher throughput units that are capable of delivering both video therapy and radiosurgery. ","For freestanding clinics, CMS is proposing a policy change to exclude the radiation treatment vault as a direct expense in the rate calculation. Rate reduction for conventional 3-D radiotherapy IMRT and SDRT would range between 2% to more than 6%.","We expect that this proposed policy change will be the topic of debate between now and November when CMS finalizes the rates for next year. We are partnering with others within the industry to advocate for reversal of this policy. ","Oncology Service was again a star performer, delivering another quarter of double-digit growth with particularly strong performance in North America. Service represented about 40% of oncology orders for the quarter and the year-to-date. ","On the product front, we have made good progress during the quarter in our software business which was particularly strong in North America. Orders ramped up for our FullScale solution that fully integrates our ARIA information system and our Eclipse treatment planning software in the cloud for hospitals and clinics of any size. ","Earlier today we announced the deployment of FullScale at e+CancerCare, a multi-site network of cancer clinics in the U.S. FullScale is also deployed at Vantage Oncology, a network of over 60 oncology centers. FullScale users are delighted with the speed, flexibility, scalability and accessibility of their data on smartphones and tablets, as well as computers.","At the annual meeting of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine, or AAPM, this week, we featured several products for quality assurance and sharing clinical knowledge through data analytics.","We exhibited a new software tool called Machine Performance Check for automating tests to help confirm that our tubing system is operating within proper parameters. It completes 18 tests in just five minutes and adds another level of competence for centers that are performing more and more sophisticated procedures.","We also showed Qumulate, a cloud-based data management tool for quality assurance as a works in progress. Clinicians will be able to use this tool to create templates for their QA processes, identify trends in QA data and compare their machines' test performance to the average of machines at other treatment centers. By using tools like this, we expect clinicians will be able to enhance the consistency and efficiency of their treatment processes.","Other products featured at the meeting included RapidPlan for knowledge-based treatment planning, our new Velocity tool for aggregating imaging and treatment data, and TrueBeam 2.0 which now includes enhanced image guidance and motion management capabilities to the TrueBeam platform.","Among the presentations at AAPM was a talk by researchers from Champalimaud Center in Portugal and the Henry Ford center in Detroit confirming that our Edge radiosurgery system can target cancerous tumors with sub-millimeter accuracy. Their end-to-end testing showed that our efforts to integrate multiple subsystems can result in a high level of precision for certain radiosurgery cases.","You may have seen a press release issued early in June about a 79-year old patient who chose RapidArc radiosurgery rather than conventional surgery for his lung cancer. He got five treatments on our TrueBeam surgery unit and each session was completed in about 10 minutes, a much easier alternative to surgery. It is both exciting and gratifying to all of us at Varian to see the dramatic improvements in treatment opportunities our innovations offer patients.","Let me turn to our Imaging Components segment. Gross orders for this segment increased 12% to $162 million, with strong growth in panels and tubes that was partially offset by soft demand for our security products. Gross orders grew in excess of 30% in our panel business. This included a contract with a large OEM in China for 1,000 panels that will be delivered over the next two years. ","Other X-ray equipment manufacturers are designing our panels into new imaging systems, setting the stage for continued growth in this product line. Healthy order growth in our X-ray tube product line was driven by our big OEM customers for use in CT scanners, general radiography, and mammography systems.","We are now focused on targeting new OEMs to expand the market and we shipped a number of new X-ray tubes for evaluation by these customers during the quarter. Our Imaging Components has built its backlog, as we assign more long term contracts for both panels and tubes. ","The company's Other category which is comprised of the Varian Particle Therapy business and Ginzton Technology Center recorded growth orders of $57 million in the third quarter.","During the quarter, our proton team booked its third order of the fiscal year to supply our ProBeam proton therapy system at the National Taiwan University. We expect the total value of the agreement is estimated to be about $100 million including long-term operations and maintenance services. We continue to see strong customer interest and good momentum in this business which is now booked nearly $120 million in gross orders so far this year. ","During the quarter JPMorgan assume $45 million of our approximately $125 million loan commitment to the Scripps proton project. We believe this is a mark of the growing confidence of the financial community has in our ProBeam proton solution. ","Scripps is continuing to expand the range of cancers that it is treating with this exciting and it has completed its first pediatric treatment on a 17-year old patient from Provo, Utah. She has been affected with the tumor on her brain stem for 15 years. She had numerous surgeries to control the spread of the tumor, but doctors could not completely eradicate it because it was too close to her brain stem. Further surgeries were not recommended, so she turned to proton therapy. Her hope is that the treatment ends the tumor once and for all. We hope so too. ","Now I will turn it over to Elisha. ","Elisha Finney ","Thanks, Dow, and hello everyone. While Dow has already covered gross orders, I want to briefly talk about the constant currency growth rates for the quarter. In comparing quarter-over-quarter exchange rates, the negative impact from weakening of the yen was more than offset by a positive impact from the strengthening of the euro and other currencies.","Oncology gross orders decreased 1% in dollars and 2% in constant currency. Oncology's North American gross orders were about even with the year ago quarter in dollars and constant currency.","EMEA gross orders increased 2% in dollars and declined 1% in constant currency. Asia, where we saw a quarter-over-quarter weakening of the yen was down 6% in dollars and down 5% from the year ago quarter in constant currency. Oncology orders in rest of world region fell by 19% in dollars and 17% in constant currency, driven by a slowdown in Australia.","Third quarter revenues for the total company increased 3% in dollars and 2% in constant currency. Year-to-date, total company revenues were also up 3% in dollars and 4% in constant currency.","Oncology Systems posted a 3% gain in revenues during the quarter, consistent with year-to-date growth of 3%. For the quarter and year-to-date, Oncology Service comprised about 40% of Oncology revenues. ","Imaging Components posted a third quarter revenue gain of 2% with double-digit growth in our flat panel products, largely offset by a decline in our X-ray tube products. Revenues were impacted by improved CT tube quality that has enabled our largest customers to lower inventory levels and delay purchases.","Year-to-date, Imaging Components revenues were up 4% from the year ago period, with double-digit growth in panels largely offset by declines in tubes and Security & Inspection products. ","Revenues in the Other category were up slightly from the year ago quarter. Year-to-date revenues were down from the year ago period when we recorded higher revenues from multiple proton projects.","Total company gross margin for the quarter was 43.3%, up 55 basis points from the year ago quarter. Year-to-date, total company gross margin was 43%, 58 basis points. Oncology Systems gross margin was 44.1%, up 38 basis points from the year ago quarter. Year-to-date, Oncology Systems gross margin was 43.9%, up 44 basis points. These gains are largely due to a mix shift towards higher margin software and service as well as improved quality costs.","Imaging Components gross margin for the quarter was 42.2%, up 125 basis points from the year ago quarter, with a shift to more higher margin panel sales and significant improvements in X-ray tubes quality costs. Year-to-date, Imaging Components gross margin was 41.7%, up 29 basis points from the year ago period due largely to improved quality costs in our X-ray tubes products. ","Third quarter SG&A expenses were $124 million or 17% of revenues. This included an approximate $8 million non-cash charge for the impairment of a portion of our existing equity investment in Augmenix. ","As a reminder, we invested in and obtained an option to acquire Augmenix three years ago. Augmenix is today announcing additional financing from multiple investors and the expiration of our option.","We recorded the impairment charge based on the current valuation of Augmenix. We continue to hold our minority interest in this company and see promise in their technology. ","The impairment charge increased SG&A as a percentage of revenue by one point. Year-to-date including the patent litigation charge in the second quarter and the impairment charge in the third quarter, SG&A expenses were 17% of revenue. These unusual charges together increased SG&A as a percentage of revenue by 1.5 point. ","Third quarter R&D expenses were $57 million or 8% of revenues, up 30 basis points as a percentage of revenue from the year ago quarter. Year-to-date, R&D expenses were also 8% of revenue, up 90 basis points from the year ago period as we continued to invest in our global strategies and execute on our product roadmap. ","Moving down the income statement, third quarter operating earnings including the impairment charge totaled $143 million or 19.1% of revenues. Year-to-date, operating earnings as a percentage of revenues were 18.4%, down about two points from the year ago period.","The impairment charge together with the patent litigation settlement in the second quarter accounted for 1.5 point of the two points decline in the year-to-date operating margin.","Depreciation and amortization totaled $15 million for the quarter and $46 million year-to-date. The effective tax rate was down two points from the year ago quarter to 25.5%. And year-to-date, the effective tax rate was down about half a point to 28.1%. ","Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased from the year ago quarter to $104.9 million, due largely to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted earnings per share was $1.02 for the third quarter. The impairment charge negatively impacted EPS in the quarter by about $0.06.","Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $926 million, debt of $480 million and stockholders' equity of $1.7 billion. DSO at 95, was up 11 days from the year ago quarter with an approximate eight-day impact from the proton therapy business, where deferred payments terms are not yet due, but revenue has been recognized under the percentage of completion method.","Third quarter cash flow from operations was $86 million, less than net income, primarily due to working capital increases in inventory and the payment of the Q2 patent litigation settlement.","Primary uses of cash were $103 million toward the repurchase of 1.25 million shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had 2.75 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2014.","Now, I will turn it back to Dow for the outlook.","Dow Wilson","Thanks, Elisha. We realize that our guidance range for Q4 is broad, the timing of our proton therapy projects is hard predict and any one deal can have a significant impact on our financials in a given quarter. ","We expect total company revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 to increase in the range of 7% to 15% and we expect net earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.14 to $1.29.","We are now ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will conduct our question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) ","Our first question comes from Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird. Please state the question.","Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Can you hear me okay?","Dow Wilson","Hi, Jeff. ","Elisha Finney","Hi.","Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Okay. Elisha, I wanted to start with you on the SG&A line, I appreciate that the last couple quarters there's been some non-recurring items in there, but I by exclude them including the $8 million charges this quarter, it looks like your SG&A this quarter hit and almost five-year high as a percentage of revenue definitely came in $7 million or $8 million hot relative to our expectations. So, just wondering if you could give us any insight on this SG&A costs.","Elisha Finney","Sure Jeff we get a lot of variability in SG&A from hedging and legal expenses and I would guesstimate it's about 60% fixed, 40% variable. I think it's better to look at year-to-date and if you come back to year-to-date as a percentage of revenue if you exclude the impairment and you exclude the University of Pittsburgh charge it's up 40 basis points.","So, that really was -- in our expectations for the year as we've noted both on R&D and SG&A, it's the year of investment. And so we\u2019re just expanding our global operations and that's where those 40 basis points come from.","But yes, if you look at any given quarter you\u2019re going to get variability. I think really it was more a factor of we had some proton revenue move out of the quarter and so as a percentage of revenue, it looks very high in Q3.","Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Okay. And that segues on to my question. I guess on the proton side, at one point you were talking about $100 million to $150 million in revenue this year. I think year-to-date you've done $23 million. So, hard to see even if you book Maryland and flow some of that revenue through that you get those targets. So, wondering maybe if you can address that? Number one.","And number two, if the cyclotron is now in at Maryland, I thought in the past you guys a talked about you wouldn't install the cyclotron unless financing was largely in place or fully in place. And so just wondering what the hang-up is still on either finance being in place there for that order officially being booked and those profits flowing through this year into the guidance. Thank you.","Elisha Finney","Sure. So, Jeff let me come back to your first question. So, I think as of the last time, I had tagged it at about $125 million that we have built-in to our revenue expectations for the year. Come off that a little bit just based on Q3 is closer to call it $110 million, $115 million for the year. And you\u2019re absolutely right; there is a significant portion of this $65 million, $70 million hedging on Maryland.","These tend to be very large projects and if a customer\u2019s date moves on when they're ready for equipment, we then obviously slowdown on building the inventory. That slows down the cost we\u2019ve incurred, which slows down the revenue. So, it's really just the timing of these can be very, very hard to predict.","That said it is just a matter of timing. We've had none of these are proton deals fall part and we're feeling very confident about that business in general. In terms of Maryland, again, we continue to be -- we're working closely with ATT our customer there. They\u2019re making good progress. They have completed their equity financing, working with several large institutions on the debt.","Thanks to stealing documents and it\u2019s the due diligence and the timing and the documentation, the timing is just so hard to predict, but we\u2019re absolutely committed to the viability of this project.","We did deliver the cyclotron. We have a large almost $20 million non-refundable down payment as well as we've retained his security interest in the equipment. So, again, we felt like it was the right thing to do to keep this project moving so that we can get this center out of the ground.","Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.","All right. Thanks. And just last question I was going to ask it, but with EBS change in the guidance by a few pennies coming down of the low end and JPMorgan taking that trench of the Scripps debt out. If memory serves that was a pretty high price debt that you guys had financed and were getting the benefit of an interest income. Does that explain the changing guidance or am I over-reading that?","Elisha Finney","No. It's really just one quarter that's coming out. So, it will have an impact. Hopefully, we\u2019re going to get to take that money that's indicated and redeploy it to another proton project and get our 8%, 9% interest back.","But Jeff if I look at where we were originally, 422 to 434 because we have the midpoint in Q3, it was right where in the middle of where we expected to land. We just came off $0.02 on the high end to reflect that. And then we broaden the range for protons just given as time goes on and we're incurring more cost of these things without is just a bigger impact to revenue. So, just gave ourselves a little more breathing room on the proton business, but it had nothing really to do with the debt syndication.","Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Please state your question.","Patrick Donnelly - JP Morgan Chase & Co.","This is actually Patrick Donnelly in for Tycho. Thanks for taking the question.","Dow Wilson","Hi Patrick.","Patrick Donnelly - JP Morgan Chase & Co.","Dow you talk about the CMS proposed rates from earlier this month and noted throughputs are going to become more important. We've also heard building discussion about clinical data. How you go about build out building clinical evidence on a different technology to show Varian is the best option? And how important do you view this?","Dow Wilson","Well, I think the -- first of all from an overall reimbursement point of view as mentioned in the script, we\u2019re positive about the hospital side. I think that's pretty good momentum for our market. That freestanding side as I mentioned is again we've got another year of pressure for freestanding. Largely due to a change in how the vault is calculated as an expense. And -- so between now and the final ruling on reimbursement, there will be a lot of activity around that which we will join.","In terms of clinical data, clinical data is very, very important. I think I mentioned UAV paper that will be published here this next month on stereotactic radiosurgery in the brain that will be a very nice paper for us. That will really demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of our machine.","And equivalency in terms of clinical outcome relative to cobalt-based brain radiosurgery. So, we're optimistic about that. I think the growing body of evidence in lung cancer is a big deal. We continue to see that grow literally almost every day. And I think that will be a theme at Astro both in the customer presentations clinical presentations at the show as well as some of the technologies that we're working on for the show.","In proton therapy, one of the things that we're seeing is a nice demonstration, especially of the benefit of proton therapy in head and neck, that's an emerging application with good clinical data forthcoming. And I think that will help boost some of the proton therapy efforts.","Patrick Donnelly - JP Morgan Chase & Co.","Thanks. And can you expand a bit more on China. I know you guys expected growth to see an uptick in the second half and certainly saw that with the 20% growth number you mentioned. Maybe just talk to those dynamics and how you expect growth to trend going forward?","Dow Wilson","Sure, may be for just a second I can step back to the overall emerging markets. Brazil, Russia, India, China, Africa for us we're up 70% in the quarter and are up 20% year-to-date. The BRICA now including Africa is about 15% of our oncology business.","And as I said in the script we've had double-digit growth this quarter in China, India, Eastern Europe, and Africa. Interesting in Africa, we had good orders performance in Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa, and Libya. So, we continue to seek the content move which is encouraging.","India was up 50% for us on the quarter and 35% year-to-date. So, that's kind of a nice story overall emerging markets. China itself to get your question, we had a very good quarter. China orders were up 20%. The market appears to be recovering. We\u2019re continuing to make a pretty substantial commercialization effort in that market. So, we began in earnest in 15 or 18 months ago.","And we have a terrific team in place right now. And I think we\u2019re really starting to make some nice headway in that market. We -- as I mentioned, the market is recovering and we also believe our share is improving in that market and we\u2019re seeing some nice success in the tender business there in China as well.","Patrick Donnelly - JP Morgan Chase & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions everyone. Dow I wonder if you could spend a minute talking about what you\u2019re hearing from customers in the U.S. particularly in hospitals about large equipment spending.","Software is doing well, service is doing well, equipment is not doing as well and it\u2019s clearly the on-market issue. Can you give us a sense for what you\u2019re hearing from the hospitals about how they\u2019re thinking about budgets and how they\u2019re evolving? What the impact of ACA has been so far this year? And your general thoughts on the market in North America? Thanks. ","Dow Wilson","You know, I would say the -- we continue to hear some of the things that we talked about continued consolidation of the market, people moving to more regional integration on the full provider side, hospital and non-hospital. So we are seeing regional consolidation there.","I think we've talked about the fact that deals are getting larger and more complex as a result. It does slow down a little bit the purchasing process. Freestanding market, as I mentioned in the script, is very quiet and an uncertain reimbursement environment. And I think that will continue on the hospital side.","Still very bullish about radiation therapy and the strong are investing and figuring out how to strengthen themselves. We see a continued attention given to total cost of ownership. I think that underscores our capability. We have the most versatile machine out there, and that people will look especially at cost of -- lifecycle ownership of their radiation therapy, we're very favorably positioned.","I'd say at a very high level hospitals are looking very hard at their capital budgets and we are -- there's been a lot of conversations about where the budgets goes. But I think still very favorable outlook in hospital market towards radiation therapy.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley","Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. Actually piggybacking on your comment about large orders, Elisha, have you given people a sense at this point for how the backlog in Oncology has evolved in terms of what fraction of the backlog is comprised of these large multi-year orders?","Elisha Finney","Not really, Steve. I mean, we do have several orders that have been announced that we have not yet booked. I mean, Brazil, obviously being the largest one in there or several in North America as well. So, we have very strict order booking guidelines. So if it doesn\u2019t have a two-year delivery window, it doesn\u2019t go into backlog. And if it's contingent on financing, it does go into backlog.","I think one thing, if you look at Oncology on a net basis in the quarter and year-to-date up 2%, so slightly different, I think we've gotten through a lot of the removable of these freestanding cancer centers where we had issue the last several quarters.","I just don\u2019t have it quantified, but we have several of these large deals that have not met the order booking guidelines as of today.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley","Got it. And Elisha could we get the percentage of net oncology orders that was North America?","Elisha Finney","That was North America was -- yes, up 6% on a net basis.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley","Perfect. Thanks so much everyone.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","Thank you again. Good afternoon. I wanted to come back to the guidance, make sure I understand what's implied in the 7%to 15% number for the fourth quarter. Am I reading this correctly that 7% basically excludes that $65 million and the 15% inclusive, that\u2019s basically the delta that I'm getting high to low?","Elisha Finney","Yes, David roughly. But don\u2019t hold me to an absolute dollar amount. But, yes, we would be at the high-end if we get the Maryland deal. We will be towards the low end if we don\u2019t. So that\u2019s kind of how -- that\u2019s why we are putting this -- it's just such a big number on a single deal that we felt like we have to give you the full range.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s perfectly understood. And then just as you think about the low end of the range, you haven\u2019t put a 7% growth number now and in basically since the second quarter of fiscal 2013. What are you seeing in the business that gives you confidence in seeing that acceleration in the fourth quarter, ex-proton, particularly when I look at the gross order numbers in the fourth quarter of last year being fairly sharply down year-over-year? ","Elisha Finney","Yeah. Well, again, I come back to, it's just a detailed look at what's in backlog and the fact that our service business continues to grow, our flat panel business which are short cycle businesses, which we saw very strong order growth in Q3 from both of those product lines, it's just coming back to what we expect to deliver out of backlog.","Oncology in terms of revenue has been spot on this year from forecast on looking at the backlog and what the revenue is going to be. So, I hear you, I understand you. But what it means is its still for 4% for Oncology for the year. So it's not like we are seeing huge high-single digit growth year-over-year. It's just how the quarters play out.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","Got it. And the last just on the imaging business, because that\u2019s been a really strong franchise for you, and maybe you could just go into little bit more detail on the comment you made on revenues impacted by, I think you said, improved CT quality.","And maybe just how we should think about that in the context of the business on a go forward basis and if you think that\u2019s going to have any appreciable impact relative to the strong growth rate we've seen over the past several quarters?","Dow Wilson","Maybe I can talk about the overall business and Elisha can talk about the two quality piece. Overall, first half of this year we had a little lighter growth rate, so we were really pleased to see the higher growth rate in Imaging Components business this quarter. Tubes were up 14%, flat panel was up 34% and then our security was quite substantially, so overall we were up 12%.","We continue to see digitization driving the flat panel piece. So we think that that growth will continue. On the tube quality side, one there is improvement in tube quality it tends to drive one time or gradual one-time adjustments in order rates. And I think that\u2019s what we've seen from some of our big customers, is that we've executed nice tube, it helps on a margin rate side. But it causes things to slow down little bit on the order rate side.","We might have another quarter of that -- two quarters of that as we go forward. But I think we will see it anniversary and move forward.","Elisha Finney","Yeah, and I would say, the tubes are just lasting significantly longer. So I think we are building some customer loyalty and satisfaction. And as Dow said, the gross margin the quarter was up 125 basis points, driven almost exclusively by -- and the tube margins were up I think 5 points in the quarter. So it does -- it hurts us on the revenue line, but it comes back at the gross margin level.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","Okay. That\u2019s helpful perspective. Thank you.","Dow Wilson","And it makes us tough to compete with. It makes tough to get out of there. So tube-like is good. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Hazan with SunTrust. Please state your question.","Amit Hazan - SunTrust","Hey, good afternoon guys. Can you hear me okay?","Dow Wilson","Yeah.","Amit Hazan - SunTrust","Great. Let me just start with a softer one first. I want to maybe ask on the software in U.S. market share side in particular. I wanted to be careful on how I asked because I know every company likes to say they are gaining share that Oncology is really no exception to that. But I want to try to understand what you are doing on the software side and on the Oncology IT side, maybe in particular FullScale and maybe RapidArc and things like that, new offerings. ","If that visibly helped you gain system market share at all yet, be it competitive conversion, the Greenfield units, and if you kind of how you see that going forward as well. How important the factor is that in the market right now?","","Dow Wilson","I would say it's helping us. We've always had a very strong position in treatment planning, our introduction of RapidArc really strengthen that business five year ago. The continued strength of our algorithms, our capabilities in treatment planning is a nice differentiator for us in the marketplace and we are demonstrating a leadership for there for sure. ","The ability to deliver the physician prescription in there and they just want to know that it happens, the QA happens, the delivery happens and then the record and verify and interaction with the EMR, all happens the way it's supposed to. That\u2019s really what the physician wants to care about, that\u2019s all seamless and integrated.","And I think we've got a very good position there. And I think that we are starting to see -- I think we've always had some benefit in treatment planning and we are starting to see some benefit from our Oncology Information System, our ARIA product as well as it impact hardware sales.","So, as I said in the script, we think our share in North America is up a little bit. So, to answer your question directly, I think that\u2019s part of it FullScale. People really like the virtualization of FullScale, going to the private cloud is a big deal, we've seen that in front of our large accounts.","We are starting to see that in kind of the next tier of accounts, folks you have 5 to 15 centers. I'd say the early adoption of FullScale has been folks that have -- customers that have more than a dozen accelerators. And what we've seen is that virtualization is driving our productivity story and our credibility story and I think we've got a nice position.","We've launched the product in China. It's not just helping us in the U.S., its helping us outside of the U.S. and we've got teams across the globe getting very excited about it and customers, I think, are taking notice.","Amit Hazan - SunTrust","It just -- two more quick questions. One, to follow-up on the orders comments in North America. And I had the similar question last quarter and I think it's pretty important to ask it again. From Oncology orders in North America, if I remove the service component from the quarter, it implies the non-service side, the unit side. It would be down way into the double-digits on what frankly was another not so hard comp.","So just trying to put that in context with your commentary, especially into quarter that you are seeing signs of recovery in the North American market, just does not seem to be the case in any way from the numbers that you are reporting on the actual system side.","So, I'm just trying to reconcile there was commentary that -- especially in your slide presentation which was your actually putting up in terms of unit -- implied unit numbers into North American market.","Elisha Finney","Yeah, so let me bring you back year-to-date again. I think it's more reflective of what's going on in the market and you get such volatility in any given quarter. Year-to-date North America is up 5%, international is up 2%. ","So it is true that the service year-to-date is up in the low-teens, so 13%, which means the rest of Oncology is down 1% to 2%. Service is driving the growth. So, yes, the rest of the business is down, but nowhere near double-digit. It's 1% or 2% year-to-date.","Amit Hazan - SunTrust","Okay. Fair enough. And then last one, still I have that -- this question at this point. I mean, I thought you guys are long time, I think during that time in terms of your ability to forecast revenue and earnings and then hitting or beating those targets, I've kind of witnessed, which is kind of a rather significant change between the Varian of several years ago that literally never missed the number.","And the Varian of today that I think it missed at least one number and more than half of the last quarter in the last couple of the years, I realized a lot of things going on and there is huge FX factor out there that\u2019s out of your control, that\u2019s hurt you in quarters in the last couple of years.","But I think maybe it\u2019s a proper time to ask you, what you think has changed within the company to cause that? And what you're doing maybe to change that, to be able to forecast more accurately and go back to maybe the Varian of old?","Elisha Finney","Yeah, so -- and I don\u2019t want to come up across defensive that I'm going to just start with we hit the high-end of our range in Q1, we hit the high-end of our range in Q2, we hit the midpoint of our range in Q3. So year-to-date, let's call it up a $0.01 from the range that we've given. ","In a word, Amit, it's proton. As the revenue starts to come to fruition in these proton deals, it is almost impossible on the timing. So that\u2019s why we are trying to guide with and without proton. It is just extremely difficult to predict with accuracy. So hear you, the sales mess was entirely proton in the third quarter, and, again, why we are putting this broad range on Q4 and the year. ","There is no change in how we are forecasting. I mean, the business is bigger, its complex. We have more software, which means we are trying to tie in exceptions. It's just a nature of the beast. But our forecasting, we try and go into is absolute much detailed as we can.","Dow Wilson","Yeah, and I would just echo that. The core business, our processes haven\u2019t changed. If anything they\u2019ve improved. And to at least Elisha's timing issue if Linac moved one day outside of the quarter that\u2019s basically a $0.01 share for us. So I think we've done really good job of managing our overall earnings and EPS forecasting.","Now, the revenue forecasting with protons is where it gets tough and that\u2019s what we had missed this quarter. ","Amit Hazan - SunTrust","Fair enough. I appreciate the commentary. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Petron with Jefferies. Please state your question.","Anthony Petron \u2013 Jefferies","Thanks guys and good afternoon. So how are you there? Just to start on Oncology for a second there. Dow, your comments last quarter talking about large orders that we initially signed with hospitals in the U.S., some of those Lenexa potentially could have booked this quarter and next quarter.","I'm just wondering if there is an update on -- actually if there was any orders that were signed in the fiscal second quarter that would book this quarter and how should we be thinking about that for the fourth quarter?","Dow Wilson","I think we -- as we mentioned last quarter, we continue to see large orders and yes we do see some move from quarter-to-quarter, but I think at this point now it equal. What moved from last quarter into this quarter and moves from this quarter into next quarter are different ones. So we do look at every one of these very hard.","But I would say in any given quarter depending on the size of an order it can move the number around, and that we don\u2019t guide to orders and its maybe predictability of orders forecasting a little bit tougher.","But we do continue to see large orders. These large orders contain complex equipment with multiple-year deliveries and little more complexity on that side of the order as people consolidate a couple of years' worth of purchases together, and then across multiple sites.","So we are seeing that. Yeah, in any given quarter it maybe goes one direction or the other. I think at this point it\u2019s at least coming into Q4. Yeah, there were some orders that we thought we would have booked at the end of Q3, we'd love to have them. Now they're going to happen in Q4. Those are going to be incremental to our number in Q4. I can look you in the eye and tell you one way or the other.","Anthony Petron \u2013 Jefferies","Right, right. And maybe just a quick follow-up and then a move over to proton. So is it safe to say your book-to-bill, clearly, has extended here the book-to-bill cycle. But is there any maybe number around about how much that\u2019s actually extended?","Dow Wilson","I think it\u2019s hard to tell, because of the continued globalization of the business. I'd say in the U.S. we probably are seeing the book-to-bill extend a little bit. But outside of the U.S., tender driven business -- once the tender is done people want their equipment.","Now, I haven't done the analytics, but I would say on balance its probably haven\u2019t changed that much. Elisha, any change to that?","Elisha Finney","No, I think that\u2019s correct.","Anthony Petron \u2013 Jefferies","And then just round that with protons just to stay on that -- the lumpiness. Maybe Dow and\/or Elisha, can you maybe give in a little bit as to actually where you are actually seeing the delays? I know these are complicated construction projects. These project delays are they financial delays or maybe something else that we are just not seeing from the outside looking in?","Elisha Finney","No, it just have to do with the timing of the projects. So if a date gets delayed when they are equipment by a quarter, then we are not going to build as much inventory quite as fast. And so we are not incurring the cost.","If we are waiting on a gantry that we purchased to deliver to go into our cost structure and that gantry hits in one quarter versus the other, it's just everything about protons is small number, great big dollar. And it just moves us from one quarter to the next.","Anthony Petron \u2013 Jefferies","And last one on proton and I will jump back in. Is -- we've been hearing a lot about single vault systems and you guys had the FDA approval for ProBeam. So was that playing out there in the marketplace? Is there more of a discussion on price and or some of these contracts maybe slowing down because they are considering single vault units et cetera. But maybe a little bit of color there would be helpful. Thanks. ","Dow Wilson","Yeah, I think the -- we've had pretty good year so far. We've booked three systems this year. There is -- we are competing on a large number of projects. So we continue to feel poorly bullish that the proton business can be $200 million to $300 million business for us. There is noise about compact machines. We have our own probing the compact machine. We've got several customers looking at that machine. It has several advantages. It's the only compact machine on the market with full 360 degree rotational gantry capability and it's got the best intensity modulated proton therapy capability which over at the PT cog, the Proton Therapy Meeting in Shanghai last month that was all the news.","It felt a little bit like to 2000, 2001 and IMRT. And we feel very good about our position with that capability and a short version is the feedback from customers is multi-room or single room, don't want to do proton therapy with outstanding capability.","And -- so we feel great about our position there. We have not seen a lot of growth in that compactor room market yet. There's others that got some early share maybe a year or two ago, but there hasn't been a big increase in recent orders because people want scanned beam technology and until there\u2019s scanned beam option in that market, it\u2019s not going to grow and that's why we feel very good about our position. We do have scanned beam capability with that probing compact product. And we\u2019re in discussions with a few customers about worldwide about taking on that product. ","Anthony Petron \u2013 Jefferies","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with ISI Group. Please state your question.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group","Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess my first one, Dow, you guys have been talking about this replacement cycle in the U.S., so can you just sort of talk to us because I think some of the signs that we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re seeing utilization pick up. I think some of the commentary from to hospitals is sounding more positive. They do you feel like the pursing to loosening up. So, if these trends were to play out, do you feel like the replacement cycle is finally going to happen and can be get more comfortable more positive on the timing?","Dow Wilson","I think the challenges the freestanding market. The hospital replacement market, I think as we said, there is now 90% of our oncology orders is the U.S. hospital market. The freestanding centers as a percentage of installed base, it's a strong third of the U.S. installed base. And they are not replacing. That replacement market is very, very quiet.","And until we see some movement there, I think -- the good news is the hospital market is moving and we're seeing some nice action on the hospital side. But we\u2019re -- that's not enough to offset the one-third of the installed base that's the freestanding market. And that one third is at least at this point very quiet replacement cycle.","I think the that to happen, we would need to see some movement in reimbursements and as I mentioned in the call that's why there's a lot of consensus and activity going on around getting this vault calculation back in the reimbursement scenario for freestanding customers.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group","That was helpful, and maybe one for Elisha. You guys have probably been one of the most balanced cap room -- very shareholder friendly. You've done all the actions right. And so I guess if you\u2019re looking at this new environment right Elisha to Dow's point, if the freestanding centers remain anemic, what else can you do from the balance sheet capability like have you guys thought about additional avenues, create shareholder value.","Elisha Finney","VK, I'm not exactly where sure you're going with this. We\u2019re using our balance sheet strategically to go in and offer financing and it's on a fairly limited basis. We don't want to go crazy with this.","When we can win business by offering terms in a zero interest rate environment, we\u2019re doing that. I think we've got the ability to step-up a lot more in terms of our proton financing. I don't know that we\u2019ll do like we did at Scripps on our first one when we essentially financed at all until it was built or the vast majority.","But I do anticipate that we\u2019re going to participate in these proton projects to some extent going forward. We\u2019ll continue to spend more than our cash flow from operations in the U.S. on share repurchase.","We've got 1 million to 2 million shares per quarter and I think you should expect that at least in the short-term that should continue. But if you were going -- because I don't think we\u2019re going to actually buy or invest in customer-centered and then be competing with our other customers.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group","Got it. And maybe if I could speak one last one in. On the tax rate Elisha what are your thoughts longer-term tax structure?","Elisha Finney","Well, we've been able to bring the tax rate down over the last several years by I don\u2019t know 50 basis points to 100 basis points a year. Right now it\u2019s going to kind of depend in the short-term on whether this R&D tax credit gets extended or not.","But as we\u2019re selling more international all things equal that helps on the tax rate. So, I think for the fiscal year, we\u2019ll be around 28%. If I look back several years ago, we were in the low to mid-30. So, we\u2019re taking down as we become more and more international all things equal.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group","Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Wittes with Brean Capital. Please state your question.","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC","Hi, thanks for fitting me in. I wanted to ask about proton revenues and recognition. I think what you said earlier was roughly beginning of your thinking about $100 million to $150 million of proton revenue this year and I think assuming looking at Maryland it\u2019s going to fall in the $110 million to $115 million range. Does that mean that roughly $20 million to $25 million or so revenues that we should have seen this year was just getting pushed into next year, mainly because of project delays and things like that? That's the right way to think about it?","Elisha Finney","Yes.","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC","And I mean specifically which projects, I assume everything that's ongoing right now has seen some kind of small delay and that's what's contributed to this?","Dow Wilson","We\u2019ve got eight or nine in the backlog and I\u2019d say four or five are impacting the number.","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC","Four and five that are basically started construction?","Dow Wilson","Yeah, started to recognize revenue. ","Elisha Finney","Recognize, yeah.","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC","Okay. And then it sounds like with some refinancing from Scripps, you can use that for of the projects and perhaps even like a Maryland use that to push -- get them over the gap in terms of financing and then recognize revenues. Is that a reasonable assumption to look at it that way?","Elisha Finney","That is a distinct possibility. And if you should assume that on -- we will likely be in the facility at some level. But not -- I don't expect at this point that we would be a majority participant.","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC","It sounds like that would be enough potentially to bridge them over the gap and allow you to recognize revenue hopefully.","Elisha Finney","Hopefully.","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC","Hopefully, fair enough. And then I just wanted to ask about -- I read your comments -- I think your commentary was pretty accurate pretty much in line with everybody else is thinking in terms of reimbursement.","The hospitals look like they are up slightly. The freestanding clinics again took a hit. I guess the question is I assume that will basically stall anything going on as a freestanding clinics in purchasing until things are decided November, but also to we have a risk--","Dow Wilson","Jason the only thing I'd say that does not stalls anything, because it's already installed.","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC","I was going to put the distinction and that's a fair -- I agree with that. But curious if there's something in the backlog that could potentially be written down as we saw at the beginning of last year or the end of last year. Just because there may be a big contract in there that could be impacted by-- ","Dow Wilson","We look at a very hard every quarter now. We\u2019re very comfortable with our order booking guidelines.","Elisha Finney","I can't predict cancellations. That should something we have to take as they come.","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC","Fair enough. And then just one last question on Proton. There was a question about single room centers which appear to be emerging. I guess if you look over the next two years, do you see them playing an important role in the market itself or do you still think that the focus is going to be in the larger three or five room centers?","Dow Wilson","I think focus is going to be -- link this to previous question is going to can you demonstrate the clinical evidence to the advantage of proton therapy and to really get that you need good intensity modulated proton therapy. And therefore, you got to have hand beam technology and that's what people are going to be looking at.","Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC","Okay, that's fair. I appreciate that. Okay. Thanks a lot guys. I appreciate it.","Dow Wilson","We have time for one more question. We\u2019re over the top. But I'm sorry we couldn't get to everybody, but this will be the last question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today comes from Jeremy Feffer with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please state your question.","Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.","Good afternoon guys, thank you for squeezing me in. Most of my questions have been answered. I will just ask this one follow-up to a previous question about service versus systems within oncology. You mentioned system is being down, is that more units or come in a little bit on the pricing dynamics going on?","Elisha Finney","It's really more a reflection of units. The pricing is a hard question to answer because for instance if it's a TrueBeam versus a unique it's very, very different pricing. But I would say apples-to-apples, machine-to-machine pricing is holding.","Dow Wilson","You can see that in the margin rate.","Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.","Okay. And so last one -- squeeze last one in. You talked about this obviously is an investment year. I know we're not talking about 2015 guidance just yet, I\u2019m just wondering how we think about I guess in general terms margin performance going forward. Can we expect small bits of leverage obviously correcting for variations in proton, but just in the core business, can be expect some -- little margin expansion over time?","Dow Wilson","In 90 days.","Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.","I want to know now.","Elisha Finney","Not guidance Jeremy, but I mean I\u2019d we\u2019re going to try and manage to get a small amount of leverage. We're kind of at the top when it comes to our EBIT margin relative to the medical device space. And so -- but we\u2019re going to manage for incremental improvement. But generally by growing corporate expenses slower than we grow the topline.","Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.","Okay. Appreciate that. Thank you very much.","Dow Wilson","Thanks all.

Today, I'll share the key milestones we achieved this past quarter and year, and how they have contributed to our long-term growth and value creation strategy, as well as provide our outlook for the upcoming fiscal year. ","Looking back, this is the second consecutive fiscal year Varian has reported double-digit revenue growth and 9% oncology orders growth. Our core business is strong than ever and being powered by our continuous innovation. As one proof point, our North American market delivered a strong growth quarter with 10% orders growth and trailing 12-months growth of 8% in the face of uncertainty around the alternative payment model. We were able to successfully manage through a tariff environment, executing and mitigating actions throughout the year and improving operating earnings as a percentage of revenues from 16.2% in the first quarter to 18.1% in the fourth quarter. We have strong momentum, executing our fourth quarter in our core businesses and our acquisitions are delivering on growth expectations. Our strategy is delivering value to patients, clinicians and our shareholders.","Now let me touch on our fourth quarter and full year performance. Total revenues of $879 million increased 10%. This was driven by robust oncology revenue growth of 8%. On a full year basis, total revenues of $3.2 billion grew 10%. Operating earnings of $159 million or 18.1% of revenues grew 13%. For the full year, operating earnings of $542 million or 16.8% of revenues grew 6%.","GAAP earnings per share of $0.97 declined 23%, while non-GAAP EPS of $1.21 grew 4%. For the full year, GAAP EPS of $3.38 grew 109% and non-GAAP EPS of $4.63 grew 5%.","Cash flows from operations were $118 million, up 9%. For the full year, cash flows from operations were $372 million, down 18%. In the fourth quarter, we are pleased to receive tariff exclusions from both the United States Trade Representative or USTR for component sourced from China and from China for tariffs imposed on medical linear accelerators. Gary will discuss the net impact of these exclusions in more detail.","Our progress towards becoming the global leader in multidisciplinary cancer care solutions is powered by our focus on executing on our four strategic enablers for customers and their patient: First, innovating in radiation therapy. Second, leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning and cloud-based solutions. Third, growing emerging businesses and technologies. And fourth, improving operational, financial and capital efficiency.","First, let's review our progress on innovating in radiation therapy. We continue to widen the gap in the radiation therapy market with our innovation cycle, industry-leading net promoter score and new services offerings from Cancer Treatment Services International or CTSI, all of which are driving our sustained worldwide market share leadership. This was evidenced by our fourth quarter and 2019 orders revenues and unit volumes for hardware, software and services, all hitting new record highs. Our key growth markets of India and China continued to deliver strong growth both in the quarter and over the trailing 12 months. In China specifically, we're now seeing an uptick in incremental licenses and expect the momentum to continue into fiscal 2020. At ASTRO we had over 1,100 customers at our Users Meeting and unveiled multiple new innovations including Ethos therapy and multi-room ProBeam 360.","In the oncology business, our worldwide net installed base of 8,496 units grew 439 units or 5% in the fiscal year. Each net new socket of course represents meaningful future revenues from software, services, upgrades and most importantly more patients\u2019 lives touched. This year both Eclipse and TrueBeam Varian\u2019s key radiotherapy solutions were recognized as category leaders by KLAS, an independent research firm specializing in monitoring and reporting on the performance of healthcare vendors.","Hardware revenues grew 8% for the quarter and 13% for the full year. We manufactured the 3,000 TrueBeam and received orders for over 200 systems in the fourth quarter. Fiscal year 2019 was a record year on both orders and revenues for TrueBeam. Halcyon orders grew 30% to 114 in the quarter, of which 65% were taken in emerging markets. We have now taken 398 orders of Halcyon since its May 2017 launch. The global installed base is now up to 116 systems with continued exceptional customer feedback. Halcyon sales have successfully ramped since launch and moving forward we will not provide specific Halcyon order and installed base details.","As mentioned earlier, Ethos therapy was unveiled in mid September at the ASTRO Trade Show in Chicago, during which over 450 customers received in depth workflow demonstrations, and over 7,000 trade show attendees were introduced to the new system. Ethos therapy unlocks the ability to deliver on-couch adaptive radiation therapy treatments, using artificial intelligence and multi-modality imaging in a standard 15 minute treatment time slot, enabling new possibilities in targeted personalized radiation therapy delivery. ","During the quarter, we received 17 orders for Ethos including 11 new systems and six conversions in Europe and Australia highlighting strong demand and market excitement for the system. Ethos is CE Mark registered and 510 (k) pending. Orders from brachytherapy afterloaders grew over 40% to 112 in fiscal year 2019. Our global brachytherapy installed base is now 1,161 systems. Last year, we launched our new Bravos afterloader and the customer uptake has been extraordinary. ","For example, this quarter, the Karolinska University Hospital Solna in Sweden, became the first Hospital in Scandinavia to deliver high dose rate brachytherapy treatments using the new Bravos afterloader. This integrated system is designed to improve the patient and clinical experience by simplifying brachytherapy treatment and providing greater workflow efficiency.","On the software front, we remain focused on investing in innovation to capitalize on evolving market needs with emphasis on efficient clinical workflow, systems integration and treatment planning quality to help close the current resource and the skills gap around the globe. This innovation has led to software growth of 12% for the quarter and 16% for the full year. This quarter Varian was selected to supply Eclipse Treatment Planning software and ARIA Oncology Information System to three radiotherapy centers in Serbia. The Varian solution will replace competitive solutions at three important luminary centers there. We also won our first big software tender in China this quarter at Tianjin Tumor Hospital that includes ARIA China Clinical Information platform, a localized software for China language and workflow. ","Orders for HyperArc, our high definition radiotherapy solution for stereotactic radiosurgery grew double-digits in the quarter. We've now taken over 300 orders for HyperArc since its August 2017 launch. Orders for Eclipse MCO or Multi Criteria Optimization planning software grew double-digits in the quarter and we've now received over 1,400 MCO orders. ","Our services revenues grew 7% for the quarter and 5% for the full year driven by our growing installed base. The strength of our services offerings was validated in IMV\u2019s 2019 U.S. service track report, in which we ranked first in the industry in net promoter score. This score represents the likelihood that a customer would recommend a manufacturer to a colleague and we're honored once again to lead this customer loyalty metric with a score of 78% as compared with the nearest competitor at 25%. ","Finally, we acquired CTSI in physical 2019 to further strengthen our core and power new technology enabled services. We are currently investing in the build out of these services that will drive mature market productivity and the emerging market adoption. CTSI is now successfully integrated into our Oncology Systems business. In our Proton Solutions business we took one new order in the fourth quarter for a total of four proton orders in the fiscal year. We now have a total of 82 proton orders under contract across 27 sites globally. 41 rooms are currently operational including 6 rooms which were handed over to clinical operations this quarter. ","The New York Proton Center treated its first patients on Variance ProBeam Proton Therapy System. NYPC is New York State's first proton therapy facility and is a collaboration between Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Montefiore Health System and Mount Sinai Health System. NYPC is anticipated to treat 1,400 patients annually, including pediatric patients, another highly complex disease size, delivering the most advanced form of cancer radiation treatment currently available.","In the fourth quarter, we booked an order from Ohio State University to equip a new multi-room proton therapy center in Central Ohio with the ProBeam 360 system. This new proton facility is a collaboration between Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer, Arthur James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute and Nationwide Children's Hospital. The facility will treat both adult and pediatric cancer patients and is scheduled for completion in early 2023. ","Subsequent to the close of the quarter, we were selected by Penn Medicine to install, and additional Varian ProBeam 360 single-room configuration at their new cancer treatment center. The selection of Varian system as part of Penn Medicine's ongoing strategy is providing innovative technologies in the communities it serves through a multi-disciplinary cancer care model. Construction of the new center began in September 2019, with first patient treatments expected in 2021.","We're honored to be chosen as partners that these luminary institutions, providing innovative proton technologies that further advance clinical capabilities with particle therapy treatments.","At ASTRO, we launched the multi-room configuration for the ProBeam 360 proton therapy system. The ProBeam 360 system is the smallest multi-room system available today and offers an optimized human centered design, efficient patient workflow, superior total cost of ownership and the viable path to potential next-generation treatments such as FLASH therapy. ","In October last year, we announced the formation of the FlashForward Consortium to study potentially groundbreaking ultrahigh dose rate cancer treatments with protons. FlashForward Consortium in efforts to understand the mechanism of action continued to gather steam. We have added numerous milestone achievements this past year, key results were presented at AACR, ASTRO, AAPM, PTCOG and ISRS annual meetings, all important trade shows in our industry. We demonstrated the first use of an integrated treatment planning and treatment delivery system for FLASH using protons. We also gained early insights into the biology of how FLASH works, including the impact on the immune system, the role of oxygen in normal tissue protection of ultrahigh dose rates and the impact of FLASH on both tumor and normal tissues in preclinical models. ","The support from the academic and medical community has been encouraging as we look forward to bringing FLASH therapy to patients. We will continue to work with our partners worldwide to ensure a safe, integrated and effective treatment modality.","Second, let's turn for our progress in leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning and cloud solutions. Artificial intelligence powers our new Ethos therapy system, enabling the use of multimodality images such as MR, PET, CT and daily iterative cone-beam CT images at the treatment console. Clinicians can now better visualize changes to anatomy, adopting a normal treatment slot, personalized dose and ultimately deliver better treatment to every patient. We've received an order for 60 Ethos therapy solutions for Amsterdam UMC in the Netherlands. This is just one of many exciting examples of luminary customers globally who has chosen Ethos. To further accelerate momentum, we have established an Adaptive Intelligence Consortium comprised of leading institutions globally who will be working to generate clinical and technical evidence showing the differentiation of the Ethos therapy. ","Orders for RapidPlan, our individualized treatment planning software that was launched five years ago and is the first machine learning application in the field of radiation oncology grew double-digits in the quarter. We've now taken over 2,500 orders for RapidPlan to-date and installed over 1,800 licenses at 660 customer locations.","This year we made substantial progress in the deployment of Noona, our software application for managing patient symptoms and capturing patient reported outcomes in cancer care to our partnership with Tennessee Oncology. Noona is being deployed at over 30 centers across Tennessee and reaching over 20,000 new patients per year. Additionally, we are involved in 19 cancer programs in the State of Michigan through our partnership with Michigan Oncology Quality Consortium. Once deployed across 19 centers in Michigan, Noona will reach close to 22,000 additional new cancer cases per year.","Third, let's discuss emerging businesses and technologies. This fiscal year we made significant strides in growing our addressable market through acquisitions outside our core. We entered the fast rolling interventional oncology markets through the acquisitions of Endocare, Alicon and the asset purchase of Boston Scientific\u2019s microspheres portfolio. The interventional oncology market is expected to grow from $860 million this year to $1.1 billion in 2022. We see meaningful value creation opportunities between our businesses specifically through the combination -- through combination therapies and leveraging our software platforms that will touch more patients and maximize outcomes. ","This month we showcased our Interventional Oncology Solutions at the symposium on Clinical Interventional Oncology in Miami, Florida. We remain deeply committed to the ongoing development of innovative treatment solutions for clinicians offering ablation and embolization services to patients. Interventional oncology revenues were [$70 million] in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. This is our second quarter reporting revenues from interventional oncology business under the other segment. Interventional oncology revenues represent sales for our cryoablation embolic microspheres and microwave ablation portfolio. ","Additionally, we continue to invest in the development of our cardiac radioablation technology. We're building out a team and creating a clinical consortium to assist with our product development and clinical trial strategies. Overall, we are pleased with the company's performance in the fourth quarter and the full year. ","I'll now turn it over to Gary, who will discuss our fourth strategic enabler and provide more context on the fourth quarter and full year financial results.","Gary Bischoping","Thanks, Dow, and hello, everyone. Our fourth strategic enabler of improving financial operational and capital efficiency requires maintaining a balance between growth, profitability and liquidity over time. ","Let me start with growth. Companywide revenues were $879 million in the fourth quarter, up 10% or 11% in constant currency. Full year revenues of $3.2 billion were up 10% or 12% in constant currency. Organic revenues which excludes the year-over-year impact of FX and growth from the acquisitions of CTSI, Endocare, Alicon and Boston Scientific B portfolio grew 11%. ","In oncology, revenues were $820 million up 8% or 9% in constant currency driven by robust growth across hardware, software and services. CTSI contributed $17 million revenues in the quarter. For the full year oncology revenues grew 11% or 13% in constant currency. Orders were $1.1 billion, up 7% year-on-year and in constant currency. For the full year orders grew 9% or 11% in constant currency to $3.4 billion. We ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in backlog, up 7%.","Our orders mix for the full year was approximately 48% in the Americas, 33% in EMEIA, and 19% in APAC and less than 1% from CTSI based on timing of acquisitions close in June 2019.","Taking a closer look at our oncology business results. In the Americas, revenues grew 2% in the quarter and 7% for the full year. Revenues in North America grew 3% in the quarter and 7% for the full year. Orders of $559 million grew 11% in the quarter, driven by strength across our portfolio, which is ideally positioned for a value-based care environment. The full year orders in the Americas grew 7% with 8% growth in North America.","In the quarter, we received a multiyear commitment for 10 TrueBeam systems, in-associate software from the University of Rochester. Approximately $11 million was booked in the fourth quarter. Also we received $25 million order from 21st Century Oncology for replacement of accelerators across their network.","In our Europe, Middle East, India and Africa geography, revenues grew 6% in the quarter and 13% for the year. Orders were $396 million in the quarter, increasing 10%. For the full year, orders grew 12%. Robust growth in EMEIA was driven in part by orders for 13 TrueBeam systems as part of the Tata Trusts Framework Agreement as well as regional performance in Southeast Europe and CTSI services.","Asia Pacific revenues grew 30% in the quarter and 14% for the full year. Orders were $182 million in the quarter, decreasing 9% for the full year, orders grew 9%. The challenging quarter in Japan was partially offset by growth in China, Southeast Asia and Korea. In China we remain the market leaders and continue to see strong demand for our entire portfolio of solutions, including 10 Halcyon orders in the fourth quarter. Our Southeast Asia and Korea geography continue to be a growth driver. We've received orders for four VitalBeam systems in Korea and sold the first HyperArc system in Singapore and Hong Kong during the fourth quarter. ","Our Proton Solutions business posted revenues of $42 million in the quarter, a decline of 9% compared with last year. For the full year, revenues were $144 million, down 3%.","Turning to profitability, total company gross margin of 45.2% of revenues increased 270 basis points, driven by our oncology business, where we continue to see solid revenue growth across the portfolio. For the full year, gross margin rate decreased 70 basis points to 43.1%. Oncology fourth quarter gross margin of 45.5% of revenues increased 160 basis points driven by advantage from tariff exclusion, increased Halcyon and software volume and increased services revenues from installed base growth and the CTSI acquisition.","Full year oncology gross margin decreased by 110 basis points to 44.4%, driven by tariffs impact, regional shift to emerging markets and higher software contract costs due to increased upgrade activity in fiscal 2019. ","Looking at Proton Solutions, fourth quarter gross margin dollars were $11 million, up $2 million. Full year gross margin dollars were down 13%, primarily driven by timing of orders. Investments will continue to be a key driver of our long-term growth and value creation strategy. In the quarter, R&D investment of $65 million was up 9% at 7.4% of revenues. R&D expenses for the full year were $248 million, up 6% and representing 7% of revenues. R&D spend this year was driven by investments in software, adaptive radiotherapy\/and other strategic innovation programs. ","In the quarter SG&A expenses were $173 million or 19.6% of revenues, up 220 basis points as a percent of revenues, primarily driven by recent acquisitions, expenses triggered by the tariff benefit and the September 2019 ASTRO event, which did not occur in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. ","For the full year SG&A expenses were $601 million or 18.6% of revenues, up 40 basis points as a percent of revenues. The increase was primarily driven by recent acquisitions and having to ASTRO events in one fiscal year. Company operating earnings were $159 million or 18.1% of revenues, increasing 13%. For the full year, operating earnings were $542 million or 16.8% of revenues, increased 6%. ","Turning to taxes. For the full year, our GAAP effective tax rate was 29.3% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22.9%. The non-GAAP tax rate was higher than anticipated in our original guidance and primarily driven by updates to the estimated impact of the Global Intangible Low Tax Income or GILTI and Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax or BEAT provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The negative impact to earnings per share related to the update in tax rate was approximately $0.08. ","GAAP EPS was $0.97 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.21 with related diluted share count of 91.7 million shares in the quarter. We are pleased to note that our acquisitions performed above our business case expectations in the fourth quarter. For the full year, GAAP EPS was $3.38, and non-GAAP EPS was $4.63, up 5%. ","As Dow mentioned, we are very pleased to receive two tariff exclusions in the fourth quarter. The exclusions had a $21 million benefit to revenues, a $4 million benefit to cost of revenues and triggered a $2 million expense due to receiving the exclusion in China. The net benefit to operating earnings was $23 million or $0.19 on a non-GAAP earnings per share basis. ","The net benefit was mostly offset by the increase in tax rate previously mentioned and expenses related to annual discretionary contributions to U.S. based foundations that independently fund research and training. Additionally, operational spend in our core businesses came in above expectations although this higher spend was partially offset by early momentum in our recent acquisitions. ","Incrementally, the company did not record approximately $11 million of potential tariff refund in the fourth quarter due to timing of recognition. We expect to recognize this benefit in fiscal 2020. ","Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity, we ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $531 million and $412 million in debt. Cash flows from operations were $372 million for the fiscal year, down 18% due to higher working capital to support product transitions and growth. Oncology DSO was 109 days in the year, 7 days higher than last year due to strong revenue momentum. ","In addition to R&D other investments in the quarter included $14 million in CapEx and $32 million to repurchase shares of our stock. As of the end of the year, we had 2.2 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. ","I will now turn it back over to Dow, who will discuss our fiscal year 2020 annual guidance. ","Dow Wilson","Thanks, Gary. Before turning to guidance, I'd like to share with you the changes announced regarding our leadership team. Earlier this year we combined the recently acquired businesses of Endocare, Alicon, and the microsphere and bland embolic bead assets from Boston Scientific to create our Interventional Oncology Solutions business under the Chief Growth Officer putting to Kolleen Kennedy, President Proton Solutions and Chief Growth Officer. Based on the success of the integration and the robust performance by our Interventional Oncology Solutions business, it\u2019s a right time to move this new business from the incubation stage under the Chief Growth Office. Effective December 31, 2019, Gary Bischoping, currently Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Finance Officer, will take down a new role as President Interventional Oncology Solutions. Mike Bruff, currently, Senior Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations will succeed Gary as Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Both executives will report directly to me. Kolleen will continue in the role as President Proton Solutions and Chief Growth Officer, in which capacity she will focus on incubating emerging technologies including FLASH therapy and cardiac radioablation as well as leading our acquisition integration office. As Varian continues to evolve and grow, our deep bench of leadership capabilities across the organization will help propel our business to success in both the near and long-term.","And now, looking forward to fiscal year 2020, our guidance continues to consider the projected market growth and momentum of our products and solutions in the market. Our fiscal year 2020 guidance considers the recently announced tariff exclusions from both China and U.S. trade representative. Expecting to continue our strong operational performance, the company plans to invest in our growth initiatives, including: driving core business growth in China, fueling growth of our recent acquisitions by building out global sales and distribution capacity and touching more patients by ramping research and development investments in technology enabled services, FLASH technology, our Noona patient reported outcome offering and cloud-based software. Continuing to invest in meaningful innovation, go-to-market capabilities and scalable infrastructure is aligned with our commitment to drive long-term growth for shareholders.","After careful consideration of these assumptions, we expect the following for fiscal year 2020: ","Revenue of $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion, representing growth of 9% to 12%. Non-GAAP operating earnings as a percentage of revenues of 17.5% to 18.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $5.30 to $5.45. Cash flows from operations of $450 million to $500 million. The guidance assumes a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 22.5% to 23.5% and a weighted-average diluted share count of $92 million. The guidance also assumes currency rates as of the beginning of fiscal year 2020, includes acquisitions announced to-date and includes the expected impact of all currently enacted tariffs. ","Thank you. And now let's go to Q&A. Operator?","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Matt Taylor, UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Matt Taylor","So, I think the question is probably most top of mind for folks is, you had very strong order here in the quarter where I think a lot of investors expected that there to could be some uncertainty in the U.S. Can you talk a little bit about the dynamics that drove that order growth to be so strong especially in North America?","Dow Wilson","Yes, I think there's a number of factors here, Matt. First of all, we're very pleased, as you heard on the call our 12 months North America oncology orders grew from 6% to 8% on very strong growth in the quarter. A number of factors. One, I think everybody kind of overestimates the impact of these things a little bit in the short-term. As we said last quarter, we thought we had a very good funnel coming into the quarter. Second, I'd say overall, our portfolio is very well positioned for a value based market. So I think we've got the best portfolio, room for expensive niche products is not exactly the best position. We saw some Ethos volume and that's global, that's not U.S. impact, I want to make that point. We saw the good U.S. volume despite not having Ethos yet to sell, we don't have 510(k) approval should see it towards the late end of this year, maybe early in January and that's good. So funnel remains strong, product portfolio is great and I think the portfolio is very well lined up for the market and maybe the last thing I would add is you heard that really outstanding results of our software business both in the quarter and the year. That is very much at this point developed market growth. We are starting to see, you heard me mention the nice order in China, it\u2019s the biggest software order we've ever received in China. So we've localized that product. Yes, I mean speaking Chinese is one thing but getting the right workflow and the right interfaces and responding to the customer needs in China is a big deal as well and I really like what the team has done there. So think that product is positioned for continued growth both in developed and developing markets. ","Matt Taylor","Maybe, if I can just ask one follow up on the orders. It was nice to see Ethos pretty strong out of the gate there. Can you talk about the funnel for that, any reception or feedback that you got when you launched it at ASTRO and how we should expect that to resonate and take off in this kind of environment? ","Dow Wilson","The ASTRO launch was terrific. We just launched it as I said in the call middle of September. So we kind of had really only five or six weeks to fill it in the quarter. We're not selling it yet in China or the U.S. I\u2019d just say excitement across both academic and community segments is very high, so we're hitting both markets. We had at ASTRO 450 customers went through the Ethos station, our team is still in recovery as we had really great participation especially by the -- by our first couple of sites, Herlev Hospital treated the first sites. They're now doing 20, 25 patients a day and a mix of both adaptive patients and non-adaptive patients. But it's an ideal device for adaptation in this APM environment. So I think that's the momentum that we're looking to out of the product in the U.S. once we get 510(k) approval. ","Operator","Our next question is from Jason Bednar, Baird. Please proceed with your question. ","Jason Bednar ","I just wanted to offer first congrats to Gary and Mike on their new upcoming roles here. Then, I guess starting here first maybe to follow up to Matt\u2019s question there on Ethos, just fully acknowledging, understanding where maybe a little over a month into the launch. But as you kind of contemplate the potential I mean do you see this as may be following the Halcyon or the TrueBeam adoption curve more closely or somewhere in between, just as you think out not just over the next couple quarters but as you look out over the next few years, I mean where does that slot in from an adoption curve standpoint?","Dow Wilson","I wish I could tell you, Jason, because they keep surprising me. When you heard we say in the call, it started with TrueBeam. And we had a record quarter on TrueBeam and then on top of TrueBeam, we had a record quarter on Halcyon, and now on top of Halcyon, we're launching Ethos. So, we're pretty bullish about it. We got these 11 orders plus 6 upgrades. So, it\u2019s going to disrupt the adaptive niche, but I think it's focused on a segment of the market where it's really meaningful, and I think we will start to see penetration into that community hospital market. So, for us, we're really selling the portfolio and I think Ethos is going to democratize, a really important technology and make available in a standard treatment slot.","And then of course, when you add it all up, at the end of the day, what we really like and I think you're starting to see that, I mean we had 5% growth on the total installed base number of sockets. So, well over 8,500 sockets, 429 incremental new sockets on the year. So, we're just not replacing stuff, we're getting new range of sockets, growing the pie, and that's for us what matters most, which is why we're disclosing that number to investors, so they can watch what happens to our overall installed base growth.","Jason Bednar ","Yes. That's helpful. And then just to brief follow-up, I mean as we look at APAC order number in the quarter and look out over the next couple of quarters here, in the first half of fiscal '20, is that something that we should be mindful of, maybe do we still have some tough Japanese order comps that we will have go through in the next couple quarters or do you see this is more of a temporary down tick in the order growth for that region?","Dow Wilson","I\u2019ll just keep you focused on a trailing 12. Our trailing 12 overall Asia has been 11% constant currency growth. Yes, we didn't have that greater quarter in Japan, offset largely by pretty strong performance in our Southeast Asia, Korea market and then China was very solid for us on the quarter. As I said in the remarks, we are starting to see some pull down of the China quota. So, that\u2019s going to be upside on the market. But especially market like Japan, it\u2019s lumpy. We had better quarters there recently, so that's good news as opposed to kind of last year where we had several -- not so great quarters in a row, but trailing 12, 6 in Japan, very strong double-digit growth in China, and starting to see some of that China market, some of that go-to-market pull down.","From a share standpoint in Japan and China, we remain in very solid position. So, at least from a competitiveness point of view, that's hanging in there just fine, even growing.","Operator","Our next question is from Anthony Petrone, Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Anthony Petrone","I'm actually Dow going to start one just with guidance. Guidance was ahead of our expectation both in reported revenue and constant currency growth and there\u2019s a number of moving parts in there. So as you look at fiscal 2020, how much of the guidance reflects; one, the tariff reversal both on the top and bottom-line; and then how much is from the interventional oncology rollout? And then I have a couple of follow ups.","Dow Wilson","It's a good question. Anthony we will walk you through it in detail. Let me kind of start with and I'll turn over to Gary for the details. We're actually very pleased with the orders growth so the P&L starts there and the orders have been terrific as you know and I'd say they're broad based. So we're especially seeing them in accretive parts of portfolio Halcyon, software, services et cetera. The organic part of the business is booming. So when you look at the year-over-year from an operating earning points of view, if we start fiscal year '19 at $542 million, we think there's almost $100 million of year-over-year organic investment. And kind of with that as a introduction, let me turn it over to Gary to give you a complete walk on the earnings guidance.","Gary Bischoping","Yes, what I would say just to clarify that point, from a year-over-year basis there is over $100 million of organic operating margin accretion, right? ","Dow Wilson ","Tariffs, 100 million reported. ","Gary Bischoping ","Tariffs ex-acquisitions, right. And so to Dow's point that's revenue growth and inside of that revenue growth what you're seeing on the margin line is, you\u2019re seeing that software growth now growing faster than the hardware right and that's pulling through more margin dollars. You're seeing the installed base growth now pulling through the services part of the P&L whish is also at a higher margin. As we referenced on the call we've got Halcyon now banging through the P&L, 116 of them installed out there in the field. You're now starting to see the accretion from that in the margin. So that strong growth coupled with margin expansion out of the core business in addition to the fact that on the VPS side, on the proton side, we are now seeing the services business grow as we get more rooms installed in clinic and get to that one year period. So you\u2019re seeing the portfolio unveil itself in the core and really now you can see you with the tariffs kind of out of the noise you can see the operating performance of the company. And with that we also have the tariffs impact as you mentioned. So all of that stacks up to what we think is the right place to guide and deliver in the P&L. All -- we're doing all that Anthony delivering that guidance while making significant investments in ongoing innovation to maintain the growth in the company over the medium to long-term. Building out the acquisitions, further investments in China to grow, right, our ability to drive more out of the R&D portfolio that Chris is running and operating. So to summarize we think this is pragmatic guidance, the growth is being driven by the core as well as the acquisitions that are off to a good start, and we have a significant investment on the acquisition side as well. ","Anthony Petrone","And just two quick follow ups from me. One on just the CMS oncology bundle. We're I guess about a week or so a little bit more away from the final rule. I mean do you guys have any sort of opinions or expectations into the final rule? And then just Dow, you mentioned China order flow for next year that I guess I can think your comment was even the back -- the last quarter you could see some contribution but as we look in the fiscal '20 what is the expectation for order flow in China specifically off of the Class A and B licenses. Thanks again.","Dow Wilson","Yes, on the reimbursements side, I'd say, we don't really have anything to update you on. I think we're pretty thorough. There is some posted comments on our investor website on kind of where we see things. So, I don't know if there is much of an update. Obviously, we were very pleased with the performance of the business and the portfolio and especially in the U.S. this quarter, it shows you the strength of the hardware and software businesses together. New acquisitions are also hitting in both U.S. and non-U.S. markets as well. I'd say China, we don't guide to China orders number. We do have tougher comps in that market because we have had very strong double-digit growth over 2019. I think we'll remain very strong there. So, funnel looks good. We are excited about Halcyon 2.0. So, we have got some good Halcyon 1.0 momentum in China and we should get that regulatory approval coming soon. And then of course we will have Ethos launch mid-year, next year, may be late in the year, but the -- depending on how fast we can get that through. But we -- it remains our second largest market, very important market to us. We continue to invest in the team, have an outstanding team in China that's really executing and we like what we see.","Operator","Our next question is from Tycho Peterson, JPMorgan Chase and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Tycho Peterson","I want to start with the kind of interventional move here. And do you have kind of critical mass in the portfolio now or how do you think about opportunities to kind of further build that out through M&A? And can you actually quantify what the revenue contribution is in guidance? I didn't hear that in the answer to Anthony\u2019s question.","Dow Wilson","Yes, sure. Gary, go forward.","Gary Bischoping","Yes. I think we have got a good start to the portfolio as well. I would say Tycho with what we've acquired we're working our way to delivering on the go-to-market investment in interventional oncology to be able to represent that portfolio and specifically the embolic bead business that we just got from our Boston Scientific asset acquisition.","One of the biggest things that we see going forward from opportunity perspective is software, that really enable us to differentiate the portfolio going forward, coupled with what we've acquired and we'll continue. That\u2019s part of the investments that I outlined in my earlier comments.","So, looking forward to getting in there and driving that portfolio over time and it\u2019s something where IOs probably were, RT was kind of two decades ago and we're positioned well to go drive that marketplace.","Dow Wilson","Yes, in terms of some of the investments we're making there, I think Gary alluded to it, but the Alicon product is largely a Chinese product. It's looking for global distribution. The Endocare product is largely a U.S. product that's looking for global distribution, and Boston Scientific product has some global distribution that we've got it now, since it was an asset purchase we got to build that capability. So, we really like the growth dynamic in the business, the margin rates are very, very good and we've got some investments to make in 2020 from kind of a selling and administrative point of view, building infrastructure and get a lot of feet on the street to sell the product and that will be our big focus. We think that's a really good grower for us looking forward. ","Gary Bischoping","Yes, Tycho on your guidance question, we did outline that organic -- in our guidance that we gave organic year-on-year. So that's excluding currency and excluding the acquisitions, organic year-on-year revenue growth to 7% to 9%. So you can see in there kind of 200 to 300 basis points of a combined net impact from currency and the acquisitions.","Tycho Peterson","Okay, and then on the tariff dynamic, why is it only 11 million in the refund instead of the 48 million?","Gary Bischoping","Yes, let me walk you through that and clarify kind of the whole walk from where we were because -- and again, I'm going to talk about gross tariff impact, right. The gross tariff impact that we talked about at the outset was $55 million. Through our operational actions, as well as some of the tariff remaining, there is about $29 million that would be available for a refund, right. Now just remember the things we did on the supply chain side, things we did around the legal entity structure, we avoided about $13 million of tariffs and then there's about $12 million of remaining tariffs. So again $55 million down to $29 million, that's the gross amount of tariff available for refund. ","Now, I'd also remind everybody that we had some tariffs impact in Q4 of fiscal year '18. So you take that $29 million you add another $4 million from the available refund from fiscal year '18, now you get a total available refund pool, if you will, of $33 million. Of that $33 million what we did with our import-export agencies that we work through to import our products into China, we received some documentation from them that gave us comfort around booking that from an accounting perspective. However, there were some -- it's just a matter of timing of when we got the approval. There were some we didn't get that documentation from. So we did not recognize about $11 million of that $33 million in fiscal year '19. So that gets you down to $22 million. Just to be fully transparent, the last piece that we -- is running through in the P&L in Q4 from this, is that we received the exclusion on the 17th of September, that gives us a couple of weeks to shift stuff in, to be transparent about versus our guidance, we had $4 million, right, of avoidance relative to our guidance because we actually didn't incur the tariff post the exclusion date. So that gives you up to a benefit in the P&L as outlined of $25 million and then as we worked through the process we used advisors to help us work through the China tariff exclusion process and that costs us $2 million. So $25 million and that's down to $23 million inside of fiscal year '19 specifically in the fourth quarter and then that $11 million I alluded to that we did not have the actual documentation for to post that in FY '19, we'll get that in fiscal year '20. Does that clarify Tycho? ","Tycho Peterson ","Yes. That's helpful. And then last one for Dow on the bundle, is your base case expectation for proton to be included or excluded from the APM in the event that there is no exemption, what do you expect the impact on orders revenue and profitability for proton to be? ","Dow Wilson ","All I can really tell you is the proposed rule was pretty dramatic for proton therapy. There has been a chorus from the community. We're hopeful that it's changed. And at this point, your guess is as good as mine. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. There are no further questions at this time and I will now turn the call back over to Dow Wilson for closing remarks. ","Dow Wilson ","Thank you, operator. In closing, we're excited to finish the year with very solid performance and have tremendous momentum, as we enter the next Fiscal Year. We're pleased that our core business is very strong. Our recent acquisitions are delivering above growth expectations and we received important tariff exclusion. Our long-term growth and value creation strategy is working and delivering growth for our shareholders. I hope you will join us at Varian's Investor Day on November 15th to New York City to learn more. As always, in everything we do, we remain committed to innovating and investing in new technologies and driving toward the ultimate victory, a world without fear of cancer.
