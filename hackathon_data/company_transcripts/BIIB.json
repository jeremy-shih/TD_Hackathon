At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen third quarter 2016 financial results and business update. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","Thank you. I now would like to turn the conference over to Matthew Calistri, Senior Director of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.","Matthew Calistri - Biogen, Inc.","Thank you, Dan, and welcome, everyone, to Biogen's third quarter 2016 earnings conference call.","Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the press release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we'll discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call.","I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail.","On today's call, I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. George Scangos; Dr. Michael Ehlers, EVP of Research and Development; our Chief Commercial Officer, Michel Vounatsos; and our CFO, Paul Clancy. We'll also be joined for the Q&A portion of the call by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Al Sandrock.","Now I'll turn the call over to George.","George A. Scangos - Biogen, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today.","I'm happy to say Biogen delivered another solid quarter, complete with strong financial performance and significant advancements in the pipeline. For the third quarter of 2016, Biogen generated a record $3 billion in revenues, a 6% increase from the same period a year ago. Our GAAP earnings were $4.71 per share, a 13% increase versus Q3 last year. and non-GAAP earnings were $5.19 per share, a 16% increase.","I'll come back to the financials in a minute, but first I'd like to highlight some of the important third quarter pipeline progress.","One of the most exciting milestones this quarter was the positive interim analysis of nusinersen in the ENDEAR study. Recognizing the tremendous need in the SMA community, we moved quickly, established the Expanded Access program, and completed the NDA filing with the FDA in less than two months, the fastest filing time in Biogen's 38-year history. We continue to be grateful to the patients, families, investigators, and employees who worked tirelessly to bring this program to this point.","We've also filed with the EMA, where nusinersen has received Accelerated Assessment status. If approved, nusinersen would be the first treatment for patients with spinal muscular atrophy, a leading genetic cause of death in infants.","We were honored when one of our key pipeline programs was featured on the cover of Nature, specifically, the results of our preclinical research and Phase 1b study of aducanumab. This rare distinction was a first for Biogen research and one that I think further highlights the important work that we're doing in the area of Alzheimer's disease. We also announced that aducanumab was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA.","Our commercial business continued to deliver solid results this quarter. We furthered our leadership in MS through the launch of ZINBRYTA in collaboration with AbbVie, and we continued to grow the number of patients benefiting from our full portfolio of MS products.","Our third quarter hemophilia revenues grew to $217 million, and we've made further progress with the spinoff of our hemophilia business into a separate, independent, publicly traded company, known as Bioverativ, with the initial filing of the Form 10 in August. We continue to expect to complete that transaction in early 2017.","In Europe, we doubled our biosimilars revenues over the prior quarter, as BENEPALI continues to launch in markets across the continent and pick up share at a rate previously unseen for a biosimilar anti-TNF. And we launched FLIXABI, our biosimilar of infliximab. We continue to believe that our work in biosimilars is an important growth opportunity for Biogen.","So we've seen great progress in both our pipeline and our commercial portfolio during the quarter. As you'll hear shortly from Mike and Michel, our entire executive leadership team is focused on driving commercial performance, prioritizing our assets, advancing our clinical programs, and reshaping our pipeline. And our 7,000 employees globally remain committed to delivering therapies that we believe can make a positive difference in the lives of patients.","I'll now turn the call over to Mike so that he can give you a thorough update on our pipeline.","Michael D. Ehlers - Biogen, Inc.","Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. Let me provide some highlights from this quarter, starting with multiple sclerosis.","Last month at ECTRIMS, we presented clinical findings from our broad portfolio of MS therapies as well as top line results for opicinumab, or anti-LINGO, a potential neuroreparative therapy for people with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis.","We presented real-world data and clinical evidence showing that TECFIDERA consistently demonstrates strong efficacy by reducing MS disease activity in patients that have had up to 9 years of treatment. These data also affirm TECFIDERA's well characterized safety profile. Importantly, we believe these findings provide additional support for the early use of TECFIDERA to improve patient outcomes.","Data were also presented for ZINBRYTA, our newly launched once-monthly, self-administered subcutaneous treatment option for relapsing forms of MS. A new post-hoc analysis from the pivotal DECIDE study showed that a significantly greater number of people treated with ZINBRYTA showed no evidence of disease activity compared to those taking intramuscular interferon. Additional new interim data from the long-term extension study, EXTEND, show that treatment with ZINBRYTA had long-term benefits in the proportion of patients who remained relapse-free as well as those who did not experience 24-week confirmed disability progression.","For opicinumab, we presented top line results from the Phase 2 SYNERGY study in MS, in which opicinumab missed the primary endpoint. However, we believe the robust design of this study has allowed us to identify an appropriate patient population and dose to move forward with development. Within the 10 milligram per kilogram dosing arm of the study, we identified a treatment effect in patients whose MRI scans had specific features suggesting evidence of reduced myelination and intact axons at study entry. This subset represented approximately 1\/4 of all patients in the SYNERGY study. Based on these data, we hypothesize that patients with similar features may have the potential to benefit from treatment with opicinumab. We are in the final stages of designing the next study and look forward to providing an update in the coming months.","Turning to another late-stage asset, we made significant progress advancing nusinersen this quarter. As George highlighted, in August Biogen and Ionis announced that we met the pre-specified primary endpoint upon interim analysis of ENDEAR. In the analysis, patients with infantile onset SMA, or SMA consistent with Type 1, who were treated with nusinersen demonstrated a highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the achievement of motor milestones as measured by the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination. The responder analysis looked at achievement of tangible milestones like kicking, head control, rolling, sitting, crawling, standing, and walking. And we believe the results provide a real demonstration of the value nusinersen could bring for patients and their families. Data from the other endpoints analyzed were also consistently in favor of the treated infants.","The ENDEAR study remains ongoing and will be stopped once enrolled patients complete their next office visit, when it is anticipated to happen for all patients before the end of the year. Once this occurs, we will be able to provide more detailed efficacy data, including an analysis on survival.","During the quarter, we also successfully completed the rolling submission of the New Drug Application to the FDA for nusinersen. The U.S. filing was submitted less than two months after the positive interim analysis of the ENDEAR trial, a significant accomplishment for the company and recognition of the urgent need in this community. We have applied for Priority Review, which if granted will shorten the review period for nusinersen following the agency's acceptance of the filing.","Earlier this month, we also filed a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency. The EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use has granted nusinersen Accelerated Assessment status, which can also reduce the standard review time. And we look forward to working with both agencies over the coming months to bring this treatment to patients as quickly as possible.","For nusinersen, our regulatory submissions are comprised of results from the pre-specified interim analysis of ENDEAR as well as all other clinical and preclinical data currently available, including open-label data in both Types 2 and 3 SMA patients. We are seeking a broad label for the treatment of SMA in our current filing applications in the U.S. and the EU.","Our other randomized placebo-controlled Phase 3 study, CHERISH, in children with later-onset SMA consistent with Type 2, was fully enrolled in March this year and remains on track for completion in the first half of 2017.","Earlier this month, we presented additional data for nusinersen at the 2016 World Muscle Society Congress in Granada, Spain. The presentations included safety results from the interim analysis of the Phase 3 ENDEAR study, which demonstrated a favorable safety profile. Analysis of the ongoing Phase 2 open-label study NURTURE demonstrated a positive effect in genetically diagnosed and pre-symptomatic SMA infants. In the NURTURE interim analysis, all 13 infants have demonstrated increases in mean Hammersmith Infant Neurological Exam scores over time, and no infants have discontinued, withdrawn from the study, or reached the primary endpoint of death or respiratory intervention in patients who have been enrolled for a minimum of 64 days and up to 13 months.","A recent analysis of data from the CS2 and CS12 open-label studies in patients with later-onset SMA, which included both Type 2 and Type 3 patients, was also presented at World Muscle. The data showed that children with SMA treated with nusinersen exhibited improvements on several measures of motor function for up to nearly three years. These results are in contrast to the stable or slow decline in scores typically observed in patients with later-onset SMA over time. We continue to be encouraged by the consistently positive results for nusinersen, which we believe support its benefit in SMA.","Now turning to Alzheimer's disease, during the quarter, a number of exciting developments occurred for our lead candidate, aducanumab. As George mentioned, results from preclinical research in the Phase 1b study of aducanumab were published in Nature, a significant achievement for the program and recognition of Biogen's high-caliber science.","Aducanumab was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA, an important step in bringing this potential therapy to patients as quickly as possible. And in a recently completed interim analysis from the Phase 1b study, which included the titration cohort Arms 8 and 9 and a portion of the long-term extension study, efficacy and safety were consistent with results previously reported and support the design of the ongoing Phase 3 ENGAGE and EMERGE studies.","The data from both the titration cohort and a portion of the long-term extension study of PRIME have been accepted to the ninth Clinical Trials in Alzheimer's Disease [CTAD] meeting in San Diego, and we look forward to sharing additional safety and efficacy data with you in December.","We're also making important progress across our pipeline, and we continue to shape our R&D engine for the future. Last year we announced an agreement to license amiselimod, an oral sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator, from Mitsubishi Tanabe. Since announcing the license agreement, we assessed the compound for a number of autoimmune indications, with a particular interest in inflammatory bowel disease. As we prioritize our strategic objectives and the IBD landscape continues to evolve, we've decided to discontinue our current development plan for amiselimod.","As we mentioned last quarter, we generated encouraging Phase 1 data on BIIB059, our anti-BDCA2 for lupus. The anti-BDCA2 Phase 1 study included both healthy volunteers and a cohort of 12 lupus subjects. We anticipate presenting these data at ACR next month, including results from the lupus cohort. A Phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety is BIIB059 is underway, with the first subject dose this month.","We're also working to advance BIIB074, a novel investigational state-dependent subtype selective sodium channel blocker for neuropathic pain. We have initiated an open-enrollment Phase 2b trial for lumbosacral radiculopathy, also known as sciatica. We are also close to completing enrollment in a small exploratory Phase 2a study in erythromelalgia, and we are working toward initiating a Phase 3 study in trigeminal neuralgia in 2017.","BG00011 or STX-100 for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [IPF] is enrolling its final cohort in a Phase 2a study, and we expect to present the data after the trial completes in the second half of next year. BG00011 blocks alpha(v)beta disintegrin, which is selectively upregulated in epithelial cells and fibrotic conditions such as IPF, and is known to be a key mediator of TGF beta activation. We believe early safety and biomarker results from this study evaluating BG00011 in IPF patients are encouraging.","In summary, we continue to make strong progress across our pipeline, and we are working aggressively to optimize and reshape our R&D activities, focusing resources to rapidly advance assets that present the greatest opportunity and address unmet need.","With that, I will now pass the call to Michel.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","Thank you, Mike.","This is a solid quarter for our MS business. Our portfolio of MS therapies delivered revenues of $2.3 billion, an increase of 3% versus Q3 last year and 2% versus Q2. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, MS revenues increased 5% versus Q3 last year and 2.5% versus Q2. Biogen maintained its global leading market share of 38% and remains the leader for both newly diagnosed and switch patients, representing the dynamic portion of the MS market.","As I communicated during our last call, the commercial organization is now focusing on four key opportunities: portfolio strategy; commercial excellence; medical leadership; trust and value. Since the beginning of Q3, we are now in execution mode, especially for MS in the U.S. With portfolio strategy, we have progressed and now identified our prioritized growth opportunities for now and 2017. It is all about making hard choices, driving consistency in resource allocation, and following through with tactical plans and execution.","With commercial excellence, in the U.S. we have piloted and defined a specific engagement model with key MS centers. The rollout is expected to be completed by year end. Additionally, we are currently enhancing our sophistication in multichannel marketing, with a strong focus on digital execution capabilities.","We need to meet our customers where they are, defined by the customer journey, to provide a seamless and differentiated Biogen engagement experience, whether through direct, digital, or other media. These are important steps, not only to improve performance in the short term, but also towards the creation of a new go-to-market model that is more effective and at a lower cost.","In terms of medical leadership, during the third quarter, our R&D colleagues have identified several key opportunities as to how to improve MS care today. We believe we have the opportunity to bring to use a regular and competitive measurement of disease progression, including cognition and imaging.","In addition, we just launched our MS Paths initiative that we believe will create a standardized high-quality data repository from the very diverse real-world patient population in the U.S. and EU. We believe this will open new and differentiated engagement opportunities with major MS clinical centers in the U.S. and in Europe.","And finally, trust and value, we are developing \"beyond the pill\" solutions that we believe will meet customers' day-to-day needs in living with or treating MS. We are working on establishing the leading ecosystem for patients and providers to improve patient outcomes. We believe that Biogen is the only company that has the position and commitment to MS to be able to provide this level of support in a trustworthy and valuable way.","Across these four priority areas, we have well-defined plans. And as I said, since early Q3, we are now in execution mode. Delivering on those well means enhancing the fundamental capability of the commercial operation at Biogen. These priorities are intended to not only drive performance for our inline products, but also to prepare the organization for current and future product launches.","Turning to MS performance, in the U.S., the overall MS market has experienced a 2% decline in commercial patients versus Q3 last year; while in Europe, the market continues to grow, with a 7% increase in patients versus Q3 last year. For TECFIDERA, global market share has increased by approximately 1 point to 15% versus Q3 last year. In the U.S. we had a stable TECFIDERA performance. TECFIDERA continues to capture roughly half of all patients starting on an oral, with a current oral share of 51%. And overall patient share remains relatively stable at 20% since the beginning of the year. This is a clear leadership position for all three metrics.","In Europe, there are approximately 65,000 patients on TECFIDERA, an increase of approximately 30% versus Q3 last year and approximately 4% versus Q2. TECFIDERA is now the most prescribed MS therapy in Germany, France, the UK, and Italy, with more recently launched markets continuing to drive patient growth. We do aspire to restore growth to the more mature markets, and we are very pleased to see early indicators that TECFIDERA gained share this quarter in France following two quarters of lagged performance.","Over the past year, TYSABRI has seen steady incremental share gains globally as it continues to add patients, driven by increased share in the U.S. as well as in the emerging markets. As we continue to see a shift towards increased use of high-efficacy therapies, we believe TYSABRI is benefiting from growing first-line use in the U.S.","In Europe, we are also encouraged by the recent update extending the indication for TYSABRI and allowing physicians to better optimize risk management based on JC virus antibody index values. Following the EU label approval, we have also received similar label updates in Japan, Canada, and Switzerland.","Our interferon therapies continue to play an important role amongst the injectable portion of the market. We believe PLEGRIDY is helping to slow the decline of our interferons, though it does not completely compensate for the loss of AVONEX patients.","In collaboration with AbbVie, we launched ZINBRYTA in August in the U.S. and Germany, and we just recently obtained approval in Australia. We believe the launch of ZINBRYTA comes at the right time, as we see a trend towards increased use of high-efficacy products with both current therapies and future entrants.","While early in the launch, we are encouraged by the level of physician and patient interest in the strong product profile. In the U.S., for example, over half of our target physicians have completed enrollment on our REMS [Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy] program, enabling them to begin prescribing. These are early data, but we see indications that we are capturing many switching patients who otherwise might not have chosen a Biogen product. So it appears that our positioning and execution is working. Looking forward, we expect to receive reimbursement for ZINBRYTA in all the major European markets within the next 12 to 18 months.","So overall, we had a solid performance this quarter across our MS business despite the recent slowdown in the overall MS commercial market in the U.S.","We are also very excited about the continued progress of our biosimilar business. BENEPALI is now available in 13 countries. And in most markets, we are seeing a conversion rate superior to the first infliximab biosimilar launch in Europe, with up to 60% to 80% conversion in markets such as Norway or Denmark. With BENEPALI, we believe we are able to compete beyond price. We are seeing a strong preference for the BENEPALI auto-injector versus that of the originator, with our research indicating that 86% of the nurses prefer our device.","We recently also launched our infliximab biosimilar, FLIXABI, which is now available in Germany, the UK, and the Netherlands, with three additional countries anticipated in Q4. We believe our ability to potentially be the first company to offer all three major anti-TNFs in Europe could put us in a position of strength in the market. We believe biosimilars are an important growth opportunity for Biogen as we work to optimize our engagement with stakeholders across the healthcare system.","In summary, we had a very productive quarter across our MS business in terms of performance. We are encouraged with our new product launches, and we see clear progress as we work hard to elevate our commercial execution capabilities to new levels and as we improve our go-to-market model.","Also, we are particularly excited about the potential to soon launch nusinersen for SMA. With approximately 20,000 patients across the U.S., Europe, and Japan, and no available treatments today, we believe nusinersen represents a significant opportunity for both Biogen, and more importantly, for the patients who today have no treatment option.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul.","Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.","Thanks, Michel.","In the third quarter, our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.71, a 13% increase versus Q3 last year, while our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $5.19, an increase of 16%. Total revenue for Q3 grew 6% versus Q3 last year to approximately $3 billion.","Global third quarter TECFIDERA revenues were $1.034 billion, an increase of 10% versus Q3 of last year. This included revenues of $845 million in the U.S., an increase of 12% versus Q3 last year, and $189 million outside the U.S., an increase of 3% versus Q3 last year. In the U.S., we believe TECFIDERA benefited by approximately $40 million to $50 million versus Q2 due to inventory build in the channel. Outside the U.S., Q3 TECFIDERA decreased by $17 million versus Q2, largely driven by parallel trade dynamics. Versus Q3 last year, foreign exchange and hedge impact weakened TECFIDERA revenues by approximately $17 million.","Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, were $708 million during the third quarter, a decrease of 10% versus Q3 last year. This included $506 million in the U.S. and $203 million in sales outside the U.S. In the U.S., we believe there was a drawdown of AVONEX inventory in the wholesale channel, resulting in approximately $10 million versus Q2. Outside the U.S., foreign exchange and hedge impact weakened interferon revenue by approximately $20 million versus Q3 last year.","TYSABRI worldwide revenues were $515 million this quarter, an increase of 7% versus Q3 last year. This included $301 million in the U.S. and $214 million outside the U.S. Outside the U.S., TYSABRI revenues benefited by $20 million due to a favorable adjustment to our discounts and allowances. Foreign exchange and the hedge impact weakened TYSABRI revenue by approximately $16 million versus Q3 last year.","Our hemophilia products continued to perform well this quarter. ELOCTATE revenues for the quarter were $132 million, an increase of 46% versus Q3 last year. This includes $110 million in the U.S. and $22 million outside the U.S. ALPROLIX revenues in Q3 were $85 million, an increase of 30% versus Q3 last year, including $67 million in the U.S. and $19 million outside the U.S.","Our biosimilar business generated $31 million in revenues this quarter, driven primarily by BENEPALI.","Turning to our AFICD-20 revenues, which include our profit share for RITUXAN and GAZYVA in the United States as well as our profit share and royalties on sales of rituximab outside the U.S., we recorded $318 million for Q3, a decrease from Q2, driven by a reduction in inventory from the second quarter.","Total other revenues, which include revenues from collaboration relationships, royalties, and contract manufacturing, were $99 million in the third quarter. The increase versus Q2 was related to contract manufacturing for a strategic partner, slightly offset by a $13 million loss in our AbbVie collaboration profit share.","Now turning to the expense lines on the P&L, Q3 GAAP cost of goods sold was $417 million or 14% of revenue. Non-GAAP COGS was $396 million or 13% of revenue. The increase versus Q2 was primarily attributable to a mid-single-digit royalty on U.S. sales of both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY.","Q3 GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense was $529 million or 18% of revenue. Both GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense included a $75 million payment to Ionis related to the exercise of our opt-in right to develop and commercialize nusinersen globally.","I'd like to note that our collaboration partner Eisai has stated their goal to start a Phase 3 trial for E2609. A $50 million milestone payment is expected to be triggered once the first patient is dosed in the E2609 Phase 3 trial, and there's a potential chance they could dose the first patient by the end of this year. The $50 million milestone was not considered in our midyear 2016 R&D guidance.","Q3 GAAP SG&A expense was $463 million. Q3 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $461 million or 16% of revenue. Other net expense was $58 million in Q3, which includes $66 million in interest expense, primarily related to our 2015 bond offering.","In Q3, both our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were approximately 25%. Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately $219 million for Q3, which brings us to our diluted earnings per share, which were $4.71 on a GAAP basis and $5.19 on a non-GAAP basis.","We ended the quarter with $7.4 billion in cash and marketable securities, with approximately 40% of this in the United States. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of the company's common stock for a total value of $349 million.","So as often, we had a number of puts and takes in the quarter, nevertheless a very solid financial quarter. I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments.","George A. Scangos - Biogen, Inc.","Okay, thank you, Paul.","I'm very pleased with what we've accomplished this quarter. We delivered solid commercial performance, strong financial results, and important advances in the pipeline. I'm particularly excited about the direction we're heading as we finish 2016 and look forward to 2017 and beyond. As I've said, I believe we're at the beginning of a transformative era in neurodegeneration, which could result in a new era for Biogen as well. We're already starting to see the types of discoveries that can be expected as science advances and innovative trial designs yield previously unseen results and insights.","We believe the early data for aducanumab point to additional opportunities to invest in novel science to address Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. The insights we've gained from the SYNERGY trial are teaching us more about remyelination, and we're enthusiastic about moving opicinumab forward. And the encouraging results we're seeing from nusinersen point to the possibility that there can be entirely new mechanisms and modalities for treating the many daunting diseases of the central nervous system.","I'm proud to have led Biogen for more than 6 years now, and it's gratifying to me to be in a position to turn a high-performing organization over to a successor. Our board search for a new CEO is progressing. We don't have a formal update on timing yet. But as you'd expect, the opportunity to lead Biogen is generating plenty of interest. And in the meantime, I'm working closely with our management team as we strive to realize our goals for 2016 and kick off a busy and productive 2017. We're fortunate to have a great leadership team and a passionate group of employees who come to work every day to make a positive impact on patients' lives, and I thank all of them for their hard work and dedication.","Thanks to all of you for joining us this morning, and we'll now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Eric Schmidt, Ph.D. - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks for the question and congrats on a solid quarter. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the parallel trade issue associated with TECFIDERA. Is that something new? Is there anything you can do about it? Is it going to get worse in the future? Thanks.","Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.","Thanks, Eric. This is Paul. I'll try to take a crack at it. We didn't point it out last quarter. So in fairness, looking at the numbers this quarter, we noticed it in looking backwards. It effectively happens when a low-priced country gets extra purchasing patents and it ends up in a more higher-priced company. Across all of our products, we look hard at this, and we try to, to the extent we can, manage it. We haven't, across the whole time in multiple sclerosis, for 10 or 15 years, seen this to be a big issue, but we'll continue to try to manage it. I don't expect it to be a meaningful issue as we go forward over the next bunch of quarters. It could bounce around every now and then though. Thanks for the question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for the question. Just on the remyelination side for Mike or Al, so what are the puts and takes of finding a population for anti-LINGO versus expanding the program for BIIB061? I'm just curious if you can use the lessons from SYNERGY to optimize BIIB061 development or if you have to prioritize one over the other. Thank you.","Michael D. Ehlers - Biogen, Inc.","Geoff, this is Mike. That's a good question. So my comment on the SYNERGY results is we've been using that data to really look at the potential for an identified population. We think we've found that. We think this is really going to inform our development of BIIB061. We're thinking about that very closely. There's reason to believe that the same population may be something we can investigate similarly with BIIB061. We think it will inform the development. That's going to be part of the plans for how we would develop opicinumab as well.","Alfred W. Sandrock - Biogen, Inc.","Maybe I could add to that. This is Al. The subpopulation that we identified has really good biological plausibility. In other words, these are patients who have evidence of intact axons. They have evidence of demyelination. This makes sense to us that both of these drugs would work better in this population, and that's why we're encouraged by these results.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much for the question. I just want to throw a few questions in on nusinersen. First, what would be the earliest that you would be in a position to actually launch the product if the FDA acted with the speed that they've acted on some other recent applications for high unmet need medications?","Secondly, could you give us a sense of the number of patients continuing from the trials on an open-label basis and also the number of patients in the Expanded Access program, and when you would expect those to be converted to commercial patients?","And then lastly, you mentioned the 20,000 patients with SMA in North America, Europe, and Japan. But what proportion of those do you consider to be really addressable with the label that you're filing for? Is that the population under 10 or infant onset, or is that just all now the different forms of SMA? Thanks, sorry for the multi-part question.","Michael D. Ehlers - Biogen, Inc.","Okay, Geoffrey, this is Mike. I'm going to start and then we're going to tag-team the multi-part question here. Hopefully we'll remember each of the parts.","Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.","We need all members of the management team to address it, so chime in.","Michael D. Ehlers - Biogen, Inc.","So first of all, on the filing, I do want to emphasize that we've submitted the file. We've applied for Priority Review. We haven't heard back on the determination of that. That will obviously dictate when we will get approval for that in the U.S. Similarly, the Accelerated Assessment application we have in Europe, again, that would potentially reduce the review time. But we're expecting that finally to be validated in the coming weeks. So there's some timing dependence on regulator acceptance of these Priority Review and Accelerated Assessment. With that, I'm going to let Michel talk about the launch based on that, but let me address a couple of the other things you mentioned.","Our Expanded Access program is active. We've got patients who are receiving drug. This is obviously country-by-country specific in how they're administering it. And it's an ongoing work in progress. That program will really be relevant during this period while we're filed but before we've got approval. We anticipate that that's going to be a small number of patients that we can get in the relevant countries based on the criterion established in our Expanded Access program.","On the incidence and prevalence and the label, what we would say is this is 20,000 patients prevalence today in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. SMA as a whole has an incidence of about 13,000 patients a year across those roughly. The data that we've submitted were from the interim analysis of ENDEAR. These were Type 1 patients. We've included data across all of our studies as well as preclinical data. We are going to seek a broad label for the treatment of SMA. This obviously will be something under review. And based on that, that will determine the overall size of the patient population, which I'll also let Michel comment on when I turn it over to him.","My final comment on that would be we expect that if successful and launched that these prevalence numbers will increase over time to the extent that we have an impact on survival in these populations. So the label, there's a lot of open questions. We'll have to wait and see, and that is going to determine what the ultimate upside is. So, Michel, maybe I'll turn it over to you on the label.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","Thank you, Mike. So basically, the label is a question mark. The timeline is also a question mark. I had the opportunity to review lately the U.S. operation in terms of launch readiness. And I can tell you that I'm very pleased with the team that is getting together, a high qualified, highly committed team in order to best serve the unmet medical needs together with hopefully a good product with a good label and approved on time. So the launch readiness is there. And basically the label will determine which proportion of the current prevalence we can address at launch. So for that, we have to wait a little bit. 20,000 patients in terms of prevalence in the year so actually that we have qualified, but there are many more beyond, and we are also looking into that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning and thank you for the questions, so first a quick clarification. On the anti-LINGO, is this another Phase 2, or are you actually starting a pivotal program with that?","And then my question is really on market access for multiple sclerosis in 2017. Now that those contracts have been written, can you give us a directional view as to your formulary access versus 2016 and the pricing environment for your products during that year?","Michael D. Ehlers - Biogen, Inc.","Okay, Ron, thanks for the question. This is Mike, and then I will probably let Al comment as well on opicinumab anti-LINGO. We're very much in the design phase of this, looking at the potential of a trial. We're looking at timing. We're looking at cost. We're looking at feasibility. We don't have an answer today, but we think in the coming weeks we'll have a determination about whether we conduct a Phase 2b trial or whether we look to go straight into Phase 3.","Alfred W. Sandrock - Biogen, Inc.","I don't have any further comment.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","So concerning the formulary access in the U.S., we do not comment on the way 2017 will look like nor on the gross-to-net. What I can tell you is that the organization is committed to continue to generate profitable growth. And for that, we go after the cost picture forcefully, how we supply and how we procure our business. And as I explained earlier, we are working on our go-to-market model. We don't believe the reach and frequency model that prevailed in the past is sustainable, and we are basically, step by step, building a new go-to-market model. So we are working on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","Hi, thanks very much for taking my question. I guess a question for Mike. I was hoping you could clarify what you guys have meant on the aducanumab titration data, what you meant by efficacy results that are consistent with results previously reported. Are you referring to imaging or cognition?","And then on the safety side, when you talk about safety looking consistent with what's previously been reported and supporting the design of the Phase 3s, does that suggest that the ARIA is consistent with what you're seeing, or does it support the idea of titration potentially reducing the risk of ARIA in certain populations? Thanks.","Michael D. Ehlers - Biogen, Inc.","Brian, thank you. Thank you for that. And by the way, these are all things which we will have a lot more to talk about at CTAD in San Diego in December. So let me comment on that. So when we say consistent with, we're referring to both imaging and functional endpoints in cognition. As you know, what we've looked at before is the CDR [Clinical Dementia Rating] sum of boxes and the MMSE [Mini-Mental State Examination] as well as amyloid PET.","On the titration side and safety side, again, we'll have a lot more details on this. But what I'd say is what we're seeing is consistent with what we had hypothesized around for the safety basis of aducanumab. In other words, it's within the range of what we've seen and reported before with the Phase 1b study.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks for the question, a follow-up on the Alzheimer's prior question. I just wanted to understand the context of the efficacy comments, in particular given that I think there are still some questions around the placebo arm, and I think that you're still using partly the pool of placebo from before. So I just want to understand the caveats and I guess how confident you are versus that arm.","And then just a quick follow-up is you did mention the line about MT-1303. So I just wanted to understand what happened there. Is that a commercial competition thing, or what happened in that decision? Thanks so much.","Alfred W. Sandrock - Biogen, Inc.","Hi, Michael. This is Al Sandrock.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes.","Alfred W. Sandrock - Biogen, Inc.","The additional cohorts included some additional placebo patients. So we will show the data from the additional placebo patients as well as the placebo patients from prior cohorts, and that will be shown at CTAD. And the efficacy is on PET imaging as well as on the clinical cognitive assessments that we looked at previously, MMSE and CDR sum of boxes. That will all be shown at CTAD.","Michael D. Ehlers - Biogen, Inc.","So, Michael, this is Mike. I'll comment on amiselimod. As we looked at how the landscape was evolving, both in terms of the regulatory competitive landscape, changing features there, and the corresponding fit with our strategic priorities about where we could best allocate resources based on our own expertise and competency. We just determined that it wasn't as good of a fit as other things which we could allocate our resources towards.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning. Thanks for my question as well. Just quickly, we're all anxiously waiting for the top line from solanezumab Phase 3 in December. Can you frame us on what could the reason be for the Phase 3 program for aducanumab?","And then secondly, what's your view on the recent data from AveXis gene therapy in SMA, and what that could mean for nusinersen in the commercial opportunity? Thank you.","Michael D. Ehlers - Biogen, Inc.","Okay, thanks for the question. Maybe I'll take a stab at this and see if anyone wants to open up. First of all, I don't think we'll speculate on the potential results of the solanezumab trial based on that. There are scenarios that one can envision that we are certainly taking into consideration. We very much look forward to seeing their data.","A couple things I would point out on this is, although both are a-beta [amyloid beta] antibodies, these are actually fundamentally quite different mechanisms of action. So whereas we think if there were positive results out of the solanezumab trial, this would give great credence to the amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease, and I think bode well for the potential results of aducanumab. However, because these are fundamentally different mechanisms they're going at is that it is far more difficult to interpret a negative result if solanezumab were to find it, as we would be able to see it. We believe it will be much more difficult to make a conclusion about a negative result on solanezumab vis-\u00e0-vis the potential results of aducanumab.","On AveXis, I think what we would comment is look, we welcome innovative therapies for SMA. We think this is a very serious, very important disease area. We're highly committed to this disease area and to the patients and families. We think that gene therapy has an overall approach is a viable one in spinal muscular atrophy. And in fact, we're quite excited about our own internal program that we have and our collaboration with UPenn in that regard as well. So we look forward to seeing how the combination of nusinersen potentially being launched and the next-generation therapeutics that we are certainly working on will play out over time. We see great prospect for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy.","Alfred W. Sandrock - Biogen, Inc.","And the only thing I would add on the Alzheimer's is the population is a little different than solanezumab. They're studying the mild patients, which makes sense because that's where they saw some evidence of efficacy in EXPEDITION-2, whereas in the case of aducanumab, we're studying prodromal in the early mild patients. And I agree with everything Mike said about the differences in the antibody.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thanks for taking the question. I appreciate it. I just wanted to go back to SMA for a second again and just try and better understand your comments around a broad label. I guess what data supports a label outside of SMA-1 patients? And what's the rationale that you might be able to achieve a label outside of SMA-1 patients ahead of the randomized study data? Thanks.","Michael D. Ehlers - Biogen, Inc.","Okay, Matthew, thanks for the question. I guess I would first start by saying we really are not going to comment on the data prospects for our label. What I will say is that we have ongoing studies in Type 2 patients where we're looking at the potential efficacy of nusinersen. As you know also, we have an ongoing trial, as I had mentioned, in pre-symptomatic genetically diagnosed infants. And so all of that data is data that we look to include in our filing application. And from that, the extent of the label that we achieve, that will be based on the agency's review of the totality of the data and the evidence. We will present evidence based on those populations in our effort to seek a broad label. What that data is we will be able to present at the appropriate time. Many of these studies have not completed.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Scotti with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","John Scotti - Evercore Group LLC","Great, thanks for taking my questions. On the CEO search, could you just elaborate a bit more? I'm not sure what exactly, but I know this is a big topic for investors right now. On timing, is it unreasonable to hear something by year end? And then exactly what is the profile of the person you're looking for? Is it someone from industry, out of industry, et cetera?","And on the MS market, Michel, I had a quick question. You said that in the U.S. that volumes are declining year over year. Do you see this trend continuing? And if so, is it fair to say that any growth from TEC [TECFIDERA] with stable patient share and then I guess also perhaps the entire MS market as a whole would come from price going forward, or do you see volumes inflecting at some point? And if so, what would be the catalyst? Thank you.","George A. Scangos - Biogen, Inc.","Okay, this is George. Maybe I'll comment on the CEO search first. Look, I'm not going to comment on the specific timing. I can tell you that I think we all believe that the sooner we can get through this and have a new CEO come, the better it is for all of us. So it's a very active search. The board is interviewing a number of candidates. There are, as you would expect, very high-quality candidates coming in and being interviewed from a variety of backgrounds actually. And we'll give you an update on that as soon as we can. But I don't want to comment any more on the specific timing today.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","So concerning the U.S. market, thanks for the question. What we had seen during the past quarters was basically a slowdown towards low single-digit market growth in the U.S. What we have seen during the past months or weeks was a shift in the mix between commercial and free that is impacting basically the commercial unit's performance. So I don't know if it's an overall market trend, but this is what we have seen internally.","What I can tell you is that TECFIDERA remains the number one priority for the organization. We have a plan. As alluded to last time, we are working based on the portfolio work that we are doing on TEC GI discontinuation. That remains at an average of approximately 22%. We have a good opportunity to make some inroad there because basically the scope goes from 5% to 35%. So there are some MS centers where they are able to manage with the right engagement, and here there are different type of engagements that are being practiced in the different centers. There is no evidence yet. One can speculate that we can see a temporal association between the increase of eosinophil and the GI symptomatology, but this was not confirmed by clinical trials because of many different controlling factors. So we work on TEC GI. We see early signs that it's heading towards the right direction also in Europe, but it's too early to claim any big success here.","We are working on the capture risks, and one balanced the other. That's why we have a stable patient base. And the base of the market is certainly lower than what we have estimated in our assumptions, but it's not an excuse for not increasing share.","So we do not give up. We invest. We are committed. I can tell you the team in the U.S. is all up and running. They have piloted a new engagement model with the critical MS centers. I'm very pleased to see the perception improvement, and now we have to continue to execute. And the full rollout of this new plan will be towards the end of the year, or by latest early January. So we are committed. We don't give up on the large mature markets where the share of TEC is relatively stable versus the latest launch markets where we continue to make fast inroads, like in Italy, Spain, or the UK. And the good news is that we returned to positive France. And we continue for Germany and we continue for the U.S. We are committed. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, guys, thank you. So just to follow up on market trends in MS, so help us understand. Why do you think \u2013 is there anything going on with the MS market? Why is it shrinking in the U.S.? Are you seeing any people who are trying the orals and then hopping off and not getting back into the MS treatment bucket?","And then on PLEGRIDY, the market, having a certain small percentage of the market is interesting, but do you think you can grow that? And what are you specifically doing to grow the PLEGRIDY market share? Thank you.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","So thanks for the question. It's very difficult to speculate on the future trend of the market. So we have seen a couple of points negative for the quarter versus the prior year. This was not a situation during the prior quarters, so time will speak. We'll see over time, but I don't believe that this will be sustained. And again, I spoke about some trends in the marketplace between commercial units being commercialized and other channels. So we are committed to gain market share in a slower base of the market in all our mature markets, including the U.S.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, thanks for letting me ask a question. Just back on to SMA and nusinersen, you guys have talked about your Expanded Access program and moving that forward. And it sounds like there's a desire here to get more patients on. We ran across some social media chatter from parents that seem to be complaining about at least some PIs that were looking to restrict access to this program. I wonder if you could \u2013 it seems to be a little bit at odds with what you guys have talked about. Can you maybe comment on that and maybe help explain what exactly is going on? Thanks.","Michael D. Ehlers - Biogen, Inc.","Chris, maybe I'll start. The essence is we're not going to comment on specific investigators or specific sites around this. I would say that our Expanded Access program was really designed to, in cases and at sites and countries where we were able to with this severe disease, before we're able to successfully launch hopefully if we get a favorable review, to maximize the access that we could based on criteria that were medically established at relevant sites. A lot of that is determined at the site and the country level. They determine that. And we are doing our best to ensure access in a way that makes sense but that does not jeopardize our filing and the potential approval of this for broad access.","Our hope, by the way, is that this period will be short and that we'll be able to utilize the Priority Review and the Accelerated Assessment of the EMA to bring this to patients as quickly as possible so that this EAP program can be as short as possible.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning and thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask you about your broader biz-dev intentions. Obviously, you had the setback with MT-1303. But as we look forward, can you talk about your strategy here and how much you're able to act on it, if at all, while you have a CEO search ongoing? I guess is this part of the business that we should assume is on hold for the time being until you get someone in who can take stock of the overall organization, or are you still proceeding with diligence of other companies as usual? Thanks.","George A. Scangos - Biogen, Inc.","No, you should not assume this is on hold. We all believe this is an important part of what we have to accomplish. We are continuing with diligence on several companies as we speak, and that will continue. And we will continue to work aggressively to finalize some of these issues. I think the areas in which we are interested are clear. We have a very good R&D team now who can make the technical assessments. We have a great ability now to make the accurate commercial assessments. And so we are full speed ahead.","Matthew Calistri - Biogen, Inc.","All right, Dan, that should conclude the call for today.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Idec Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]  Claudine Prowse, you may begin your conference.","Claudine Prowse","Thank you, and welcome to Biogen Idec Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. We issued a press release this morning providing earnings results for the quarter and full year 2012. The press release and related financial tables are available on our website under the Investors section as are the slides that follow today's call.","I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary from our expectations. I encourage everyone to consult our SEC filings for additional detail.","On today's call, I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. George Scangos; Tony Kingsley, EVP of Global Commercial Operations; Dr. Doug Williams, EVP of Research and Development; and our EVP of Finance and Chief Financial Officer, Paul Clancy. We'll also be joined for the Q&A portion of the call by our Vice President of Medical Affairs, Dr. Kate Dawson.","I will now turn the call over to George.","George A. Scangos","Thanks, Claudine, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. 2012 was a successful and exciting year here at Biogen Idec. We exceeded our financial goals for the year, enjoyed good performance from our products, made substantial progress moving BG-12 and our hemophilia compounds towards hopeful approvals and launch and substantially improved the quality and quantity of our early-stage pipeline.","So following my brief opening remarks, Tony Kingsley, Doug Williams and Paul Clancy will review the results and achievements of 2012 and how they position us for 2013. Doug will also review the positive pivotal trial results of PEGylated interferon that we announced last week.","So 2012 revenue and earnings were strong and exceeded our expectations. Revenue was $5.5 billion, and non-GAAP earnings were $6.53 per share, a strong performance in a year where we invested heavily to advance the late-stage pipeline and prepared for multiple product launches.","As Paul will outline, the good performance was the result of a mixture of positive and negative factors, but the bottom line is that the products continued to do well. AVONEX, after years of declining market share, had a turnaround year in 2012. The introduction of the AVONEX PEN, the first intramuscular autoinjector and the AVOSTARTGRIP, a titration kit to help reduce the frequency and severity of flu-like symptoms, together with great execution on the part of our commercial team, gave AVONEX new vibrancy, and that resulted in a turnaround from losing to gaining market share within the ABCRE class.","2012 was also a good year for TYSABRI, as we ended the year with 7,700 more commercial patients on drug than we started. With the availability of the test for JC virus antibodies, TYSABRI's use is shifting into the JCV-negative portion of the population, and it is getting earlier use in that segment.","Our late-stage development programs, BG-12, hemophilia programs and PEGylated interferon continued to march forward in 2012. We continue to be optimistic about BG-12's potential to benefit patients with MS. You may have noticed that there's been some noise from entrenched competitors, which is not surprising. We believe in BG-12's favorable risk-benefit profile, which has been studied in a large clinical program with more than 3,600 MS patients and includes an ongoing long-term extension study. So I take the noise to be more a reflection of competitive worries about BG-12 than anything else. I want to point out that the biggest risk to MS patients is inadequate control of their disease, and the introduction of more efficacious products can only be a good thing for patients.","We're very pleased to have received the notice of allowance for our dosing regimen patent application in the U.S., claiming the administration of 240 milligrams of DMF twice daily for the treatment of MS. That is the dosing regimen currently under review in our NDA, and this patent is expected to be listed in the FDA's Orange Book and provide patent protection for our BG-12 product until 2028. We believe BG-12 represents a meaningful advance for the MS community, and our focus is on bringing this important therapy to patients as quickly as possible.","We're also working toward the potential registration for our hemophilia compounds, recombinant Factors VIII and IX. Based on the data that we announced from our Phase III trials, we believe both products have the potential to offer longer-lasting protection from bleeding while meaningfully reducing treatment burden. If approved, we believe these products will represent the first major treatment advances in hemophilia A and B since recombinant clotting factors were introduced in the '90s.","Third, one of our goals was to build up the early- and mid-stage pipeline. We continue to focus on areas where we think we have a competitive advantage, neurodegenerative, immunological and hematological diseases, where there is still a high unmet needs and where the biology is well understood. Our continued work in these areas better positions our mid-stage pipeline to reach development milestones in the next 2 years.","In summary, 2012 was a very productive year for Biogen Idec, and I'll now turn the call over to Tony Kingsley to discuss in more detail our commercial results.","Tony Kingsley","Thank you, George. Our core MS franchise continues to perform well with our fourth quarter MS revenues increasing 8% year-over-year while full year MS revenues grew 9% versus the prior year. AVONEX continues to perform well, gaining global market share in 2012 within the ABCRE injectable class and maintaining a strong front line position in MS.","We believe this continues to be driven by 2 things: market uptick of the AVONEX PEN, which brings real convenience advantages to patients and strong commercial execution in a promotionally sensitive segment of the market. In the U.S., despite new competition entering the MS market, we ended the year with more U.S. AVONEX patients on therapy than we started, providing evidence that our commercial strategy is succeeding. Outside of the U.S., AVONEX remains the leading MS therapy, as we continue to increase our leading market share position. Unit growth in these markets was strong.","Now moving to TYSABRI. Patient growth was solid during the fourth quarter, as we added another 1,500 new commercial patients, and for the year, we added approximately 7,700 commercial patients in 2012. TYSABRI's solid growth trajectory continues to be driven by its powerful efficacy. We continue to advance the science in understanding and stratifying TYSABRI's benefit-risk profile and build physician confidence in the therapy. As a result, TYSABRI continues to gain market share in the global MS space.","We saw a continued evidence of earlier adoption in the JCV-negative patient population throughout the year. With growing JCV testing volumes and now the majority of patients who are starting TYSABRI treatment are JCV negative, leading to what we believe will be longer-term retention rates over time.","Now moving to our anticipated 2013 product launches. First, as some of you may already be aware, we now have a brand name for BG-12, TECFIDERA. In the U.S., we are fully ready for a commercial launch of TECFIDERA and continue to plan to an expected late March FDA approval. Our brand strategy is defined. We have a robust promotional plan in place, and we are appropriately resourced. Additional field resources are already in place, and we will augment with significant promotional and program spend to support the anticipated launch beginning in Q2.","Outside the U.S., we are planning toward an expected EMA approval in the first half of 2013 and expect the primary launches this year to occur in Germany and Canada, with the cadence of launches in other countries stretching into 2014. In international launch markets, we already have key marketing and market access resources in place to support TECFIDERA, and we have a clearly defined hiring schedule to add field resources several months in front of each country's launch. While we obviously do not have a TECFIDERA label yet, we continue to believe the data suggests a product profile that will be very appealing to a broad set of physicians and patients, and we continue to see high market anticipation.","We are realistic that the market is sticky with many patients well controlled on existing therapies, and that as the third oral to market, we have our work cut out for us. With that said, we are very excited. We will set very ambitious goals for ourselves, resource the launch aggressively and focus on strong execution as we have done with our other products to drive success.","While the TECFIDERA launch is of primary importance to us, our broader objective is to grow our total franchise in MS, and we believe we are well positioned to do just that. We have a potential leader in the 3 market segments: AVONEX in the injectable class or ABCRE, TYSABRI in the high efficacy segments and TECFIDERA in the emerging oral segment. With something like 30% of the patients currently on our products today, we see real growth potential across our portfolio, and we'll focus on maximizing our total patient capture.","In 2013, we also anticipate accelerating our commercial activities for the hemophilia franchise. We have a strong nucleus of commercial leadership in place, and we'll continue to build out the team infrastructure and supply chain necessary for successful launches. Assuming end-of-year approvals, we anticipate the majority of our sales force buildout to occur in the middle of the year. Similar to TECFIDERA, we also anticipate making significant investments in promotional and marketing activities that are vital to successful launches. We believe our commercial momentum is solid. We are executing our strategies successfully, and we believe we are well prepared for potential upcoming launches.","With that, I'll hand the call over to Doug.","Douglas Edward Williams","Thanks, Tony. Let me start by thanking and congratulating the R&D and regulatory organizations for all their efforts and success in 2012. It's been a year of significant accomplishments spanning the entire pipeline from research to marketed products.","In 2012, we expanded the U.S. TYSABRI label to include information about JCV antibody risk stratification and achieved FDA approval for both the AVONEX PEN and Titration Kit. We completed an NDA filing for TECFIDERA with FDA and an MAA file with the EU regulatory authorities ahead of schedule and have now filed with Canada, Switzerland and Australia for approval of TECFIDERA in relapsing forms of MS.","Our hemophilia team reported on successful Phase III clinical studies for Factor IX and Factor VIII with our long-lasting versions of those molecules. These programs are the first true innovation for patients with hemophilia in more than 15 years.","We reported Phase III data from our dexpramipexole study in ALS, which unfortunately was not positive but generated important baseline data on ALS patient diagnosis and clinical progression, which will be important for designing future trials. And just last week, we reported on positive Phase III data with peginterferon, which I'll spend more time discussing later. All in all, it's been a remarkable year of progress with our late-stage pipeline.","It's also noteworthy that our early-stage pipeline advanced as well with enrollment of first patients in our Phase IIa study of STX-100 in IPF, the Phase IIa study of anti-LINGO in acute optic neuritis and our Phase IIb study of the anti-TWEAK antibody in lupus nephritis. We also began enrolling patients in the Phase Ib IIa multi-dose study of Isis-SMNRx for spinal muscular atrophy.","We made significant changes to our research organization to promote discovery and validation of novel drug targets and key high-profile academic collaborations with the ALS sequencing project, the ALS biology consortium, the hemophilia sequencing program and the human protein-protein interaction map. All of these accomplishments position the company for near-term launches of multiple products, as well as a steady stream of Phase III and Phase II proof-of-concept study readouts over the coming years.","I'd like to highlight a few key program accomplishments, starting with our MS pipeline. I'm pleased to say that we'll have more than 50 abstracts at this year's AAN meeting in San Diego, with the majority highlighting recent developments with our MS franchise. Last week, we announced positive top line data from the Phase III registrational study of peginterferon beta-1a, known as ADVANCE, in 1,500 patients with relapsing-remitting MS. This trial was conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment with the FDA.","Primary endpoint of the study was annualized relapse rate at 1 year, and secondary endpoints included the number of new or newly enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions. The proportion of patients who relapsed in 12 weeks sustained disability progression as measured by EDSS. Patients in ADVANCE were dosed subcutaneously either every 2 or 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was met for both dosing regimens of peginterferon with ARR reductions of 36% and 28% for the every 2- and 4-week dosing regimens, respectively. Secondary endpoints were also met for both dosing arms, including EDSS at 1 year.","Specifically, the confirmed 12-week reduction in disability progression as measured by EDSS was 38% for both dosing groups. This is an important outcome measure, which showed significant results at 1 year, whereas most studies assess disability after 2 years of dosing. Rates of neutralizing antibodies were less than 1% for both regimens, and both dosing groups showed that peginterferon was well tolerated with adverse event profile similar to the known profiles of beta interferons in MS.","With these strong results, we believe that peginterferon has the potential to be a leading therapy within the injectable segment. Peginterferon should reduce the number of injections, which ranges from daily with Copaxone to weekly or more frequent injections of the current beta interferons to potentially once every 2 weeks or once every 4 weeks with peginterferon.","Detailed data for the ADVANCE study will be presented as a platform presentation at the upcoming AAN meeting. We expect to file with the FDA and EMA mid-2013, and we're planning a 2014 potential launch of peginterferon with a subcutaneous autoinjector to improve patient convenience.","Earlier this month, we and our partner Elan announced regulatory submissions with both the FDA and EMA requesting updates to the TYSABRI labels. The applications requested expanded indications, which, if granted, would include first-line use in relapsing-remitting MS patients who've tested negative for antibodies to the JC virus. Both regulatory applications have been validated by the respective agencies, and formal review has begun.","The identification of anti-JCV antibody status as a risk factor for PML has helped to enable individual benefit-risk assessment for patients with relapsing forms of MS. We've shown that anti-JCV antibody negative patients are at lower risk for developing PML, and the proposed label changes would support the earlier usage of TYSABRI in these patients.","Moving on to our early-stage MS pipeline. We initiated the first Phase II trial of anti-LINGO in optic neuritis. This is a placebo-controlled trial of 80 patients with acute optic neuritis randomized one to one to placebo or anti-LINGO administered IV. The primary outcome measure of this trial is a change of conduction velocity as measured by visual evoked potential at 24 weeks, but we'll also examine low-contrast visual acuity as a measure of visual improvement. We expect to initiate a second Phase II trial of anti-LINGO in relapsing MS during the second half of this year. This is a placebo-controlled dose ranging Phase IIb study of approximately 400 patients dosed IV for 12 to 18 months and assessed for changes in functional status by EDSS, as well as several imaging endpoints and biomarkers to assess remyelination in neuronal repair. We anticipate data from the acute optic neuritis trial in 2014 and the relapsing MS study in 2015.","Now on to our hemophilia programs. Last year, we shared positive news from our registrational studies of both our long-lasting Factors VIII and IX. I'm pleased to announce that we have had abstracts accepted on A-LONG and B-LONG, our registrational studies in hemophilia, and we'll be presenting these at the European Association for Haemophilia and Allied Disorders taking place in Warsaw, Poland from February 6 to 8. We're also sponsoring a symposium at the Congress focused on the ongoing clinical development of recombinant Factors VIII and IX with the purpose of increasing our interaction with the hemophilia community and involving expert clinicians' perspectives on our long-lasting programs.","Our collaboration with Isis Pharmaceuticals targeting spinal muscular atrophy, also known as SMA, recently completed a Phase I single-dose, open-label safety and tolerability study. The results showed that intrathecal administration of SMNRx appears to be well tolerated. Patients were assessed for clinical responses post infusion by the modified Hammersmith scoring system and with electrophysiological measures of motor unit function. Details from this study will be shared at the upcoming AAN conference.","The next step for this program is the ongoing Phase Ib IIa multiple-dose study in SMA patients, which will determine appropriate endpoints for the Phase III pivotal trial and identify any appropriate biomarkers. Our partner, Isis, expects to have top line data from this study in late 2013 or early 2014. I'm extremely pleased with the progress that the R&D organization has shown over the past year. I look forward to providing you with further updates on our progress in the coming quarters.","With that, I'll now pass the call over to Paul.","Paul J. Clancy","Thanks, Doug. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.23 in the fourth quarter and $5.76 for the full year. The primary differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter are outlined in the earnings presentation and include $49 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles, $4 million in fair value adjustments for contingent consideration and $2 million related to stock compensation expense. This was partially offset by the tax impact on these items.","Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $1.40. This includes a discrete tax item, which impacted Q4 EPS by approximately $0.12. I'll explain this in more detail in a few minutes.","Let me now walk through the financial results. Total revenue for the fourth quarter grew 7% to $1.4 billion and grew 9% for the full year to $5.5 billion. Q4 AVONEX worldwide revenue was strong, growing 7% to $753 million and grew 8% for the year to $2.9 billion. Both Q4 and full year worldwide unit model volume increased 4% versus prior year.","In the U.S., AVONEX grew 11% in Q4 to $467 million, and for the full year, U.S. AVONEX revenues increased 10% to $1.8 billion. Inventory in the channel in the U.S. ended at just over 1.7 weeks, a slight decrease compared to the prior quarter. Internationally, Q4 AVONEX revenue was $286 million, an increase of 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Foreign exchange weakened AVONEX revenue by $10 million, which was offset by a $3 million hedge gain. For the full year, AVONEX international revenue increased 6% to $1.1 billion. Foreign exchange weakened AVONEX revenue by approximately $69 million. This was offset by a $25 million hedge gain as compared to a $31 million hedge loss in 2011.","TYSABRI worldwide end market sales were $433 million in the fourth quarter and $1.6 billion for the year, up 14% and 8%, respectively. Biogen Idec recorded TYSABRI product revenues of $295 million in Q4 and $1.1 billion for the full year. In the U.S., fourth quarter TYSABRI product revenue to Biogen Idec grew 20% to $104 million. Full year TYSABRI product revenue was $383 million to Biogen Idec, an increase of 17% over 2011. Q4 international TYSABRI product revenue was $191 million and $753 million for the full year.  TYSABRI product revenue was negatively impacted by approximately $17 million of deferred revenue in Q4 and $63 million for the full year in our Italian affiliate. The impact of foreign exchange for the full year also detracted $48 million from international TYSABRI revenue versus the prior year, which was offset by a $10 million hedge gain compared to a $6 million hedge loss in 2011.","FAMPYRA revenues were $11 million in the fourth quarter and $57 million for the full year. U.S. RITUXAN sales were $769 million in the fourth quarter, up 7%. For the full year, U.S. RITUXAN sales were $3.1 billion. RITUXAN benefited from continued patient penetration in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and adoption in the vasculitis indications.","Our profit share and expense reimbursement from that business was $257 million in the fourth quarter and $1 billion for the full year. Royalties and profit share on sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. in Q4 were $24 million and $105 million for the full year. The result was $281 million of revenue from unconsolidated joint business in Q4 and $1.1 billion for the full year. Royalties were $56 million for the fourth quarter and $161 million for the full year. We also recorded $6 million of corporate partner revenue in the quarter and $44 million for the full year.","Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q4 cost of goods sold were $134 million or 9% of revenues. Full year COGS were $545 million or 10% of revenues. The increase in COGS in '12 over prior year was primarily driven by higher revenues from our core products, higher cost of the AVONEX PEN and increased funding related to the JCV assay, nurse training fees and our arrangement with Samsung Biologics.","Q4 R&D expense was $344 million or 24% of revenues, which includes a $30 million upfront payment to Isis for the discovery collaboration and spending related to dexpramipexole. For the full year, R&D expense was $1.3 billion or 24% of revenues.","Q4 SG&A expense was $375 million or 26% of revenues, an increase of 33% over last year. This was driven by costs associated with promotional planning and sales force deployment for TECFIDERA in the hemophilia therapies, as well as an increase in grants. For the full year, SG&A expense was $1.3 billion or a 21% increase over 2011.","Continuing down the P&L. Our collaboration profit sharing line totaled $78 million in expense for the quarter and $318 million for the year. During the fourth quarter, we also recorded $15 million from DRI from the sale of our BENLYSTA royalty and related rights. Other income and expense was a loss of $14 million in the fourth quarter.","Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was 30.6%. This is an increase versus our normal effective tax rate due to a onetime discrete item in the quarter. Specifically, during our year-end audit, we discovered an error in our accounting for the income taxes related to the capitalized interest at our Denmark manufacturing facility. This had accumulated over many years going back to 2006. We've adjusted this all in the fourth quarter as a cumulative correction for the last 6 years, and it increased our tax expense by $29 million. This was a noncash impact which unfavorably impacted Q4 EPS by $0.12.","In the fourth quarter, our weighted average diluted shares were 238 million, flat versus the prior quarter. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in cash and marketable securities, of which approximately 2\/3 is in the U.S. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $1.40 in the fourth quarter and $6.53 for the full year, up 11% versus 2011.","Now I'd like to provide our full year 2013 guidance. We expect total revenue growth of approximately 10%. While we usually don't provide product-specific guidance, I would like to characterize how we're thinking about each of the products. Overall, as we've talked, our thesis remains that we will potentially have leading products in each of the 3 multiple sclerosis segments: the ABCR segment, the high-efficacy segment and the oral segment.","We expect the revenue dynamics of our AVONEX business to remain roughly similar to the last year or 2 with single-digit unit declines in the U.S. due to the new entrants and low single-digit increases outside the U.S. We expect the impact of 2012 pricing action to carry forward as a positive impact in the U.S. and a slight negative impact outside the U.S., roughly offsetting each other.","Overall, we expect AVONEX revenue in 2013 to be pretty comparable to 2012, which is consistent with our goal to gain share within the ABCRE class. We expect continued growth from TYSABRI driven by risk stratification efforts and its high-efficacy profile. Our business plan assumes TECFIDERA is approved in the United States in late March and shortly thereafter in the EU. Over the multi-year time period, we believe TECFIDERA, given the therapy's profile, can be the leading oral treatment in MS.","Let me point out a couple of factors that are included in our TECFIDERA projections for 2013. First, subsequent to last year's PDUFA delay, we adjusted our plans to assume TECFIDERA will be available to patients in the U.S. for only 9 months in 2013 versus 12 months. That dropped the highest revenue quarter. Second, due to the normal country reimbursement process outside the U.S., international revenue comes primarily from Germany in 2013. We expect to see the benefit of the remaining countries begin largely in 2014. And finally, our forecast on dose compliance is cautious for 2013 which, I'll admit, we really don't know until we get into launch.","Moving to RITUXAN. We expect our revenue from unconsolidated joint business to be similar year-over-year, as international Rituximab royalty declines are offset by modest U.S. profit share increase.","Moving to the expense lines of the P&L. We expect cost of goods sold to be between 8% and 10% of sales. R&D expense is expected to be between 22% and 23% of sales, a decline from 2012. Our R&D expense starts to benefit from the maturation of the late-stage pipeline, and our spending in R&D moves to greater investment in mid- and early-stage development programs.","SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 24% to 26% of total revenue, an increase from 2012. We see 2013 as an investment year in SG&A, as we build out the commercial efforts for TECFIDERA and we execute prelaunch commercial efforts for hemophilia in the U.S. We do expect to drive SG&A leverage post 2013.","We expect our effective tax rate in 2013 to be between 24% and 26% of pretax income. As a result, we anticipate GAAP earnings per share to be between $6.45 and $6.55 and non-GAAP EPS results to be between $7.15 and $7.25. So we're excited about 2013 and setting the foundation for what we hope will be strong earnings growth over the next number of years, as we hope to launch multiple new products over the course of 2013 and 2014.","I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments.","George A. Scangos","Okay. Thank you, Paul. This is a remarkable time for Biogen Idec. In 2012, our commercial, regulatory, development, clinical and research teams achieved significant milestones that positioned us for sustained near- and long-term growth. As I think about 2013, we believe that the underlying drivers of growth continue to look robust.","Current products continue to provide a solid business foundation, and we expect continued performance in 2013. AVONEX is now gaining market share in the U.S. and internationally within the ABCRE class. And as Paul -- as Doug reported, we recently had the results for our peginterferon trial, which showed solid efficacy. We plan to launch peginterferon with the disposable subcutaneous autoinjector to improve patient convenience. This potential best-in-class profile should enable us to further expand our share in the ABCRE segment.","We continue to be optimistic about the prospects for TYSABRI. The JC virus antibody test seems to be paying off now, and we think TYSABRI has substantial growth potential. We're entering an era, where subject to FDA approval, we hope to have several new product launches: TECFIDERA, our hemophilia compounds and PEGylated interferon. Behind those is a pipeline of very promising compounds. Next year, we'll have a readout for daclizumab HYP, which has the potential for once-a-month dosing for the treatment of relapsing MS patients.","In 2015, we'll have a readout for TYSABRI in secondary-progressive MS. If the data are positive in this indication, it would be a great service for those patients and a new market for TYSABRI. SPMS patients make up approximately 35% of the total MS population.","And then potentially, there's a readout for ISIS-SMNRx in 2016. So over the next 3 years, we expect to have proof-of-concept data for multiple compounds including anti-LINGO for MS, ISIS-SMNRx for SMA, STX-100 for IPF, anti-TWEAK for lupus, neublastin for neuropathic pain and BIIB037 for Alzheimer's disease. So it looks like we could have pivotal trial results for at least 1 new compound each year for the next 3. Together with readouts from our Phase II compounds and proof-of-concept data within that same time frame, we believe that the early-stage pipeline is maturing nicely and could be a major value contributor to the company as we move forward.","Our next steps are pretty clear. We now drive forward with the same passion and commitment we demonstrated over the years to maximize the opportunities ahead of us and bring innovative and sought-after therapies to patients globally. We need to continue to drive the performance of our current products. What's important to us is to drive leadership across the entire MS franchise. We believe that with a leading injectable, the leading high-efficacy therapy and potentially the leading oral compound, we're well positioned to capture more net new patients in each of those segments.","We need to ensure that we go through the registration processes for our new compounds efficiently and successfully launch each of the late-stage products in the coming years. For the rest of the pipeline, we need to ensure that we get the trials done on time and continue to drive innovation to bring the best science to the company. And we need to further build the early-stage pipeline to continue to bring important new medicines to patients in areas of high unmet need and further ensure that we have major value drivers going forward.","So our future and our success are in our own hands, and that's a nice place to be. Very few companies can tell the story that we can, and that doesn't happen by accident. I'm very proud of the many accomplishments achieved by our company and our outlook for 2013. We thank all of the employees who make our achievements possible.","And at this time, I will open the call to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","As you know, it's our job in the investment community to worry about the unlikely, so with that in mind, let me ask the following questions, if you don't mind. Could we maybe get your updated thoughts on the potential impact of the PML cases linked to FUMADERM in Germany on your BG-12 regulatory applications? And also I think there is a recent blog post by Dr. Gold which seemed to suggest that -- it seemed at least to suggest that some BG-12 patients, he thought, should be -- should have their white blood cell counts monitored. I just -- I'd love get your thoughts on that. And then finally, what do you expect the FDA and EMA to do with the BG-12 preclinical kidney cancer signal that you disclosed many years ago? I remember you disclosing it many years ago but which Teva referred to in its recent CP. And then I'll get back in the queue. I really appreciate you entertaining my paranoid delusions.","George A. Scangos","Thanks, Mark, and let me just point out that it's also our job to worry about unlikely events, so -- but let me take those 2 things 1 at a time, and this is like the guest who won't leave the party, I guess. But anyway, look, let me take the PML stuff first. We talked about this at JPMorgan. So let's first talk about BG-12, right? It's been studied in 3,600 patients including a long-term extension study, 0 cases of PML, no opportunistic infections, looks great. With FUMADERM, in 180,000 patient years, there have been 3 cases of PML, and there's 1 additional case that's been reported in a patient taking formulated fumaric acid esters, right? So lump those together, you got 4 cases in 180,000 patient years. So the first thing to say is that is kind of the normal rate that you would expect to see in a population of patients with an autoimmune disease. There's nothing alarming about that role rate. Two of those cases are heavily confounded, patients taking other drugs, having other risk factors for PML. Two of them, which I think are the 2 patients to which Dr. Gold alludes in his post last week, were lymphopenic for sustained periods of time. Lymphopenia is also known to be a risk factor for PML. So the 2 cases reported last week are not new cases. They're 2 of the 4 cases that are already known. I -- there, he mentioned that they are going to be published in a major medical journal. I think that's true, but I just -- I mean, glad you asked the question because we can make it clear here. Those are not new cases. These are the old cases. And the rate's low. So that's all there is, I think, to say about that. Now on the kidney issue, the -- look, this came from a website that was deemed constructed for internal use only. The -- actually, the information on the website were not completely accurate. They were not vetted completely by us, let alone even submitted to any regulatory agencies, let alone approved by any regulatory agencies. And they were largely meant to be placeholders for the site, so we could substitute the official information and get the site up quickly after approval. The site -- the data -- the site was accessed by Teva. Data were inappropriately used to file their citizens position -- petition that they filed. The data are not new. They are old. We disclosed those data, as you pointed out, many years ago. The regulatory agencies have had them for years for those reason that we did the renal monitoring during the clinical program. And as you know, from looking at the Phase III data, there were no signs in the renal trial in humans. So we feel very comfortable about the safety profile of BG-12 and about the risk-benefit profile of BG-12. And we are still aiming for an approval at the end of March. And as I said before, we take these concerns now to be -- I think the noise about them now is largely a question of competitive pressure rather than anything else.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Well, maybe best for Paul. You laid out a lot of factors on BG-12 for us to think about in terms of how to model the launch. When you look at the analyst models out there, maybe specifically consensus of about $330 million for the year, are you getting the sense that the Street's thinking is aligned with your own? And if not, where do you think there's disconnect?","Paul J. Clancy","Yes -- no. Thanks, Eric. I mean, I think the -- what we've -- I've been working to try to do is just try to point out the fact that post the PDUFA delay last year, I think there were a fair amount of models that actually didn't adjust for the fact that it's 9 months in the United States as opposed to 12 months. And then I think the other key thing is that compliance for BG-12, we just actually don't know. So we're kind of being a little bit cautious that we're looking at twice-a-day drugs as opposed to once-a-day drugs kind of the benchmark being kind of Gilenya, that there's a good chance that compliance coming out of the gates may be a little bit lower. We're going to be putting in place a lot of programs, pharmacy programs and the like to make sure over the medium term that patients are taking the therapy appropriately. So falling short a little bit of exactly asking -- answering your question on the number, the spot number, just kind to want to really point that stuff out, it's obviously a range. And I think that we'll know that as we get into it. We are very comfortable with the longer-term projections, which also obviously is a range. But just for this year, I just want to try to really point a couple of those factors out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A question on the ADVANCE trial. Obviously, the Q2 and Q4 week achieved the endpoint, but there were some differences between the 2 on everything but EDSS, so maybe help us with how you see Q4 week playing out commercially versus Q2 or other injectables. And then will there be an efficacy measuring going out to 2 years that possibly that you could see a catch-up effect with a month ago [ph]?","Tony Kingsley","Yes, Geoff, it's Tony. Thanks for the question. So look, from a commercial standpoint, our thesis on the injectables class has been that as other products enter and the efficacy differences get compressed a little bit, it moves to convenience. Look, both of these are good news from a convenience standpoint. It's early days, and I think we have some work to do to think through the -- sort of the more tactical marketing strategy on 2 versus 4. There's -- the good news is they're both good. Disability is obviously encouraging to have, and that can be a differentiator, I think, particularly with payers who are particularly interested in that. Doug, I don't know if you want to talk about the 2-year.","Douglas Edward Williams","Yes, in the 2-year data, because of the way the study is designed, the patients who are on placebo roll over to active drug. So what we'll really be looking at there is primarily tolerability-related issues in the second year. You really lose your comparator group, if you will, just based on the way the study is designed.","So primarily we'll get some additional tolerability data. We'll obviously be looking at sort of long-term efficacy measures but have less power to say things just based on the fact that the placebo patients have now been rolled over to active drug.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So just got 2 questions, guys. One -- and I don't know if you can answer it, maybe just kind of philosophically, when you look at Aubagio, it's around $40,000 per year, and with the recent price increase of Gilenya in the U.S., it's around $60,000. So the question is BG-12 really has sort of a great profile between the 2 drugs and can support premium pricing, certainly at the higher end of Gilenya, but then you're probably worried about market access. So just give us a little bit of a sense to how you think about that range and then any sense of how should we think about the gross to net discounts in this market for the oral drugs. And then just secondly, if you don't mind for Tony, TYSABRI, what -- how should we think about patient starts from now just given the deceleration quarter-to-quarter?","Tony Kingsley","Yaron, it's Tony. On pricing, I think Aubagio's $45,000 last I looked. I think you said $40,000. Look, there is a range between that and where Gilenya is today. If you look at where the ABCREs are, they're mostly pretty clustered in that category. We've said before, whereas we think about the BG-12 pricing strategy, we think it's got a good profile. We're going to do what we can to capture value for that, but we're going to be thoughtful about not creating lots of barriers for us. Let me touch on TYSABRI, and then Paul can maybe take the gross to net question. We feel good about the pace on new patient starts. It's a little slower in the second -- in the fourth quarter. If you look, that's not unusual. There is some seasonality in the TYSABRI business. I think in the past, we have seen some -- Q4 particularly around December is a little softer for patient adds, but we're continuing to see risk stratification take hold and the benefit-risk profile moving. So as I think we've often said, we didn't view risk stratification as a massive inflection since there was a lot of understanding of that through the STRATIFY clinical trial, but it's a nice steady march of continuing to move physician confidence. And with that, we think patient adds. Paul, you want to talk about it?","Paul J. Clancy","Yes. No. Great question, Yaron, with respect to gross to net, and clearly, we're talking about the United States. The gross to net -- few people have pointed this out, that it has increased over the last couple of years, so that's always good to be mindful of. For us and for our category, multiple sclerosis, it's a function of private payer rebates, which really are actually haven't meaningfully increased and then government rebates, which while it's a relatively lower percentage of the mix for us, it actually can -- it plays a factor into the gross to net dynamics. Certainly, that's particularly true for AVONEX. That's true for TYSABRI. That will actually, in the early days, obviously be less true for BG-12 because that's more of a function of historical pricing vis-\u00e0-vis kind of cost-of-living adjustments if you will. So it's good thing to be mindful of, but I think it's still quite manageable.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Porges with Bernstein.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Appreciate the transparency. Just a question, Paul, about margins. Your R&D looks like it's coming down next year. You've been around -- hovering around 24% the last couple of years, and you clearly had to pull back or been able to pull back on spending on dex. Can you give us a sense of what the sort of thing you might be looking out from a business development standpoint given that it looks as though you've got 1 point or 2 of SG&A spend that you could potentially deploy into another late-stage program? Or is that an incorrect assessment?","Paul J. Clancy","I'd say that the dynamics of 2013 are, Geoff, pretty close to what you point out in terms of we expect to get a little bit of deleverage in SG&A, call it, 150 to 200 bps of deleverage as this is a critical year and a very unique year and a great year for Biogen Idec with respect to kind of the bolus of potential launches. R&D, we expect to get to more or less make up that point, those 150 to 200 basis points. And actually, that has been all along kind of the thinking, as the maturation of the late-stage programs get through kind of the big spending. They -- as you move late stage and finish your trial as we've talked about in the past, it's not like the spending disappears. The exception obviously is dexpramipexole. We expect just very small amount of spending in 2013, and that is really kind of a big driver on the 2012 to 2013 kind of leverage point. We will continue to look at business development deals in R&D. Our current guidance doesn't include anything real meaningful in that, but we feel that we have an obligation to continue to look at those things and cover the cost of those if they're very manageable and very, very small. And that continues just to be real important strategically to build up the early- and mid-stage pipeline to get a real longer-term sustainable growth for the company. And it's essentially part and parcel to what we do here, and it's been proven to be pretty darn effective. Those -- anything meaningful on that front, we look at on a -- the merits of the molecule, the merits of the deal, less about kind of what does it do for the kind of quarter-to-quarter impact on the P&L. And we have to solve that after the fact.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ravi Mehrotra - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Two-part question on TECFIDERA. Paul, you've mentioned twice now some caution around the BID dosing compliance. Is there any studies or real-world experience which brings you to that cautionary note? And related to that, turning to the GI and flushing side effects, which you flagged openly, can you remind us how you aim to manage that in the early days of the launch, what you're hoping to get within the label in that regard and remind us of the studies to support those steps?","Paul J. Clancy","Yes, let me start with the first part, Ravi. Well, first of all, nice job on the pronunciation of TECFIDERA. Look, Gilenya, as you know, they've reported kind of into the 90 percentages on compliance. We -- we're looking hard at this, and there's lots of studies of more than a handful of comparable twice-a-day therapies that actually get closer to 70% compliance. So that's a big -- in the world of revenue and P times Q, that's actually a big swing, and that's a little bit about what we're being cautious of. Obviously, our job is to work hard on that. It's the right thing to do for the business. More importantly, it's the right thing to do for patients so -- but that gives you a little bit of kind of the swing factor that could play. Doug?","Douglas Edward Williams","And in terms of what we'll have available to help physicians manage patients through, we're really talking about the first month here where both the flushing and the GI tolerability effects seem to manifest themselves, and they tend to sort of self limit after a month. But we will have patient support services available to be able to sort of advise and counsel if you will. As you know, we've done some studies with aspirin that seem to have a meaningful effect on flushing. Those won't be in the label, but we're continuing to do some additional work. Those studies have been published. They've been talked about at some of the major neurology meetings, so that information is obviously out there and available for physicians. And then as far as the GI tolerability, we're also looking at the ability to titer the dose up to see whether or not that has a meaningful impact for those few patients who do experience significant GI tolerability effects so -- and we'll have patient information. We won't have anything in the label initially, but we're continuing to do studies to be able to understand and better manage that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess I'm thinking about PEG-Avonex and the data, you've said that you want to be the market leader amongst interferons, and I'm wondering whether or how you're thinking about peginterferon. Do you think that peginterferon could be the market leader amongst the interferons? And then second question related to that is how do we think about gross margins? You have a lot of new products coming online and in particular, even if peginterferon makes it to market, how do we think about margins versus current margins?","Tony Kingsley","Robyn, it's Tony. So look, we're obviously thinking about interferon as a franchise over time, and we'll think about the value proposition of PEGylated interferon in that context. Again, our theory is convenience is an important differentiator and an increasingly important differentiator over time. We have a strong value proposition with AVONEX and the PEN today, a subcutaneous 13 or 26 times per year injectable is very attractive. So you ask could it be the leading interferon. The question I would ask is why couldn't it be the leading injectable. If you look at 13 or 26 times a year with the kind of data we're talking about relative to 365 times a year, also subcutaneous, it's a pretty powerful value proposition.","Paul J. Clancy","And Robyn, I think not too much to report for 2013 on gross margins other than what's in the guidance. Over the longer term, the gross margins are quite healthy now as you know. Over the long term, we actually think we can creep it north of that modestly. BG-12 is a very good kind of cost of goods sold. We expect over time TYSABRI, with bringing on Denmark, that we can move gross margins a little bit more favorable in that dimension. So I think that,that actually over time is a modestly improving story.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Paul, first in terms of the above consensus revenue guidance. The past couple years you've been pretty conservative on this line versus what you've actually delivered, and I was wondering if there's anything different in your process this year as you came up with your 10% year-over-year growth on revenues and whether or not there are any particular lines, line items in your forecast that were particularly different than consensus. And then secondly, for Tony on PEG-Avonex, once that is available, can you talk about how your promotion strategy for the interferon strategy will shift? Is it important to switch the current AVONEX users over to PEG-Avonex? Or is this more about a strategy to compete for new patient starts?","Paul J. Clancy","Yes, thanks, Matt. It's great and probably helpful in terms of clarifying. The consensus is essentially what our plan is for the top line, so I mean, I think I wouldn't stretch it and to say that we've got a lot of conservatism at all built into that. It assumes a little bit of pricing action in the U.S., yet modest. It assumes that we'll solve AIFA at some point during -- the impact during the year. That's not the most meaningful assumption that we have, and we certainly are working hard to do that. If we don't, it's still manageable in the bottom line. It doesn't -- we don't have an assumption in terms of the top line with respect to legislative changes that many of you have or -- and all of us are watching. Dual eligibles is actually a meaningful impact for us on the AVONEX business, and our kind of top line outlook assumes very comparable foreign exchange. So I think it's a pretty fair kind of look at what we think the business is. I would not guide at all to stretch that much further at all.","Tony Kingsley","Matt, it's Tony. In terms of the kind of the strategy for PEGylated interferon, I'd say TBD. Clearly, you'd want to think about capturing new patients with that. We don't have the label, et cetera. Yes, that's a ways off. The pace at which you think about converting a subject to a lot of different factors, well-controlled patients, do you want to move them off therapy, what data will physicians want to be comfortable doing that. There are payer dynamics associated with that. So lots to work out on that front, but again, from a franchise standpoint, this is good news.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","A question for Dr. Dawson or Tony. So you guys have launched more MS drugs, obviously, than anyone, but when you look at the launch of TECFIDERA this time around and you look at the reimbursement, the payer landscape and different EU pricing bands, are there things today, particularly o U.S., that are different than a couple years ago? How are you thinking about that as we model or you model internally?","Tony Kingsley","Yes, good question, Michael. So look, the couple of macro things that are different is the class is getting more crowded, right? There are more -- there have already been more entrants. Anticipate more entrants. So payers around the world are obviously focused on a class because there are more things to look at. The second is I think Paul has been pretty transparent. The European pricing environment has been very difficult in the last couple of years, and we think there's going to continue to be meaningful pressure on prices in general as the European economy continues to struggle. So if you think about it, the differentials between U.S. pricing and largely, European pricing are getting greater than they have, and both those factors seem to be moving in the direction that would increase those over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rachel McMinn with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to clarify, Paul, a couple of things you said. On your AVONEX guidance, should we look to the 7% to 8% sales growth we've seen over the last 2 years and think about that as an accurate number to go forward? Or just you actually mean that sales would be flat? And then on BG-12, with your comment about Germany, will you be able to launch rapidly after approval? Or is there just a prolonged period where we should we be thinking about revenues more weighted towards the back half in Germany for TECFIDERA?","Paul J. Clancy","Yes. No. Rachel, thanks for the clarification. No, AVONEX we actually think is a pretty comparable year-over-year number. So more flat on a year -- from a total revenue perspective. Tony?","Tony Kingsley","Yes, from a launch standpoint, we think mechanically we should be able to launch relatively quickly in Germany. As I think you know, the AMNOG process, which is the reimbursement process in Germany, allows you free pricing for, I think, the first 12 months. So you can get to market while you are negotiating that, and then you may be subject to some adjustments to that later, but no, no barriers to keep us from getting on the ground relatively quickly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Was just wondering in terms of PEG-Avonex, can you make any comments about the tolerability of that drug relative to weekly AVONEX? And then on the patent side, anything else beyond the patent that you mentioned today that we should think about for BG-12?","Douglas Edward Williams","This is Doug. I'll go ahead and speak to the tolerability issue. I think what we've reported thus far is that tolerability issues are pretty comparable to what's been seen with other interferons. There were some flu-like symptoms that were seen, some injection site reactions. We'll actually be reporting a lot more information at AAN. We're still in the process of doing some of that analysis work to look at things like duration of flu-like symptoms and don't have that data yet. But what I can say is that discontinuation rates were very low in the study, which would suggest that the flu-like symptoms, even if patients had them, were not an impediment to them staying on the study drug through the conduct of the clinical trial. So we feel like we've got a molecule that has a very solid efficacy profile and one that, tolerability wise, looks not dissimilar from the existing AVONEX molecule. But we'll have a lot more data for you at the AAN.","George A. Scangos","Yes, on the IP front, you can assume that there are other things that we are doing. This is obviously a very important franchise for us, and we're working on a number of factors. This -- the 480 patent is pending in the EU as well. And so we haven't spoken too much publicly about what else we're doing, so we'll leave that alone for now.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Marshall Urist with Morgan Stanley.","Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So a couple of things. Number one, Paul, just to clarify, I know this has been asked a couple different ways but just to be absolutely clear on guidance, so it sounds like from what you're saying, if you're guiding to 10% revenue growth on flat AVONEX and flat RITUXAN, then is it as we all try and kind of back into the TECFIDERA number, then it's basically just TYSABRI, whatever TYSABRI growth, whatever the settlement in Italy is worth incrementally? Are there -- and then so nothing else, it sounds like from your comments it's just those plus TECFIDERA to get to the 10%. And then second, just as we think about patient flow models, it sounds like you guys are thinking the discontinuation rates early on will be higher than what we saw in Phase III and then eventually that should settle or improve as the launch moves on. And then, Paul, just lastly, what are your updated thoughts on accounting also for the BG-12 milestones and royalties?","Paul J. Clancy","Yes, let me take the first and third. Probably too much of a shorthand everybody's jumping to already. So we actually do think actually TYSABRI continues in a growth year. So growth there, as well as kind of AIFA, our kind of royalty line and corporate partner revenue line actually expands a bit. So I think we're probably being a little bit more cautious and believe to be more cautious on BG-12 than kind of what -- and that has got nothing to do with the longer-term prospects of what we think about the drug over the long haul, just kind of the dynamics of the first year launch. With respect to -- I'll jump to the third part of your question, Marshall, which we expect to the accounting for the BG-12 contingent payments, no change. So that was -- we're kind of being very, very consistent with the way we've treated purchase accounting that it does not impact the non-GAAP P&L, but it certainly is something to be accounted for. It impacts the cash flow statement. They are very, very meaningful, so certainly want to be very cognizant of them.","Tony Kingsley","Marshall, it's Tony. In terms of the actual real-world experience with discount rates and compliance versus other things like that, we don't know until we get into the real world. We think we have an idea of where that will come out, but we're going to monitor it very closely, and as Paul said, we'll have programs in place to try to address issues that we see on that front. But we'll be all over it as we launch and tracking it and seeing what we can do to improve issues that come up.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to our presenters for any closing remarks.","George A. Scangos","Okay. Thank you, all, for listening to the call today. I appreciate the questions, and we'll get back to work and hopefully deliver a great 2013. Thanks.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"3575":["Biogen Inc.

[Operator Instructions] Please limit yourself to one question to allow other participants time for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Biogen CEO, Michel Vounatsos. You may begin your conference.","Michel Vounatsos","Thank you. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. I would like to start by thanking Matt Calistri for nearly four years he spent leading our Investor Relations program. We wish him the very best in this next endeavor.","I would like to welcome Joe Mara, our new Vice President and Head of Investor Relations, who is a talented and energized finance and business leader with over 12 years of experience at Biogen across a number of functions. I am confident that Joe will prove to be a valuable resource for the investment community and I look forward to all of you getting to know Joe.","Joe the floor is yours. Welcome.","Joe Mara","Thank you, Michelle. And welcome everyone to Biogen's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. I look forward to getting to know all of you over the coming months.","Before I begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the earnings release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in tables one and two and table three includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We've also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call.","I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail.","On today's call I am joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Michel Vounatsos; Dr. Michael Ehlers, EVP of the Research and Development; and our CFO, Jeff Capello. We will also be joined for the Q&A portion of the call by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Al Sandrock.","Now, I will turn the call back over to Michel.","Michel Vounatsos","Thank you, Joe. Now let me begin with some financial highlights. Compared to the same period a year ago, Biogen delivered solid topline and bottom line growth. Second quarter revenues grew 8% to $3.6 billion.","Second quarter GAAP earnings per share grew 88% to $7.85 and non-GAAP EPS grew 58% to $9.15. Based on our strong performance year-to-date and our dated outlook for the second half of the year, we are raising our full year financial guidance, which Jeff will discuss in more details.","Now let me review the highlights from the second quarter. First, revenues from our MS core business, including OCREVUS royalties increased 3% versus the prior year to $2.4 billion. Excluding OCREVUS, the total number of patients on our MS products globally grew in the low single digits versus the prior year. Critically, we are focused on addressing the IP challenge with TECFIDERA, while also preparing for the expected launch of VUMERITY towards the end of the year.","Second, SPINRAZA global revenues grew 15% to $488 million driven by year-over-year revenue growth both in the US and outside the US. The number of commercial patients on SPINRAZA increased by approximately 12% from last quarter and we now have approximately 8400 patients on SPINRAZA, including the Expanded Access Program and clinical trial.","Within the US, the number of SPINRAZA patients increased by approximately 4% versus Q1 which we believe demonstrates the potential for continued patient growth in the more mature markets.","We were very proud to announce new data for the neutral study of SPINRAZA. We have continued to generate long-term data across broad patient populations which underscore the compelling safety and efficacy profile of SPINRAZA.","Many are focused on the potential of new competition for SPINRAZA. While we welcome new options for patients, we believe it is premature to make assumptions about the ultimate uptake of emerging modalities given the large number of outstanding questions on the clinical profiles. Importantly, sorry, SPINRAZA remains the only SMA therapy approved for all age groups.","Third, our biosimilars revenue grew 45% year-over-year to $184 million. We continue to deliver on our broad portfolio of anti-TNFs including the strong launch of IMRALDI, the market-leading biosimilar referencing in HUMIRA Europe. We estimate that the uptake of our biosimilars products will contribute up to $1.8 billion in healthcare savings across Europe in 2019, an important contribution to the long-term sustainability of the European healthcare systems that Biogen is proud to contribute to. We believe this business continues to demonstrate a strong trajectory with the potential to continue to drive growth.","Fourth, we make continuous progress to develop and expand our pipeline as we work to build a multi-franchise portfolio. We added four clinical programs to our pipeline this quarter, including the two mid to late stage ophthalmology gene therapy programs we acquired through Nightstar, also an oral BTK for MS and an oral compound for sporadic ALS.","In total, we have added 17 clinical programs over the past two and a half years as we have materially expanded and diversified our pipeline which now includes 27 clinical programs. Mike, will provide more details on the development across our entire pipeline.","Fifth, we maintain our diligent focus on capital allocation to maximize potential shareholder returns. During the second quarter, we generated $2 billion in cash flow from operations and we benefited from the expiration of the contingent payments related to TECFIDERA.","In the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 10.4 million shares at an average price of $231 per share for a total of $2.4 billion. As we have stated previously, we view share repurchase as an important element of thoughtful and value creating capital allocation.","But at the same time, we have the financial flexibility and capacity to continue to evaluate potential external business development and M&A opportunities as evidenced by the 11 deals we executed over the past 2.5 years, including our recent acquisition of Nightstar.","As we have demonstrated, we are committed to maximizing returns for our shareholders, while continuing to bring innovative service to patients something that demands a thoughtful approach towards all our investments over both the short and the long-term.","In summary, Biogen continue to execute on our strategic objectives. We delivered solid financial results, raised our full year 2019 financial guidance, continue to progress our pipeline and we\u2019re opportunistic and discipline with capital allocation.","Our core MS business demonstrated resilience and delivered an all-time high quarterly revenues. SPINRAZA continue to grow into key markets, including mature markets such as the US and we presented compelling new data for the NURTURE study.","We grew our biosimilars business driven by strong launch of IMRALDI. We added four new clinical programs to our pipeline and we generated significant cash as we focus on strategic - strategically allocating capital towards the areas we believe have the highest potential return.","Before I conclude, I would like to discuss how Biogen is evolving its strategy to drive long-term growth. Together with our Board of Directors, we have reflected on the opportunities before us and we continue to believe that the core focus on neuroscience will lead to long-term shareholder value creation based on the large and growing epidemiology, breaking science and our deep neuroscience expertise and core capabilities.","With that said, we are refining the five strategic priorities we outlined two years ago. Our overarching goals are to enhance our focus on our current commercial business, accelerate the areas with the most attractive opportunities to build new franchises, rebalance the risk reward profile of our pipeline, prioritize our investment based on clinical data and widen our lens to new therapeutic areas.","Our first priority remains unchanged to maintain long-term leadership in MS and maximize the resilience of that franchise. Our second priority is to build out a broader leading franchise in our muscular disorders. We aim to bid [ph] on SPINRAZA as the most successful rare disease launch ever as we pursue multiple potential therapies for ALS, as well as in muscle strengthening program with potential applicability across a broad range of neuromuscular diseases.","We have reported very encouraging results for tofersen in SOD1 ALS, and we believe this has positive implication for our broader portfolio targeting order form of the disease.","Our third priority is to continue developing and expanding our neuroscience portfolio, while now also widening our lens to selectively follow the science into therapeutic adjacencies including immunology. Mike will provide more details on our strategy in R&D.","Our fourth priority is to unlock the potential of biosimilars as a continued growth driver as we work to create financial headroom for innovation in the healthcare system. We aim to both increase the size of our biosimilars portfolio and expand geographically.","And fifth in parallel, we will continue to drive efficiencies including adopting digitalization in our operating model through continuous improvement and we will be diligent in capital allocation as we aim to maximize returns for shareholders. We believe these priorities reflect both the recent progress we made and the most attractive opportunities ahead of us.","We are working diligently to rebalance the risk profile of our pipeline leading us to prioritize the areas we believe have the greatest probability of success and highest potential return.","Overall Biogen's purpose remains the same. We aim to transform patient\u2019s life by pioneering and leading neuroscience and therapeutic adjacencies.","I will now turn the call over to Mike for a more detailed update on our recent progress and long-term strategy in R&D.","Michael Ehlers","Thank you, Michel. And good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with the progress in our industry-leading neuroscience pipeline and with our expanding efforts in immunology. Illustrating the momentum in our portfolio, we look forward to 10 mid to late-stage readouts over the next 18 months.","As Michel mentioned, our top priorities are to continue strengthening our franchise in MS and neuromuscular disorders. Beyond these priorities we are refining the emphasis within our core and emerging areas.","To that end based on the opportunities we see following our acquisition of Nightstar Therapeutics, we now view ophthalmology as a core growth area. Moreover, recognizing the potential of our existing assets and long-standing expertise in immunology we can now consider this to be an emerging growth area.","Diving in, let me begin with advances we made in the second quarter to secure long-term scientific leadership in our MS and neuromuscular franchises. At the annual meetings at the American Academy of Neurology and the consortium of multiple sclerosis centers, we presented new interim data from EVOLVE MS-1, an ongoing single-arm open-label 2-year Phase III study, evaluating the safety and efficacy of diroximel fumarate to be marketed as VUMERITY if approved by the FDA in patients with relapsing-remitting MS.","Interim results in 696 MS patients showed that treatment with diroximel fumarate was associated with a 79% reduction in the annualized relapse rate over one year when compared to baseline, with an 83% reduction in newly diagnosed patients.","The mean number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions in patients treated with diroximel fumarate was reduced by 77% compared to baseline in the total population and by 96% in newly diagnosed patients.","Over one year the rate of gastrointestinal adverse events leading to discontinuation was 0.7%. GI tolerability of diroximel fumarate versus TECFIDERA is been evaluated in the ongoing EVOLVE MS-2 study. This study is now near completion and we expect results in coming weeks.","I am also pleased to announce that we have dosed the first subject in the Phase I study of BIIB091, a highly potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase or BTK.","BTK is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that regulates development and signaling of B cells and myeloid cells that are hypothesized to contribute to the pathogenesis of MS. Notably BIIB091 is in non-covalent innovator of BTK which we believe together with its high potency and selectivity has a potentially best-in-class profile.","This placebo-controlled single and multiple ascending dose study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of BIIB091 in healthy adults.","Turning to our progress in neuromuscular disorders. At the Cure SMA Annual Conference and the 5th Congress of the European Academy of Neurology, we presented new interim data from the NURTURE study of SPINRAZA in presymptomatic infants with SMA. Now including up to 45 months of analysis, this ongoing open-label study once again highlighted the remarkable efficacy profile of SPINRAZA.","Specifically, of the 25 presymptomatic patients with SMA treated with SPINRAZA in this study 100% were alive, none required tracheostomy or permanent ventilation. 100% were sitting independently and 92% were walking independently or with assistance.","In addition, patients were approaching the maximum score of 64 on the CHOP INTEND measure of motor function. At last visit, patients with three SMN2 copies achieved a mean score of 63.4 out of 64 and patients with two SMN2 achieved a mean score of 62.1 out of 64.","Importantly, these data also showed that the overwhelming majority of patients had achieved these motor milestones within the timeframe of normal development.","Given the robust, durable efficacy of SPINRAZA across a broad range of SMA patients, its well established longer-term safety profile with the reversible targeted mechanism of action and unsurpassed real-world experience, we believe SPINRAZA will remain a foundation of care in SMA for years to come.","Moreover, we believe that SPINRAZA demonstrates the transformative potential of antisense oligonucleotide therapies to dramatically alter the course of diseases of the nervous system. We are excited by the depth of our ASO pipeline targeting the genetic underpinnings of a range of neurological diseases such as ALS.","Specifically, as we described during our recent ALS webcast, we are targeting genetic forms of ALS where modulation of genetic target is causally linked to disease. For instance, we continue to advance the Phase 3 VALOR study of tofersen, an antisense oligonucleotide designed to degrade SOD1 mRNA and SOD1 ALS. We believe that this study has the potential to support registration for this devastating genetic form of ALS.","We have now finalized the Phase 3 study design, which includes 99 patients treated with 100 milligram tofersen or placebo. Over the course of this 20 weeks \u2013 28 week study, patients will receive three loading doses over the first 29 days, followed by maintenance doses every four weeks. Based on the final stage three study design, we expect a readout from this study in 2021.","We also continue to advance the Phase 1 study of BIIB078, an antisense oligonucleotide targeting hexanucleotide repeat expansions in C9ORF72, the most common genetic cause of ALS. Data from this study are also expected in 2021.","Further, we are pursuing novel scientifically driven drug targets for the larger opportunity in sporadic ALS. To this end, I am pleased to announce that the first patient was dosed in the Phase 1 study of BIIB100 for sporadic ALS last month.","BIIB100 is a small molecule inhibitor of exportin 1 or XPO1, a nuclear transport factor that mediates the export of many proteins from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm.","With BIIB100, we aim to test the hypothesis that reducing nucleoprotein export may prevent the formation of neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions and thereby slow the clinical progression of sporadic ALS.","In movement disorders, the Phase 2 study of our anti-tau antibody BIIB091 or gosuranemab in progressive supranuclear palsy is fully enrolled with data expected in the second half of this year. We believe the positive data from this study could potentially support a regulatory filing.","Also this quarter we completed enrollment of the Phase 2 study of BIIB054, a monoclonal antibody targeting extracellular alpha-synuclein for Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is the second common neurodegenerative disorder with the prevalence of approximately three million patients across the G7 and no available treatment to slow its inexorable progression.","Aggregation of misfolded alpha-synuclein and degeneration of nigro-striatal dopaminergic neurons represents hallmark pathologies of Parkinson\u2019s disease and genetic data from familial Parkinson\u2019s disease shows that alpha-synuclein can play a causal role in Parkinson\u2019s disease pathogenesis.","In the second half of next year, we expect to receive data from the one year placebo-controlled period of this study. This will include safety data as well as a neuro imaging-based assessment of striatal dopamine transporter density.","Beyond BIIB054, we expect advance up to two new antisense oligonucleotide programs for Parkinson\u2019s disease into the clinic by the end of the year. And in Alzheimer's disease and dementia, this quarter our collaboration partner, Eisai, dosed the first patient in the Phase 3 study of BAN2401 for early Alzheimer\u2019s disease and continued to advance the Phase 3 study for Elenbecestat, also for early Alzheimer's disease.","In parallel, we continue to advance our portfolio of tau-directed therapeutics including gosuranemab in Phase 2, BIIB076, a distinct anti-tau antibody in Phase 1, and BIIB080, an antisense oligonucleotide targeting tau mRNA currently in Phase 1, being developed in collaboration with Ionis Pharmaceuticals.","Further, we are advancing a suite of next-generation preclinical programs pursuing genetically validated targets for defined subsets of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia patients.","Moving to neurocognition, we continue to advance the Phase 2b study of BIIB104 for the treatment of cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia. Last month the FDA granted fast track designation to BIIB104 for this indication.","BIIB104 is a first-in-class AMPA receptor potentiator that we believe has compelling data from a number of distinct early clinical studies. Data from this Phase 2b study are expected in late 2020.","As I mentioned earlier, we view immunology as an emerging growth area for Biogen that takes advantage our long-standing in-house expertise in this area. This quarter we completed enrollment of the Phase 2 study of BIIB059, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds BDCA2 for cutaneous lupus erythematosus, or CLE and systemic lupus erythematosus, or SLE.","As shown in the Phase 1 study of BIIB059 recently published in the General of Clinical Investigation, treatment with BIIB059 led to BDCA2 internalization on plasmacytoid dendritic cells, as well as decrease interferon pathway activation, reduced immune infiltrates and skin lesions, and decreased cutaneous disease activity in patients with SLE and CLE.","With limited available treatment options and a prevalence of approximately 800,000 patients across the G7, we aim to bring forward a potentially new disease modifying therapy to this area of high unmet need. Data from this study are expected by the end of this year.","Further, in collaboration with UCB, we plan to initiate a Phase 3 program with the - in the first half of next year for dapirolizumab pegol, an anti-CD40 ligand pegylated fab in patients with active SLE despite standard-of-care treatment.","This decision is based on the promising results of the Phase 2b clinical trial. Interim data from this study were presented at the European Congress of Rheumatology last month.","As part of the ongoing process of balancing risk and opportunity within our pipeline, we continue to strategically prioritize our programs and disease areas. To that end, we have decided not to initiate the Phase 3 trials for Vixotrigine or BIIB074 in trigeminal neuralgia this year, although we will continue with Phase 3 preparation activities in advance of a potential initiation next year.","We will continue to evaluate our trigeminal neuralgia program and we will assess the potential initiation of Phase 3 studies next year. We continue to advance the Phase 2 study of Vixotrigine in small fiber neuropathy and now expect to readout from that study in 2021.","In addition, we continue to enroll the Phase 3 study of BIIB093 for the prevention and treatment of severe cerebral edema in patients with large hemispheric infarction with the potential launch as early as 2022. We also expect a Phase 2 readout of TMS007 in acute ischemic stroke by the end of next year.","Finally, emphasizing our focus on genetically validated targets in defined patient populations to rebalance pipeline risk, let me conclude by highlighting our recent acquisition of Nightstar Therapeutics.","We are extremely excited to join forces with this talented team of drug developers to address serious genetic causes of blindness for which there are no current treatment options. This acquisition accelerates our entry into ophthalmology with the potential to deliver first-in-class gene therapies to patients suffering from severe retinal diseases.","Our lead drug candidate, NSR-REP1 now known as BIIB111 is an AAV-based gene therapy delivered by targeted sub-retinal injection for the treatment of choroideremia, a rare degenerative disease that inevitably leads to blindness, for which there are no current therapies.","In Phase 1\/2 trials, treatment with BIIB111 via subretinal injection was associated with the higher rate of maintained vision and in a subset of patients, a meaningful improvement in visual acuity, suggesting that BIIB111 has the potential to significantly alter the course of this disease. We expect data from the Phase 3 STAR trial of BIIB111 in the second half of next year.","Our second clinical stage asset NSR-RPGR now known as BIIB112 is an AAV-based gene therapy targeting X-linked retinitis pigmentosa or XLRP. Like BIIB111, BIIB112 is delivered by targeted subretinal injection.","Data from the Phase 1\/2 dose-escalation study showed promising signals of early efficacy, including increases in central retinal sensitivity as measured by microperimetry. Phase 2\/3 dose expansion study of BIIB112 is currently enrolling with data expected in the second half of next year.","These diseases, which inevitably lead to blindness and the associated severe disability are part of a larger set of inherited retinal diseases which have been estimated to afflict up to 200,000 patients in the U. S. alone that maybe amendable to similar genetic medicine solutions.","We look forward to leveraging our newly acquired leading clinical platform in specialty ophthalmology to potentially expand the future opportunity across inherited retinal diseases.","As Michel mentioned, including our new Nightstar assets, we added four clinical programs to our pipeline this quarter, BIIB111 for choroideremia, BIIB112 for X-linked retinitis pigmentosa, BIIB091, a small molecule BTK inhibitor for MS, and BIIB100, a small molecule XPO1 inhibitor for sporadic ALS.","In total, we have added 17 clinical programs over the past 2.5 years as we have continued to expand our pipeline. And we expect to advance up to three additional programs into the clinic in the second half of this year, including up to two new antisense oligonucleotide programs for Parkinson\u2019s disease.","As we widen our strategic lens, we will continue to mitigate risk by seeking later stage assets, prioritizing targets that have been validated by human genetics, deploying biomarkers in early stage clinical programs and leveraging our asymmetric capabilities and expertise in neuroscience.","With 10 mid to late stage readouts over the next 18 months including 8 Phase II readouts the Phase III readout of BIIB111 and head-to-head data for VUMERITY, we believe we are poised to reinforce our core franchises in MS and neuromuscular disorders build for their depth in our neuroscience portfolio and followed the science into emerging areas.","Above all, we remain focused on our goal of developing transformative medicines from patients living with devastating neurological diseases. ","I will now pass the call to Jeff.","Jeffrey Capello","Thanks, Mike. Good morning everyone. I'll now review our financial performance for the second quarter 2019 starting with revenues. As Michel mentioned earlier, we had a very strong Q2, 2019 from a revenue perspective.","Total revenues for the second quarter grew 8% year-over-year to approximately $3.6 billion. Overall our MS business delivered revenues of approximately $2.4 billion in the second quarter 2019, including OCREVUS royalties of approximately $183 million, growing 3% versus the prior year. Global MS revenues in Q2 2019 were stable versus the prior year without OCREVUS royalties.","US MS revenues in Q2, 2019 were impacted by a decrease in channel inventory of approximately $25 million compared to a decrease of approximately $50 million in Q2, 2018 and a decrease of approximately $175 million in Q1, 2019. In addition this quarter we benefited from lower than anticipated discounts and allowances, which is not expected to continue for the rest of the year.","Global second quarter TECFIDERA revenues increased 6% versus the prior year driven by revenue growth both in the U.S. and outside the US. U.S. TECFIDERA revenues were impacted by decrease in channel inventory for approximately $10 million in the second quarter 2019 compared to a decrease of approximately $40 million in Q2, 2019 and a decrease of approximately $110 million in Q1, 2019.","We were pleased to see a continued increase in the share of new prescriptions for TECFIDERA in US and for the second consecutive quarter our share of new prescriptions exceeded our share of total prescriptions. Additionally, our share of new prescriptions in the US for TECFIDERA is now its highest point since the launch of OCREVUS.","Outside the US, TECFIDERA performed very well in Q2, 2019 with continued volume increases across all large European markets and Japan versus the prior year somewhat offset by pricing pressure in several European countries. In total TECFIDERA delivered strong global patient growth of approximately 8% year-over-year.","Q2 Global interferon revenues including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY and decreased 11% versus the second quarter of 2018 due to the continuing shifts from the injectable platforms to oral or high-efficacy therapies.","Within the US AVONEX and PLEGRIDY were impacted by decrease in channel inventory of approximately $5 million compared to a decrease of approximately $10 million in Q2, 2018 and a decrease of approximately $50 million in Q1, 2019. Outside the US, interferon revenues benefited by approximately $10 million with channel dynamics within Europe.","TYSABRI worldwide revenues increased 2% versus the second quarter of 2018. Within the US, TYSABRI revenues were impacted by a decrease in channel inventory of approximately $10 million compared to relatively stable levels in Q2 2018 and a decrease of approximately $15 million in Q1 2019. We were pleased to see stability in TYSABRI revenues in the US along with growth outside the US versus the prior year.","We believe the recent launch of Mayzent has primarily impacted GILENYA so far with minimal impact on TECFIDERA and TYSABRI in the second quarter. Overall, we were pleased with the execution of our MS franchise and a strong performance of our MS business in the second quarter. We continue to be focused on maintaining resilience and MS market leadership.","Let me now move onto SPINRAZA. Global second quarter SPINRAZA revenues increased 15% versus the prior year to $488 million. In the US revenues increased 12% versus the second quarter 2018 and 3% versus Q1 2019, driven by continued patient growth, which we believe demonstrates that SPINRAZA has the potential for continued steady growth in larger more mature markets.","The number of patients on therapy in the US increased 4% as compared to the end of the first quarter of 2019. Since its approval in late May, we have not seen a meaningful impact from Zolgensma on SPINRAZA performance in US. As a reminder, Zolgensma is only indicator for children under two years old, which represents approximately 5% of the prevalent market.","In the US, we continue to make strong progress with adults. In the second quarter, we were pleased to see approximately 50% of new starts were adults and the number of adult patients in the US increased by approximately 7% versus the first quarter 2019.","We still believe there is a large opportunity remaining, as we\u2019ve only reached approximately 20% of the adults in the US. And as a reminder, this is the largest patient segment representing approximately 60% of the SMA market.","In the US, we observed discontinuation rate is relatively low, currently in the mid-single digits on an annualized basis. Outside the US revenues increased 19% for the second quarter 2018, driven by continued new country launches and increased penetration across all major geographies.","In total, outside the US, the number of commercial SPINRAZA patients increased approximately 17% versus the prior quarter. We recorded revenues from over 40 international markets in the second quarter. During the past quarter, we secured broad reimbursement in the UK, Ireland and Argentina. As a reminder, we believe the global opportunity for SPINRAZA is significant and even greater than we had initially anticipated. We estimate that there are over 45,000 individuals with SMA in the markets where Biogen has a direct presence, including attractive markets of Asia Pacific and Latin America.","Versus Q1 2019, ex-US revenues decreased 13%. As we previously mentioned on our last earnings call, Q1 revenues benefited from a positive pricing adjustment of $14 million in France and the timing of shipments across several international markets, which can be lumpy at times, affecting the quarter-over-quarter comparison.","In the second quarter, ex-US revenues were also impacted by the continued transition from loading to maintenance doses in more mature markets. Although, overall ex-US revenues declined due to quarterly dynamics - excuse me, we saw quarter-over-quarter patient growth in the mid single digits across the larger more mature European markets, as well as Japan, significant patient growth in Turkey and strong double-digit patient growth across multiple markets in Asia Pacific and Latin America.","Overall, we were pleased to see continued patient growth across the larger mature markets and continued rapid uptick for more recently launched markets. Given our expected continued patient growth and the execution across many global markets, our established product profile and the significant market opportunity, we remain optimistic of our SMA business and its trajectory.","Let me now move on to our biosimilars business, which generated $184 million this quarter, growing 45% versus the prior year. We estimate, there are now over 170,000 patients using our biosimilars in Europe.","BENEPALI has continued to grow in volume and market share across Europe, strengthening its leadership position in markets such as Germany, the UK, Norway and Denmark. We were pleased to report that BENEPALI has now become the number one prescribed embryo biosimilar across the major EU5 markets.","FLIXABI volume grew 96% versus the prior year. IMRALDI volumes grew 40% versus 44% versus Q1 2019 and it continues to be the leading launched HUMIRA biosimilar across Europe.","The IMRALDI autoinjectors have been well received in the market and continues to build on our success with BENEPALI and offering an improved patient experience at a lower price point. In a recent study comparing the IMRALDI autoinjector device with the HUMIRA device, 85% of nurses and 78% of patients prefer the IMRALDI device.","Our biosimilars business along with SPINRAZA has help drive geographic diversification of our revenue base. We aim to continue capitalizing on global growth opportunities for both our current commercial portfolio and our pipeline products.","Total anti-CD20 revenues in Q2 increased 18% versus the prior year, primarily driven by OCREVUS royalties. Q2 OCREVUS royalties benefited by approximately $17 million due to adjustment related to prior periods.","We continue to expect RITUXAN revenues to be impacted by entry of biosimilars in US beginning in the fourth quarter of this year. Total other revenues in the second quarter increased 47% versus the prior year. These revenues tend to be lumpy and difficult to predict.","Let me now turn to gross margin performance. Q2 2019 gross margin was 87%, an improvement versus Q1 2019 following the sale of most of the remaining inventory in the first quarter which carried a very low gross margin.","Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense were both 13% of revenue. Q2 R&D benefited from both savings related to aducanumab, as well as the timing of spend. As a reminder, the second quarter 2018 R&D expense included $324 million related to the upfront payment to Ionis. Q2 GAAP R&D expense also included an additional $162 million related to our equity investment in Ionis.","Q2 GAAP SG&A was 16% of revenue and non-GAAP SG&A was 15% of revenue. The increase in GAAP SG&A expense versus the prior year was primarily due to approximately $33 million in acquisition-related charges incurred in connection with our recent acquisition of Nightstar.","Q2 GAAP other expense was $197 million including $174 million in net losses on investments, principally driven by a decrease in the fair value of our equity investment in Ionis, as well as a realized loss on the sale of Ionis stock versus the prior quarter.","In Q2 2019 non-GAAP, other expense was $19 million. In Q2, our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were both approximately 14%. During the second quarter, we completed the change to our tax profile. This resulted in a decrease of 500 basis points to our GAAP tax rate and a decrease of 430 basis to our non-GAAP tax rate for the second quarter. This benefit is not expected to recur post 2019.","We repurchased approximately 10.4 million shares in the second quarter at an average price of $231 for a total value of approximately $2.4 billion. We completed our 2018 share repurchase authorization. And as of the end of the second quarter, we get approximately $4.1 billion remaining on our 2019 authorization, which now brings us to our diluted earnings per share.","In the second quarter, we booked GAAP EPS of $7.85, an increase of 88% versus the prior year and non-GAAP earnings of $9.15, a 58% increase versus the prior year. As a reminder, Q2 2018 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS were impacted by a total of $2.84 and $1.52, respectively related to BD transactions affecting year-over-year comparisons.","We generated approximately $2 billion of net cash flows from operations in the second quarter and this quarter the continued payments related to TECFIDERA expired. We ended the quarter with approximately $4.3 billion in cash and marketable securities and $5.9 billion in debt.","Let me now turn to our updated full year guidance for 2019. We expect revenues of approximately $14 billion to $14.2 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of approximately 4% to 6%, which is an increase from our initial guidance of 1% to 3% growth. This range is driven primarily by uncertainty in channel inventory levels in the US at the end of the year.","We anticipate GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense between 15.5% and 16.5% of sales, a slight decrease from prior guidance. This reflects a savings from the termination of the Phase 3 studies aducanumab, as well as additional operating expenses for the Nightstar programs we acquired.","We expect GAAP SG&A expense to be approximately 16% to 17% of revenues and non-GAAP SG&A expense to be approximately 15.5% to 16.5% of revenues. We expect our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 17% to 18% and our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 15.5% to 16.5%.","We anticipate full year GAAP diluted EPS of $29.60 to $30.40, representing growth of 37% to 41% versus 2018 and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be $31.50 to $32.30, representing growth of 20% to 23% also an increase versus prior guidance. Of note this guidance does not include any impact from potential acquisitions or large business development transactions as both are hard to predict.","I'll now turn the call back over to Michel for his closing comments.","Michel Vounatsos","Thank you, Jeff. Biogen demonstrated strong commercial execution this quarter and we continue to apply our world class capabilities expertise to progress our pipeline, all while maintaining a diligent focus on continuous improvement and strategic capital allocation.","Between now and the end of 2020, we expect continued progress as we aim to build inventory franchise portfolio, including 10 mid to late stage data readouts in MS, PSP, lupus, epilepsy, Parkinson\u2019s disease, cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia, stroke and ophthalmology, and potential regulatory approval in the US for VUMERITY in MS.","Finally, I want to reiterate our commitment to maximizing returns to our shareholders and bring innovative participation over the long-term. These demands that we continue to allocate capital efficiently, effectively and appropriately. As we have demonstrated in the past, we will always strive to have an optimal capital structure, as well as aim for superior returns from the investment we make.","As we are closing a solid quarter, I would like to step back and comment on what we stand for as a company and how we conduct our business. We believe doing the right things for patients, employees, the environment and the communities we serve will help build sustainable value for all our stakeholders including our investors. After 41 years, we are extremely proud of our track record and commitment to sustainability.","Finally, I would like to thank our employees around the world who are dedicated to making a positive impact on patient's lives and all of the physician, caregivers and participants in our clinical development programs, our past and future achievements could not be realized beyond the passion and commitment.","With that, we will open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan.","Cory Kasimov","Hey. Good morning, guys. And thank you for taking my question. So want to ask about SPINRAZA. And it sounds like there hasn't been an impact thus far from Zolgensma at least to-date. But I am curious if you're seeing any signs of potential warehousing of the minority portion of the SMA patients that are currently eligible for gene therapy?","And how you're thinking about the growth outlook for the product when considering a nice year-over-year jump in sales, but another quarter-over-quarter decline before competition potentially kicks in? Thanks.","Jeffrey Capello","So Cory, this is Jeff. So this point we don't see - we haven't seen any indication that there maybe any warehousing, I mean, it's difficult to tell. But there is no impact at this point in time. I mean, as we mentioned patients were up pretty well year-over-year and they were up sequentially.","And if you look at kind of the larger segment of that patient pool which is the adult segment, it's 60% of the market, we\u2019ve only penetrated 20% of that, and Zolgensma was not indicated for that. So we think there is ample opportunity to grow within the US and continue to kind of post impressive patient numbers.","Outside the US, you know, the opportunity frankly is larger. And if you look at the chart that we put out last quarter, we originally thought that the epidemiology within SMA was 20,000. We now think it\u2019s 45,000. So there is more patients outside the US within the US. We can continue to open up new countries. And our experience in US and in the large European market would indicate that we can continue to kind of penetrate the mature markets and open up new markets. So we think, it's a good growth opportunity in front of us. ","Michel Vounatsos","Mike? ","Michael Ehlers","Yeah, Cory, I\u2019ll add to that. Well, I mean, clinically one thing that's - that you need to consider and this is for what Zolgensma indicated for is the under age two - usually the more severe SMA patients for which time is really critical. We know that the time of treatment even before symptoms but certainly as a function of symptoms stage is really essential. So that would tend clinically to be a very different from a typical kind of scenario where you might be waiting for a different new treatment.","Michel Vounatsos","So let me share the underlying uptake of patients behind this very successful launch is the most, I will say, positive news in mature markets and in emerging geographies where we are gaining access. So we remain confident.","Obviously there are more clinical trials in that space too and it\u2019s still the early days for this new therapeutic alternatives. And we welcome alternative for patients based on the severity of the disease.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a two part. Just wondering Michel or Jeff, if there any original steps you\u2019re considering to bolster your balance sheet here beyond the sale of Hiller\u00f8d facility?","And then you are fairly active on the repo front this quarter. Just - should we expect that pace to continue through the second half of the year? And should we read into it as a sign of your confidence in your TECFIDERA IP? Thanks a lot.","Michael Ehlers","So, one of the many hallmarks of Biogen is a company with very strong cash flows. We generated $3.4 billion of operating cash flow within the first six months and we've now had the expiration of the TECFIDERA Fumapharm payments.","So at this point in time there is really no intent to kind of - if you mean by change the balance sheet, lever up the balance sheet is certainly not the intent. The company generates a lot of cash.","With regard to uses of cash, I think we've been very consistent that our capital allocation strategy is centered around optimizing of the capital allocation to maximize shareholder value and we'll continue to do that and the good thing is we've got ample capacity to do that, either vis-\u00e0-vis share repurchase or continuing to add assets to the clinical pipeline, business development, or M&A. So I would look for us to be active across the board, because we\u2019ll have the capacity, it's very strong company from that perspective.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore.","Umer Raffat","Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. I wanted to focus on TECFIDERA for a second. And it seems that a few ANDA filers have withdrawn their ANDAs and the case has been dismissed under a joint stipulation. So my question is, has there been a formal settlement, because we haven't seen a press release or did those ANDAs just not meet bioequivalence?","Jeffrey Capello","So Umer, this is Jeff. We're not going to comment on the specifics of our IP situation, only to say that, as Michelle has said, a lot of interest in kind of getting it resolved.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink.","Geoffrey Porges","Thank you very much for taking the question. And congratulations on the good numbers in the quarter. I suppose, I have to ask follow-up on aducanumab. Previously, you disclosed that you are continuing to monitor the patients in the study and to see whether there was any evidence of clinical effect from the - in the pivotal studies with prolonged exposure. Could you share with us what you have found with that extended follow-up?","And secondly, in that context, how much are you continuing to invest in the amyloid hypothesis and particularly in 2401 and Elenbecestat, could you kind of reconcile those two for us? Thanks.","Michel Vounatsos","Geoff, thank you for asking this important question. Obviously, since we did not present at AIC it is clear to everybody that we are not ready. We are not finished with our analysis of the data, first available at the cutoff date of the futility analysis, but also the data that is coming after the cutoff date of the futility.","So Biogen said and will continue to follow the science and these analyses have critical importance, as you can imagine, for the patients, for the community, for public health and also for all the stakeholders. And at the same time, Biogen is trying to new frontiers, which is difficult to define.","So we will present the results of ENGAGE and EMERGE studies at the future medical meetings and I hope you appreciate that we cannot say much more at this stage.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies.","Michael Yee","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Appreciate the question. I had a question for Al Sandrock if he's there, or Mike, but that was regarding the comments around BIIB092 the tau PSP study. I know you completed enrollment, I guess, late fall last year, so the data is coming like you alluded to. Maybe just talk to how we should put into context the Phase 2b? How much confidence you would have on the end point, but perhaps more importantly, if there are pre-specified endpoints you're looking at sub-groups? What's important to you define supporting the tau hypotheses for tauopathies or more importantly Alzheimer's? Thanks so much.","Al Sandrock","Yeah. Michael, this is Al. So the - we've been saying that the results will be available at the \u2013 later this year toward the end of this year. As you know, in the earlier phase studies we showed about 90% decrease in CSF-free tau. And so we definitely have target engagement, because the antibody was given intravenously and we looked in the CSF at tau.","So we have target engagement in CNS. What we're hoping to see is an effect on the rating scale for PSP, which is not that different from the Parkinson's rating scale. As you know, there are - it has many of the - shares many of the features of Parkinson's disease, but there are some additional features that relate to PSP that will also be measured.","And yeah, the big question right now is we have target engagement. We have lowered CSF tau. We're hoping to catch the tau as it spreads. The abnormally - the misfolded tau that spreads from cell-to-cell, there is a lot of great data that - there's prime like propagation in the CNS and PSP and in other tauopathies and we\u2019ll see whether or not we catch it as it tries to spread and have a clinical effect.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein.","Ronny Gal","Good morning. And thank you for taking my question. Just couple of quick things on pipeline. On the PSP trial just following on Cory, how many of those patients had tau in their brain imaging? I know that wasn't available ahead of the trial, but I suspect you did it during the trial.","And second Mike I noticed your investment in Skyhawk couple of weeks ago. Care to share with your roughly how long before you'll have an oral SME product in the clinic?","Michael Ehlers","Okay. Yes, thanks for the question. I'll take both of those. First of all, just one point of clarification with tauopathy and PSP. The current PET imaging tracers for tau don't recognize the form of tau that accumulates in PSP, recognizes the form of tau that accumulates in Alzheimer's disease. This has to do with three hour versus four hour tau. So just to clarify that. None of them would have been imaged because there hasn't been an ability to image tau in the brain before that.","On Skyhawk, yeah, that collaboration is proceeding very nicely. We\u2019re working on several targets with them. We are zeroing in on potential new clinical candidates. We don't have a timeline just yet, but I would say that we're very, very happy with the progress on many targets in this way and we hope to get some to the clinic over the next couple of years let's say.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen and Company.","Phil Nadeau","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just one question on the EVOLVE MS2 trial, you mentioned that data is going to be next few weeks. Could you do remind us to design of the study? And in particular aside from GI tolerability, what other data is going to be disclosed in the top-line release? And how you would frame risk-benefit just like you come of the space, so what would be a meaningful GI tolerability improvement in your mind?","Al Sandrock","Hi, Phil. This is Al Sandrock. So, it's basically a head-to-head study against TECFIDERA. The primary outcome measure is a patient-reported outcome on GI tolerability and we\u2019re looking at essentially all aspects of GI tolerability, whether it's upper or lower, the severity, the duration and hopefully what we'll get at the end of it is an incidents, the idea of the difference in the incidence of GI tolerability events between comparison with TECFIDERA, as well as severity.","And talking to our - the prescribers, the MS prescribers, incidence is probably the most important thing. Although, ultimately, you want to try to improve compliance, so we'll also be looking at things like discontinuation rate and which as Mike said in the EVOLVE 1 study, we had a very low discontinuation rate. So, we\u2019re hopeful that we'll see a nice comparison to TECFIDERA in this EVOLVE 2 study.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Harrison","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to follow-up on something Phil said. Can you just talk if you are able to achieve the profile that you've talked about with VUMERITY in terms of, let's say, lowering your incidence? I mean, how does that impact how do you think about the drug commercially. Would you expect to be able to try and switch TECFIDERA patients who are already stable, and because I know mostly GI effects come early in drug or how should we think about VUMERITY commercially if you are able to achieve that profile? Thanks.","Michel Vounatsos","So thanks for the good question. Obviously, we need to consider the outset that the patients on TEC after the four, five, first weeks are stabilized that they are doing fine. So the strategy is not to switch, the strategy is to expand.","Al Sandrock","Yeah, I mean most physicians that I talked to would not want to switch somebody who is done well, who stabilized the initial phases of taking TECFIDERA and or doing well in terms of tolerability. Of course, if there is breakthrough disease you would consider switching probably to a different mechanism of action.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Salim Syed with Mizuho.","Salim Syed","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Mike or Al, I had a question for you actually. You guys have mentioned in the past, I believe that you are looking at new MS targets. And I was curious what your thoughts were on EBV as a target? Thank you.","Michael Ehlers","Yeah. So, this is Mike. Look I'll say this has been a long-standing interesting hypothesis. We've really rejuvenated our effort on early targets in MS and novel target including something that might be virally based and other sales based.","So early days in a lot of that. But we've created a new highly dedicated group, focused on early stage MS research in novel mechanisms. And so where we see an opportunity, independent of modality we will advance that.","Al Sandrock","The EBV is a very interesting virus, so if you look at epidemiological studies and MS, particularly out of Harvard School of Public Health. There is a strong implication that EBV infection precedes the onset of MS. It's very tantalizing that the B-cell follicles that are in CNS in the sub-meningeal space generally they are EBV positive.","EBV effects B-cell function and B-cells are, obviously, important in MS as seen by all the drugs that are directed against B-cells, ocrelizumab and BTK inhibitors have seem to have efficacy.","So, I think in some ways EBV is very interesting as a causal virus. However, in terms of treatment, once the virus activates the immune system toward an autoimmune state, I don't know whether getting rid of the virus will help. These B-cell follicles molecules in the CNS, perhaps getting rid of the EBV positive B-cells there maybe helpful. But treating the virus itself, you'd have to design a study very, very early, perhaps even before MS even starts.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets.","Brian Abrahams","Hi, there. Thanks for taking my question. Appreciate the strategic updates, and congrats to Joe on his new role. You talked about immunology as more formalized area of focus. I was wondering if you can speak a little bit broadly about how you plan to approach the space, maybe which of your assets you expect to prioritize? And then potential BD and future commercial strategy that you're thinking about within immunology? Thanks.","Michael Ehlers","Sure, Brian. This is Mike. I'll start out with that. So we are very happy about this where we're going to start with focus is where we've got existing assets and or expertise. By and large right now that\u2019s really going to start with our lupus program it include BIIB059, the BDCA2 antibody and dapirolizumab pegol, this anti-CD40 ligand Fab.","And from that we will look at things that touch on that either within that indication space or perhaps in and around those mechanisms to expand. It will start with those places where we\u2019ve got existing assets and or capability. We think it fits very nicely with a lot of the ongoing programs and things that we're otherwise doing.","It also - I\u2019d say on the business development front does give us an ability to look somewhat more broadly at external opportunities we might be able to use for either early or late supplementation of the pipeline.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Matteis with Stifel.","Paul Matteis","Great. Thanks so much to taking the question. I wanted to ask a question on business development. What is Biogen\u2019s thinking on the ongoing delays with the Roche Spark deal and what that might mean for your ability to do M&A in areas where you already have a strong presence?","For example, you have a pretty broad pipeline and assets either in your pipeline or marketed in a lot of areas of neurology. Does the delay that's going on which seems to be about therapeutic overlap make you at all reluctant to be more aggressive in M&A in areas where you already have a presence? How did this complicate things, if at all? Thanks.","Michel Vounatsos","So it's always difficult to kind of I think what you're getting at is kind of antitrust. I think we will take a careful approach as we look at business development. But we don't see that deterrent, to be active from BD or M&A perspective, we will certainly be careful as kind of look at targets. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Evan Seigerman with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Evan Seigerman","Hi, guys. Thank you for taking the question and congrats on the progress. One for Al and Michael, so with the recent failure of base inhibitor reported by Amgen, Novartis why does Biogen continue to pursue development of Elenbecestat? And generally given the failure of a beta antibodies, what gives you confidence that targeting tau is the right approach for AD?","Michael Ehlers","So Evan, why don't I take the beginning of this? Of course you know, we're highly aware of all the announcements in and around base inhibitors and resent Novartis and Amgen announcement of the termination, they\u2019re discontinuing their base inhibitors. So we're highly aware of this.","I would say patient safety is paramount in our clinical trials, including the Mission AD1 and Mission AD2 trials for the base inhibitor that is being conducted in collaboration with our collaboration partner Eisai. Those studies have independent data in safety monitoring board that reviews the data regularly from those Phase III studies.","And to-date the DSMB has recommended the studies proceed. They have an ability to look at that data when they want and they are certainly aware of the likewise the safety signals and discontinuation of other programs and they will be assessing as it goes along.","As BAN2401, I'll refer back to what Michel commented on earlier, which is that we are in the midst of very thorough analysis of all the ENGAGE and EMERGE data from aducanumab which is an extensive data set and we would like to have a full understanding of that data before we make a specific forward development decisions on BAN2401.","Michel Vounatsos","I think we have time for about two more questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with UBS.","Carter Gould","Great. Thanks, guys. I guess for Michel or Michael, as far as your comments earlier around rebalancing the risk reward of the pipeline it sounded like that was really kind of externally focused, but I wanted to ask if there is any sort of thoughts underway to also revisit maybe our existing programs and any change there in sort of the hurdle for moving programs forward? Any color there would be appreciated? Thank you.","Al Sandrock","Yeah. Carter, good question. So I mean, the few things we would say to maybe flush that out a little bit. I mean, we've had an ongoing effort over some time to really look at the risk reward profile and that means to be able to balance risk in different categories and include things like seeking later stage assets where we can, taking advantage of unique capabilities where we see them leveraging our debt in certain areas like MS and neuromuscular, where we've got very strong franchises, and likewise going after the types of disease where we\u2019ve got high confidence, things where there you've got genetically defined targets and genetically defined patient populations.","And you can see examples of that in our pipeline that have been very intentional. These include things like VUMERITY, as a very good example of rebalancing risk, supporting our MS franchise. I think, you see that within our Nightstar acquisition and the mid to late stage clinical programs in gene therapy there, Choroideremia and X-linked retinitis pigmentosa. And hopefully that came across in my emphasis on our confidence in our ASO platform and ASO programs that we've been advancing collaboration with Ionis.","In addition to that, I think, and Michel spoke to this, we look to our important clinical readouts, our 10 upcoming clinical readouts in the next 18 months as trigger points, to help define and refine the areas that we really want to concentrate resource and activity on in the future.","Michel Vounatsos","If I may just add to the good comments made by Mike, it's also the opportunity to widen the strategic plans and important readouts in the coming months in BIIB059 in lupus. So stay tuned.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Mohit Bansal with Citigroup.","Mohit Bansal","Great. Good morning and thanks for taking my question and a very warm welcome to Joe from our side as well. So quickly on guidance, it appears to be indicating a slight decline or maybe flat revenues in the second half versus the first half. You mentioned inventory.","But could you please provide little bit more granularity on the process or thought process for remainder of the year. Is RITUXAN biosimilar which is the bigger factor here? Thank you.","Michael Ehlers","So we\u2019re not \u2013 we have a policy of kind of giving guidance twice a year and not doing it by the product level, but what I can do is kind of maybe point you to some areas within the historical numbers. Certainly, in the first quarter, Bioverativ inventory sale certainly helped the first quarter inventory growth. You have to look at that. That was a one-time type element. We also, in the second quarter - the MS business was quite strong as a result of the less of an inventory dry down and some gross-to-net favorability, which we don't expect to continue.","And then, two other factors that I would highlight is, SPINRAZA will face some more difficult comparisons in the second half of this year compared to the second - first half of this year. The numbers get bigger. And then finally, the RITUXAN and GAZYVA we've said all along that we expect competition to come in the fourth quarter. So if you look at all those factors, it would indicate there would be little more strength in the first half versus the second half.","Mohit Bansal","Got you. Very helpful. Thank you.","Michael Ehlers","Yeah.","Michel Vounatsos","So thank you all for attending our call today. Another very strong quarter for our company, very exciting times at Biogen nowadays. Thank you.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you.","Claudine Prowse, VP, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Claudine Prowse","Thank you, and welcome to Biogen Idec\u2019s third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogenidec.com to find the press release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures that we\u2019ll discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in tables one and two. Table three includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP better represents the ongoing economics of our business and reflects how we manage the business internally. We\u2019ve also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call.","I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult our SEC filings for additional detail.","On today\u2019s call, I\u2019m joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. George Scangos; Tony Kingsley, our Head of Global Commercial Operations; and our CFO, Paul Clancy; Doug Williams, our Head of R&D; and Al Sandrock, our Chief Medical Officer. Our traveling overseas will be available for Q&A.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to George.","George Scangos","","Okay, thanks Claudine and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Biogen Idec had another great quarter in which our products continued to perform well, and during which we achieved several key milestones. Our underlying business remains strong as we enter into a period of anticipated growth, resulting from the introduction of several new therapies in MS and hemophilia. As Paul will review, third quarter financial performance was strong with 37% growth in revenues and 61% growth in diluted non-GAAP EPS year-over-year.","Our core multiple sclerosis franchise continued to capture share with an increasing number of patients using our therapies. We believe that our product portfolio of disease modifying MS products, including TECFIDERA, TYSABRI, AVONEX, and now PLEGRIDY truly differentiates Biogen Idec as a global leader in the treatment of MS. TECFIDERA continues to gain market share in the U.S. and uptick has been strong in European countries, where it has been launched.","TECFIDERA is the number one oral MS treatment in the U.S. and with many more launches to come around the world, we believe that it has the potential to be a market leader in many countries. According to our estimates, TECFIDERA has treated over 100,000 patients globally within just 18 months of the U.S. launch, and only six months since EU approval. This is an impressive milestone to reach and we believe that it reflects a broad recognition by physicians and patients that TECFIDERA is a unique product that offers strong efficacy with a favorable tolerability and safety profile along with the convenience of oral administration.","We would like to inform you that we have confirmed the case of PML in a patient being treated with TECFIDERA, who recently died from complications of pneumonia. Despite this project loss, we believe that the overall positive benefit risk profile of TECFIDERA remains unchanged. The patient was treated with TECFIDERA for 4.5 years as part of the ENDORSE study. During the course of therapy, the patient experienced severe lymphopenia that lasted for over 3.5 years.","Lymphopenia is a known risk factor for PML, and can be caused by a number of factors including treatments for MS, cancer, HIV. The current TECFIDERA label includes warnings and precautions regarding lymphopenia. We\u2019ve reported the case to the regulatory authorities and we\u2019ll work with them to confirm that the language in our label provides patients and their physicians\u2019 appropriate information regarding lymphopenia.","Moving on, AVONEX continues to be a very strong part of our business, and we believe that the Interferon franchise will continue to remain solid with the anticipated launch of PLEGRIDY in the U.S. With an attractive clinical profile and every two week subcu dosing, we believe that PLEGRIDY has the potential to be the leader in the Interferon class.","We\u2019re optimistic about the future of TYSABRI as physicians continue to view this product as an important high efficacy treatment option. We believe the high level of efficacy, the increasing understanding of the benefits of risk stratification, and the potential of TYSABRI and other indications such as SPMS and Stroke, all bode well for its long-term growth.","We\u2019ve now launched both of our hemophilia therapies, ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE, in the U.S. Although, hemophilia is a new therapeutic area for Biogen, we believe that we\u2019re well-positioned to succeed. We\u2019re the first-to-market with long-acting products and we bring tremendous expertise in Biologics Manufacturing and Process Sciences, and we\u2019ve built a hemophilia organization comprised of many individuals with years of experience in the treatment of hemophilia for communicating the clinical benefit of ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE to physicians.","We continue to advance our R&D efforts. At last month\u2019s ECTRIMS meeting, we highlighted our continued leadership in MS and ongoing commitment through advancing patient care. We presented several analyses of TECFIDERA\u2019s positive real-world patient experience, as well as longer-term data from the ENDORSE study, demonstrating sustained patient efficacy.","ENDORSE data indicated a favorable overall safety profile, including data from some patients who were treated for up to 7.5 years. Other presentations, including data reaffirming the powerful efficacy of TYSABRI, two-year data for PLEGRIDY demonstrating sustained efficacy and a compelling safety profile, full Phase III results for Daclizumab HYP, as well as supportive data for Anti-LINGO in acute optic neuritis.","Our pipeline continues to move forward, and we have strengthened our research and development capabilities even further by hiring a number of highly accomplished scientists. Chris Henderson has joined the Company as Head of Neurology Research. Chris formerly was Professor of Neurology, Pathology, and Cell Biology, Director of the Stem Cell Initiative and Co-Director of the Motor Neuron Center at Columbia University Medical School.","Richard Ransohoff also has joined as Vice President of Neuro-Immunology Research. He previously was Director of the Neuroinflammation Research Center and Professor of Molecular Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic. Don Johns recently joined the Company to head our ALS initiative. Dr. John previously was Head of Neuroscience Translational Medicine at Novartis. And Olivier Danos recently joined Biogen Idec to head Gene Therapy Research. He previously was Senior Vice President at Kadmon Pharmaceuticals and prior to Kadmon led the Gene Therapy Consortium at University College London. With these new hires, we\u2019ve meaningfully strengthened our R&D capabilities in our areas of expertise and natural adjacencies.","Now I\u2019ll pass the call over to Tony.","Tony Kingsley","Thanks, George. Our commercial organization continued to execute and deliver strong results during the third quarter. Starting with MS, during the quarter Biogen Idec executed our MS franchise strategy, and as a result, we continued to grow our global MS market share. TECFIDERA\u2019s launch trajectory in the U.S. was sustained through the third quarter as this therapy continued to grow. TECFIDERA continue to capture share while attracting a broadening set of patients from the MS population.","Year-to-date, our market research suggests that TECFIDERA is capturing approximately a third of all new patient starts and over 40% of patient switching therapies. As a result, we estimate TECFIDERA\u2019s market share in the U.S. ended the quarter in the high-teens.","Outside of the U.S., the roll out of TECFIDERA continues and we\u2019ve now secured reimbursement in 10 countries. In countries where TECFIDERA has been launched, patient uptake has been broad and strong. TECFIDERA is now the number one prescribed oral MS therapy in Germany. TECFIDERA is also available in a number of other countries with limited reimbursement and we continue to expect to achieve full reimbursement across most of the major EU markets in 2015.","In a market where oral therapies are growing rapidly, our Interferon franchise saw 2% year-over-year revenue growth. Q3 revenues included AVONEX and early PLEGRIDY revenues from Europe. AVONEX continued to perform well within the Interferon therapies. With our continued focus, we believe AVONEX has captured meaningful share of new patient starts and has exhibited strong performance within the evolving MS landscape.","The PLEGRIDY launch in Europe is underway with the initial launch in Germany and Denmark. Physician awareness of PLEGRIDY is high, and we believe the product\u2019s efficacy and dosing make it an attractive option in the Interferon class. In Germany, we gained favorable reimbursement for PLEGRIDY. PLEGRIDY does not need to go through the AMNOG process and has been priced within the band of other Interferon 8018 therapies. In the U.S., we are prepared for an early November launch of PLEGRIDY. We\u2019ve completed sales force training, established contracts with specialty pharmacies, and prepared the financial and patient support programs for a successful launch.","Now turning to TYSABRI. TYSABRI has continued to demonstrate strong performance. Patient and physician demand for TYSABRI is solid as the therapy enjoyed its second consecutive quarter of positive net new patient adds. In the U.S. retention rates have improved the levels seen prior to the launch of TECFIDERA. We believe TYSABRI continues to be viewed by neurologist as a therapy of choice for patients requiring high efficacy.","In addition, we believe the TYSABRI has benefited from physicians\u2019 improved understanding of patient management. The hemophilia launches are off to a solid start as we\u2019ve said success is a new entrant as this market will require several things. Establishing Biogen Idec is a credible and committed partner to the community. Activating early adopters among patients who see the benefits of the dosing schedule in prophylaxis regiments, educating hemophilia treatment centers and providing support services to ensure patients can get rapid access to products.","Our experience to date suggest we\u2019re making good progress on all of these fronts and we believe, we can reinforce that positive experience to extend use over time to a broader set of patients. Starting with ELOCTATE, the patient and physician awareness for ELOCTATE is high in weeks into the launch.","We\u2019re building strong relationships with customers in achieving our early goals of reach and frequency with hemophilia treatment centers or HTCs. As of the end of the quarter based on our data approximately 50% of all HTCs have prescribed ELOCTATE, suggesting broad interest in longer acting therapies across the market. ELOCTATE is also widely available through specialty pharmacies and we\u2019re pleased with the status of reimbursement at this stage.","ALPROLIX is also seeing strong demand in broad interest from patients and physicians through the end of the quarter, approximately 55% of HTCs have prescribed ALPROLIX. We believe that the early adopters initiating ALPROLIX have primarily been existing prophylactic patients and have been largely choosing the once weekly prophylactic dosing schedule.","Acquiring additional patients with hemophilia will require sustained educational and promotional efforts, but we believe we have the ability to execute. We continue to believe that reduced infusion frequency is the largest unmet need for the hemophilia community and then ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE have attractive product profiles to address this burden. Our goal is to become market leaders in the mid to long-term and we believe in the products and in our ability to execute. So overall, we\u2019re pleased with our performance. The commercial team is executing well. And we believe we are demonstrating the ability both to launch multiple therapies in parallel and drive continued growth in the base business.","With that, I will turn the call over to Paul.","Paul J. Clancy","Thanks, Tony. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.62 in the third quarter. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the third quarter were $3.80. Walking down the P&L, I will start with revenues. Total revenue for the third quarter grew 37% year-over-year to approximately $2.5 billion. Global TECFIDERA revenue was $787 million in Q3. In the U.S., TECFIDERA revenue was $638 million.","Our best estimate at this time indicates that we ended the quarter with approximately 3.5 weeks of inventory in the channel, which includes specialty pharmacies and wholesalers. International TECFIDERA revenue was $149 million in the third quarter. Germany represented approximately three quarters of our ex-U.S. TECFIDERA revenues.","Interferon revenues including AVONEX and PLEGRIDY were $745 million. In the U.S., Q3 revenue increased 6%, compared to prior year to $482 million. Outside of the U.S., Q3 AVONEX revenue was $260 million, a decrease of 6% compared to prior year due to increased oral competition.","TYSABRI worldwide revenue net of hedging was $501 million in the third quarter, an increase of 25% over the same period last year. These results were comprised of $275 million in the U.S. and $226 million internationally. There were number of items of note for TYSABRI. We\u2019re now recognizing TYSABRI revenues at the full reimbursed price in Italy.","In the U.S., there were 14 shipping weeks this quarter, compared to 13 in the same quarter last year, as TYSABRI ships on Tuesdays. And we benefited from the benefit of a timing of shipment in Brazil, a tender market. Factoring in these items, TYSABRI still experienced double-digit revenue growth year-over-year. Moving to hemophilia, ELOCTATE revenue in the third quarter, first quarter on the market was $22 million. ALPROLIX revenue in Q3 was $25 million.","Turning to our anti-CD20 franchise, RITUXAN and GAZYVA U.S. profit share was $271 million for the third quarter. Royalties and profit share and sales of rituximab outside the U.S. were $20 million. The result was $291 million of net revenue from unconsolidated joint business. This amount includes an expense of approximately $21 million related to our share of changes in the recognition of the branded prescription drug fee in the quarter.","This fee was imposed to pharma companies as part of the Affordable Care Act. During the quarter, the IRS issued final regulations related to the drug fee which changed the recognition for accounting purposes from the period in which it is paid to when the sales occur. The incremental charge this quarter represents the remaining expense for 2013 and year-to-date 2014 sales related to RITUXAN.","Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q3 cost of goods sold were $303 million or 12% of total revenue. Q3 non-GAAP R&D expense was $416 million or 17% of revenues, which includes no new business development activity this quarter. Q3 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $569 million or 23% of total revenue. Included in this amount is an expense of approximately $90 million related to the previously mentioned Branded Prescription Drug Fee.","Our Q3 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 25%. Weighted average diluted shares were $237 million, and we ended the quarter with approximately $3.2 billion in cash and marketable securities, of which 60% is in the U.S. In Q3, we incurred a $200 million liability as we reached $3 billion in cumulative sales of TECFIDERA and FUMADERM in the quarter.","As highlighted in our SEC filings, this relates to the TECFIDERA contingent payments, which are being recorded as an increase to goodwill, reported on the balance sheet when incurred and flowing through the cash statement when paid, but not impacting the income statement. We expect to enter a period of meaningful TECFIDERA CVR payments to the former shareholders of Fumapharm. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to a $3.80 for the third quarter, an increase of 61%.","Now let me turn to our updated full year 2014 guidance. We expect total revenue growth between 38% and 41% compared to prior year, unchanged from prior guidance. R&D expense is unchanged, yet expected to be at the low-end of the range of our previously communicated guidance between 20% and 21% of total revenues.","Our full year R&D forecast now includes approximately $50 million in the fourth quarter for business development opportunities, a decrease from prior guidance. This remains an important focus for the company and we continue to pursue high-quality early and mid-stage business development opportunities.","SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 22% to 23% of total revenue, unchanged from prior guidance. We anticipate non-GAAP EPS results between $13.45 and $13.55 and GAAP EPS to be between $12 and $12.10. Our improvement in both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS is primarily due to our revised assumptions with respect to anticipated business development activity.","I\u2019ll turn the call over to George for his closing comments.","George A. Scangos","Thanks, Paul. In closing, I think the third quarter was very productive for Biogen Idec. We now have 10 marketed products, including five in MS and two in hemophilia. Our efforts over the coming months will focus on continued performance of the base business, execution on the launch of new products and innovation to bring meaningful new therapies to patients.","We plan to make TECFIDERA broadly available as we launched across Europe and other regions around the globe. We will begin launching PLEGRIDY in the U.S. imminently with continued launches across Europe occurring over time. We expect to continue to grow our hemophilia franchise. We believe ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE represent true innovation for patients and a significant long-term opportunity for the company.","We believe that our accomplishments have set the stage for an exciting period as we look forward to 2015 and beyond. We expect an important part of our long-term value creation for patients and shareholders will come from our pipeline that could form the next wave of late stage development opportunities.","Our strategy for sustainable growth centers on the deep commitment to the patient and continued innovation to develop novel medicines that address important medical challenges.","We intend to follow good science and stick to our knitting in the areas that we know best: Neurology, Hematology and Immunology. We believe these guiding principles position us for long-term success.","So in closing, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank our dedicated employees and the patients and physicians involved in our clinical development programs in helping us to make a deep difference to patients\u2019 lives.","So thank you all for joining us this morning. And operator, we\u2019ll now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen and Company","Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Maybe for Tony or Paul, it\u2019s on TECFIDERA. It looks like the growth on a quarter-on-quarter basis either absolute dollars or percentage basis, it looks a little bit lower in Q3 and, say over any of the last four, five prior quarters. Was there anything sort of one-time nature that you want to call out or should we just assume that the drug is on a different sort of trajectory?","Tony Kingsley","Thanks, Eric. It\u2019s Tony. Nothing big on a one-time nature. Inventories are moderating, I think a little bit in the channel, and that\u2019s always little, probably, difficult to predict exactly, but no look, we\u2019ve always expected that TECFIDERA\u2019s grow rate would moderate over time. I think we\u2019re seeing a natural case of that, but we\u2019re very comfortable with the trajectory of the product right now. We\u2019re very comfortable as we talked about the portion of new starts and switches that we\u2019re getting. So nothing that\u2019s significantly off plan from our standpoint, in fact I think we feel pretty good about the performance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Your line is open.","Salim Syed \u2013 ISI Group","Hey guys. This is Salim in for Mark. Thanks for all the information. On the PML patient, George, can you just confirm if the patient had a history of being on TYSABRI, and then also I know you mentioned 100,000 patients have been treated with TECFIDERA, but how many of those patients have been on drug for same length of time that the PML patients, which I believe you said 4.5 years?","George A. Scangos","Yes, okay. Look, this patient was not on TYSABRI, but this patient did have severe lymphopenia for 3.5 years, and we believe that the length of time on TECFIDERA is not the issue, the issue is related to lymphopenia, all right. And so, we are treating this as a case that resolves from the lymphopenia, and there is a normal background rate of lymphopenia. There is a lymphopenia on the TECFIDERA label, a small fraction of the patients develop lymphopenia and that\u2019s why a screening for the lymphopenia is on the label, it\u2019s caused by lots of drugs.","Salim Syed \u2013 ISI Group","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","","Brian Abrahams \u2013 Wells Fargo & Company","","All right, thanks very much for taking my question. We\u2019ve been getting feedback from physicians that PLEGRIDY could be an attractive option relative to other beta interferons. So I\u2019m just curious with respect to your marketing and commercial strategy to what extent are you going to be focused on trying to capture share from other interferons beyond AVONEX and how much weight do you think improvement, the improvements and convenience might happen since perhaps some of the pricing discounts going on from some of the competitors in that space? Thanks.","Tony Kingsley","Thanks Brian. It\u2019s Tony. So look, we really like the product profile of PLEGRIDY, repeat the theory. Interferons as of last count still treat more than half of the patients in our markets. We think that\u2019s declining for all the obvious reasons, but we think interferon remains an important part of the treatment set. We think PLEGRIDY is the leading interferon and should take here from all the interferons that are on the market today. And I would point out when physicians look at it, they\u2019re not going to look just at the convenience benefit, but they\u2019re going to look at the total package of the efficacy and dosing schedule. We think that\u2019s a very attractive proposition. So, yes, we think we have the potential to take share of high frequency interferons.","Brian Abrahams \u2013 Wells Fargo & Company","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Porges \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein","Thanks very much. Lots of questions, but perhaps the macro one, I\u2019ll just go back to the issue of sequential growth. Paul, you top-lined if you net out the one-time items, it looks like sequentially it was about 3% and it\u2019s been sort of in the 9% to 10% range for most of the past year. Obviously that wasn\u2019t going to be sustainable, but is this the new normal when you add up all the sort of bits and pieces and components of your revenue mix, is this what we should be thinking going forward?","Paul J. Clancy","","Geoff, as we move into 2015, we\u2019ll use the end of the year call to give our expectations going into 2015, and obviously that will play into where we think 2016 goes as well. But I think that you\u2019re painting a picture that\u2019s probably less optimistic than we think. We certainly are in early stages in TECFIDERA for the European rollout. The majority of European TECFIDERA sales are Germany. We\u2019ve moved forward with reimbursement in a number of other markets, but ahead of us is a number of larger markets and most of those will be impacted as we go into 2015.","We think there is meaningful, still meaningful growth in TECFIDERA in the United States as we continue to penetrate docs and penetrate the marketplace. And certainly, we\u2019re in very early days for the PLEGRIDY launch, which actually is ahead of us. In the Unites States, it just started with a very small amount of sales in Europe and certainly in very early days in ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX that \u2013 well it\u2019s hard to discern signal from noise early on, but the longer-term perspective that we have is that the marketplace will move to long acting hemophilia products, and we will play hopefully a meaningful role in that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, thanks. This is John on behalf of Michael Yee. On the TECFIDERA patient with PML, could you just remind us is this the first PML case in TECFIDERA and what was the JC virus status of the patient? Also going forward, how do you think this case maybe different or similar versus the prior experience with TYSABRI? Thank you.","George A. Scangos","Yeah, let me turn that question over to Doug Williams. Doug is in a different site.","Claudine Prowse","Operator, please unmute our colleagues overseas.","Operator","Your line is now open.","Douglas E. Williams","","Can you hear me all right now, George?","George A. Scangos","Yes, we can hear you, Doug.","","Douglas E. Williams","Okay, sorry about that technical difficulty. Yes, this is the first patient with PML on TECFIDERA that we\u2019re reporting. I think, as George pointed out, it\u2019s important to note that this is a patient that as part of the ENDORSE study and was on drug for 4.5 years and for 3.5 of those years had severe lymphopenia, which we know is a risk factor for developing PML. And so, it\u2019s an unfortunate circumstance that we believe is related to the lymphopenia. Prolonged and severe lymphopenia is a risk factor. We have monitoring rules in our label right now for checking white count and we believe that that is the best way for physicians to manage patients going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Terence C. Flynn \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Hi, thanks for taking that question. Maybe more just a high level one. So in the slides you guys had called out that a portion of the market growth since the launch of TECFIDERA was attributed to this increase in the commercially insured patients. Just wondering what data led you to draw that conclusion and if you can try to quantify the benefit for us? Thank you.","George A. Scangos","","Thanks, Terence. It\u2019s an interesting point. Look, we think the market growth first and foremost is being \u2013 the increase is driven by oral to the marketplace. Specifically, TECFIDERA bringing back quitters in particular and slowing down even the number of those patients that exit the marketplace.","In addition to that, what we\u2019ve noticed over the last call, five to seven years, is unemployment rates actually have in fact, play a role in this marketplace. So when unemployment rates in the United States specifically pop up to the high single-digits, we see the impact in a slightly delayed fashion. And when they drift down, we see the impact of that as well. I mean, they\u2019re modest impacts, but still meaningful.","And then the second impact is, as we came into 2014, we think we\u2019ve gotten a little bit of a modest benefit from the Affordable Care Act, more patients being ensured in moving from essentially what was \u2013 patients that we supported on a free basis to those switching over to commercial. Thanks for the question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of (indiscernible) with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","","Hi, it\u2019s actually Kathryn for (indiscernible). We\u2019ll just have a question on LINGO. What do think is a clinically meaningful improvement in VEP until those back in 2020? And then what would expect of the placebo growth? And then how much detail do you expect to this in January versus a presentation at a conference next year? Thank you.","Paul J. Clancy","This is Paul. I was going to take it, but I\u2019ll turn it to Al.","Alfred W. Sandrock","Hi, this is Al Sandrock. I don\u2019t actually look on the MVP as a clinically meaningful end point to begin with. We powered the study for about a 30% affect on the latency, but I would look out it more as a biological measure and not necessarily one where we can look for clinical meaningfulness.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Robert Baird. Your line is now open.","Christopher Raymond \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","","Just a question on TECFIDERA life cycle management, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re probably not going to want to be too descriptive of this. But we noticed a patent application that you guys filed in June describing a deuterium substitute a DMF compound. And I guess it made us to think a bit, how might this fit into your life cycle management efforts around TECFIDERA and sort of if you could maybe talk generally about the attributes you think that that could make for a meaningful improvement over the currently approved compound obviously outside of the IP, but in terms of convenience, safety, and you know that kind of stuff, that would be very helpful.","George A. Scangos","Sure, but first of all great job of scanning the patent literature. Obviously the life cycle management for TECFIDERA is one of the key issues for us and we have a lot of work going on. That certainly is one aspect of it, but not certainly the only aspect. And we haven\u2019t gone into publicly all of the things that we\u2019re doing and things we\u2019re trying and certainly don\u2019t, want to do that now and I think it\u2019s in our interest. Obviously, if we tell you, we tell all our competitors as well. Look what would be the attractive life advantages, modest changes could be once a day, could be better tolerability. I think the biggest change would be increased efficacy. And so, we\u2019re working on all of those aspects.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Matthew Harrison \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great, thanks for taking the question. I thought maybe now that you have the full Phase 3 on daclizumab. You haven\u2019t talked about that aspect a lot and maybe you could talk about how you think that could fit in and how you might position that commercially? Thanks.","Tony Kingsley","Yes. Thanks, Matthew. It\u2019s Tony. So Phase 3 data was obviously very encouraging. We believe it has an attractive product portfolio that has a place in the market, doing lots of more detailed market research and positioning at this point to crisp that up, but we believe it has a nice efficacy; it has an MOA that is the interesting to many physicians that we talk to in once a month subQ injectable. So the overall package is attracted and certainly something that makes sense for patients who require that level of efficacy. It could be a good switch to product for a lot of patients that are getting the efficacy that I need today. So more to come on that but we certainly think there\u2019s a place where we believe that is a place for it on the market.","George A. Scangos","At this call, I\u2019d just add additionally, we also often times think that this market is easy segments to split up, this we\u2019re approaching 800,000 patients on disease-modifying therapies with lifelong disease that have lots of different heterogenous nature to the disease. So we think that actually plays well for Daclizumab.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Robyn S. Karnauskas \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","","Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question. Just about hemophilia few things to your comments around, on the trends we\u2019re seeing, [clearly] (ph) the 50% of the hemophilia treatment centers that are not (indiscernible) how do they just refer to 6% that are and how do you get access of those centers? And then why do you think you\u2019re seeing some of the patients who are once-a-week versus to twice-week patients switch to longer halfway? And what do you need to do convert those patients do you think? Thank you.","Tony Kingsley","So, thanks Robyn, its Tony. Look I think I said first we\u2019re pleased to have got the 50% or 50% plus of the hemophilia treatment centers. I think we\u2019ve said this is largely a patient-driven market, meaning that\u2019s kind of where the activation comes. So as patients get interested in the proposition of the dosing regimen for treating disease prophylactically they are asking the hemophilia treatment centers.","So we are in there talking to them, having conservations. We think as patients have good experience and as centers have good experience, it creates a virtuous cycle overtime. And we believe we\u2019re seeing some evidence of that as we go out and execute.","So look, its early days, but the plan has been to do that, get the patients get their treatment centers provide good coverage and build that virtuous cycle overtime, but we believe we\u2019re on a good path on that front.","In terms, of dosing frequency, I think, what I said on ALPROLIX, is we believe that most patients are choosing the once weekly, which is the label dose, it\u2019s either once weekly or once every ten days. That is something that has made sense for the majority of patients. So I\u2019d say that\u2019s on plan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Ravi Mehrotra \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi, thanks for taking my question which I\u2019m not sure if Paul answered it. I love your view and opinion on the strength of your 514 dosing patterns.","George A. Scangos","Look where we \u2013 I assume you\u2019re asking because of all the noise around Forward Pharma and their IPO. What we\u2019ll say is we\u2019re very comfortable with our IP situation, we\u2019re certainly not going to litigate this in public. We\u2019re very comfortable with where we are. And we\u2019ll leave it at that.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with Nomura Securities. Your line is open.","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Nomura Securities Co., Ltd.","","Thank you. I just want to follow-up on the questions on TECFIDERA. In the U.S., fairly rapidly you\u2019ve got into roughly 20% market share. I just wanted to get maybe just your thoughts on how we should think about growth going forward, factors we should consider when modeling out sales going forward. And similarly in Europe, the sales came in a little bit below our expectations and would you attribute more, more to that \u2013 which attribute at more to the timing of country introduction and to country rollout or was there sort of a bullish effect with the Germany introduction last quarter?","Tony Kingsley","Yes, thanks. It\u2019s Tony. So look the way to think about TECFIDERA growth is what portion of new starts does TECFIDERA captured and we believe TECFIDERA is capturing a nice portion of new starts and should. Physicians are comfortable putting new patients on it. And then the bigger question mathematically is what portion of switches and again we believe that the product is capturing a meaningful portion of switches. There is a third factor, which is market growth. We have said in some prior calls that the market in the U.S. has grown faster this year than it has historically, some of it is what Paul talked about before, which was the switch from free to commercial patients.","There is also the dynamic of the quitter pool; we think has been favorable this year. Essentially, TECFIDERA has probably kept people in the market, who might have quits the market. So you\u2019ve had some additional growth on that standpoint. So you also have to look at how the market grows will probably moderate over time as you get thorough a more one-time impact of the unemployment rate of affordable care and then some of the change in the balance in the switcher pool. But look as I said we believe we\u2019re capturing a very attractive portion of new starts in switches and that\u2019s where we focus our effort. Do you want to talk about Europe, Paul?","Paul J. Clancy","Yes, Ian just to add on Europe and I think these comments are probably a repeat from last quarter. We came into the Europe thinking Europe the pace of penetration would be underneath the pace of penetration that we saw at TECFIDERA in the United States. We\u2019re very pleasantly surprising Germany to see actually that being on track or better. And while Germany is that the Lion\u2019s share of our ex-U.S. revenue right now, all the other countries that we\u2019ve launched in Nordics, Canada, Australia, we\u2019re seeing similar trends that we saw in Germany in terms of very strong update. So the delayed launch actually has played and we\u2019re effectively trying to do in every country is learn from the prior launches and execute even better, and I think we\u2019re succeeding on that front.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS. Your line is open.","Matthew Roden \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much for taking the question. I just want to better understand the potential implications, if any, from that the case of PML. And we recognized that there is a background rate of PML in lymphopenic patients, including those with multiple sclerosis. We also know that TECFIDERA does lower lymphocyte count. Do you think in light of what\u2019s happened here would you prefer that severely lymphopenic patients not be on TECFIDERA? Do you expect that docs will reconsider use in lymphopenic patients? And lastly, do you expect that the regulators will update the label or will they wait for additional cases since there is a background rate in this population? Thanks.","George A. Scangos","","Thanks. Those are good questions. Look, we\u2019re certainly not in a position to make medical recommendation, right. For long lymphopenia like this patient experiences in known risk factor for PML, TECFIDERA does result in lymphopenia in a small fraction of the patients who take it. It\u2019s for that reason that lymphocyte screening is on the label. We have reported this case to the regulatory authorities. We\u2019ll certainly, as we said in the prepared script, be discussing with them whether the language on the label is appropriate to inform patients and physicians. And what is done with lymphocyte results is, I think up to the physician that\u2019s caring for those patients.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi. Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges of Bernstein. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Porges \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein","","Thanks very much for letting me jump in with another question. I just want to follow-up on the discussion on ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE. Could you give us a sense of what proportion of patients on each products, are existing prophylaxis patients for the switching over, what proportion new pro-fee patients and what proportion is used in demand? Look, I know the numbers are small, but it\u2019d just be useful to see where the majority of the uptake is coming initially.","George A. Scangos","","So I think, Geoff, it\u2019s pretty clear that the vast majority is going to be existing pro-fee patients. That\u2019s the group that we expected in both cases to buying the proposition of dosing frequency most attractive side, but I would say that\u2019s the vast majority of it. There is probably a little bit on demand. There are no signals yet that we\u2019ve seen there. There is a meaningful conversion of bringing on demand patients into pro-fee. We\u2019ve always said that\u2019s probably something that happens over time. So, I would say vast majority is existing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with Nomura Securities. Your line is open.","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Nomura Securities Co., Ltd.","","And thank you again for letting me to ask a follow-up. George, you began the call just speaking to the new hires and I was just wondering if we should think about the growth within each of these new areas. We should assume organic growth or do you think there are certain technologies out there that you sort of need to bring in-house to accelerate your efforts in the\u2026","George A. Scangos","Yeah, those are good questions. Maybe I\u2019ll turn that over to Doug Williams.","Douglas E. Williams","Sure, thanks George. Yes, I think you can look at those hires as somewhat of a mix of sort of building on our existing strengths. Don Johns would be a great example of that. Don is coming in to run the clinical trial programs in ALS. As we take those compounds into the clinic, he\u2019ll be responsible for designing and executing those studies. Chris Henderson is going to take over the research activities and neurology research. So again that just strengthens what is already a very strong group and Chris will have the mandate to focus on new target discovery and validation to really help push ahead with new initiatives that we have in some of our core areas like Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s.","And then, Olivier really represents, I think, an opportunity for us to take advantage of some of the advances that have been made in gene therapy. I think we see that as another therapeutic modality that we want to have available to us. Olivier has been involved in that field for some 20 years and brings a lot of expertise that can help us with both partnerships, but also building out some of the capabilities that we\u2019ll need internally to carry that off. So it\u2019s a mix of both expanding our capabilities and strengthening the ones that we already have.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi. Your line is open.","","Yaron Werber \u2013 Citigroup","Thanks for squeezing me in. Question it\u2019s for \u2013 I don\u2019t know if Tony want to take it or Paul. Just relating to how do we think about TECFIDERA inventories, it sounds like its 3.5 weeks. I\u2019m trying to get a sense what do you think is the normal range, especially given where you are sort of in the growth trajectory as a drug? Thank you.","Paul J. Clancy","Yes, good question, Yaron. The first thing I\u2019d want to point out is it\u2019s our best estimate. I think I had mentioned that, but that\u2019s important. These things always wobble along product therapy, the size of TECFIDERA, it\u2019s meaningful. So take it with a grain of salt. We think that each quarter \u2013 the other thing (indiscernible) said on is that three and half week estimate is the combination of wholesalers and specialty pharmacies, which we\u2019ve been trying to point out from the early days. We have good visibility on wholesalers. There\u2019s a limited number of them and that\u2019s where our direct channel is and we have decent visibility in the specialty pharmacies.","Over time, I would think that that will tighten up a little bit, as people early in the launch in particular specialty pharmacies, wanted to make sure they had plenty of product on hand. So I think if anything over time, it tightens up a little bit to a tighter supply chain, which is normal for other therapies in particular rather overall therapies. And we\u2019ll try to keep everybody apprised if that happens as it goes to the best knowledge that we have.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS. Your line is open.","Matthew Roden \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much. I wanted to ask somewhat of a similar question on TECFIDERA life cycle strategy. I have one on hemophilia. So it looks to us that you have a pretty nice opportunity here with ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX over the next couple of years. But as you look out over the mid and long-term, obviously there are other parties working on not only competing long-acting factors, but there\u2019s also other technologies being brought to bear. I realize none of these other approaches are really de-risked, but the question is, given your leadership in this area whether we should expect to see additional innovation coming out of Biogen? And bigger picture, what\u2019s your strategy for growing the franchise over the long-term? Thanks.","George A. Scangos","","Sure. Doug, you want to take that one?","Douglas E. Williams","Yes, that\u2019s related to hemophilia. I think we are continuing to innovate in that space. The first two products really represent the first two products. We have other programs further back in research, one of which is a longer acting version of factor VIII that we presented some posters on, utilizes the XTEN technology, and we think that \u2013 if it does make it into the clinic will really sort of get us beyond that one and a half to two-fold half life extension threshold that everyone seems to be caught and all the long-acting factors.","For Hemophilia A, really in the sort of one and a half to two-fold half life extension range and this could actually double that from what we have seen. We\u2019re also looking into gene therapy as a possibility to extend the franchise in hemophilia. I think it\u2019s sort of the general rule that when we move into an area and have programs and products that emerge from the pipeline, that we continue to innovate in those fields where we think that there\u2019s opportunities to improve upon existing products.","So hemophilia is one area we\u2019re doing that obviously MS, we continue to do that, that\u2019s just sort of the natural part of the life cycle for any therapeutic area we\u2019re in.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen and Company","Thanks for the follow-up. I guess I\u2019ll ask the capital allocation question again, and I don\u2019t know you\u2019ve been getting asked from time-to-time. You\u2019ve got over $3 billion on the balance sheet now, Paul. You\u2019ve been saying that, I think, tuck in acquisitions have been your favorite use of cash. But we haven\u2019t seen any of those of late and you\u2019ve now reduced the guidance for BisDev in the back half of this year. So are you not seeing the opportunities? Are you changing strategy? What should we expect in the future?","Paul J. Clancy","Thanks, Eric, for the question. Let me kind of address the second part of your question on the BisDev thing. The pipeline of business development activity, the strategic intense I think, I personally think our capabilities are at an all time high. And you just never know when these things can turn into a deal, and as a result it gets a little bit bumpy quarter-to-quarter, early in the year obviously the Eisai transaction, the Sangamo transaction impacted the R&D line. Third quarter just didn\u2019t really have anything. And I think that\u2019s continue way to expect it, it\u2019s hard to then translate that into a guidance. So we all just have to be mindful of that.","More broadly, we certainly still believe those bad word for it, but tuck-in acquisitions are a remark \u2013 it\u2019s part and participle to the business that we\u2019re in. But it\u2019s really all about the mission that we have and delivering outside has the potential to deliver outside shareholder value returns. We\u2019ve seen that over the last ten plus years.","As we move into 2015, we\u2019ll probably open and look towards figuring out what\u2019s the best way to return capital to shareholders as the cash flow continues to generate. As I also pointed out just wanted to make sure, but it\u2019s mindful of \u2013 we do expect to have meaningful CVR payments to the pharma owners of TECFIDERA, which is going to be captured into the cash flow statement, as well.","So I think it\u2019s kind of largely continued as we have and with a pretty decent intent to rebuild their early and mid-stage pipeline.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Robert Baird. Your line is open.","Christopher Raymond \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Hey, thanks. Just a follow-up here on TECFIDERA. So we\u2019ve done some of our own work on discontinuation rate and at least from docs are telling us, it looks like it\u2019s fairly flat and kind of consistent with what DEFINE and CONFIRM showed. Can you guys maybe talk about the trends you\u2019re seeing there? Are we right or is there some other sort of dynamic we should think about?","Tony Kingsley","","Yes, thanks, Chris. This is Tony. I think that\u2019s consistent with what we\u2019re seeing. As we\u2019ve said before, the discontinuation rates, we expect to be similar to other in line therapies over time. We believe that physicians are learning to manage the GI and tolerability issues, but you\u2019re still going to get some drop off of that.

Yes, we\u2019re still on track for January. As to the data that we\u2019ll show, the goal here is to be as open as we can about the data without jeopardizing our ability to publish the data in peer review journal and have it accepted at a major meeting. Those are always the things that company is trying and trade off. So I can\u2019t tell you exactly what will be in the press release, but we will certainly be as explicit as we can with those caveats.","Operator","I would now like to turn the conference back over to our presenters.","George A.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Third Quarter 2015 Financial Results and Business Update. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. Ben Strain, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Ben Strain","Thank you, and welcome to Biogen\u2019s third quarter 2015 earnings conference call.","Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the press release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we\u2019ll discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call.","I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult our SEC filings for additional detail.","On today\u2019s call, I\u2019m joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. George Scangos; Dr. Alf Sandrock, our Chief Medical Officer; and our CFO, Paul Clancy.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to George.","George Scangos","Okay. Thank you, Ben, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Third quarter was marked by significant progress across several key areas. We delivered a 11% revenue growth and 18% non-GAAP EPS growth, as we continue to see modification growth across the portfolio.","We have several important developments in our pipeline. We initiated enrollment for our Phase 3 clinical program for aducanumab and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. We announced Phase 3 results for TYSABRI and secondary progressive MS, which I will cover in more detail later in the call. And we continue to strengthen our pipeline by announcing an agreement to exclusively license MT-1303 for Mitsubishi Tanabe.","On the commercial front, we remain committed to improving our commercial trajectory with a particular emphasis on TECFIDERA. Our market research continues to indicate that prescribers believe TECFIDERA has a very strong benefit risk profile. However, patient growth in the U.S. and Germany remains challenging, and we\u2019re actively working to improve this dynamic. We\u2019ve increased sales costs for TECFIDERA, as we continue to educate physicians on TECFIDERA\u2019s strong efficacy and favorable safety profile and its label and monitoring requirements.","We\u2019ve also increased our direct-to-consumer marketing in the U.S., including a recently launched television campaign that some of you may have seen. We also made significant progress on capital allocation. Through yesterday, we\u2019ve returned approximately $3.9 billion to our shareholders through the repurchase of our common stock.","Importantly, Biogen still retains strategic flexibility to support both continued business development and potentially larger scale acquisitions. We remain focused on strengthening and expanding our early stage pipeline through tuck-in acquisitions and collaborations. The strategy that has produced assets, such as TECFIDERA, ELOCTATE, ALPROLIX, aducanumab, Isis-SMNRx and Raxatrigine. We\u2019re actively looking for late-stage and commercial assets, which have the potential to add both strategic value and near-term revenue growth, while maintaining financial discipline.","Today, we also announced the corporate restructuring that we believe will best position the company to achieve our strategic priorities. This decision to reduce our workforce was extremely difficult and we\u2019re very thankful for the hard work and contributions of our talented colleagues and friends. As part of our effort to focus on key commercial initiatives and high potential pipeline candidate, we\u2019ve also made a decision to discontinue several pipeline program that includes TECFIDERA in secondary progressive MS, as well as certain programs in immunology and fibrosis research, including anti-TWEAK.","Importantly, we plan to reinvest the savings from this restructuring into key commercial initiatives and a number of prioritized programs across our emerging mid- and late-stage pipeline, including commercial initiatives aimed at increasing sales and marketing therapies, including new direct-to-consumer marketing programs for TECFIDERA, the advancement of aducanumab, BAN2401, and E 2609 for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Anti-LINGO for multiple sclerosis, Isis-SMNRx for spinal muscular atrophy, our recently acquired asset from Convergence, Raxatrigine for Trigeminal Neuralgia and other pain indications, and MT-1303 for inflammatory bowel disease and other autoimmune diseases.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Al for an update on R&D.","Alfred Sandrock","Thanks, George. We had important clinical study readouts and good progress advancing a new generation of mid- and late-stage clinical program. This morning, we reported top line results from the Phase 3 ASCEND study for TYSABRI and secondary progressive MS. The objective of the ASCEND was to determine whether TYSABRI had an impact on slowing disability progression unrelated to relapses in patients with SPMS.","Most patients that enrolled in ASCEND had non-relapsing SPMS and had EDSS scores of 6.0 to 6.5. ASCEND did not achieve its primary or secondary endpoint, and we do not intend to file for label expansion. We are disappointed in these results, as SPMS is a serious condition with no effective therapies.","ASCEND study results did demonstrate that TYSABRI had a robust impact on relapses and MRI measures of disease, consistent with its known clinical profile in relapsing MS. Study results also indicated that TYSABRI had a statistically significant effect on upper limb function measured by the 9-Hole Peg Test, which was a component of the composite primary endpoint. Full study results will be reported at our future medical meeting.","Moving onto our other MS development programs, at the ECTRIMS Meeting earlier this month, we represented an additional analysis for renew, a Phase 2 study that evaluated Anti-LINGO in patients with acute optic neuritis, the top line results of which we reported earlier this year. About half the patients in renew underwent multifocal visual evoked potential testing, a method that allows us to record electrical responses produced in the occipital cortex upon stimulation of small segments within the retina.","First, we found that Anti-LINGO had an effect on the recovery of the multifocal VEP amplitude recorded by stimulating the eye that was affected by the optic neuritis. Interestingly, we also found that Anti-LINGO treatment preserved the multifocal VEP amplitude, recorded by stimulating the opposite eye, which was seem to be deteriorating in the placebo group, likely due to lesions developing in the visual system, as a result of some of these patients being in the early stages of MS.","We believe that these results further support our previously reported findings and provide evidence that Anti-LINGO may have neuroprotective properties. We continue to expect top line results from the Phase 2 synergy study in MS in mid-2016.","Turning to ZINBRYTA, The New England Journal of Medicine has just published the results of the ZINBRYTA Phase 3 DECIDE study. In DECIDE, ZINBRYTA demonstrated a compelling 45% improvement in annualized relapse rate compared to interferon therapy. If approved, we believe ZINBRYTA could be an important new therapeutic option for relapsing MS patients.","At ECTRIMS, Roche presented positive Phase 3 results in both relapsing and primary progressive MS for ocrelizumab, a product in which we have a business interest. Results from two Phase 3 studies in relapsing MS showed a 46% and 47% reduction in annualized relapse rate compared to interferon therapy. Ocrelizumab also demonstrated a significant role in the treatment of primary progressive MS, a serious neurodegenerative condition for which there are no approved therapies. If approved, it would be wonderful to be able offer these patients a meaningful new therapy.","Turning to our hemophilia therapies, ELOCTA, which is the approved European trade name for ELOCTATE, obtained a positive recommendation from the CHMP, as a therapy for hemophilia A. If approved in the EU, ELOCTA would be commercialized there by our collaborators Sobi. At the 2015 National Hemophilia Foundation Meeting, new ALPROLIX data showed a beneficial long-term safety and efficacy profile in patients with hemophilia B. Favorable long-term clinical results for ELOCTATE treatment of patients with hemophilia A were also recently published.","Moving to the aducanumab Phase 3 program for patients with early Alzheimer\u2019s disease, we have initiated clinical sites in both the emerged and engaged studies and the first study subjects have now been enrolled. We are pleased to have received FDA agreement on a special protocol assessment on the aducanumab Phase 3 study protocols. We have previously reported that ARIA or amyloid-related imaging abnormality was the most significant adverse event observed in the aducanumab Phase 1B study.","All patients currently enrolling into Phase 3 studies of aducanumab are undergoing dose titrations in an effort to mitigate the risk of ARIA. Preliminary data from the Phase 1B study suggests that dose titrations does seem to reduce the incidence of ARIA, although these findings will need to be confirmed with further study. We continue to obtain additional clinical data from the Phase 1B study, and we anticipate discussing these results at a scientific meeting in the second-half of next year.","We have made progress in expanding our development pipeline by acquiring rights to MT-1303, a Phase 3 ready program with potential and multiple autoimmune diseases. At the recent ECTRIMS Meeting, Mitsubishi Tanabe presented compelling results from a 415 patient Phase 2 study in MS. Results demonstrated that MT-1303 did not cause a decrease in heart rate with administration of the first dose, even without dose titration. This characteristic of the molecule may serve to eventually differentiated from other S1P modulators.","We anticipate deal completion in the fourth quarter and we intend to initiate Phase 3 studies in inflammatory bowel disease as soon as possible next year. We continue to evaluate potential further development in MS. Progress has also been made with several early-stage programs BIIB061 and oral treatment being developed as a potential reparative therapy for MS has successfully completed Phase 1 studies. We recently initiated a Phase 1 study for BIIB054, a monoclonal antibody targeting \u03b1-synuclein, which is being developed as a potential disease modifying therapy for Parkinson\u2019s disease.","The target of BIB-54 \u03b1-synuclein is a major component of Lewy bodies, a pathologic hallmark of Parkinson\u2019s disease. R&D continues to make good progress advancing the next wave of therapies and development candidates. Next year, we anticipate the approval of ZINBRYTA for relapsing MS. We also intend to initiate a number of clinical studies, including a Phase 3 study of MT-1303 in IBD, a Phase 3 study for Raxatrigine for trigeminal neuralgia, as well as a Phase 2 study BIIB61 in MS.","We\u2019re also looking forward to several upcoming clinical readouts, including Phase 3 results for SMNRx in spinal muscular atrophy, Phase 2 results for Anti-LINGO in MS, and interim phase 2 results for BAN2401 and E2609, both for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. We look forward to a deeper discussion of these pipeline programs and other initiatives that are upcoming R&D Investor Day on November 3.","I\u2019ll now pass the call to Paul.","Paul Clancy","Thanks, Al. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.15 in the third quarter. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.48. Total revenue for Q3 grew a 11% year-over-year to approximately $2.8 billion. Foreign exchange offset by hedging weakened total revenue by approximately $63 million year-over-year.","Global third quarter TECFIDERA revenue was $937 million, an increase of 19% versus Q3 of last year, and an increase of 6% versus the prior quarter. Foreign exchange impact offset by hedging weakened TECFIDERA revenue by approximately $12 million year-over-year. This quarter\u2019s TECFIDERA revenues consisted of $754 million in the U.S. and $183 million outside the U.S. Compared to the second quarter of 2015, U.S. TECFIDERA revenue increased 5%, partially due to an increase in inventory at specialty pharmacies, while U.S. revenue also benefited from a price increase in the quarter, this was partially offset by an increase in managed care and government rebates.","In Europe, TECFIDERA had strong sequential patient growth this quarter, driven by newly launched markets, including the U.K., Italy, and Spain. Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY increased 5% year-over-year to $785 million in the third quarter. Foreign exchange impact offset by hedging weakened Interferon revenue by approximately $23 million year-over-year. Interferon revenues were comprised of $538 million in the U.S. and $247 million in sales outside the U.S.","On a sequential basis, we believe the 18% increase in U.S. Interferon revenue benefited from a wholesaler inventory rebalancing coming off of the inventory drawdown in Q2, which contributed approximately $40 million. Outside the U.S., AVONEX revenue benefited by approximately $16 million from the timing of shipments in Brazil and a clinical trial order in our rest of world business.","TYSABRI continue to add patients this quarter with worldwide revenues of $480 million. These results were comprised of $284 million in the U.S., and $196 million internationally. Foreign exchange impact offset by hedging weakened TYSABRI revenue by approximately $23 million year-over-year.","Turning to our hemophilia business, ALPROLIX revenue in Q3 was $66 million and ELOCTATE was $91 million. In the U.S. after a period of rapid uptake for our ALPROLIX with elevated switching in the market, we saw the switch rates start to moderate is roughly half of the moderate and severe hemophilia B patients, treated prophylactically have switched to ALPROLIX.","ELOCTATE has continued to grow in the U.S., and we saw increased breadth and depth of prescribing. Approximately 20% of moderate and severe prophylactic patients with hemophilia A have switched to ELOCTATE. Our U.S. profit share for RITUXAN and GAZYVA, as well as our profit-share and royalties on sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. were $337 million.","Now, turning to the expense lines in the non-GAAP P&L Q3 cost of goods sold were $310 million, or 11% of revenue. Q3 R&D expense was $520 million, or 19% of revenues. This includes $48 million in upfront and milestone expense related to our recently closed collaboration with AGTC. We made a $60 million milestone payment to Neurimmune this quarter triggered by dosing of the first patient in, in the Phase 3 trials for aducanumab. This payment was an expense and presented within the non-controlling interest line in the P&L.","Q3 SG&A expense was $478 million, or 17% of revenue, as we continue to make steps in containing SG&A expenses. Our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 24% for Q3. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were 448 for the third quarter, an increase of 18% over Q3 2014. While there are number of puts and takes in the quarter, we delivered a very solid quarter with solid results from the United States Interferon business, continued European rollout of TECFIDERA, continued progress in the hemophilia franchise, and meaningful cost control absorbing the AGTC in Neurimmune payments.","Let me turn to discuss our progress on returning capital to shareholders. Recall, our Board had authorized the $5 billion share repurchase program in May of this year. Due to lower share price, we put in place a more robust share repurchase plan in late July, effectively expediting the program. Through September 30, we\u2019ve repurchased approximately 9.7 million shares of our common stock for a cost of approximately $3 billion.","And since the end of the quarter, we have purchased an additional 3.2 million shares for approximately $900 million. Our current expectation is to complete the 5 billion share repurchase plan by the end of the year. In conjunction with funding our share repurchase program, we borrowed $6 billion of senior unsecured notes in mid-September. This included maturities of 5, 7, 10 and 30 years. We ended the quarter with approximately $7.8 billion in cash and marketable securities split approximately 60\/40 between the U.S. and ex-U.S.","Let me now provide additional detail on the corporate restructuring. The restructuring includes the termination of a number of pipeline programs in a 11% reduction in workforce. The reduction was the result of a number of actions, including the consolidation and elimination of certain overlapping groups across the organization in analytical and operational support and in marketing. Resizing portions of the company, where we felt there was excess capacity, including in our manufacturing operation.","Resizing our ex-U.S. commercial operation and reductions driven by our de-emphasis of certain activities in immunology and fibrosis research in the termination of certain development programs. We plan to complete the majority of the reduction of the global workforce by the end of 2015. The restructuring is expected to reduce the current annual run rate of operating expenses by approximately $250 million. We expect to incur charge in the range of approximately $85 million to $95 million, primarily in the fourth quarter related to the restructuring.","Additionally, we\u2019re currently in the middle of our financial planning for 2016, and aim toward additional savings in non-labor expenses, with the objective of reducing lower priority fees and services expense. Conversely, on the investment side, as we move into 2016, we\u2019re excited and plan to invest behind in emerging, mid- and late-stage pipeline, invest in TECFIDERA DTC, and we\u2019ll potentially invest at risk behind prelaunch activities related to the potential commercialization of SMNRx.","While we outline our specific 2016 financial guidance in late January, we currently expect upward pressure in R&D and aim for leverage in SG&A. We aim to achieve lower overall expense growth in the top line for 2016. The restructuring will yield risk savings to enhance our operating results for 2016 and beyond, while also providing financial flexibility, as we embark on a number of meaningful pipeline opportunities.","Given the restructuring change in capital structure and share repurchase activity this quarter, we\u2019re updating our full-year 2015 guidance. Let me start with revenues. We now expect revenue growth between 8% and 9%, a modest increase versus prior guidance, reflecting the revenue strength seen this quarter. This guidance assumes modest patient growth in the U.S. for our MS products as a whole for the balance of the year. The revenue outlook also assumes a sequential decrease in Q4, due to the assumption of stable U.S. channel inventory levels for the balance of year in MS, and a reduction in U.S. wholesaler inventory levels for RITUXAN.","Non-GAAP full-year R&D expense is expected to be between 19% and 20% of revenue, unchanged from prior guidance. Assuming deal closure, we will book in approximately $60 million expense to R&D in the fourth quarter, relating to our agreement with Mitsubishi Tanabe.","Non-GAAP full-year SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 19% to 20% of revenue, a decrease from prior guidance. We do expect to invest in TECFIDERA TV in Q4. We anticipate booking a GAAP charge of approximately $85 million to $95 million, primarily in Q4 related to the restructuring.","In conjunction with our recently completed bond offering, we now anticipate additional interest expense of approximately $60 million per quarter. We expect to end the year with approximately $219 million fully diluted shares, and have a full-year weighted average diluted share count of approximately 231 million shares. We anticipate non-GAAP full-year earnings per share results between $16.20 and $16.50. This represents an increase of 17% to 19% year-over-year, and GAAP earnings per share, we expect to be between $14.65 and $14.95. The increase versus prior guidance is due to stronger than anticipated revenues in Q3, taking costs out of the business in the share repurchase activity.","I\u2019ll turn the call over to George for his closing comments.","George Scangos","Hey, thank you, Paul. This year has been a challenging month for those of us here at Biogen. But I believe that we have a solid business and R&D pipeline with exceptional potential, a thoughtful capital allocation strategy, a well-controlled expense base, and a capable group of people, who can execute against our goals. If we put aside quarterly revenue variations due to fluctuations in inventory levels, FX, or other factors, on a unit basis, we\u2019ve seen moderate but steady growth in the underlying business.","Our pipeline has matured, and I believe that pipeline is more exciting and more promising than it was a year ago. Additional data for aducanumab and Anti-LINGO increased our optimism about both of those compounds. We believe that MT-1303 has real potential in ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease. Raxatrigine had promising data in a controlled Phase 2 trial and will move to Phase 3 trial in trigeminal neuralgia in a Phase 2B trial in sciatica. SMNRx data from the open label Phase 2 trial are encouraging, and we\u2019re looking forward to the Phase 3 data late next year or early 2017.","Additionally, our research has become truly world-class, and were looking forward to giving you a deeper view of what we\u2019re doing at R&D Day on November 3. In Q3, we began the execution of a thoughtful capital allocation strategy. We issued $6 billion of senior unsecured notes, which allowed us to take advantage of our lowered stock price to return approximately $4 billion to investors through stock buy backs with an additional $1 billion to go.","We have been able to reduce our share count substantially, while leaving adequate financial flexibility for strategic acquisitions of compounds and our companies. We continue to consider opportunities within our core areas of expertise, both large and small, and as always, we\u2019ll do so, while being financially disciplined.","The restructuring that we announced today was an extremely difficult position, and all of us feel deeply for the affected employees. These people are our friends and colleagues and they\u2019ve played a big role in the successes that Biogen has had up until now. They\u2019re good people, good employees, and it truly saddens us to have to take this action. On behalf of the senior leadership team, I want to express our sincere appreciation for the work that everyone at Biogen has done.","Although this action is extremely difficult, it\u2019s a necessary step in order for us to fulfill our goals as a company. I believe that our mid- and late-stage pipeline is larger and higher quality than it has ever been, aducanumab, SMNRx, Raxatrigine, and MT-1303 either are or soon will be in Phase 3, and we\u2019re hopeful that LINGO will join them next year. These programs will require substantial investments and we believe that restructuring will allow us to aggressively conduct these programs, while maintaining healthy earnings growth.","Next year, we expect to have meaningful clinical data from SMNRx, Anti-LINGO, BAN2401, our base inhibitor E2609, and we hope to gain approval for ZINBRYTA and for two of our bio-similar molecules. So our pipeline has both near-term and longer-term potential to add value to patients and the company. And we need to be able to adequately fund these exciting programs. The restructuring helps us to do so.","Before I conclude, I want to take a moment to acknowledge Tony Kingsley\u2019s contributions to Biogen. Tony joined Biogen over five years ago and was instrumental in leading the successful introduction of several important new therapies that help serve patients around the world. I want to publicly thank Tony for all that he has done and wish him all the best in his next endeavor.","Tony built an extremely capable team, and I believe that we have the people and programs in place to maximize the potential of our commercial portfolio. In the interim, leadership of this group will be assumed by John Cox, EVP of Pharmaceutical Operations and Technology. John has been with Biogen for over 12 years, has a good understanding of all aspects of our business, and I believe that we will \u2013 he will effectively lead this group.","So as we move forward, we\u2019re starting from a good base and we\u2019ll focus on five key goals. One, maximize the potential of our commercial portfolio; two, aggressively advance our mid- and late-stage clinical programs to get them gone on or ahead of schedule; three, continue our emphasis on world-class science and medicine; four, carefully control our costs; and five, pursue nonorganic growth opportunities. We\u2019re energized by the potential that we have to transform the lives of patients around the world, and by doing so to do right by our shareholders. I can\u2019t promise you success in everything that we do, but I can promise you our commitment and dedication.","And with that, we\u2019ll now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Mark Schoenebaum","Once again thanks for all the transparency that has been the hallmark of Paul\u2019s tenure as CFO, and George as CFO, and your IR team has done a great job too. I had some questions on the pipeline for Al, if I may. Al, when will we actually see data from the some of the titration doses on the antibodies, most importantly the titration to the 10 milligram data please?","And number two, you\u2019ve talked about this before, but I think, it\u2019s time that we all start talking about again and just want to get your take. The optic neuritis data that you looked at is kind of you had to really squint to see activity. And so Wall Street expectations right now are extremely low for LINGO and MS. I mean, do you view LINGO and MS as a low probability trial, or is this one that you have a higher degree of confidence in? Thank you.","Alfred Sandrock","So, thanks, Mark. On the first question, we expect to show results in the second-half of the year. We actually have two places \u2013 oh, next year, yes. The \u2013 there\u2019s two places where we\u2019re doing titration. One is that we \u2013 when we put people from placebo in the prime study, in our Phase 1B study over into the long-term extension that was the titration phase.","And second, in cohorts eight to nine in the prime study, titration was built into the \u2013 into that study. So there are these two studies essentially to analyze and it\u2019s going to take us a little time of time particularly to get to the 10 milligram, which is what you\u2019re interested in, and will be the second-half of next year.","In terms of the Anti-LINGO, I mean, look, it\u2019s high risk. I mean, nobody has ever even attempted really that I know to repair the central nervous system, and it\u2019s a tall order. On the other hand, we think we have proof of biology based on the optic neuritis study. We believe that the results portend that we\u2019re getting the biology we want. The key question for me is, is that biology going to lead to a clinically meaningful effect? And that\u2019s what we\u2019re hoping to see in the MS trial.","Operator","The next question is from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Matthew Harrison","Great, thanks. Definitely a lot of questions to ask, maybe just another one for Al. Maybe just specifically on SPMS. Could you \u2013 it\u2019s unclear to me from the press release, it sounded like what you were trying to say was, you saw some impact in patients that had active lesions and you saw no impact in patients that didn\u2019t. Can you maybe just confirm if that was what you were trying to say, and if there was any numerical trend outside of patients without active lesions?","Alfred Sandrock","Well, I mean, what we are saying is that, it\u2019s true that there was a minority of patients, that were still relapsing in the trial, and that\u2019s why we were able to show a robust effect on relapse rate. Those are what I would call active from the inflammatory point of view. And that \u2013 there clearly was \u2013 we saw what we had seen in the past an inflammatory disease with TYSABRI.","In the non-inflammatory group, which was, I think, the majority of patients, we think, we see something in the upper extremity. However, we did not see an effect on the other two components of the primary endpoint, which was the EDSS and the Timed 25-Foot Walk. And so we were disappointed in the fact that, we didn\u2019t see an effect on ambulation. And so I think that\u2019s the reason why the primary endpoint was negative. I would say that upper extremity function is important in patients, particularly if their ambulation is starting to get lost. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to present these results next year at the Scientific Meeting.","Operator","The next question is from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Your line is open.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Morning, guys. Thanks for all the detail today and congrats on the quarter. Switch gears to ask a couple of questions on commercial for TECFIDERA and then DTC campaign. What population MS patients do you get or do you expect to get that you couldn\u2019t reach previously? And maybe can you speak to the breadth and length of time that you\u2019ll be doing the PCR reach just thinking from a cost perspective? Thanks.","Paul Clancy","Yes, thanks, Geoff. This is Paul, I\u2019ll take a crack at that \u2013 at that question. We essentially started in the first week and some of you may have seen the TV campaign, I think, the current thinking now is, we\u2019ll look hard at measuring this thing along the way. But I think the current thinking now is well into 2016. And our planning that we\u2019re doing now is to effectively have it ongoing throughout the majority of 2016.","I think the overall objective isn\u2019t that similar to the \u2013 what we saw early on in the launch is that, TECFIDERA when it came early on the launch, expanded the market, activated new patients, many of them that had gotten injection fatigue on the sidelines. And I think the thinking here is to activate those patients, activating a whole set of patients through patient awareness, which we do have some data that actually suggests that, it\u2019s a relatively low level of patient awareness, sorry, said another way, at least, that there\u2019s a big opportunity in driving patient awareness.","And we also have data that suggests that when a patient comes to a doctor, particularly in the United States with a preferred therapy that is often the therapy that the patient goes on. So that\u2019s kind of a bit of a core thesis, and we look forward to kind of moving forward with it.","Operator","The next question is from Ying Huang with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Ying Huang","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First one I have a housekeeping question. Can you spell out the TECFIDERA U.S. inventory impact exactly? And then also maybe for Al, what\u2019s your consideration behind the decision to proceed for MS indication for MT-1303? Is that conditional on the readout from LINGO, or the other programs in MS programs.","And lastly, can you update on the timing for the antibody BAN2401 and also the base emitter E2609 in second-half? Thank you.","George Scangos","All right. I think, I\u2019ll take the first of your four questions, Ying. So that\u2019s a pretty easy one. What our best estimate on the essentially the tailwind we had on TECFIDERA inventory in SPP this quarter was about $10 million to $15 million. Al?","Alfred Sandrock","So, on 1303 and MS, there\u2019s a number of option for that, and we\u2019re looking at all of them. And well, first, we have to wait for this deal to close. But in the meantime, we\u2019re considering a number of options. In terms of the other Alzheimer\u2019s program BAN and the base inhibitor, I think the best thing to do, we\u2019d ask a sigh actually what their timelines are. My understanding is that sometime next year, we\u2019ll see some data from the base inhibitor. And in terms of the BAN, I mean, there\u2019s sort of interim analysis that are based on events or numbers of people randomized I believe. So that\u2019s my understanding. But I think we could see something next year as well.","Operator","The next question is from Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Eric Thomas Schmidt","Thanks for taking my question. It sounds like you guys spoke a little bit more about SMNRx on this call than in the past. I think I actually heard Paul say something about commercial preparation or potential, of course, preparation next year. Has your optimism around the program changed? And is there a chance for filing prior to the Phase 3 data?","Alfred Sandrock","Well, we\u2019ve been fairly optimistic \u2013 I\u2019ve been fairly optimistic for quite sometime, and with every passing day, as we look at the open label of the data from the Phase 1 studies, my optimism remains. And but I still think that we\u2019re going to need data from the Phase 3 program. I mean, these are the definitive controlled clinical trials, and I would not want to raise any expectations that we could do anything without looking at that data.","Paul Clancy","And then, Eric, this is Paul, just to kind of, the other part of your question was commercial preparedness. We would characterize this, as I mentioned that, this would be at risk commercial prelaunch activity, and it\u2019s a specialty market. So I think it\u2019s in a manageable amount of money, but we would likely look towards doing that sometime in 2016.","Operator","The next question is from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Terence Flynn","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just two from me. Paul, you gave us some of the drivers for next year spend and recognized you don\u2019t want to give guidance at this point, because you\u2019re in the midst of planning. But net-net, as you think about just OpEx, can you comment directionally if we should think about it up or down versus this year?","And then the second question I had relates to ocrelizumab, now that we\u2019ve seen the full Phase 3 data. Al, just wondering if you can frame for us, how you think about this as a competitive threat to either TECFIDERA and\/or TYSABRI? Thanks.","George Scangos","Yes, Terence, it\u2019s hard for me, I think, we\u2019re obviously right in the middle of planning. So we did want to provide some context, given we\u2019ve got all these moving pieces coming out of the restructuring right now. But I think it goes back to it likely is operating expenses that are up. It is likely a very manageable number up. I don\u2019t want to give a specific number until we really get kind of to the end of year call and the 2016 guidance call.","But the restructuring provides real benefits in the magnitude what we announced today of $250 million. We\u2019re going to \u2013 we\u2019re working now, that is very much about head count reduction in some of the program decisions. We\u2019re working now to \u2013 during our planning process to look at fees and services, what we call external expenses as well and put it under similar type of lens. And then we\u2019re very happy that we simultaneously on the flipside of all these great opportunities is the mid- and late-stage pipeline starts to mature.","So I think we\u2019re attacking the efficiencies and working towards investing wisely towards driving sustainable growth for the future. And what we\u2019re trying to do is essentially make that all work as George had mentioned towards getting some earnings leverage as well.","Alfred Sandrock","On ocrelizumab, first of all, I think, Roche did a very nice job of the Phase 3 program in both relapsing MS and PPMS. I do think, I believe it will if approved will be a major contribution from MS patients,, which is good. The \u2013 on the efficacy side, it did lineup with our expectations. It\u2019s pretty similar in many ways to what\u2019s already been shown in the Phase 2 program for not only ocrelizumab, but RITUXAN. And so it\u2019s in line with our expectations. As with any program, there\u2019s always some safety issues. And we\u2019ll see how the label shapes up in terms of the benefit risk, and then that will determine, how it relates to other products in the market.","Operator","The next question is from Matt Roden with UBS. Your line is open.","Matthew Roden","Great. Thanks very much for taking the question, and congrats on a nice bounce back quarter here. So one of the biggest questions I\u2019ve gotten in the last quarter or couple of months here has been industry-wide just on drug pricing and the contribution of pricing and volumes to growth. And obviously, this has been industry-wide, but you guys have been included as part of that discussion. So, George, or Paul, can you just add some perspective to this debate from your point of view, it seems like industry isn\u2019t really stepping up and telling their side of the story. And then more specifically, if you can comment on how you expect the net pricing environment to evolve in MS. How you see the relative contributions of pricing and volumes on a forward-looking business? Thanks.","George Scangos","Okay. This is George. I can take the first part of that question. Look, obviously, there has been a lot of rhetoric about drug pricing recently, part of that is the presidential campaign. I don\u2019t expect that rhetoric to go away anytime soon. I think the industry is preparing a thoughtful presentation of a different perspective on drug prices, and the value that we bring to patients [indiscernible].","And \u2013 look, I mean, that\u2019s what everybody says, but it\u2019s true. In the end, things are going to be priced according to the value that they bring to patients. And if I \u2013 we \u2013 I believe that if we bring forward innovative drugs that make a difference in the lives of patients that those will continue to get attractive pricing. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re working on the kinds of drugs that we\u2019re working aducanumab and SMNRx and LINGO for MS. Those potentially can make a magnitude of difference that will continue to justify good reimbursement even in a tough pricing environment. So I think that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it generally. In terms of gross to net, I\u2019ll let Paul take that part of the question.","Paul Clancy","Yes, I mean, hi, Matt, I think, we don\u2019t have too many different comments than we\u2019ve had in the past in terms of the near-term dynamics. We obviously we\u2019ve talked about how United States and Europe dynamics are slightly different. We see a similar dynamics, as we have in the past, and we\u2019ll continue to be very, very thoughtful on what is a critical judgment.","Operator","The next question is from Cory Kasimov, JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Cory Kasimov","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. George, you mentioned in your scripted comments that you continue to actively look for late-stage or commercial assets. So when thinking about business development in the context of your existing commercial franchising and clinical pipeline, what do you consider the sweet spot in terms of the size of potential deals? And does the restructuring you announced today in anyway impact your willingness to engage in the M&A? Thanks.","George Scangos","Sure. Look, we are constantly looking for interesting opportunities that are consistent with our strategy that are in our areas of expertise. I would say there is no sweet spot, it\u2019s a question of value of what you get for what you pay. And we\u2019ve been financially disciplined in the past. I think, we brought in some attractive assets MT-1303 and Raxatrigine in the past several months. I think, those are very interesting compounds. We will continue to look for compounds like that that we believe are high-quality compounds with reasonable chances of success and making a difference on the marketplace that we can acquire at \u2013 also make sense for us.","So we\u2019re looking at some small things, we\u2019re looking at some large things. And there\u2019s not so much question of the size, but as of making solid, strategic, medical, and financial decisions.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Abraham with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brian Abraham","Hi. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Two questions for 1303 you talked about heart rate changes. Can you just talk about any other elements of the compounds profile that you found most attractive? And what you believe differentiates that drug from the other market and developments S1Ps with respect to sell activity in bio-distribution?","And then secondly, what proportion of the use of TYSABRI and your other MS therapy today is in primary progressive MS? Thanks.","George Scangos","On 1303, we were \u2013 first of all the \u2013 on the efficacy side, we felt that the efficacy was similar to all the \u2013 to the other S1P1 modulators, and certainly when you look across the MS trials, and even when you look across, say, psoriasis. The most attractive thing was the fact that Mitsubishi Tanabe with their expertise figured out a way to \u2013 it\u2019s not simply taking out the S1P3 activity, because a lot of people have done that. But there are other characteristics of the molecule that needed to have a \u2013 we think an interesting effect on the heart rate, which we believe is one of the key issues associated with first dose administration. And so it was that, that was attractive.","On TYSABRI, I don\u2019t think TYSABRI is used very much in PPMS. In fact, there are no effective therapies for PPMS. And I think I\u2019m pretty \u2013 I don\u2019t think that any of the immunomodulatory therapies are used very much at all and PPMS is my understanding.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Raymond with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Christopher Raymond","Thanks, guys. I just have a couple of quick questions here. First on TECFIDERA, thanks for quantifying that inventory impact. But I\u2019m just kind of curious, you guys had a mid-quarter price increase oftentimes that\u2019s \u2013 that can be seen as a driver for wholesaler inventory moves. Can you just clarify maybe some of the drivers for the inventory increase?","And then on BAN2401, besides identifying a dose, can you talk a little bit about what kind of \u2013 what success might look like here, I know this trial could be as few as 350 patients, but as many as 800, I believe. And so, there\u2019s a lot of sort of differences with this trial, you\u2019ve got a different sort of cognition endpoints et cetera. I guess, just basically talk about how we should be success with that? Thanks.","Alfred Sandrock","Chris, I\u2019ll start with the TECFIDERA inventory question and whether or not, it was driven by pricing, we don\u2019t believe so. Our best understanding is actually the driver of the increase on inventory in the specialty channels was more driven by some government purchases, that really actually potentially relate to fiscal year for certain government institutions. So that wasn\u2019t \u2013 as I noted, it wasn\u2019t a lot $10 million or $15 million, so that\u2019s our best understanding at this point.","George Scangos","On BAN, I think, there\u2019ll be several endpoints. One is that there\u2019ll be \u2013 we\u2019ll be looking at amyloid plaque load \u2013 amyloid plaque burden, which I think is important. And there is an examination of cognition using a composite endpoint, which includes things like the CDR sum-of-boxes. And the number, my understanding of the interim analysis or these analysis is based on a number of patients randomized. And so \u2013 but, again, I think, any detailed questions on that, I would rather that you ask [indiscernible]","Operator","The next question is from Joseph Schwartz with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.","Joseph Schwartz","Thanks very much. I was wondering if you could talk a little more about aducanumab and particular, it seems like you\u2019re shifting your strategy by targeting even more mild patients, or earlier-stage patients in Phase 3. How should we think about this in terms of the enrollment rate and probability of success in the market opportunity? And are you building in a interim analysis here? Thanks very much.","Alfred Sandrock","Yes. Well, we are targeting prodromal and the milder sort of segment of the mild populations based on an EDSS, I mean, sorry, MMSE cut off. And that\u2019s because our belief is that the drug \u2013 these drugs will work better in the earlier stages of the disease. And in terms of enrollment, we\u2019re pretty encouraged by what we see in early days. There\u2019s a lot of excitement about our drug, and our enrollment line rates are in line or slightly ahead of what we anticipated. So far it\u2019s still early days on the enrollment, and there\u2019s a lot of competition for similar types of patients, nevertheless, we\u2019re encouraged by what we see and\u2026","George Scangos","And baked on accrual?","Alfred Sandrock","Well, I just, yes, I think I answered the phone question.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Skorney with Robert Baird. Your line is open.","Brian Skorney","Hi, guys thanks, for taking my question. I guess I was just wondering if you could provide any commentary on in the U.S. MS market. How are you seeing any impact of generic CapEx on October. Are we seeing this primarily impacting the brand right now, or do you think there\u2019s been any impact on your MS franchise. And just real quick on ocrelizumab. Could you just recall that the thresholds on the economics, that you\u2019re getting from Roche on worldwide sales of this program. Thanks.","Paul Clancy","Brian, thanks for the question, it\u2019s Paul. Let me try to take both those in the \u2013 with respect it\u2019s relatively early I think we could say the same thing on the last call, so it\u2019s 90 days more than, it was relatively early last call. But we\u2019re seeing mostly exactly as you had alluded to the impact of a generic comp on comp.","So and we\u2019re certainly keeping a very watchful eye on that. Ocrelizumab economics to us are 13.5% to 24% royalty rate it\u2019s a tiered royalty rate on net effectively net sales was a formula for it. We act interesting, we also, which I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve shared in the past we gave 3% royalty on ex-US sales, as well. So as Al, had alluded too in his prepared remarks, and we\u2019ve got a business interest in this. There could be impact on our existing therapies, but we do see this as very interesting financial interest, and certainly in primary progressive MS where there is a tremendous unmet need. There is a real opportunity as well a financial opportunity for us as well.","Operator","The next question is from Tom Shrader with Stifel. Your line is open.","Thomas Shrader","Good morning, you didn\u2019t actually answer the interim look question for aducanumab. But I\u2019m a little curious, if this gigantic trial going on with to looks at other drugs. So how do you think about that?","George Scangos","I knew there was a second part of that question. I think we missed the market opportunity as well. So I \u2013 we I don\u2019t think it\u2019s great practice to be talking about interim looks and we\u2019re not really planning on anything like that for aducanumab, I think we have a robustly designed trial it\u2019s at the right duration. And so we\u2019ll go right to the end.","Operator","The next question is for Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Michael Yee","Thanks, for the question. On commercial question for Paul, on TECFIDERA you had suggested I guess in the last call, that you really thought things were going to be flattish, I didn\u2019t really sort of hear certainly that tone here and thought a bunch of positive things, but maybe like it start to creep up on the volume side."," So two-part question one is are you seeing volumes creep up a little bit just trying to understand what\u2019s going on near-term and as to the end of the year. And then second part on one rebating the managed care you mentioned increases in rebating, so just maybe explain a little about what\u2019s going on there as it relates to TECFIDERA volumes and net price. Thanks.","Alfred Sandrock","Yes, no thanks, thanks Michael, it\u2019s actually helpful the point of clarification. So we actually are to a large extent what we outlined in the middle of year is, that we\u2019re aspiring for much more. But we outlined on relatively flat patient demand in the United States, that is actually what we witnessed in Q3.","We definitely saw continued solid growth in a number of the launch countries in Europe, U.K., Spain, Italy they\u2019ve had very, very good performance. But I\u2019d characterize that that is a launch countries, I think we still absolutely aspire towards much better performance in the United States, there continues to be a lot of big homework in. But until we see that result turnaround we won\u2019t really incorporated in our near-term financial outlook. The action plans, that we have under it is absolutely a priority number one, number in terms of our commercial efforts the action plans we have underway include DTC activity they include enhanced patient support around tolerability, and working that.","We\u2019re focused hard on in our own patient services when working with SBP\u2019s of getting patients on therapy, that what we call cycle time. And we\u2019re certainly very focused on increasing sales for details across the world, but certainly in the United States. So we aspire towards, but we haven\u2019t yet actually seen it as George, had noted in his remarks as well.","Operator","The next question is from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Your line is open.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital","Hi, guys, thanks for taking the follow-up. I guess there\u2019s question for Paul. In the past you guys have given parameters around the level of the old licensing activity. Just want to kind of get a sense, I\u2019m assuming that tuck-in probably means in line with what you guys have done in the past and want to get that perspective from you. And then maybe how you would prioritize capital allocation with the stock where it is now versus buybacks with the stock where it is today versus deal activity. Thanks.","Paul Clancy","Yes, it\u2019s a yes it\u2019s a tough question I mean look I think we\u2019re going to try to have our P&L in a way set up, that we can not have internal friction to do the classic tuck-in type deals that\u2019s how we\u2019ve done it over the last couple of years within. At this point for the fourth quarter it\u2019s essentially the Mitsubishi Tanabe expense, that we expect assuming HSR Clarence. We\u2019ll try to allow ourselves that the normal type as we go into 2016.","In terms of capital allocation, we certainly don\u2019t want to be opaque, but I think this is in the category of it depends. We definitely aim towards all of our decisions on capital allocations is about driving intrinsic value, shareholder value creation. So when we see great opportunities in terms of doing that for returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases we\u2019ll execute against that, we\u2019ve certainly shown that action over the last 60 days. And as George had mentioned, we feel we have an absolute obligation to build the business in a financial disciplined ways with larger deployments, if we can achieve that.","George Scangos","Yes, and this is George. Look, if you look out into next year, we\u2019ll have four compounds in Phase 3, that\u2019s not four Phase 3 trial it\u2019s more than four trials, but it\u2019s for Phase 3 programs. And we\u2019re hopeful if LINGO has data next year that justify moving that forward that will be a fit and we certainly want to leave capacity to move LINGO forward through the Phase 2 data justifying doing so. So I think anything that we would look to in-license that would go immediately into Phase 3, we\u2019d have to cross a pretty high hurdle right. We will, but we\u2019re continuing to look for compounds at all stages I think and at this point with particular emphasis on their earlier pipeline.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. We will turn the call back over to our presenters.","A - Alfred Sandrock","Okay. Well, that was a lot to digest. Thank you all for your attention today, we have a lot going on here.

My name is Chris and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Fourth Quarter and Year End 2017 Financial Results and Business Update. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Matt Calistri, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.","Matt Calistri","Thank you and welcome to Biogen\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings conference call.","Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the press release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call.","I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail.","On today\u2019s call, I am joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Michel Vounatsos; Dr. Michael Ehlers, EVP of Research and Development; and our new CFO, Jeff Capello.","Before I conclude, I would also like to note that starting with the Q1 2018 earnings call we will post press releases related to future earnings calls materials and investor events on the Investors section of Biogen\u2019s website, www.biogen.com and issue statement on Twitter when they become available. We will do this instead of publishing press releases related to future earnings calls, earnings releases and Investor events via Newswire services. Our Twitter handle is @biogen.","Now, I will turn the call over to Michel.","Michel Vounatsos","Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. First, let me start with some financial highlights. Biogen closed 2017, with an all-time high in quarterly revenues of $3.3 billion. For the full year 2017, Biogen generated another all-time high of $12.3 billion in revenues. On an apples-to-apples basis, excluding hemophilia, full year revenues grew 15% versus 2016. Full year revenues grew 7% when we include hemophilia for 2016 and January 2017.","Starting in 2018, we believe that overall the new U.S. tax reform will have a positive impact to our profitability and our ability to invest for the future. But in Q4, we took a one-time charge of $1.2 billion in line with what you are probably seeing from other public companies. Jeff will provide additional detail shortly. Therefore, full year GAAP earnings decreased 30% versus 2016 to $11.92 a share. Full year non-GAAP earnings were $21.81, an 8% increase versus full year 2016, while being impacted by over $500 million of expenses due to several business development transactions including our deals BMS, Alkermes and Ionis as well as our charge related to the ZINBRYTA impairment.","Now, let me review the year. 2017 was clearly a very productive and successful year for Biogen. We launched a new focused and well articulated strategy with the longer term goal of becoming the leader in neuroscience and the fastest growing large cap biotech. We defined priority designed to drive future growth first fortifying our core MS business; second, executing on the launch of SPINRAZA and third, creating a lean and simple operating model. The goal of these priorities is to drive significant cash flow generation and invest those to create new sources of value beyond MS and SMA. We are pleased with the work the team has done to execute on our strategy which has led to significant progress for Biogen.","Let me now reflect on some of our key results across each of these priorities. For our first strategic priority maximizing the resilience of our MS core business, we grew global MS revenues including royalties from OCREVUS to $9.1 billion, an increase of 4% versus 2016. Our MS products now treat over 340,000 patients globally, a 3% increase over 2016. In the U.S., our MS revenues were stable versus 2016 and including OCREVUS royalties, MS revenues in the U.S. increased 2%. We strengthened our IP position for TECFIDERA, our leading oral therapy through a settlement and licensing agreement with Forward Pharma. We received favorable rulings for both our IPR proceeding and interference case. We achieved expanded access for 2018 in the U.S. for our MS portfolio. We executed 5 value-based contracts in the U.S., which we hope will give us opportunity to learn and develop new contracting models to better serve patients. We licensed BIIB098 from Alkermes, a Phase 3 monomethyl fumarate with a potentially differentiated profile to TECFIDERA we expect filing will occur later his year.","For our second strategic priority, spinal muscular atrophy, we delivered one of the most exciting biotech launch of the year with SPINRAZA global revenues of $884 million exceeding many expectations. As of the end of 2017, there were approximately 3,200 patients on therapy across the post-marketing setting, the EAP and clinical trials. We also launched a new collaboration with our partner Ionis to identify new ASO drug candidates for SMA with the goal to enhance strategic alternatives. And we are exploring a number of avenues, including device partnerships to improving surgical delivery with the recent example being our research collaboration agreement with Alcyone to leverage the device platform.","For our third strategic priority creating a leaner and simpler operating model, we identified opportunities to streamline our operation to help fund further investment in high-value R&D and new commercial activities. We benchmarked against multiple businesses to challenge ourselves to be as effective and efficient as possible as we aim to create an innovative operating model designed for the future. We believe this will enable us to redirect up to $400 million by the end of 2020 to be reinvested and prioritize value creating opportunities across our R&D and commercial organizations.","For our fourth strategic priority developing and expanding our neuroscience portfolio Biogen added seven new clinical stage programs in 2017 across our core and emerging growth areas through the advancement of our own internal candidates as well as external business development. And finally, our fifth strategic priority reprioritizing our capital allocation towards long-term growth, while also continuing to opportunistically buyback shares. We have emphasized investing in future growth while delivering near-term results and turned 2017 into one of our most productive year for business development. We also repurchased 4.9 million shares for approximately $1.4 billion at an average price of $278 a share. And importantly in terms of strategic alliances we renegotiated our agreements with Eisai and Neurimmune with the aim to improve long-term economics of aducanumab. In addition to the strong progress in 2017, I am also excited by new additions to our executive team. Jeff Capello has joined as Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer, Chirfi Guindo has joined as Executive VP and Head of Global Marketing, Market Access and Customer Innovation. I believe that we now have great leaders in all key position and Biogen is exhibiting well. We have a strong base business with significant cash flow generation and exciting new growth driver in SPINRAZA and accelerating momentum in R&D and business development to solidify the foundation for future growth. I look forward to carrying the strong performance through 2018 and beyond with our new executive team.","I will now turn the call over to Mike for a more detailed update on our recent progress in R&D.","Michael Ehlers","Thank you, Michel and good morning everyone. 2017 was the transformative year for Biogen R&D. We provided clarity on Biogen strategic priorities with the aim of becoming the leader in neuroscience. We believe this is an area right with opportunities, we are breaking science is opening up new avenues for drug development. We believe that Biogen has a competitive advantage in this space based on our strong track record and intense focus within our core growth areas and emerging growth areas within neuroscience. Our goal is to leverage our competitive advantage, target our investments and advance the world-class neuroscience R&D engine. To that end, we made significant progress in 2017 towards this vision. We made noteworthy advancements transitioning pipeline candidates from research to development with five transitions in 2017, nearly double Biogen\u2019s historical productivity. In 2018, we aim to continue this level of productivity or even accelerate the number of candidates that transition to the clinic.","As Michelle highlighted, we added seven new clinical stage assets in 2017, through both advancing internal candidates, and through external business development. And as you may have seen earlier today, we announced our first deal of the year, in this agreement we acquired the rights to Karyopharm\u2019s first-in-class Phase 1 ready investigational oral compound KPT-350 for certain neurological and neurodegenerative conditions, primarily focused on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS. KPT-350 is a novel candidate that works by inhibiting XPO1, with the goal of reducing inflammation and neurotoxicity along with the increasing neuro protective responses. We plan on moving this asset into a Phase 1 study by the end of the year.","As we develop and expand the Biogen pipeline, our aim is to increase overall productivity at every stage, de-risk the pipeline and continue to implement a robust external pipeline strategy that may include continued asset acquisitions, development partnerships for resource flexibility and risk sharing and early innovation partnerships. Earlier this month, we entered a precompetitive consortium with several of our peers to sequence the exempts of 500,000 participants in the UK Biobank, with the goal of assisting drug discovery and development by linking protein coding variance to human phenotypes. We believe this is a great example of our scientific leadership in the field.","Before I hand it off to Jeff, I would like to spend some time highlighting several achievements from the fourth quarter starting with MS and neuroimmunology. As part of our long-standing commitment to the MS community, Biogen remains dedicated to advancing the treatment of MS and building upon our leadership position in the space. As Michelle mentioned, we licensed BIIB098, the MMF compound from Alkermes in the fourth quarter and we anticipate a filing by the end of the year. We are actively working to optimize the value and clinical potential of this asset.","In December, we also does the first patient in affinity a Phase 2b study designed to evaluate the potential for opicinumab, the first in class human monoclonal antibody directed against LINGO-1 on improving pre-existing disability and relapsing MS patients through remyelination. We also had exciting new developments within Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia. We presented new interim data from the long-term extension of the ongoing Phase 1b study of aducanumab called PRIME at the clinical trials in Alzheimer disease meeting in November. We believe the totality of the data from the Phase 1b study is compelling and supports the design of the Phase 3 studies. Phase 3 enrollment for aducanumab is going well and we anticipate the studies will be fully enrolled in mid-2018. Last month, we learned BAN2401 and anti-beta amyloid protofibril antibody being developed in collaboration with Eisai did not meet the criteria for success in its Phase 2 study at 12 months. The study remains blinded and the final analysis will be conducted when patients have completed 18 months which is expected in the second half of the year.","In the final analysis, we are particularly interested in the Alzheimer\u2019s disease composite score, or ADCOMS and its components such as the CDR-Sum of Boxes and MSC and ADAS-cog as well as brain amyloid levels as measured by amyloid pet and its overall safety profile. Beyond aducanumab and BAN2401, we are advancing four other clinical assets in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, including a base inhibitor; two, anti-tile antibodies and an antisense oligonucleotide in collaboration with Ionis. We believe we have the industry\u2019s leading Alzheimer\u2019s portfolio.","Turning to neuromuscular disorders, we made significant progress towards our strategic objective of accelerating our leadership in spinal muscular atrophy. Along with our partner, Ionis, we were awarded the prestigious 2017 Prix Galien USA award for Best Biotechnology Product for SPINRAZA. This award recognizes extraordinary achievement in scientific innovation that improves the state of human health and we are honored to have received this distinction. In November, the end of study results from ENDEAR, the Phase 3 study of SPINRAZA were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The ENDEAR study highlights the therapeutic potential of this breakthrough treatment as most infants receiving SPINRAZA showed meaningful benefit regardless of their age or stage of the disease.","As part of our commitment to the SMA community, Biogen remains dedicated to advancing potential additional treatment options for SMA. Last month, we entered into a new collaboration agreement with Ionis Pharmaceuticals to identify additional antisense oligonucleotide drug candidates for the treatment of SMA. In this agreement, we are exploring novel chemistries for advancing intrathecal ASO-based therapies that have the potential to reduce the dosing burden or increase the therapeutic effect. We also recently signed a research collaboration agreement with Alcyone that leverages their novel device platform with the hope of improving the intrathecal delivery of therapies for severe neurological conditions with the first year of interest being for SMA and particularly patients with spinal complications. We continue to believe that there is opportunity in gene therapy and are advancing our gene therapy asset for SMA toward the clinic with the aim of dosing the first patient by the middle of this year.","Moving on to our progress and movement disorders, BIIB054, our anti alpha-synuclein antibody for Parkinson\u2019s disease has recently started the Phase 2 study called SPARC and we dosed the first patient earlier this month. In Phase 1, the drug was well-tolerated at doses that are being used in the Phase 2 study and its safety profile and pharmacokinetic behavior, including CSF concentrations in both healthy control and Parkinson\u2019s disease patients was acceptable and consistent with other monoclonal antibodies. Within acute neurology, we are currently conducting a Phase IIb trial with natalizumab in acute ischemic stroke with the aim of improving functional outcomes by limiting brain inflammation and therefore increasing neuronal survival in the post stroke period. With approximately 1.7 million ischemic strokes each year across the U.S., Europe and Japan, we believe there is significant opportunity if the trial is successful. The study is fully enrolled and we anticipate sharing top line results in the coming weeks.","As a reminder, natalizumab is targeting acute ischemic stroke patients with mild-to-moderate severity with the therapeutic time window of up to 24 hours after stroke onset. This program complements BIIB093, our first-in-class IV glibenclamide therapeutic targeting brain edema in large hemispheric infarcts, with a planned Phase 3 start in the middle of this year. So, a very productive quarter and year as we build and advance our pipeline from human genetics to new novel clinical endpoints and clinical assessment tools to differentiated clinical development to potentially transformative modalities and delivery technologies, we continue to invest in and advance our asymmetric capabilities and neuroscience where our aim is to be the definitive leader.","I will now pass the call to Jeff.","Jeff Capello","Thanks Mike. Good morning, everyone. Let me now provide a little more detail on our financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2017 and share with you our guidance for 2018. Let\u2019s start with revenues. As Michel mentioned earlier, we had a strong Q4 2017 from a revenue perspective. Total revenues for Q4 grew 15% year-over-year to approximately $3.3 billion and grew 7% for the full year to $12.3 billion. Excluding the impact of the spinoff of our hemophilia business, total revenue grew 26% for the fourth quarter and 15% for the full year versus the prior year periods.","Let me now provide more detail for our MS franchise revenues. Global fourth quarter TECFIDERA revenues were $1.1 billion, a 7% increase versus the prior year. This included revenues of $832 million in the U.S., an increase of 4% versus Q4 \u201816 and $244 million outside the U.S., an increase of 22% versus the fourth quarter of 2016. Despite the benefit of a roughly $20 million increase of inventory in the channel in the U.S. versus the third quarter of 2017. We are pleased with our net low single-digit growth versus Q4 \u201816 as we absorb the impact of OCREVUS. In addition, we are very encouraged by the growth outside the U.S. driven by patient growth across almost every large market in Europe and strong emerging market growth.","For the full year, worldwide TECFIDERA revenues were $4.2 billion, an increase of 6% versus prior year. This includes $3.3 billion in the U.S. and $920 million in sales outside the U.S. Interferon revenues including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY were $645 million for the fourth quarter, a decrease of 6% versus Q4 \u201816 due to continued shift from the injectable platforms to oral or high efficacy therapies. This included $449 million in the U.S. and $196 million in sales outside the U.S. Within the U.S., AVONEX and PLEGRIDY benefited from the inventory build of approximately $15 million, while outside the U.S., Avonex benefited from a $9 million shipment to Brazil, neither of which are expected to recur in the first quarter of 2018.","For the full year, worldwide interferon revenues were $2.6 billion, consisting of $1.9 billion in the U.S. and $757 million in sales outside the U.S. TYSABRI worldwide revenues were $463 million this quarter, a decrease of 2% versus the fourth quarter of 2016. This included $252 million in the U.S. and $211 million outside the U.S. In the U.S., revenues declined 13% versus the prior year. We saw an impact on TYSABRI shortly following the launch of OCREVUS both in terms of new patient starts and patient discontinuations. However, we believe both of these trends have now stabilized at new run-rate. Within the U.S., TYSABRI benefited from an inventory build of approximately $5 million.","Outside the U.S., we had very strong TYSABRI growth of 14% versus prior year driven by both the large order of $6 million in Russia as well as solid growth in all major European countries driven by patient growth following the label update in 2017. For the full year, worldwide TYSABRI revenues were approximately $2 billion stable versus the prior year. We recorded U.S. revenues of $1.1 billion and $859 million internationally. As expected, across our MS business, we saw an increase in discounts and allowances in the fourth quarter partly due to seasonality.","Throughout 2018, we expect another couple of 100 basis points of pressure on discounts and allowances with the typical seasonality in the first and fourth quarters. Despite this dynamic, we expect roughly flat performance for our total MS revenues for 2018 when you include the impact of the OCREVUS royalty. This corresponds to a low single-digit contraction in our MS revenues, excluding the OCREVUS royalties. Additionally, we expect the potential inventory drawdown in Q1 2018 coming off the build of approximately $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.","Let me now move to SPINRAZA. Global fourth quarter SPINRAZA revenues were $363 million. This included revenues of $218 million in the U.S., an increase of 10% versus the third quarter and $144 million outside the U.S. almost doubling quarter-over-quarter. For the full year 2017, worldwide SPINRAZA revenues were $884 million making it one of the most successful rare disease launches in history. This included $657 million in the U.S. and $227 million in sales outside the U.S. In the U.S., we now see over 275 sites that have submitted start forms, of which 215 have dosed at least one patient. We saw 33% increase in the number of patients on therapy in the U.S. as compared to the end of the third quarter.","Similar to last quarter, revenues grew at a lower rate than patients due to loading dose dynamics with roughly half of revenues coming from new patients started dosing in the fourth quarter. In the U.S., we believe that new patient starts in the fourth quarter were weighted towards the beginning of the quarter as we saw an impact on demand during the holiday weeks. As a result, we expect a relatively lower contribution in Q1 2018 from these patients as they will have worked through many of their loading doses in the fourth quarter 2017.","As expected, we are seeing an increasing contribution from maintenance doses as patients who started earlier in the year transitioned to dosing once every 4 months on a chronic basis. In the U.S., approximately 25% of SPINRAZA revenues in the fourth quarter were attributed to maintenance doses as compared to 10% in the third quarter. This correlates with the continued decline in the average doses per patient from 1.8 to 1.5 from the third quarter to the fourth quarter this year. We expect this dynamic to normalize over time with approximately 50% revenue being driven by maintenance doses by the end of 2018.","In the fourth quarter and for the year, approximately 20% of U.S. SPINRAZA units were dispensed to our free drug program highlighting our goal that no patient will forego treatment because of financial limitation or an insurance denial in the U.S.","We believe U.S. inventory levels for SPINRAZA were relatively flat in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. And in the U.S. we signed increased discounts allowance for SPINRAZA of a couple of 100 basis points to approximately 16%. We expect this rate to similarly increase over 2018 as we are seeing increasing utilization by Medicaid patients and purchasing from 340B hospitals. In the U.S. over 20% of SPINRAZA patients currently on therapy are over the age of 17 and increased from last quarter. A key strategic priority for us is to activate older patients through expanded patient and physician engagement.","Outside the U.S. we more than doubled the number of commercial patients on therapy versus the prior quarter to 990 with approximately 35% of these patients transition from expanded access program or EAP. As a result, approximately 280 patients are still active in EAP as of the end of the fourth quarter. It\u2019s important to note that those patients transitioned from this program may have already completed most of their loading doses. The largest contributors to the ex-U.S. SPINRAZA revenues in Q4 were Germany, Turkey and Japan, which accounted for over two-thirds of the ex-U.S. revenues. We continue to be very encouraged by the up-tick of SPINRAZA outside of the U.S. in terms of country approvals, speed of adoption and penetration levels. In 2018, we expect growth from SPINRAZA in the U.S., but expect a larger portion of the revenue growth to come from outside the U.S.","Let me now move on to our biosimilars business, which generate $122 million in revenue this quarter more than doubling year-over-year. Full year biosimilar revenues were $380 million, growing nearly fourfold versus 2016. We anticipate that increased biosimilar competition will result in further price erosion, but we still expect double-digit increases in revenue in 2018. Turning to our anti-CD20 revenues, we recorded $415 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 31% versus prior year primarily driven by the OCREVUS royalties. Full year anti-CD20 revenues were $1.6 billion, a 19% increase versus 2016. Within anti-CD20 revenues our estimate OCREVUS royalties were $77 million for the fourth quarter and $159 million for the full year. Although we do expect OCREVUS royalty continue to grow, we anticipate total anti-CD20 revenue growth to slow in 2018 versus what we saw in 2017 driven by the anniversarying on the OCREVUS launch in the second quarter of 2018 and the full year impact of a lower profit share percentage for RITUXAN.","Total other revenues were $180 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of $129 million versus $51 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016, driven by greater contract manufacturing. Other revenues were $360 million for the full year, a 14% increase versus 2016. In 2018, we continue \u2013 we expect continued growth in contract manufacturing similar to the growth in full year 2017 but the exact amounts maybe lumpy over the quarters.","Let me now turn to gross margin performance. Q4 gross margin was 85% which was negatively impacted by the disproportionate increase in contract manufacturing of biosimilars as well as a write-off of approximately $20 million of ZINBRYTA assets including inventory. Full year gross margin was 87%, slightly lower than in 2016. Q4 R&D expense was 18% of revenue or $588 million. This included $78 million of expense related to Alkermes and $25 million with Ionis due to recently announced business development transactions.","Full year GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense were both 18% of revenue or $2.3 billion. Q4 GAAP SG&A was 17% of revenue or $572 million. Q4 non-GAAP SG&A was also 17% of revenue at $554 million. Full year GAAP SG&A was 16% of sales or $1.9 billion and non-GAAP SG&A was 15% of revenue at $1.9 billion. Both GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A increase versus the prior quarter due to the timing of spend as well as certain investments across sales and marketing, worldwide medical and G&A. We do expect slight relief in core OpEx in the first quarter 2018 with the gradual decline as we move throughout the year.","Other net expense, which includes interest, was $66 million in the fourth quarter which was impacted by a $17 million charge to markdown marketable securities as we prepare to move our offshore cash back to the U.S. Other net expense was $250 million for the full year. Our expectations for other net expense in 2018 are lower due to less debt outstanding and higher interest rates on cash balances. In the fourth quarter our GAAP tax rate was approximately 112% as we booked a GAAP charge of $1.2 billion related to the recently enacted U.S. corporate tax reform legislation. In Q4 our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 29%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were impacted by $42 million and $50 million respectively related to the one-time ZINBRYTA charge. For the full year, our GAAP tax rate was approximately 48% and our non-GAAP Tax rate was roughly 25%. In 2018 we expect the underlying run rate for our tax rates to be \u2013 benefit by approximately 200 basis points as a result of U.S. tax reform with further benefit in 2019 and beyond.","Our weighted average diluted share count was approximate 212 million for the quarter and 230 million for the full year which now brings us the diluted earnings per share. In the fourth quarter we booked the GAAP loss of $1.40 per share and non-GAAP earnings of $5.26 per share. For the full year, GAAP EPS was $11.92 and non-GAAP EPS with $21.81. GAAP EPS declined for Q4 2017 on the year-over-year basis driven by the $5.51 impact of tax reform, the $0.52 impact from our revised Neurimmune agreement, $0.34 impact for the Alkermes and Ionis deals and the $0.43 impact of the ZINBRYTA charge. Full year GAAP EPS decline versus 2016 due to the same factors as well as $1.08 impact from our deal with BMS and $0.48 impact from our deal with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals. Non-GAAP EPS grew 4% for Q4 \u201817 despite the $0.34 impact from the Alkermes and Ionis deals and the 32% impact of ZINBRYTA charge. Non-GAAP EPS grew 8% for the full year 2017 versus prior year, despite the same factors as well as the $1.08 impact from our BMS. We ended the quarter with approximately $6.7 billion of cash and marketable securities.","Let me now turn to our full year guidance for 2018. We expect revenues of approximately $12.7 billion to $13 billion which would represent year-over-year growth of 3.5% to 6%. We expect cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales to be consistent with our full-year 2017 cost of goods sold. We anticipate R&D expense between 16% and 17% of sales. Of note guidance does not include any impact from potential acquisitions or large business development transactions as both are hard to predict. We expect SG&A expense to be approximately 15% to 16% of revenues. From a tax perspective, our guidance takes into account the impact of U.S. tax reform and we anticipate our GAAP tax rate for 2018 to be between 23.5% to 24.5% and our non-GAAP tax rate to be between 22.5% and 23.5%. We anticipate full year 2018 GAAP EPS results of $22.20 to $23.20 representing growth of 83% to 91% and non-GAAP EPS to be between $24.20 and $25.20 representing growth of 11% to 16%. From a quarterly perspective we expect non-GAAP EPS growth on year-over-year basis to be stronger in Q2 \u201818 and Q4 \u201818 due to the impact of business development events in 2017 and the factors described above. We believe the midpoint of the guidance ranges we have provided represents a reasonable base case.","I will now turn the call over to Michel for his closing comments.","Michel Vounatsos","Thanks Jeff. We are excited to have you on the team and I am glad to see that you are quickly coming up to speed on the business. I would like to conclude with these thoughts. When I spoke from the SIT a year ago, I told you we are refocusing the organization, building our new management team and developing a strategy and priorities for both short-term and long-term shareholder value creation. I stated that our actions would speak for themselves. 2017 was a very strong and successful year for Biogen and we delivered on the commitments we have made. For 2018 our goal is to continue this momentum and achieve our guidance. We have a well defined strategy to deliver near-term results and to maximize long-term value.","We have an energized world-class executive team and key opportunities in front of us based on the significant unmet medical needs and breakthroughs we are seeing in neuroscience. We believe the risk level neuroscience is fundamentally challenging at this time and we believe Biogen is uniquely positioned to leading the space based on our core capabilities and intense focus. Looking forward to leading the next 12 months to 18 months where we have several meaningful readouts across our neuroscience pipeline including natalizumab stroke BIIB098 in MS, BIIB054 in Parkinson\u2019s disease, BIIB074 for painful lumbosacral radiculopath, BAN2401 in Alzheimer's disease, BIIB067 for ALS and our gene therapy program for XLRS.","Before we go into Q&A, I would like to thank our employees around the world who are dedicated to making the positive impacts on patients\u2019 lives and all of the physicians can give us and participants in our clinical development programs. In 2018, Biogen celebrates its 40th anniversary. Our past and future achievements could not be realized without the passion and commitment.","With that, we will open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Michael Yee of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Michael Yee","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Congrats on a great quarter. Appreciate the question. Maybe a question for Michel, obviously, you have seen a ton of M&A going on in the space over the last 6 to 12 months and it\u2019s turning up maybe you could just remind us about how you think about your strategic M&A plans and how you think about whether neurology, aware of neurology you could go and whether there are other larger market opportunities outside of neurology that you can look at? How you think about the landscape now? Thanks.","MichelVounatsos","So, I will initiate the answer and then my colleagues will add. Long-term value generation is the strategic focus and we have communicated that. And for that, we said we shipped some of the capital allocation to enrich the pipeline. And I am pleased with what we have done in 2017 and what we have continuing to do in \u201818. I don\u2019t see a frenzy of increase of because of more cash. I see strategic intent, science, scientific rationale first, patents and ordered and financial rigor in order to rationalize any move from the company. We are contemplating early assets, which remains the sweet spot, the sweet spot where we can add tremendous value because of the capability that we have and the focus. We are contemplating larger assets as you can imagine, but I will stop here and I will let Jeff comment, it\u2019s important as the new CFO and Mike from the therapy point of view.","Jeff Capello","Thanks, Michel. It\u2019s a good question. What I say would be I think we laid out for the investor community at the JPMorgan Conference an illustrative view of how much capacity we have from a capital perspective and that concluded both cash on hand at the end of the second, third quarter rather leverage taking the leverage of the company up to 2x less the leverage we have today plus cash flow for the next 5 years. And if you put all those factors together, I am assuming a flat business, which we obviously don\u2019t expect. We get a $37 billion number, which gives us a lot of capacity to add to the business. And I think our focus is on that \u2013 is on growing the business continuing to be active in early stage, but also hopefully being active in mid to late stage assets to bring in things that are closer to revenue. Having said that, we also expect to be able to return cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchase, I think we have ample flexibility for that, but we will be disciplined and we will look for those opportunities that fit strategically, scientifically, that fit with the operations and fit in our core areas. So, we expect this to be active, but disciplined.","Michael Ehlers","The only thing I would add to that, Michael, is just reemphasize that really our approach is a blended one considering pipeline additions and larger opportunities as Jeff said where the strategy and science makes sense and where we really feel that Biogen can track the maximum value.","Operator","Our next question comes from Umer Raffat of Evercore. Your line is open.","Umer Raffat","Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. I wanted to focus on a couple of R&D topics if I may. First on TYSABRI stroke, I am curious your expectations for the 600 mg dose arm on the primary endpoint as well as how you think about the more \u2013 the longer time from stroke onset to have the role on the primary endpoint? And then separately, when I look at your slide on readouts for this year, one thing I noticed is your partner Alkermes had mentioned they will have data from the head-to-head study versus TECFIDERA at least for the 100 patients in early 2018 is what they had guided to for the readout over the course of last year. And I was curious if you have that data in-house anything you are seeing from that? Thank you.","Michael Ehlers","Yes, Umer, thanks. Let me take a couple of these here. So, what I would say is starting with the TYSABRI stroke setting, one reason why we are very interested in this study is the fact that we are assessing potential clinical benefit up to 24 hours after the stroke instant. This would obviously be a substantial change to standard of care [indiscernible] out there is for TPA and a thrombolytic really only approved in 4 hours to 5 hours after the stroke. So this would be significant. And we think that it makes sense in terms of the known pathophysiology of acute ischemic stroke where in the period after the infarct you have got this period of intense brain inflammation that\u2019s associated with poor clinical outcomes. And we are testing two different doses or perhaps you were getting at which is to see whether or not there is any dose dependent difference in clinical benefit. First, we will have to wait for the data and as always these are Phase 2 clinical studies and we will have to see what it shows, but where to be positive we think that this would represent a significant advance. On the question on the Alkermes BIIB098 MMF, this is something that which we are still evaluating and what we said is that we do anticipate an ability to file this year. We have not made the determination exactly when data will be presented out of that, but that\u2019s something that we are working through with Alkermes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is open.","Geoff Meacham","Good morning guys and thanks for the question. Just have a few quick ones, for Jeff is there a tipping point in the biosimilars business that would make the option for the JV more attractive and I am assuming that the status quo is assumed in 2018 guidance. And then for Michel just to ask the bus dev question another way, if you had to choose the priority would it be to diversify pipeline risk say over the longer term or more to augment P&L growth say in the next few years? Thank you.","Jeff Capello","Okay. Let me start with the biosimilars question. So we were pleased with the performance in the fourth quarter. And as we looked out through next year and there on I think that business is well-positioned. As you pointed we do have an option to buy in more to that business and I think that would be our intent. And then we continue to look at it strategically in terms of what would fit with our core operations going forward.","Michel Vounatsos","And concerning your second part of the question we are not on the burning platform, we are doing reasonably well in terms of top line momentum as you can see. Obviously, there is a binary event that we all know and should we find a late stage that is aligned and meets the criteria that were alluded by the team here will be very interested. So, science will be the key driver, the ability to create value that nobody else will be able and alignment to the strategies that we brought in.","Operator","Your next question comes from Geoffrey Porges of Leerink. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Porges","Thank you very much. And Jeff maybe just a few kind of questions just on the P&L, because your margins certainly bounced around compared to prior periods, first you alluded to the gross margin effect of the high contract manufacturing, should we be modeling that the gross margin is going to so trend in the direction of the Q4 performance going forward, because of the contribution of that in the biosimilars mix to your overall revenue. And then secondly you talked about the SG&A spike in Q4 and that was significantly higher than we had anticipated, could you give us a little bit of color to the contributing factors to that spike and how that might continue going forward as we update our models? Thanks.","Jeff Capello","Sure. Well, good questions. So first question, gross margins went down Q3 to Q4 from like 88% down to 85%. Two factors drove that, the first was our significant growth in corporate partner revenue, it increased significantly from the third and fourth quarter and that has much lower gross margin. I would say that contributed about two-thirds of the impact of the gross margin erosion sequentially. The other third was the roughly $20 million inventory charge we took at ZINBRYTA. And as we look forward to next year, gross margin quarter-by-quarter although it\u2019s difficult to predict excess and obsolescence charges, we obviously don\u2019t expect that charge to recur per se. And we also expect to have less corporate partner revenue for the quarters for next year and the margin to be slightly better. So both of those things will abate and we expect our margins to kind of get back to the 87% range. So we are pretty comfortable with that by quarter for gross margins. On the question of SG&A, you are correct that the SG&A rate did increase quite a bit sequentially from the third to the fourth quarter. There is really four factors that drove that. One was just basic expenses that ended up moving in from the first quarter of \u201818 to the fourth quarter which were known. The second impact were investments with regard to our SMA business. We are very happy and pleased with the growth, but we are investing in it. The third factor was year end bonus true-ups and other benefit true-ups which were typical the fourth quarter. And then the fourth component were fees and services for projects. So what we think happens here is the rate comes back down as we look at kind of going forward it will kind of \u2013 it will get back into kind of the our guidance range. So we think the fourth quarter is a little bit of an aberration and it will settle back down.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Schmidt of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Eric Schmidt","Thanks for all the added transparency on SPINRAZA and some of the other numbers. Maybe for Jeff on SPINRAZA you spoke to faster ex-U.S. growth in 2018, is that going to be a function of existing geographies, putting more patients on the drug or will be driven by more newer territories coming online and when you think about SPINRAZA kind of big picture, could this be a franchise similar to other orphan franchises where maybe as much as two-thirds of the total peak revenue is outside the U.S.? Thanks.","Michel Vounatsos","So, I will get started Eric, and then Jeff would come. So we are very pleased with the momentum that we see here, ex-U.S. also in the U.S. where we foresee continuous growth. But you know the most urgent to treat patients, the 70% achievements from the age 0 to 2, somehow is done and now we move into the year the biggest strata. Ex-U.S. a significant opportunity and as Jeff said 70% approximately of the results to-date are generated by three markets. So, we still have a long way to go in terms of reimbursement that we are currently negotiating and also NPP that emerges from geographies that were non-anticipated, so still a long way to go ex-U.S.","Jeff Capello","Yes. I would just add that we are really pleased with the performance. I think European team has done a really good job and they are poised to kind of do even better in 2018, as we look at the countries, we have got \u2013 countries kind of lined up and we expect increased growth from the existing countries as well new countries coming on. So I think that the business is really well-positioned for 2018 in Europe as well as the U.S.","Michel Vounatsos","So just to add to that, we are proved in 34 markets, reimbursed in 14 and we still have to 280 patients on early access program.","Matt Calistri","We are ready for the next question. I want to remind please keep it to one question. I know there is a lot of people in the queue, so please keep it to one question. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Matthew Harrison","Great, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to ask on your SMA gene therapy product, what are the steps that you have to take to get that started by the middle of the year and can you talk about potential differentiation versus the existing SMA gene therapy product that\u2019s in the clack? Thanks.","Michael Ehlers","Yes. Thanks. Thanks Matthew. So I mean steps to be taken I think these are lot of the known in standard steps, essentially about trial design, material preparation, site activation, etcetera. So there is \u2013 there are no kind of surprises in the steps to get to the clinic here, but things that we consider are also lot of known things. As we are designing this, which are the patient subset, way to delivery, we think a lot about manufacturing. We think a lot about the safety features for these agents, still early days across the space in gene therapy, so we think a lot about that. And all of those can be elements of differentiation. Another thing that we are spending a lot of time contemplating is how we would want to be able to demonstrate clinical benefit and the potential space for a gene therapy where we think there is a lot of opportunity together with SPINRAZA.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alethia Young of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Alethia Young","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, just one unrelated to like ALS in the Karyopharm and putting it together of what you are doing with Ionis if you can just talk about kind of the strategic vision there with the ALS opportunity? Thanks.","Michael Ehlers","Yes, Alethia, thanks for the question. So, the Karyopharm compound is pretty interesting one. This is very early, it\u2019s a preclinical, but we will get it to the clinic this year. It\u2019s inhibitor of XPO1. This is a key component of nuclear export and they had done a lot of collaborative work, very nice scientific work showing that this could reduce the hallmark pathology of sporadic ALS, which is the cytoplasmic accumulation of these toxic RNA binding proteins like TDP-43 and FUS, which undergo unclear export that can be blocked at this way. So, the hypothesis is that this could be an oral drug potentially for sporadic ALS. This really complements our ASO programs with Ionis that are really targeting initially genetic forms of ALS like the SOD1 mutant ALS, which is a subset. So, we have got very complementary modalities, completely orthogonal mechanisms and potentially distinct clinical populations.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang from Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Ying Huang","Hey, good morning. Thanks for the question. Just want to ask one of SPINRAZA U.S. new patient adds, it seems that in 4Q added 420 patients, it\u2019s a step down from 3Q. I was wondering is it because of our seasonality you expected to go back to let\u2019s say 500 per quarter level or what\u2019s the outlook for 2018 new patients out in the U.S.? Thank you.","Michel Vounatsos","So, I will get started and Jeff will come in. So, first Q4, there were lot of holidays. Okay, so we need to take that into account and it is expected that the suitable proportion of the later onset has complicated spine and therefore it takes more time to dose those patients. So, this is a trend that we need to get used to even if we work at helping the provider community to dose better with devices etcetera. So, we are come to start out the patients where there is a bit less urgency to treat and some of them have more complicated spine. Jeff will add.","Jeff Capello","Yes. And the only thing I would add to that, I would agree with that would be just getting the infrastructure up and running the number of sites people trained to kind of handle the increased volume that will take time. So, I think it\u2019s a combination of both getting the more difficult to treat patients and getting the infrastructure ramped up.","Michel Vounatsos","The epidemiology is still there. We have 9,000 patients and we still have a long way to go. We increased the team. So, we are getting in there step by step and there is a long queue of patients that are waiting.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Raymond of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Chris Raymond","Thanks. I am just on the SPINRAZA discounting and allowances I think that you called out, just doing some quick math on the patients and the dose per patient \u2013 doses per patient that you guys callout in your numbers. I don\u2019t really see a step down in the \u2013 essentially in the revenue per dose quarter-on-quarter. Can you maybe sort of square that a little bit and talk about what\u2019s really going on with respect to discounting allowances? Thanks.","Michael Ehlers","Yes, I am not sure we are going to be able to do the math real-time for you, it\u2019s fairly complicated, but what we did experience just to reiterate is that we did have a little bit of an uptick in the fourth quarter and discounts and allowances by about a couple of 100 basis points as we sell into more 340B hospitals and the Medicaid mix kind of increases. So that is happening and we expect that to happen into next year, it\u2019s kind of hard to do the math real-time on your numbers, but we can certainly take that offline.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas of Citigroup. Your line is open.","Robyn Karnauskas","Hi, guys. Thank you. I was wondering if you could talk a little about how the price increases for MS and FX contributed to your 2018 guidance and then what element is just growth? Thanks.","Michael Ehlers","Okay. So, from a price perspective, I think the people are aware, I will talk to the U.S. first that we took prices up about, little bit more than 8%, some products a little bit less than that in others. So, we expect to get kind of some price drop through. We do expect as we commented the gross to net or discounts in a while just to go up. So, we won\u2019t probably fall through as much as we had historically, but we will still get some kind of pricing increases. Volume will be a little bit pressured in the first half of the year as we complete the anniversarying of the OCREVUS launch after which in the second half volume will come back a little bit more. So, that\u2019s a little bit with regard to the U.S. dynamics. Outside the U.S., we expect to continue to see pretty good growth in unit volume across most of the major European countries. We will have kind of OCREVUS coming in across some of the countries slowly, so there will be a little bit of a headwind. We still expect to grow and then price will maybe be down a little bit across Europe. So, that kind of if you put all that together you get to kind of the low single-digit kind of contraction of the business. And then the factor we have of course is the interferon class is continuing to get again some headwind as a result of people moving away from that class a bit and we are doing our best to kind of stem that. Hopefully, that\u2019s helpful.","Operator","Your next question comes from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Terence Flynn","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a follow-up on your gene therapy, Mike, you talked about some of the differentiated features, but are you willing at this point to give us anymore details with respect to either the vector you guys are using or the route of delivery and how you are thinking about initial trial designs? Thanks.","Michael Ehlers","Yes, I know, thanks for the question. This is not something that which we are talking about yet. I just want to highlight that these are key elements of our considerations for designing study. And I think it will be a general feature for a lot of AAV base gene therapy efforts. It\u2019s still kind of early days to know this. And like I mentioned, the long-term safety profile and how that relates to route of administration transduction efficiency, patient subtype etcetera is what we are working through and those together with the development paths it might contemplate a position along with SPINRAZA we believe are all potential elements of differentiation.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Cory Kasimov","Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess for BIIB089 so formerly ALKS 8700, what type of clinical profile do you need to see relative to TECFIDERA to be confident this product is differentiated and if it ultimately is what are your early thoughts about the potential commercial strategy for that product? Thanks.","Michael Ehlers","Yes, I will start on the clinical side and then see if Michel or Jeff want to jump in on the commercial differentiation and by the way it\u2019s BIIB098 not BIIB089.","Cory Kasimov","Oh, sorry about that.","Michael Ehlers","For those taking notes memorizing. So, look I think the profile here that we are looking at is to see whether or not this is different fumarate pro drug has a different profile in terms of GI tolerability. This is something which we will play out in trial designs in looking at adverse events and ultimately probably will play out in the real world setting. So we are looking at that as kind of a potential clinical differentiator and that will be based on the data that we see. Ultimately the head-to-head comparison may allow us to get a better feeling for that. It may also end up, but this will have to play out in the real world setting.","Michel Vounatsos","Yes. As Mike said so the priority is certainly on the better tolerability profile. We did suffer on the GI discontinuation on track even if we did improve a couple of points. There is still a long way go the oral market of the MS TMTs is going much faster than the other segments. So we will be able to expand the big franchise there. And with the longer patent life, this opens plenty of opportunities beyond the priority that we just spoke about.","Operator","Our final question comes from Carter Gould of UBS. Your line is open.","Carter Gould","Right. Good morning, guys and congrats on a successful 2017. From Michael, just following up on the earlier comments on TYSABRI and stroke, how do you think about the hurdle for potentially moving that into Phase 3 given clearly need, but balanced by the [indiscernible] we have seen with prior assets that had encouraging initial data? Thank you.","Michael Ehlers","Yes. I think it\u2019s a valid point, Carter. I mean this is one of the reasons why we have spent a lot of time really thinking about this. I mean our belief is that just the world has changed in terms of the ability to really conduct and evaluate the stroke to trials and the kinds of quantitative endpoints that you can really apply. And there is a lot of reasons for that I think one macro reasons that people have learned how to conduct is better with the advent of endovascular thrombectomies, trials are actually working now. So there is a lot more refinements just in the execution of these trials and the other thing is that we are looking at this with eyes wide open and the totality of our action one and action two studies. And so based on the data we obtain from action one, we have revised our study design and our endpoint selection. And so we do think that out of this study the data that we will get, we will be able to know whether or not the clinical benefit that we saw across action one and action two whether it\u2019s real or not. And it has to be real for us to take it into the Phase 3.","Operator","That was our final question today. I will return the call to our presenters.","Michel Vounatsos","So, thank you all for your attention and support to our great company. Thank you. Have a good day.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Idec Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Ms. Claudine Prowse, Vice President, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Claudine Prowse","Thank you, Melissa. And welcome to Biogen Idec's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call.","Before we begin, please visit the Investors section of biogenidec.com to find our press release and related financial tables including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures that we'll discuss today. Our GAAP financial results are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results, which we believe provides additional insight into the ongoing economics and reflects how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call.","I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements which are based on our current intent, belief and expectations. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and I encourage everyone to consult the risk factors described in our SEC filings for additional detail. Actual results could differ materially from our expectations.","Today on the call, I'm joined by Dr. George Scangos, Chief Executive Officer; Dr. Doug Williams, Executive Vice President of Research and Development; Tony Kingsley, Executive Vice President of Global Commercial Operations; and Paul Clancy, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. We'll also be joined for the Q&A portion of the call by Dr. Al Sandrock, Senior Vice President of Development Sciences and Chief Medical Officer.","Now I'll turn the call over to George.","George A. Scangos","Okay, thanks, Claudine, and good morning, everyone.","Our strong momentum continued into the third quarter. We delivered 6% revenue growth to $1.4 billion, managed our expenses and continued to advance the late-stage pipeline. As you can see from the press release, we had a very solid quarter across the products and delivered strong earnings growth to the bottom line. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.91, up 19% year-over-year, although this number was bolstered by a onetime item of $32 million relating to the monetization of our royalty and other rights related to Benlysta.","The AVONEX business continued to deliver improved contribution driven by share performance within the ABCRE class both inside and outside of the U.S. The AVONEX PEN, designed to improve the self-injection experience, renewed physician interest and helped to maintain share of voice and awareness of the brand in a competitive market.","We continued to see steady year-over-year growth in TYSABRI units both in and outside of the U.S. Awareness remains high for our risk stratification tools and we're seeing nice growth in testing volumes. The key attribute of TYSABRI continues to be strong efficacy. We believe the investments we're making in the product risk stratification will keep the growth trajectory moving in the right direction.","We also made progress with our late-stage pipeline. We were delighted to announce positive top line results from our registrational study for Factor IX in Hemophelia B and we're expecting results for Factor VIII in the near future.","Last week, the FDA informed us of an extended PDUFA date for BG-12 to allow more time for the review of the new drug application. The extended PDUFA date is now in late March. Additional studies were not requested, and we continue to work with the agency to facilitate the review. And while this 3-month delay is, of course, disappointing, our view of the potential of BG-12 to benefit patients with MS has not changed. Awareness remains high, aided by the recent publication of BG-12's pivotal data in the New England Journal of Medicine. These studies, which form the foundation of the regulatory filings, support BG-12's potential as a new oral option for MS treatment.","Earlier this month, we also shared more than 50 company- and partner-sponsored presentations at the ECTRIMS meeting in Lyon, France. These presentations included data reaffirming the powerful efficacy of TYSABRI; AVONEX's 16-year history as a proven and effective, safe MS therapy; analysis of pool data from the Phase III DEFINE and CONFIRM trials of oral BG-12, as well as supporting data on daclizumab and anti-LINGO as possible treatments for MS. I think the breadth of our presence and the presentations highlight our continuing leadership in MS and our commitment to bring better medicines to patients in all segments of the market: the well-established injectables, the high-efficacy segment, as well as the growing oral segment.","So with those highlights, I'll now turn the call over to Doug Williams to take you through the pipeline advances in more detail.","Douglas Edward Williams","Thanks, George. During Q3, we continued to made progress on several fronts with our R&D programs. These advances should position the company for substantial future growth. Let me begin by focusing on our late-stage pipeline.","Last month, we announced positive top line results from B-LONG, the registrational study of our recombinant long-lasting Factor IX. Let me briefly summarize the study objectives and top line results from the study.","Primary objectives of the B-LONG study were to assess the safety and tolerability of long-lasting Factor IX, efficacy in all treatment arms of the study and a comparison of the annualized bleed rates or ABR between the episodic treatment arm of the study and the weekly and individualized prophylaxis arms of the study. The results showed that, compared to the episodic treatment arm of the study, the ABR of the weekly or individualized dosing arms of the study showed reductions in ABR, where the overall median ABR was 2.95 in the weekly prophylaxis arm, 1.38 in the individualized prophylaxis arm and 17.69 in the episodic treatment arm. Greater than 90% of bleeding episodes that occurred were controlled by a single injection of long-lasting Factor IX. Importantly, at least half of the subjects achieved a dosing interval of 14 days or more in the individualized prophylaxis arm.","No patients developed inhibitors to Factor IX and there were no cases of anaphylaxis. Long-lasting Factor IX was generally well tolerated in the study. While there's still ongoing analysis being done with the B-LONG study, we're now working very hard to complete our regulatory submission for filing in the first quarter of 2013. We look forward to sharing with you top line results from A-LONG, the registrational study for our recombinant long-lasting Factor VIII, in the near future.","Moving now to our late-stage neurology franchise. We showcased the interim results from ENDORSE as a late-breaking presentation at the ECTRIMS meeting. ENDORSE is a double-blinded Phase III extension study evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of BG-12 at a dose of 240 milligrams BID or TID. At the time of the analysis, ENDORSE had enrolled over 1,700 patients with relapsing-remitting MS who had completed the DEFINE or CONFIRM studies. In ENDORSE, the safety profile for patients was generally consistent with that of DEFINE and CONFIRM and no new safety issues were identified in subjects who continued on BG-12 or were treated for more than 2 years. The incidence of serious infections was low, consistent with DEFINE and CONFIRM, and there were no opportunistic infections in patients treated long term with BG-12. The types and frequency of malignancies that were observed in the treatment groups were expected in the population under study. This trial will continue until our expected completion date in 2016.","In a second late-breaking presentation at ECTRIMS, we highlighted primary efficacy results from SELECTION, the one-year extension study of SELECT, the first registrational study of daclizumab HYP or DAC. The results of SELECTION supported the positive findings seen in SELECT and indicated DAC's clinical effect was sustained through the second year of therapy. Safety results of SELECTION showed that the safety profile of DAC was similar in years 1 and 2 of therapy.","Moving on to TYSABRI. We continue to build and improve upon our risk stratification tools. The generation 2 assay was launched in Europe earlier this year and we anticipate launching it in the U.S. in the coming months. This assay will provide for improved sensitivity and specificity to detect patients with low levels of JCV-specific antibodies.","Looking ahead to the remainder of 2012, we expect to share top line results from A-LONG, the registrational study of long-lasting Factor VIII, in the near future; and the Phase III study of PEGylated interferon beta-1a in relapsing MS in early 2013. For EMPOWER, which is the Phase III study of dexpramipexole in ALS, the study remains blinded and we expect top line data readout by late this year or early next year. In late September, the last patient completed 12 months of treatment in EMPOWER. As a result, all clinical sites are now actively working to evaluate all patients still active in the trial for the final study visit. That timing of these visits will drive the timing of the top line data readout. I look forward to providing you with updates on our progress for our late-stage programs in the coming quarters.","Turning now to the early-stage pipeline in research. I'm pleased to announce that we enrolled our first patient this past quarter in the Phase II study of anti-TWEAK for lupus nephritis and the Phase Ib study for BIIB037 for Alzheimer's disease. The TWEAK program will examine the impact on renal function of treatment with a neutralizing antibody against TWEAK in combination with standard of care. The TWEAK molecule is associated with renal flares in lupus nephritis patients and the absence of immune effects of TWEAK make this an ideal molecule to combine with current standard of care treatments, such as CellCept, which are profoundly immunosuppressive.","Our BIIB037 program is a multiple ascending dose Phase Ib study of our anti-beta-amyloid antibody in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The study will examine the reduction of beta-amyloid by imaging to define the optimal dose for future studies.","Proof-of-concept studies for anti-LINGO are expected to begin dosing in the fourth quarter of this year for optic neuritis and the second half of next year for relapsing and progressive forms of MS.","Finally, we've decided with our partner, Portola Pharmaceuticals, not to proceed with the planned Phase IIa trial in RA because the lead compound did not meet the stringent target product profile to be competitive in this specific market. We're continuing to do exploratory work in allergic asthma as a possible indication for the lead molecule and are focusing on additional 6 selective backup compounds for what we believe is a key pathway in chronic autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.","We also took steps in the quarter to strengthen our discovery research capabilities through restructuring and reallocation of resources to support those early stage activities. These steps are consistent with the strategic priorities of the R&D group which I laid out in some detail at the Analyst Day in June.","With that, I'll now pass the call over to Tony.","Tony Kingsley","Thank you, Doug. Solid execution of our product strategies drove 6% revenue growth in the third quarter. Global AVONEX revenues increased 8%, driven by a 5% units increase year-over-year, as we continued to experience competitive share performance within the ABCRE class across markets.","We continue to be pleased with the uptake of the AVONEX PEN and believe strong commercial execution is driving strong performance. Convenience is an important differentiator in the ABCRE class, and as a once-weekly treatment, AVONEX has become a compelling choice for both patients and physicians. During the third quarter, more than 2\/3 of all new AVONEX starts in the U.S. have been with the PEN. We've also seen strong conversion from the prefilled syringe to the PEN, which we believe will benefit longer-term retention. Similarly, we've seen significant interest in the AVOSTARTGRIP as over 2\/3 of all new starts on AVONEX in the third quarter titrated with the AVOSTARTGRIP.","Outside of the U.S., AVONEX remains the prominent MS therapy and we maintained our leading market share position. Unit growth in these markets was strong, increasing 8% year-over-year. Similar to the U.S., the AVONEX PEN is continuing to drive strong unit demand across Europe.","Moving on to TYSABRI. Third quarter global TYSABRI units increased 9% versus prior year. We experienced strong unit growth both in the U.S. and outside the U.S., with TYSABRI units growing 10% and 8%, respectively, in the third quarter versus prior year. We are seeing solid growth in new patients, with 2,100 added during the third quarter.","We're pleased with the execution of our commercial strategy. TYSABRI's core efficacy message continues to resonate with physicians and risk stratification and the use of the JCV assay continue to build physician belief in TYSABRI's benefit-risk profile. We see testing volumes growing nicely. Physicians are increasingly testing new candidates for TYSABRI. And we see greater confidence in moving the product earlier in the treatment paradigm.","During the quarter, U.S. discontinuations rates remained stable quarter-over-quarter and TOUCH forms for newly diagnosed patients increased to the low double digits, providing confidence in our commercial strategy. In Europe, the rollout of the second-generation assay has contributed to a moderate increase in discontinuations. While we believe that TYSABRI will continue to see periods of lumpiness in net patient adds, we believe we will continue to see an overall solid growth trajectory.","While we were obviously disappointed by the PDUFA extension in the U.S. for BG-12, we feel well prepared as we continue to invest in prelaunch preparations and detailed tactical planning. We are also accelerating our commercial activities for the hemophilia franchise given the recent positive readout in Factor IX and in anticipation of the upcoming Factor VIII readout. We have a strong nucleus of commercial leadership in place and we'll continue to build out the team, infrastructure and supply chain necessary for a successful launch.","The hemophilia market will be a new market for Biogen Idec, but we understand the requirements for commercial success as we continue to build awareness, establish trust and credibility and attract world-class talent.","We believe our commercial momentum is solid. We are executing our strategy successfully and believe we are well prepared for potential upcoming launches.","With that, I'll hand the call over to Paul.","Paul J. Clancy","Thanks, Tony. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.67 in the third quarter. The primary differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results are outlined in the earnings presentation and include $51 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles, $10 million in fair value adjustments for contingent consideration and $8 million related to the research restructuring executed in the quarter. This was partially offset by the tax impact on these items. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.91, up 19%. As George noted, this quarter we favorably benefited from the $32 million recognized from the sale of our royalty and other rights related to Benlysta. In addition, as a result of our decision not to move the Syk Inhibitor program into Phase II, we did not incur the previously anticipated $23 million milestone payment.","Let me walk through the financial results now. Q3 AVONEX worldwide revenue was strong, growing 8% to $736 million. In the U.S., AVONEX grew 12% to $462 million. U.S. unit volume increased 1% versus prior year and was up 2% versus last quarter.","Inventory in the wholesale channel ended at slightly less than 2 weeks, a modest increase compared to the prior quarter. As we mentioned last quarter, there may still be some AVONEX stocking in the retail outlets to likely balance the demand for the prefilled syringe in PEN. As a result, we cautiously believe that there could be excess inventory in the retail channel that may unwind over the next couple quarters.","Internationally, the underlying AVONEX business is strong as units increased 8% year-over-year. International AVONEX revenue was $274 million in the quarter, an increase of 1% compared to third quarter of 2011. Foreign exchange was a meaningful headwind for the quarter, weakening AVONEX revenue by $29 million. This was offset by a $9 million hedge gain, as compared to a $9 million hedge loss in Q3 2011. AVONEX international revenues were also impacted by certain modest price reductions across a few select countries and a mix shift to lower-priced distributor markets.","TYSABRI worldwide end market sales were $404 million, an increase of 3% year-over-year. Biogen Idec recorded TYSABRI product revenues of $275 million.","In the U.S., TYSABRI product revenue to Biogen Idec grew 15% to $98 million. Q3 international TYSABRI product revenues were down 8% to $177 million, while units increased 8%. The disconnect between unit and revenue growth was driven by approximately $14 million of deferred revenue in our Italian affiliate and the impact of foreign exchange.","FX for the third quarter weakened TYSABRI international revenue by $19 million versus prior year. We offset this by a $30 million gain from hedging compared to a $2 million hedge loss in the prior year.","U.S. RITUXAN sales were $787 million, up 7% versus prior year. RITUXAN continues to experience continued penetration in NHL maintenance setting and further uptake in CLL. Our U.S. profit share from that business was $259 million. Royalties and profit share on sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. were $29 million. The result was $288 million of revenue from unconsolidated joint business.","FAMPYRA revenue was $12 million for the quarter. Recall that the GBA gave FAMPYRA a level 5 rating and provided a range of approximately EUR 1,000 to EUR 3,000 per year as the price that they're willing to reimburse. We're currently in price negotiations with the German authorities and expect a resolution in early 2013. As of August 1, we've been recording FAMPYRA revenue at a net price that assumes the lower end of the range and we'll continue to do so until the final price is established. Royalties were $47 million and we recorded $12 million of corporate partner revenue in the quarter.","Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q3 cost of goods sold were $139 million or 10% of revenues. The increase in COGS year-over-year was driven by higher AVONEX revenue, higher cost of the AVONEX PEN, nurse training fees and an increased funding related to the JCV assay.","Q3 R&D expense was $296 million or 21% of revenues, lower than anticipated due to the timing of certain clinical trial expenses and the avoidance of the expected $23 million payment for the Syk program. Our research spend was also temporarily down during the quarter due to the research restructuring.","Q3 SG&A expense was $298 million or 22% of revenues, an increase of 15% over last year as we prepared for potential commercial launches. Collaboration profit sharing line totaled $76 million.","We now have a new line item on the P&L, as you may have noticed, called \"gain on sale of rights.\" Prior to this quarter, we're eligible to receive low royalty from GSK in each GSI on global sales of Benlysta. We sold our Benlysta royalty and other rights to a DRI Capital-managed fund. DRI will now pay us a multiple of those royalties for the period covering October 2011 through the third quarter of 2014. This will be recorded on the gain of sale of rights line. During this quarter, we received $32 million from DRI, representing essentially 3 quarters of activity. We expect quarterly payments through the third quarter of 2014 as a gain on the P&L to be less than the amount paid this quarter, independent on the uptake of Benlysta. Other income and expense was a loss of $5 million in Q3. Our Q3 non-GAAP tax rate was 24.2%.","In the third quarter, our weighted average diluted shares were 238 million. And we ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in cash and marketable securities, of which approximately 1\/3 is outside the U.S. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which were $1.91 in the quarter, an increase of 19% year-over-year.","Now I'll turn to our updated full year 2012 financial guidance. Overall, we're raising our full year guidance to close to a double-digit increase in non-GAAP earnings. This has been a year characterized by very solid commercial performance on our core products, coupled with meaningful investments to mature the late-stage pipeline and prepare for potential product launches.","We expect full year revenue growth of mid-to high single digits, a modest improvement over prior guidance. While we're working to resolve the IE for TYSABRI claim in Italy, our current guidance does not include a resolution in 2012. Regarding FAMPYRA, as I previously mentioned, the balance of the year assumes revenues recorded at the lower end of the GBA range. Our full year forecast also assumes a modest slowing of U.S. RITUXAN revenues in the fourth quarter due to wholesale dynamics, which is characteristic of past year-end trends.","Our expense targets are largely on track to our original full year business plan: cost of sales expected to be between 9% and 10% of total revenue; R&D, expected to be between 24% and 25% of revenue. Our R&D forecast includes approximately $20 million to $30 million of an upfront payment in the fourth quarter earmarked for a discovery collaboration which we're in the process of negotiating. Additionally, we expect to incur some supply chain spending related to dexpramipexole to be prepared in the event of a positive readout.","SG&A is expected to be between 22% and 23% of total revenue. During the fourth quarter, expect meaningful increase in investment for prelaunch activity, building out our customer-facing resources, product positioning and promotional planning, scientific outreach, preparing the patient services organization and readying our supply chain and distribution organization. This spending is purposely back-end loaded as we get closer to the potential BG-12 launch.","We put our Denmark manufacturing facility into service during the month of September, which is a very positive milestone. And we'll seek formal regulatory approval for TYSABRI supply in mid-2013. The short-term P&L impact of this was a change from capitalizing interest to expensing it. This will result in approximately $7 million of noncash expense in the fourth quarter which will be recorded on the OI&E line.","We expect our tax expense in 2012 to be between 23% and 25% of pretax income. As a result, we now anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $6.40 and $6.50 and GAAP earnings per share to be between $5.63 and $5.73, an increase from previous guidance by approximately $0.20. This is due to the combination of the gain from the Benlysta-related transaction and the strength in the core business.","As you likely noted, we expect our third quarter earnings per share to be the high watermark for the year, and the fourth quarter, conversely to be the low watermark. This is due to the many of the P&L items I've highlighted, included the significant prelaunch activity in the fourth quarter, the potential research collaboration highlighted, the step-down of the Benlysta-related gain and the interest expense related to the Denmark manufacturing facility.","So this was a solid quarter, and while we have an additional quarter to go, we're positioned nicely for a successful year.","I'll hand the call over to George for his closing comments.","George A. Scangos","Okay, thanks, Paul. So look, as you can see, during the quarter we made excellent progress across our financial, commercial, R&D objectives for the year. And it's an exciting time for us as we look to close out the year and move into 2013. We had a positive result for the long-lasting blood Factor IX for Hemophelia B and have 3 more pivotal trial data readouts ahead of us: Factor VIII for Hemophilia A, dexpramipexole for ALS and PEGylated interferon for MS, an all-time high for by Biogen Idec and the result of the commitment and productivity of the talented employees across the organization.","As we prepare for the potential of multiple product launches in the coming years, we'll continue to be vigilant, keeping a tight lid on costs while investing where necessary to ensure that we have successful launches and a pipeline that delivers sustainable growth for the future.","We believe that we're on track to deliver solid revenue and EPS growth in a year in which we've had a number of pipeline successes and in which we're investing heavily for the future growth that we anticipate from our new products. And that's not an easy thing to do.","I want to thank our dedicated employees who have helped us to achieve our goals, as well as patients and physicians who are always central to what we do.","So with that, we'll now close our remarks and open up the call for questions. Thanks to all of you for joining us this morning.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt from Cowen and Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","George, just a quick question on the BG-12 PDUFA date delay. Did you receive a reason for that delay from the FDA? Was some sort of data resubmission classified as a major amendment? And if so, what might that have been?","George A. Scangos","Yes, thanks, Eric. I'm -- why am I not surprised that's the first question? Okay, look, technically, the answer to your question is, yes, it is a major amendment. But let's understand what the term -- major amendment is kind of a term of art. So in the normal review of an FDA -- of an NDA, the FDA asks questions of the sponsor and to which the sponsor, in this case us, response in writing. So the FDA has the ability to determine that any of those responses can be classified as a major amendment. And so by doing so, the FDA extends the PDUFA date for 3 months, and as far as we know, there is no other mechanism by which the FDA can extend the PDUFA date by 3 months. So the fact that a response is classified as a major amendment doesn't necessarily mean that there are problems with the application or the drug. It can mean only that the FDA believes it needs more time to review the application, the answers to the questions, and will not be able to meet the original PDUFA date. And we believe that's the case with our application. And as you know, Eric, a 3-month extension has been applied to a lot of other compounds, including recent approvals in MS. So we believe we're on track, and we have a 3-month delay.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","It sounds like you were prepared for that one.","George A. Scangos","It wasn't a surprise.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from JPMorgan.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess, just a follow-up to that and to some of Paul's questions -- or Paul's comments on the fourth quarter. Sounds like you guys are investing pretty heavily in the BG-12 infrastructure ahead of time. But maybe just give us kind of an update with where you are with respect to hiring, promotional and what sort of cost that you've already incurred and maybe the timing of when you think you'll start to roll out some of the more commercial personnel costs with respect to the launch.","Paul J. Clancy","Yes, Geoff, let -- Tony and I will try to tag-team that. So and I'm glad you asked the question because, certainly, this -- as my guidance implies, there's some lumpiness in the quarter-to-quarter trends on SG&A expense, and that's very purposeful on our end. Costs for Q3 were a little bit lower than we expected for both R&D as well as, actually, SG&A. I mean, that's just kind of the way things kind of turned out for Q3 and resulted in some pull-through on the bottom line, but we do intend -- and it's more than just the personnel costs, right? It's more than just the customer-facing resources. We do intend to, over the next 90 days, or now nearing in on the next 60 days, to really prepare for BG-12 across customer facing, medical education, scientific education, preparing the whole organization. So I think that is very consistent with what we've said over the past is this is a rare opportunity that we have. We don't want to be pennywise and pound foolish, so we'll put kind of the investments in as we get ready for kind of what we hope is a BG-12 launch early in the second quarter of 2013. Tony?","Tony Kingsley","Yes, thanks, Paul. So, Geoff, look, we had the plan for approval. Obviously, you'd want us to do that in resource and the critical areas for approval, particularly getting people trained and in place. So we are obviously well into that ramp for the right reason, but we also planned for the contingency. So we will have to adjust, redeploy and look to manage discretionary spend in the light of this delay and manage the ramp over time. So that's what we will do tactically at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from Bernstein.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And just to follow up on some of the commercial comments rubbed [ph] and BG-12. First, could you just help us reconcile TYSABRI? The patient growth trend looks like it's in the high teens year-over-year. And I know there are some onetime items in there, so if you could just sort of bridge us back to that patient growth trend. And secondly, could you let us know about the pricing? You mentioned a couple of negative pricing effects for AVONEX. Could you give us a little bit more detail about the magnitude and whether that's likely to continue to play through the results for the immediate future?","Tony Kingsley","Yes, thanks, Geoffrey. It's Tony. So on the numbers, TYSABRI is never an exact straight line between patients, units, et cetera. We have seen, we think, you look at U.S. and Europe, solid unit growth year-on-year and solid patient growth year-on-year. But as Paul will talk to, the impact outside the U.S. was more pricing, particularly IEFA and some FX issues.","Paul J. Clancy","Yes. And just to add, Geoff. And I think this is a probably continued commentary from our partners' conversation yesterday. Most of the imprecision, if you will, is rest of world patients, right? We have pretty darn good visibility, we think, driven by the TOUCH program in the United States for the patient calculation. Outside the United States, it really is -- and I apologize if we presented it as if it's precise data, but outside the United States, it's a combination of registries in certain countries, literally unit triangulation in other countries where we don't have registries. So I don't -- and we adjust those as we look backwards. I don't think that, as we do that and we look back, it has at all changed the fundamental story. The disconnect outside the United States between units, patients can be driven by what we just talked about, the imprecision of the data. It could be driven by compliance, which we don't think is a big deal, right? We've seen that in past years with TYSABRI, with drug holidays, suspension. We're not sensing that outside the United States and in Europe. And then it can be driven by inventory in parallel trade dynamics in Europe specifically. We do know of some parallel trade issues in the quarter that we work extremely hard, like any other biopharmaceutical company, to try to limit those, but there were some dynamics. And what ends up happening is units show up in one quarter versus -- as opposed to the other quarter from a patient perspective. The second part of your question, Geoff, was designed around AVONEX. I'd underscore, it was modest price reductions. We had seen some price reductions driven by austerity measures in 2010, 2011. Spain was one of those, as we pointed out in our SEC filings. This quarter, the most notable one was France where just kind of normal kind of price conversations with France resulted in a little bit of a low-single-digit decline in AVONEX price there. But I think we're weathering through that quite well in the aggregate.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from ISI Group.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","First one is, did you guys submit any -- maybe it's for Al, I guess. I mean, did you guys submit any FUMADERM data in your BG-12 regulatory package, either in the EU or in Europe? And then on dexpramipexole, hey, Al, we all understand statistical significance if you hit your p value or not. But assuming you hit your p value, what do you think the data need to show so that the ALS community will really view the drug as a really important breakthrough and that would then allow you to get, perhaps, MS-type pricing?","Douglas Edward Williams","Yes. Mark, this is Doug. So with respect to the first question, I'll take that, and then I'll pass it off to Al to address the question about ALS. With respect to FUMADERM, these are 2 different drugs, as we've been maintaining all along. FUMADERM is a mix of fumaric acid esters and BG-12 is dimethyl fumarate in a different formulation. So obviously, the regulators are aware of the data around FUMADERM, particularly in Germany which is where that drug is approved for psoriasis. But 2 different drugs in different populations of patients with different comorbidities, so no, it's not necessarily relevant, we believe, to the BG-12 situation.","Alfred Sandrock","Mark, on the dex question, the primary endpoint basically has 2 components: the functional rating scale and survival. And you'd kind of have to break it down to the -- into the both -- into the 2 components in order to know whether or not it's clinically meaningful. So on the ALSFRS, the community, the ALS physicians have decided that a change of greater than 20%, so a greater-than-20% change in the slope of decline is considered clinically meaningful. And then on the survival, Riluzole is sort of a benchmark for survival. As you know, in the States, Riluzole is not very commonly used, although in Europe and in Japan, it's quite commonly used. And Riluzole had about a 3-month extension of survival on average, and so I think that that's certainly a benchmark that people will use.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rachel McMinn from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, I just wanted to follow up on a comment, Paul, I think you made about dex, that you're building up manufacturing there. Is there anything that you're seeing in the blinded data that would cause you to do that to give you more confidence? Or is it really just a hedging strategy? And then I was curious, separately if you could talk about the XenoPort product, Al or Doug, if you had a view of that being competitive with BG-12 based on the early Phase I data.","Paul J. Clancy","Yes, Rachel, I'll start with the first part of the question. So it has nothing to do with the data. I don't have any -- that information at all. And it's -- I'm glad you asked because we'd hate to have it be read that way at all. The basic thinking is that, if this trial is a positive trial in this disease and in this patient population, it's such a high unmet need, that we need to be prepared for that. I mean and we're going -- we would need to be prepared for a potential relatively quick review and the potential to supply patients even before that in some form or fashion. So that's -- and into -- the lead time, otherwise, even for a product like dex, is well beyond. We'd need to start it now. So that, we've taken on as what we call at-risk spending. It hits the P&L. We can't capitalize inventory until we get to a Phase III readout. So that literally is just our thinking around in case this is a positive readout. From a commercial perspective, we've paused with respect to a lot of dex -- we're doing a little bit of work there but we haven't done it to -- certainly to the magnitude that we're doing in BG-12. And -- but we think that, if it's positive, we will quickly be able to turn on the dime there.","Douglas Edward Williams","And Rachel, this is Doug. With respect to XenoPort, obviously we're aware of the data. We've been tracking what XenoPort has been doing with that compound, and we feel very confident in BG-12. We've got very large data set that we've accumulated in the Phase III program and now supplemented that with the ENDORSE results that we presented at ECTRIMS, which further extends the safety experience with that drug. So that, plus the fact that we have our own life cycle management activities going on that we feel good about, I think we feel like we're in a great position.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber from Citi.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So I have 2 questions. One, just -- I don't know if you can answer, but maybe if you can just give us a little bit of a sense. Gilenya's price came out much higher than was expected; Aubagio's pricing is pretty good. How are you guys thinking about BG-12 versus these 2 drugs? And then I had a follow-on for Paul also.","Tony Kingsley","Yaron, it's Tony. So we are thinking hard about it.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Can you let us know how hard and in which direction?","Tony Kingsley","We'll think about it right up until the day we price. Look, I think we've said in the past it's unwise to comment on any kind of detail on pricing strategy. We're looking very closely at what's happening to the category and we're going to just try to strike the right balance.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I mean, when we calculate the data and from different sources, we're getting to around a 30% gross to net. Does that make sense to you in MS? And how fast do you need to discount until you're going to see sort of a gross-to-net for BG-12 once it launches?","Paul J. Clancy","Yaron, this is Paul. It actually -- it's a function of a bunch of different things, including the channel dynamics and as well as the government mix in that product. I mean, MS isn't going to be that different product to product to product. But the government part of the business, as you know, in the United States is limited to the kind of a -- essentially a CPI index. So and I guess the other big factor is the percentage of the business or the products business that is helping to support unemployed people in patient-set need. So I mean, I'd just pause to say it's -- that is -- that probably isn't too far off the mark, but it can change product to product.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","My question actually is on the BG-12 European submission. Can you remind us where you are there and that have you gotten 120-, 180-day questions? And in relation to that, the delay that you got in the U.S., was that actually a submission of data or any sort of submission of safety that triggered it? Or is it just simply a response to questions? I wasn't really clear on that.","George A. Scangos","Well, in Europe, we submitted soon after we submitted in the United States earlier this year, in late February-March time frame, and we're on track. We're not going to comment on -- we're having the normal regulatory interactions. We're basically on track.","Douglas Edward Williams","And as far as the second question. This is Doug. As George described earlier in the call, this was just sort of normal course of business in terms of responding to questions from FDA. And so they determined, based on the back and forth, that essentially they needed more time to review the file.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marshall Urist from Morgan Stanley.","Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So just maybe you could comment on the BG-12 IP strategy, when we might learn a little bit more about the strategy around some of the longer patents that you guys have referenced either from an application or issuance perspective and kind of where we are with that. And then just second, on Hemophelia, given that we've seen B-Long, maybe it'd be helpful if you guys could characterize what your thinking would be good data from A-LONG particularly in terms of dosing frequency.","Paul J. Clancy","Thanks, Marshall. This is Paul. I'll try to address the IP situation. Nothing terribly new to report with respect to where we think we are -- stand in the EU, as well as in the United States with the 999 patents and the 5 years of data exclusivity even underneath that. I think what you're mostly referring to is our -- what we've done is file for a formulation patent that has the potential to extend it out much later than that. That has been filed over the last year and we don't have visibility and probably won't for a little bit of time in terms of the ruling on that.","Douglas Edward Williams","And Marshall, this is Doug. Just speaking to your question about success in the Hemophilia A study. We haven't really quantified that, I think, in terms of, say, a target product profile with percentage of patients and frequency of dosing. But I'd just take you back to the Phase I\/II experience where that change in half-life translates to somewhere on the order of 50 to 80 fewer infusions for a patient with Hemophilia A. If we can replicate that in the Phase III experience, I think we'll feel very good about the product and what its potential is in the marketplace.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Sendek from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Joel D. Sendek - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I have also a question on Hemophelia. So you said, for the next study for the Factor VIII study in the near future. Can we interpret that to be this year for the data? And if that's the case, would you be on track -- if it's positive, would you be on track to file in the first quarter? And can you give us any more details around what -- beyond your prepared comments on how you're preparing for the launch.","Douglas Edward Williams","Well, I'll take the first 2, and it's fairly easy. The answer is yes and yes. And I'll sort of defer the question on the commercial preparation to Tony.","Tony Kingsley","Yes. Thanks, Joel. So we have focused, not surprisingly, on the long lead time thing. So where we've added commercial focus is on thinking about product positioning and how to build awareness over time, thinking about health economics data, et cetera. We're obviously still a long way from adding true customer-facing resources, but distribution strategy, patient services strategy, that's all the stuff we're thinking, with kind of a core central theme. And then as we get closer to launch, when we get there, we'll obviously build out the customer-facing stuff.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams from Wells Fargo Securities.","Brian Corey Abrahams - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","With the BG-12 time line pushed out, I'm just wondering if you might be able to get the aspirin and\/or titration studies on the initial label now. And also wondering, might you actually be able to derive some synergies from a closer alignment of the U.S. and European commercial launches? And then just separately, on TYSABRI, is there any defined process we can look towards for that dispute resolution in Italy, any timetable? I know you said, unlikely this year. But how should we be thinking about that going forward?","Paul J. Clancy","Okay, our pencils are scribbling away at your 1, 2 and 3 questions there, Brian...","Douglas Edward Williams","I'll take the number one, Paul, which is the aspirin study. No, we don't anticipate that we will be able to add that into the initial filing. There's no mechanism where we can do that.","Paul J. Clancy","And then I think the other thought you had, Brian, were synergies that, now that you appropriately kind of have the math right that there is closer alignment between the U.S. FDA approval and the EU approval. I think the way to think about that, though, is that they're modest. Outside, in Europe in particular, as you know, there's approval and then it's country-by-country rollout. So certainly, Germany likely is going to be one of the first and the normal, as you would think. And the last question, Brian, I think you had was around IEFA timing. We, as our partner, we're frustrated and disappointed that we weren't able to get it done this year. It's still not over, right? It's just that's the guidance that we have built into the financials and want to have that for expectations. I think that's appropriate. As we move into 2013, it certainly -- we -- certainly, that is a big objective of ours.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Wei from Jefferies.","Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","On SG&A, with the third quarter SG&A number coming in a little bit lighter than the whole Street had expected, that makes the 4Q SG&A larger than what we had modeled. And at the midpoint of the guidance that you've given on SG&A, it looks like that -- basically, that number times 4 would get you to the SG&A consensus for 2013. And so I just wanted to understand a little bit better: Should we assume that, as you actually go into 2013 and there are actual product launches underway, there should be a very healthy increase in those costs beyond what the run rate is in the fourth quarter?","Paul J. Clancy","Yes, Thomas, thank you. This is Paul. Let me give a little bit more color to help on that. A lot of the step-up, 3 to 4, some of it is labor, personnel, customer-facing costs, but a lot of it is fees and services. So we have the ability to kind of -- and we purposely wanted to throttle that a bit more, going into the fourth quarter, closer to launch. So that's a bit purposeful. So I think that's -- it's just kind of a helpful framing. It's -- and then, as it relates to 2013, I mean, quite frankly, we really need the next few months under our belt, next 3 or 4 months under our belts, which will give us a greater clarity on the next set of pivotal trial readouts. I think I've described that 2013 could be a year of launching 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 products. And that if it's the right-hand side of that equation, it obviously puts upward pressure on SG&A for all the great -- all great reasons. And if not, it puts a little bit less of upward pressure on SG&A. So I think it's going -- as we spin into 2013, it very much is a function of the pivotal trial readouts that are upon us over the next -- this cohort of pivotal trial readouts. And we'll get -- we should get greater visibility, obviously, as we've noted, soon with respect to Factor VIII by the end of the year or early 2013, for dex. And I think -- so then, we'll be able to talk a lot more about SG&A.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tony Butler from Barclays Capital.","Charles Anthony Butler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to ask one question for Doug and then a couple of housekeeping, if I may. Doug, on 037, given the data that came out with Sola at ANA, and I recognize that this is a Phase I dose-ranging study with MRI endpoints, but has your thinking changed there with respect to the clinical development of 037? And then secondly, Tony, with respect to AVONEX OUS, sequentially, I recognize a tender occurred in Q2 in Brazil, but does that actually get recorded all at one time? I'm trying to understand the sequential decline x some inventory. And then finally, Paul, on Southern Europe, I recognize Italy, but did Spain pay you this quarter? Are they still on credit?","Douglas Edward Williams","Tony, it's Doug. No, it hasn't really changed our thinking about the development of our own antibody. I think we're pretty bullish on the fact that the antibody we have is distinctly different in terms of its mechanism. I think the ability to remove plaque -- beta-amyloid plaque is going to be perhaps more like the Roche antibody that's been reported out, just based on our mechanism versus the mechanism for the other antibodies. So we believe that the ability to rapidly remove beta-amyloid is going to be a benefit that our drug will demonstrate in this Phase Ib study. I think that's important in terms of demonstrating efficacy. I think you also have to take into account the population of patients that was looked at in some of the early studies. We, like everyone, are moving to an earlier population of patients, which I think is a prudent and intelligent way of approaching treatment in this patient population. So we're going about the study, and I think in a very rational and systematic way using imaging as a way of defining optimal dose for our drug to go forward into what I'd characterize as sort of proper efficacy studies where we'll be looking more carefully at endpoints like cognition. So I think we're learning from the previous studies that have been reported and trying to apply that learning to our own molecule. But we're still excited about the antibody and the prospects.","Tony Kingsley","Tony, it's Tony Kingsley. On the Brazil situation, specifically. So specialty products in Brazil are purchased centrally by the government. AVONEX falls under what's effectively an administrative tender, which is essentially kind of a once-a-year price negotiation. In fact, they end up ordering quarterly, so shipments that are actually made are done on a quarterly basis based on the government's estimate of what they will need to fill the demand in hospitals. There is sometimes some quarter-to-quarter timing just when the shipment comes based on what the government does, but it's not like an all-or-nothing tender that you see in some different places. It's largely administrative.","Paul J. Clancy","Yes, so and then just to build on -- I think what you're trying to get at is kind of the sequential AVONEX unit trend. Q2 was an extremely strong AVONEX unit, if you recall, one, for what you had noted. The second was that we actually benefited in Q2 from a refill from the product supply issue that we had in Q1. So we're -- the net of that is, hey, we're very pleased with our AVONEX unit trend as we swing through a year-to-date basis outside the United States. The other part of your question, I believe, was with respect to accounts receivable in Southern Europe. The second quarter was a very strong payment from Spain as many pharmaceutical companies -- so we benefited from that as well. The third quarter, I think, Spain has kind of gone back to what was more traditional over the last year or 2. We remain at those -- the 3 countries in Southern Europe: Italy, Spain and Portugal, as our areas of key focus from an accounts receivable perspective. We have, in aggregate, a little bit over $200 million of accounts receivable in those 3 countries. And I think, as people know, in Greece we're actually on a cash basis, with a distributor relationship there. So it's -- for us, it's centered in on those 3.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Marko Kozul from Leerink Swann.","Marko K. Kozul - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","I think there was a previous question on dexpramipexole and pricing. Just wanted to come back to that and ask what your thinking is, if you did show a 20% or 30% decline in the slope of the ALSFRS. And then my question was actually regarding daclizumab, if you could give us an update on the Phase III study and how you think the drug could be positioned, if approved, in future years?","Tony Kingsley","So it's Tony. Let me comment on the pricing for dexpramipexole. Look, obviously, we look at all sorts of analogies, but there are huge swings based on what the data says. It'd be very difficult to try to center it on what makes sense. Well, we're obviously looking closely at it, looking at the obvious analogies, but I still think there's a lot of question on the table of what the data will say.","Alfred Sandrock","On daclizumab, the Phase III trial is fully enrolled. It's a 2-year trial so we expect the readout in 2014. The -- in terms of positioning, I mean, we'll have to see what the data shows, but in the first registrational study we saw a very strong effect on disability progression, which was unexpected and it was actually significant and also a good affect also on relapse rate and on MRI endpoints. So and also, you combine that with month-to-month subcutaneous dosing. So we'll see what the Phase III data shows in 2014.","George A. Scangos","Okay. I think our hour is up. Thanks to all of you for spending an hour. And we're -- I'll just sum up and say, look, we're very excited about where we are. I think we've got a great few months coming up ahead of us, a lot of data readouts. And base business continues to do well, so we're -- I think we're in a good place. So thanks to all of you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

My name is Sharlene, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Idec Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Ms. Claudine Prowse, President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference, ma'am.","Claudine Prowse","Thank you, and welcome to Biogen Idec's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogenidec.com to find the press release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures that we'll discuss today.","Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results, which we believe better represents the ongoing economics of our business and reflects how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call.","I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from our expectations. I encourage everyone to consult our SEC filings for additional detail.","On today's call, I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. George Scangos; Tony Kingsley, EVP of Global Commercial Operations; Dr. Doug Williams, EVP of Research and Development; and our CFO, Paul Clancy. We'll also be joined for the Q&A portion of the call by our SVP and Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Al Sandrock.","I'll now turn the call over to George.","George A. Scangos","Okay, thanks, Claudine, and good morning, everyone. The quarter marks another period of strong financial performance and continued pipeline progress for Biogen Idec. Tony, Doug and Paul will cover our achievements in more detail in a couple of minutes, and I just want to make a few introductory comments.","So revenues for the quarter were $1.8 billion, up 32%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.35, up 23%. Based on these results, we're raising our financial guidance for the year.","In the U.S., the TECFIDERA launch continues to go exceedingly well. According to IMS, TECFIDERA is now the leading oral therapy after only 6 months on the market. Importantly, we've achieved this significant milestone by increasing our share in the overall market without disproportionally diluting the rest of our MS franchise. We're excited by the initial success of TECFIDERA and its trajectory, but our launch efforts continue, and we need to remain diligent to fully capitalize on this early success.","As for the situation in the EU, I'm sure that by now, you're aware of the release from the EMA on Friday that announced that DMT was evaluating TECFIDERA and expects to make a decision on regulatory data protection at its November meeting. We continue to believe that we're entitled to regulatory data protection, and we're working diligently to achieve that outcome. We'll have no other update on the EU situation on this call.","As expected, TECFIDERA has taken share from the injectable segment of the market. Within that segment, however, AVONEX continues to hold up well. In the coming year, we look forward to the potential launch of PLEGRIDY, our PEGylated interferon product candidate, which has the potential to provide patients with another efficacious treatment option with less frequent dosing. If approved, we believe patients and physicians will view PLEGRIDY as the preferred front-line treatment option in the injectable segment.","We continue to have confidence in TYSABRI's powerful efficacy and the utility of risk stratification to effectively manage patients. We have some work ahead of us near term to ensure that patients with active disease benefit from TYSABRI. Our fundamental [indiscernible] remains unchanged [indiscernible] the efficacy exposure in treatment [indiscernible] TYSABRI offers them the best solution. As you know, next year marks not only the potential introduction of PLEGRIDY, but also of our long-lasting clotting factors ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE. Today, I want to give you all an update on the regulatory process for our long-lasting factor VIII product candidate, ELOCTATE.","Based on discussions with the FDA last week, there's a possibility of a delay in the approval of ELOCTATE. The matter under discussion does not pertain to the safety or efficacy of the product or any of the clinical trial data. It pertains to the validation of certain steps in the manufacturing process, and we are in an active dialogue with the FDA. It's a bit premature to discuss this development since it is so recent and evolving. And unfortunately, we cannot be more precise about the matter or timing at this time. However, we know that approval of ELOCTATE is important for the hemophilia community and our investors, and we wanted to be upfront on the call. When we have more complete information, we'll update you at that time.","I do want to remind everyone that in addition to the 3 products now under regulatory review, we have a number of promising drug candidates in mid-stage clinical testing, and we expect to have meaningful readouts on up to 6 of our compounds by the end of 2014. It's unlikely that all 6 will be positive, but we're hopeful that some of these will represent the next wave of Phase III product candidates.","In summary, we had an excellent quarter commercially and financially and are raising our guidance for the year. Our pipeline is making good progress. We'll know more about European regulatory data protection next month, and we'll update you on the ELOCTATE situation at an appropriate time.","I'll now turn the call over to Tony.","Tony Kingsley","Thanks, George. The commercial team is executing on all fronts as we continue to grow our MS franchise patient market share while preparing for the potential launches of 3 new products in 2014. I'm very pleased with the broad adoption and strong uptake of TECFIDERA and view it as a positive sign of initial physician acceptance. According to our data, through the end of the quarter, over 5,000 U.S. doctors have prescribed TECFIDERA. Our sales force continues to focus on educating physicians to deepen usage among current prescribers and further expand the prescribing base.","While there are still doctors who haven't prescribed, we believe these are generally community physicians who treat fewer MS patients. We believe that our strong TECFIDERA launch puts us in a very good position but understand that TECFIDERA's long-term success will require a robust and sustained commercial effort.","Consistent with last quarter, our data indicates that approximately 1\/4 of TECFIDERA patients who were not on prior therapy while approximately 3\/4 switched from a disease-modifying therapy. We believe switches from each therapy continue to be roughly in line with market share. In the upcoming quarters, we expect TECFIDERA new prescription volume will remain healthy but continue to moderate to more closely reflect the underlying patient dynamics of the MS market.","We believe that TECFIDERA is generally viewed by physicians as having strong efficacy, a solid safety profile and good tolerability. Some patients do experience GI tolerability concerns with a subset of patients experiencing GI issues for an extended period. From our conversations, we believe physicians largely view these side effects as manageable.","We continue to improve patient access to TECFIDERA. As of the end of the quarter, over half of U.S. patients had access to TECFIDERA without requiring a step edit. To further expand access, discussions with additional payers are ongoing. And as additional contracts are implemented, discounts are likely to increase.","Outside of the U.S., TECFIDERA was approved in Australia in July, and we expect to have reimbursement approved by early 2014. In Canada, TECFIDERA's launch is off to a good start through private insurance, and we also expect the public reimbursement decision by early 2014.","Turning to AVONEX. Within the injectable segment, AVONEX has gained market share year to date, which we believe is primarily driven by the convenience of the AVONEX PEN auto injector. We believe convenience continues to be a key differentiator for the injectable segment and that we are well positioned with the AVONEX PEN and potentially PLEGRIDY, should it be approved.","Moving on to TYSABRI. We believe physician perceptions of TYSABRI's efficacy remain strong. In the U.S., new TYSABRI prescriptions continued at a good pace despite the additional treatment option of TECFIDERA. There were fewer discontinuations in Q3 compared to Q2, and about 70% of U.S. patients discontinuing TYSABRI started on TECFIDERA and remained in our franchise of MS products. Accordingly, the number of TYSABRI patients leaving our MS franchise has declined significantly in the U.S. compared to prior to TECFIDERA's launch.","In Europe, TYSABRI growth continued to be impacted by oral competition. Strong commercial focus on TYSABRI's high efficacy and differentiated product profile, coupled with risk stratification, remain very important to the success of this product.","So in summary, I'm very pleased with the performance of our MS franchise during the quarter. TECFIDERA's rapid launch trajectory has continued, and AVONEX and TYSABRI have held up well as expected. The commercial organization has demonstrated strong execution in launch mode, which I believe bodes well for the potential upcoming launches in MS and hemophilia.","I'll now turn the call over to Doug.","Douglas Edward Williams","Thanks, Tony. We're very pleased by the progress in R&D. I'll start by highlighting new data for TECFIDERA and TYSABRI and then review a number of our other product candidates, many of which are expected to have important readouts in 2014 and 2015.","We continue to invest in TECFIDERA to better understand the characteristics of this important therapy. At the recent ECTRIMS meeting, we presented interim analysis from the ENDORSE extension study that support the favorable safety profile of TECFIDERA in patients with relapsing-remitting MS and showing no new or worsening safety signals in patients who had received TECFIDERA for up to 6.5 years. Longer-term analysis from ENDORSE also demonstrates that TECFIDERA maintained its effect in reducing disease activity.","New data were presented at ECTRIMS for TYSABRI that reaffirms the powerful efficacy of this product, which we believe continues to be its key differentiating feature. Based on analysis from the TYSABRI Observational Protocol, or TOP study, MS patients treated for up to 6 years with TYSABRI maintain very low relapse rates and stable EDSS disability scores.","We also presented baseline patient characteristics from the ASCEND study for TYSABRI and SPMS, a study which, if positive, we believe has the potential to support expanded TYSABRI use into this vastly underserved population. This study is being performed under an FDA Special Protocol Assessment, utilizing a novel composite endpoint to evaluate the ability of TYSABRI to slow disease progression independent of MS relapse. Accrual for this study is complete, and results are expected in 2015.","Now I'll turn to our late-stage pipeline product candidates. Based on 1-year clinical and MRI data from the 2-year Phase III ADVANCE study, PLEGRIDY appears to have an efficacy and safety profile similar to other currently available interferon therapies combined with reduced frequency subcutaneous administration, and if approved, a patient administered auto injector. We continue to expect FDA and EMA decisions for PLEGRIDY in mid-2014.","Also in mid-2014, we look forward to seeing Phase III data for daclizumab in relapsing-remitting MS. Data from the daclizumab Phase IIb registrational study point at strong efficacy in annualized relapse rate and MRI measures of disease activity and EDSS measures of disability progression. Our hope is that these data will be affirmed in the ongoing Phase III DECIDE study and support registration of daclizumab as a high efficacy once-monthly subcutaneous therapy.","Now moving to our hemophilia franchise. At the recent National Hemophilia Foundation meeting, we shared data from registrational studies of our long-lasting recombinant hemophilia product candidates, ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE. These data reinforce the value proposition that we believe these long-lasting therapies, if approved, may bring to patients, including reduced dosing frequency and innovative individualized dosing flexibility.","The pediatric Kids B-LONG trial for ALPROLIX and the Kids A-LONG trial for ELOCTATE remain on track to read out in 2014. These studies are essential for filing in Europe and are also important for the U.S. label.","Another key event that occurred during the quarter was positive Phase III results in chronic lymphocytic leukemia for GA101, a humanized anti-CD20 antibody designed to improve upon RITUXAN's efficacy. Combined with chemotherapy, GA101 was significantly superior to RITUXAN and CLL. While we usually don't discuss GA101 because our partner, Roche, is operationalizing the program, moving this molecule forward is an important part of a longer-term strategy to extend our anti-CD20 franchise. Roche will present additional data at ASH and expects an FDA approval decision for CLL by the end of 2013.","Turning to the earlier-stage product candidates. Our R&D strategy has been to improve the mid-stage pipeline in both quality and number. We've invested in programs that we believe have both strong technical rationale and the potential to provide meaningful clinical improvement in patients with serious unmet medical needs. Our objective has been to design robust proof-of-concept studies to enable well-informed decisions about future larger-scale development efforts.","During the last several years, we've been executing on this plan, and our mid-stage pipeline is now at a point where a number of our clinical studies are nearing maturity. As a result, we expect 2014 to be a data-rich period for Biogen Idec as we anticipate up to 6 proof-of-concept readouts for anti-Lingo in optic neuritis, STX-100 in IPF, neublastin in neuropathic pain and BIIB037 in Alzheimer's disease, as well as for our partnered programs, ISIS-SMNRx in SMA and anti-CD40 ligand in lupus. With each of these clinical study results, we expect to gain a deeper understanding of the potential of each of these candidates and hopefully take a step closer to bringing new therapies to patients in need.","We also took steps during the quarter to add capabilities to our discovery research platform in neurology by entering into research collaborations with ISIS Pharmaceuticals and Amicus Therapeutics. As part of our research collaboration with ISIS, we gained exclusive rights to use ISIS's antisense technology to develop therapies for a broad range of neurological targets. Targets discovered in this collaboration can be developed by Biogen Idec as biologic, small molecule or antisense drugs. The agreement also provides Biogen Idec with the option to license ongoing antisense development programs against neurologic targets.","Our collaboration with Amicus will leverage their research platform and expertise and focus on discovering and developing small molecule drugs for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. We believe Amicus has unique approaches to developing drugs to reduce alpha-synuclein accumulation, a hallmark of Parkinson's disease pathology.","In summary, significant progress is being made in the late-stage pipeline. And just as important, the Phase I and Phase II portion of our pipeline is maturing nicely as well. Overall, we believe that 2014 will be a data-rich year for our pipeline followed by a steady stream of important readouts for all of the late-stage programs: Daclizumab in relapsing-remitting MS in mid-2014, TYSABRI and SPMS in 2015, in addition to Pivotal GA101 readouts in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.","I look forward to providing you updates on our progress in the coming quarters. I'll now pass the call to Paul.","Paul J. Clancy","Thanks, Doug. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.05 in the third quarter, while our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.35. The differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial results are outlined in the earnings presentation.","Total revenue for the third quarter grew 32% to $1.8 billion. AVONEX worldwide sales were $733 million in the third quarter compared to $736 million in prior year. In the U.S., AVONEX revenue declined 1% to $457 million. Internationally, AVONEX revenue increased 1% to $277 million. Foreign exchange and hedging weakened AVONEX revenue by approximately $5 million in the quarter compared to a gain of $9 million in Q3 of 2012.","TYSABRI worldwide revenues, net of hedging, were $401 million in the third quarter, comprised of $232 million in the U.S. and $169 million internationally. Third quarter TYSABRI revenues were unfavorably impacted by $13 million of deferred revenue in our Italian affiliate. The impact of foreign exchange and hedging for the third quarter softened revenue by approximately $2 million for TYSABRI compared to a gain of $3 million in the prior year.","Global third quarter TECFIDERA revenue was strong at $286 million. U.S. TECFIDERA revenue include incremental inventory build of approximately $12 million this quarter. Absent this inventory build, revenue generated from underlying patient demand in the U.S. was approximately $272 million. As of the end of Q3, we estimate U.S. inventory in the channel for TECFIDERA was in the 4- to 5-week range or approximately $92 million. Third quarter international TECFIDERA revenue, entirely from Canada, was $2 million.","U.S. RITUXAN sales were $947 million. Our U.S. profit share was $282 million. Royalties and profit share and sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. were $21 million. The result was $303 million of revenue from unconsolidated joint business.","Now turning to the expense lines in the non-GAAP P&L. Third quarter non-GAAP cost of goods sold were $235 million or 13% of revenue, which includes TYSABRI contingent payment and third-party royalties. Third quarter non-GAAP R&D expense was $409 million or 22% of revenues, an increase of 38% over last year, primarily driven by our recently announced research collaboration with ISIS. Specifically, we made an upfront payment of $100 million, of which approximately $75 million was expensed in the quarter. The remaining portion will be capitalized and expensed over the life of the collaboration.","Third quarter non-GAAP SG&A expense was $404 million or 22% of revenues, an increase of 36% over last year, driven primarily by increased investment associated with the TECFIDERA launch. Our third quarter non-GAAP tax rate was 27%, driven by a larger percentage of our revenues coming from within the United States due to the strong TECFIDERA launch.","During the quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million shares for a total of approximately $360 million. Our weighted average diluted shares were 238 million, and we ended the quarter slightly north of $1 billion in cash and marketable securities. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $2.35 for the third quarter.","Now we'll turn to the full year 2013 guidance. We're raising our guidance as the result of the strength seen with the TECFIDERA launch. We now expect total revenue growth of approximately 23% to 25%. For TYSABRI, we hope to record a revenue benefit of approximately $95 million by the end of the year related to the pending settlement with the Italian National Medicines Agency, but this may not happen. The timing of the final approval remains a bit uncertain and could move to early 2014, which would put our 2013 revenue growth at the lower end of the guidance. Additionally, we'll continue to defer a portion of our Italian revenue until this settlement is finalized.","Moving to the expense lines of the P&L. We anticipate cost of goods sold to be between 12% and 14% of sales. R&D expense remains unchanged, and we expect to be between 21% and 23% of sales. This includes approximately $60 million earmarked for milestone payments and potential business development opportunities in the fourth quarter. SG&A expense remains unchanged and is expected [ph] to be approximately 24% to 26% of total revenues as we continue to fund TECFIDERA's launch and make prelaunch investments in hemophilia.","Our effective 2013 tax rate expect to be between 24% and 25% of pre-tax income, a modest increase over our prior guidance, driven by a larger percentage of our pre-tax income being generated in the U.S. As a result, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share results between $8.65 and $8.85 and GAAP EPS to be between $7.50 and $7.70. The range reflects the uncertainty around the timing of the finalization of the IEFA settlement.","I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments.","George A. Scangos","Okay. Thank you, Paul. And look, Biogen Idec is doing well, and we believe the prospects for next year look even brighter. Our quarterly performance was strong, and we've raised guidance for the year. We believe we're the global leader in MS today with a growing market share and with potential leaders in the 3 market segments: AVONEX and potentially PLEGRIDY in the injectable segment, TYSABRI in the high efficacy segment and now TECFIDERA in the oral segment.","We recognize that patients and physicians are seeking treatment options that provide flexibility, and we believe that we have the portfolio to appropriately address the diverse needs of this population. TECFIDERA continues on a strong trajectory, and we believe that its broad adoption in the U.S. is a testament to its value to the MS patient community.","Our launch efforts continue as we look forward to building on this quarter's achievements to serve even more patients. We have 2 large regulatory issues underway: TECFIDERA regulatory data protection in Europe and the process validation of ELOCTATE in the U.S. We understand the importance of these issues and are working diligently to resolve them. As you know, we're moving closer to a resolution of European regulatory data protection. The ELOCTATE process questions have just recently arisen, and we'll update you as soon as it's appropriate to do so. These types of issues are part of our business, and we're working through them.","Over the years, our commitment to reinvigorating the science has been the driving force behind our pipeline programs. We're encouraged by the quality of our pipeline but recognize that continued efforts to identify early-stage candidates are necessary to ensure our continued momentum. We're determined to be at the forefront of science and medicine, which we believe is critical to enable us to sustain and grow value in years to come.","As we look at the number of development milestones that we have achieved this year and those that we expect next year, it's evident that momentum is growing throughout the company. We're very proud of our accomplishments but know that continued success requires sustained execution on the part of our organization. We believe we're on a trajectory for continued growth with the potential for 3 additional products in 2014. This type of growth requires a broad coordinated effort, especially for an organization of our size. Our team is diligently working to ensure that we have the resources required to make each launch a success while maintaining our momentum in the other areas of our business.","In closing, I'd like to take this opportunity to once again thank our dedicated employees for their contributions to bringing meaningful new therapies to patients in need and to physicians and patients who are always central to what we do. Thanks to all of you for joining us this morning, and we'll now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from ISI Group.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","My question -- I wanted to drill down on the factor VIII issue that you disclosed there. I don't know if there's -- I mean, basically, it's an open-ended question. Is there anything else you can tell us? And then specifically, is the commercial product exactly the same as the Phase III product? Is it the same cell line, the same process? Or were there any changes made between the Phase III production and the commercial production? And if I just may, this is a housekeeping, is it possible to give us maybe, Paul, I'm not sure this is appropriate, for TECFIDERA U.S. patient share according to your data?","George A. Scangos","Okay, good job of getting 2 questions in there in one. Look, on the first issue, there weren't any changes between the Phase III and the commercial product. But other than that, we really can't go into any more details. This is all new. It's premature, and we're working through it. On the market share, I'll let Paul take that.","Paul J. Clancy","Yes, Mark. I think what we said during the call was that we feel that during the quarter, we were the leading oral. So we surpassed market share of the other oral during the quarter, and that puts us probably into double-digit range, into kind of the just over the bar on the 10% from a share perspective towards the end of the quarter in the United States. So very good launch, obviously. We're very pleased with that trajectory coming out of the gates.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt from Cowen and Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I won't ask for an update on the EU, but maybe I could just ask for a post date. Could you clarify, George, whether previously the CHMP has reviewed NAS status for TECFIDERA and actually turned down the molecule or could you just say that you've not been informed one way or another?","George A. Scangos","I think, Eric, at this point, we're not going to say any more at all. These processes are complicated, and they go back and forth. And so better to just leave it as it is, I think. And we are getting closer to a decision, and I'll leave it at that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from AllianceBernstein.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Quick question on MS. So could you tell us what's been the overall expansion in the size of the MS market if you look at the treated patient numbers, say, for the most recent quarter compared to a year ago? And then just on a related note, could you comment on the trajectory of the new patient starts through the quarter? Because we're seeing TRX numbers that are blends, obviously, and it would be helpful if you could tell us the actual main patient trajectory.","Tony Kingsley","Yes, thanks, Geoff. It's Tony. So I think we -- as we talked on the prior calls, we've seen the switch market in the U.S. moving at a rate that's much higher than it has been historically. Again, the numbers we've quoted, we -- when the market is at sort of steady state, when you take switchers, returning quitters, people going out, new starts tends to run at about 1,000 to 1,200 kind of available patients per week. And as we pointed out, even TECFIDERA alone has been running as a multiple of that. We do expect to see that come down over time. We have, as always, at best, probably anecdotal evidence about returning quitters. It's hard to identify that population. We do think some of the TECFIDERA volume is people who have come back into the market, but we've always been cautious about overstating that. We think it's more just the underlying switch dynamic that has increased pretty significantly.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra from Credit Suisse.","Ravi Mehrotra - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","My 2-part question, which is completely unrelated to each other. TECFIDERA, could you just give us some input into the real world what the doctor is doing with regard to the lymphocyte monitoring and CBCs? I mean, are they doing that monitoring more than -- well, more than the label annually, they would have to be, right? And secondly, Paul, the share buyback that you put in this quarter, $360 million, 1.7, can we extrapolate anything from that?","Douglas Edward Williams","Ravi, it's Doug. With respect to lymphocyte monitoring, I think that there's probably a little bit going on out there that we hear with docs monitoring lymphocytes maybe a little more frequently than what the label suggests. I think that's not unexpected with a new product as the doctors are becoming familiar with it. But it's our position based on the data from the Phase III studies and now from the ENDORSE extension study that has data for 6.5 years that the labeling is appropriate for monitoring these patients with respect to lymphocytes and white cells.","Paul J. Clancy","And then, Ravi, this is Paul. The share buyback this quarter was intended for share stabilization impact. So that's an ongoing what we do on an annual basis to stabilize shares. Certainly as we go forward, high-class problem in terms of the cash flow generation that we have, and we'll continue to look to be very good stewards of shareholder value in the deployment of capital.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rachel McMinn from Bank of America.","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes. On the tax rate, Paul, I'm just curious if you can give us a better sense. It looks like your guidance is implying somewhere in the high 20s or maybe even 30% in the fourth quarter. How should we think about tax for 2014 with and without European TECFIDERA? And then just a second part. On persistency trends, can you talk a little bit more, Tony, about what you're seeing with discontinuations for GI and tolerability overall?","Paul J. Clancy","Yes, Rachel, this is Paul. So the tax guidance was, as you know correctly, that's tax guidance for the full year. For the fourth quarter, our tax guidance, while it's not stated there, I'll just kind of give you the number that we're thinking through at this point, is right around 26% for the fourth quarter. So just to try to clarify that. It's just the result of TECFIDERA profits in the United States being very strong and robust. As we move into the next year, I think we'll have to get past and get clarity on kind of the product mix as we go into next year, and we'll update you at probably at the end of year call.","Tony Kingsley","Yes, Rachel, it's Tony. So we're still seeing a big -- look, I talked to a lot to physicians. They're seeing a big mix in their experience with tolerability issues. There are some physicians who are seeing the subset -- usually a small subset of patients who have more extended GI issues. There are other physicians who don't see, in my conversations, much of an issue at all. We think the market is working through it. From a sort of persistence standpoint, I think we'll -- we still think it's a little early to give very specific guidance on how we think discontinuation rates are going to settle out because we're still early in the launch and we've had a lot of patients go on pretty quickly, but we're not seeing anything that's outside our expectation.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Roden from UBS.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I actually have a pipeline question here, Doug or Al, if you're on. The 14-month follow-up data on SMA showed a mean improvement on the Hammersmith, I think, 5.75 points in the high-dose group with no patients declining. Just wondering in the absence of a placebo ARM, can you just add some perspective as to how that should be interpreted? I mean, we understand that normal development growth, maybe even a learning curve, can drive the Hammersmith score higher. Just wondering if the magnitude of the change in the high-dose groups leads you to conclude anything here ahead of having any placebo-controlled data.","Alfred Sandrock","Matt, it's Al Sandrock. I agree with you that without well-controlled trial, it's always a little difficult to make any strong interpretations. It's gratifying to see the improvement, and you mentioned the average improvements. Some patients are improving more than that. Some are less. And so I think in the absence of a well-controlled trial, I think it's premature to make any strong conclusions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from JPMorgan.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I got a couple on TYSABRI. Can you guys talk about switches for TECFIDERA? I know last quarter, you gave a good amount of detail on that. And then with the competition from orals in the EU, there really isn't a lot of new data. So what's the commercial strategy for you guys to protect share going forward?","Tony Kingsley","Great, great question. It's Tony. So look, let me separate U.S. and EU. In the U.S., there's a new alternative in the market, which is TECFIDERA, which we know has caused some -- attracted lots of patients. Look, in light of that, we think that TYSABRI -- we believe TYSABRI -- actually, new prescription volume is holding up quite well. It speaks to the fact that it is a product with higher efficacy that tends to have a subset of patients that makes sense. The impact in the U.S. has largely been on the discontinuation side. Again, there's a new alternative, and for patients who are post years [ph] JCV positive, we've seen a meaningful portion move over. I think EU is a similar situation, certainly on the discons is where we're seeing more of the challenge, and it's frankly been the other orals pretty aggressively competing against that. So look, it's an execution issue for us, I think, in both cases. We know what TYSABRI's value proposition to patients and physicians is. We know what the value of risk stratification is. So it's very much focused on messaging presence in the physician office and focus on patient identification, and we think that, that will help us work through that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber from Citi.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","If you don't mind, I just kind of -- I wanted to clarify something, and then actually, I have a question. So just to clarify, George, you mentioned that with ELOCTATE, I think the words you used, and maybe I'm incorrect, but was the word you used, that there might be an extension to the review, I'm just trying to get a sense. Are you kind of thinking a 90-day extension or whether you're thinking a refiling? And then secondly, and that's the real question, can you guys maybe share with us your thoughts of how does MMF differ from DMF in the body clinically?","George A. Scangos","Okay, Yaron. Look, for the first question, we're not thinking about a refiling. We're thinking about a delay, and it's really premature to speculate on the...","Douglas Edward Williams","And this is Doug. With respect to the difference between DMF and MMF, we had an abstract at the recent ECTRIMS meeting talking about some preclinical work that we've done, looking at gene transcription changes that take place with systemic administration of those 2 different fumarates. And I think what's clear from that set of experiments is that all fumarates are not created equal with respect to their biology, and we saw different patterns of gene expression, and it's clear that MMF and DMF elicit different biological responses.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe just one more on hemophilia. I was wondering, number one, if you can tell us where the manufacturing is done, if that's in-house. And then how similar are the steps between your factor VIII and your factor IX? Just wondering if there's -- why there was only delay for one of them.","Douglas Edward Williams","The first question, do we do the manufacturing in-house? Yes, we do. And the discussions we've had that led to these questions with the agency are centered on factor VIII, and that's the update that we provided today. I just want to emphasize, we're not talking about jeopardy to approval here. We're talking about timelines.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes, hey, a question on -- a follow-up on hemophilia. We continue to talk to a lot of doctors, and I know a lot of people continue to do a lot of survey work as well. It's pretty consistent with the very bullish outlook. Maybe you could comment about how you would expect additional launch. What is your work set now versus, say, a year ago? The counterargument has always been a conservative launch with switching just to comfortable and safety. So maybe you could compare and contrast the bullish outlook versus conservative doctor outlook.","Tony Kingsley","Thanks, Michael. It's Tony. Look, I'm not surprised to hear that there's interest in the surveys that you do out in the market. Again, long-acting factors is the biggest unmet need in this market. You get that from -- we've known that for a long time. You get that from physicians. You get that from patients. So look, we think there's interest in the class of long-acting factors, and so we think there's a product that has -- a profile that has the potential to do very well. We still are sort of moderate in our expectations about pace. Again, this is a market that has very slow switch rates. It's very patient-driven. There's a lot of conservatism among patients. There's a reasonable amount of conservatism among physicians. And actually, the frequency with which patients go to the hemophilia treatment center, certainly if you compare it to something like MS, is less frequent. So excited about the product profile and the potential and not surprised to hear there's some market excitement, but we do think this is a market that has a lot of characteristics that make it move a little more slowly. And it's a patient commercial approach and education approach that we think is going to be needed.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So now that you've seen the impact to the orals and the MS market, and you see switchers from TYSABRI who are JCV positive, do you have any updated thoughts on the positioning of the daclizumab now that you're a year away from data?","Tony Kingsley","Yes, thanks, Robyn. It's Tony. We've said we have to wait and see the data. It looks like it could be something that fits into the high efficacy space with some -- potentially some attractive characteristics. So I think we'll -- certainly, it looks like a product that would have a place in the market as we've often said. There are lots of different patient segments with different needs. So we'll have to wait and see how the readout looks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joel Sendek from Stifel.","Joel D. Sendek - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","On TECFIDERA, I think I heard you say you expect discounts are likely to increase. I'm wondering if you could give us more detail potentially on that. And then as far as the inventory on TECFIDERA, you mentioned 4 to 5 weeks. I'm wondering if there's a possibility for that to go up or down? I guess I'm comparing it to the AVONEX 2 weeks. Is 4 to 5 weeks a lot relative to a trajectory that TECFIDERA's on?","Paul J. Clancy","Yes, Joel, this is Paul. Thanks for the question. Let me kind of start with TEC -- let me start with the inventory first and move it to Tony on the TEC question. 4 to 5 weeks is actually the total inventory that encapsulates both the wholesalers, as well as the SPP. So that's what we're actually looking at now. It's pretty common to kind of have 2 weeks at the wholesalers for the MS products and about 2 or 3 weeks at the retail we have in the SPP basis. So I think -- we think that, that actually will probably -- is where the steady state is, and that implies very much kind of what kind of happened in the third quarter. That somewhat implies that our reported results will probably pretty closely mirror the results in the patient demand.","Tony Kingsley","Yes, Joel, Tony. On discounts, look, I think what we've said on TECFIDERA over time, we expect the growth in that characteristics to be similar to the other MS products with the main difference from, say, AVONEX being the government discounts would be lower. So you'd have some favorability there. During the launch period, we're not contracted with -- in the early days with commercial payers, so you're not paying rebates, which is a piece of that mix. Just a signal that as we finalize a number of those contracts through the end of this year and then into early next year, we'll start to see some impact from payer discounts. But again, broad strokes, we think this will be characteristic of other products in the market. With some places, it may be more favorable.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ritu Baral from Canaccord.","Ritu Baral - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","I guess in the next 18 to 24 months, you've got some interesting potential trade-offs between different products in MS, and I was wondering how you look at AVONEX versus PLEGRIDY and the strategy there for preserving the interferon franchise. And also, you're sort of pulling our thoughts on the Orchestra data that is potentially coming in 2015 from GA101 in MS.","Tony Kingsley","Ritu, it's Tony. Let me talk about the interferon franchise. Look, we do think about interferon as a franchise for us over time. So look, job 1 is to continue to emphasize the benefits of the AVONEX PEN and gain share in that injectable segment even as it decreases. We think PLEGRIDY plays right into the area of convenience matters because it's a potential significant differentiator. So we will think about -- as PLEGRIDY comes in, it's a natural extension to that franchise over time.","George A. Scangos","And then, Ritu, I think I'm going to turn it over to Al, but I think what you're referring to is the ocrelizumab data in multiple sclerosis on the OPERA trial so...","Ritu Baral - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","I'm sorry, OPERA trial, yes.","George A. Scangos","No problem. We're getting our symphonies a little mixed up, but Al, if you have a point.","Alfred Sandrock","Yes, I think actually there is an Orchestra trial as well, but both ocrelizumab. Ocrelizumab has very exciting Phase II data, and the extension studies that have been presented at various meetings continue to show sustained effects, long-term effects with dosing at very infrequent intervals. It's probably going to join the high-efficacy segment. It depletes a class of cells, as does some of the other high-efficacy drugs. I think the distinguishing feature of daclizumab is that potentially it could have high efficacy without depleting cells. And we joined TYSABRI as the other high-efficacy drug that doesn't deplete the lymphocytes. But I think it's an exciting -- I think ocrelizumab is an exciting drug, and the Phase II data were meaningful.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gene Mack from Brean Capital.","Gene Mack - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","I just wonder if you can comment a little bit on TYSABRI. Are you guys -- can you just give us a sense of what level, if any, off-label use is happening right now in secondary progression?","George A. Scangos","Well, TYSABRI is labeled for relapsing forms of MS in the United States, and patients with secondary-progressive MS who still have relapses are eligible per label. And I suspect that there are people who have entered SPMS but were still relapsing who are on label getting TYSABRI. The issue of when somebody goes from relapsing to non-relapsing, you only know that in retrospect usually because the relapse frequency decreases kind of gradually.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams from Wells Fargo Securities.","Brian Corey Abrahams - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A question for, I guess, for Doug and Al. Among the interesting data you guys presented at ECTRIMS, there were some additional results from the LINGO program. I was wondering if you could talk us through some of your learnings from both the PK and imaging components of the Phase I study, how it framed your dose selection and design of the ongoing studies. And then how does this shape what we might be thinking about looking for in the upcoming readouts for the 2 ongoing studies?","Alfred Sandrock","Well, the main additional piece of information that we presented at ECTRIMS was the effective anti-LINGO on axonal regrowth after optic nerve crush. And we have been talking a lot about the biology of anti-LINGO in terms of remyelination, but this is sort of additional information. But I mean, in both -- in the sense it's a good drug for repairing because as you know, in MS you have axons that are transacted as well as loss of myelin. The dosing has been informed -- I mean, in the Phase I trial, we looked at CSF levels of anti-LINGO. We looked at some other biomarkers in CSF. And we know based on our animal studies, when you achieve certain CSF levels of anti-LINGO, you've achieved certain levels of anti-LINGO in the brain parenchyma. And so that's how we based our dosing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Marko Kuzol from Leerink Swann.","Marko K. Kozul - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Just a quick clarification. In the prepared remarks, I believe you said over 50% of patients have access to TECFIDERA. Does this mean that these patients are receiving commercial reimbursement? And then my question is do you have any color on reimbursement tiering for the drug and any potential impact it has on how the drug is used?","Tony Kingsley","So I think what we said is over 50% of the patients have access without a step edit. So yes, we would expect a lot of those patients would transition to commercial drug relatively quickly. That's a good -- it's a good point at this stage in the launch. Over time, we're continuing to negotiate with payers. Probably a little early to call what we think the outcome will be from a reimbursement standpoint, but we think we're on track to get broad coverage.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Wei from Jefferies.","Thomas Wei - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just a clarification and then a question. On Rachel's question about persistency, could you sort of clarify, should we interpret your answer to mean that discontinuation rates are relatively consistent with the TECFIDERA clinical trial data? And then on the 1,000 to 1,200 steady-state rate in the MS market, can you just give us a sense of what your data tells you that number was during the third quarter on a weekly basis?","Tony Kingsley","Yes. So on persistency, I don't think I specifically compared it to the clinical trial. Again, we think it's a little early to give very tight guidance on discontinuations. There are a lot a patients starting quickly and still working through. And I think we said before we'd sort of go through the end of the year to get a good handle on that. The 1,000 to 1,200 is, I think, round numbers what we have typically seen historically. You can look at the -- even the TECFIDERA, if you can extrapolate on the TECFIDERA volume on its own in the third quarter, it was probably equal to that or even north of it. So the whole market is continuing to move at a faster rate, but we've said we think that will come down and is working its way down over time.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of John Newman from JMP Securities.","John L. Newman - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","My question is just regarding how we should be thinking about TECFIDERA in Europe going forward. I mean, should we be thinking about sort of different scenarios under which TECFIDERA would be launched? Or should we be thinking that there may be scenarios that may be unattractive to you in terms of launching the product?","George A. Scangos","Okay, our goal and our intent is to launch both IP protection and regulatory data protection. We're working towards that goal. We'll learn more about that in not-too-distant future, and we'll make our decisions at that point.","Operator","There are no further questions in queue at this time.

My name is Tiffany and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Idec Q2 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you.","Claudine Prowse, Vice President, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Claudine Prowse","Thank you. And welcome to Biogen Idec\u2019s second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogenidec.com to find the press release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in tables one and two. Table three includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflects how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call.","I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult our SEC filings for additional detail.","On today\u2019s call, I am joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. George Scangos; Dr. Doug Williams, EVP of Research and Development; Tony Kingsley, EVP of Global Commercial Operations; and our CFO, Paul Clancy. We will also be joined for the Q&A portion of the call by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Al Sandrock.","Now, I will turn the call over to George.","George Scangos","Well, thanks Claudine and good morning everybody and thanks for joining us today. Biogen Idec had a great second quarter, strong financial performance and several key pipeline accomplishments. So, as we recap these achievements today, we believe that our continued progress reflects the strength of our underlying business and good execution towards our 2014 goals.","Our core multiple sclerosis franchise performed remarkably well and we continue to see an increase in number of patients using our therapies. TECFIDERA continues to gain market share and we believe it\u2019s on track to become the leading MS therapy in the U.S. The early months of our European launch reinforce our belief that TECFIDERA will continue to be a major value contributor to the company. AVONEX and TYSABRI also performed well as physicians and patients continued to look to them as the injectable and high efficacy therapies [inaudible]. With these important medicines available to patients, we believe that we have a product portfolio that makes us the global leader in the treatment of MS.","In our late-stage pipeline, we moved forward two new potential therapeutic options for relapsing MS patients this quarter. PLEGRIDY received the positive CHMP opinion in Europe and at this point, I will diverge from my prepared statements to say that just this morning as we are sitting in the room preparing for the call, we received the letter from the EU saying that PLEGRIDY have been approved. We haven\u2019t had a chance to look at the label or any details yet, which we will do. And when we are through that, we will issue a press release, but since we are sitting here, PLEGRIDY has now been approved in the EU. We also reported positive top line results from the Phase 3 trial of Daclizumab and should all these products complete registration, we will have six important medicines that offer MS patients with different needs.","Moving beyond the MS franchise, we launched ALPROLIX, the long-lasting therapy for hemophilia B and received FDA approval of ELOCTATE, our therapy for hemophilia A. These products mark our entry into a major new therapeutic area. ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE represent the first meaningful innovations in the treatment of hemophilia in many years and reflect our mission to help renewed therapies to patients who are underserved. We believe that these therapies have the potential to meaningfully reduce treatment burden and significantly improve patients\u2019 lives. These accomplishments are reflected in our strong quarterly financial performance with a 40% growth in revenues and a 52% growth in non-GAAP EPS year-over-year.","And as Paul will discuss this quarter\u2019s financial performance also benefited from the approval of an agreement with AIFA relating to TYSABRI sales in Italy. We have also made excellent progress in Japan which is an important strategic priority for us as we expand our global presence. We have recently obtained Japanese approval for TYSABRI and ALPROLIX and filed a marketing application for ELOCTATE earlier this year. The expansion of our products into Japan allows us the opportunity to introduce new treatment options to patients and physicians in new regions around the world. We believe that Japan represents an attractive long-term growth opportunity for our company. So we had an eventful and productive quarter with a lot of exciting developments.","And I will now pass the call over to Doug.","Doug Williams","Thanks George and good morning everyone. We and our collaborator AbbVie recently announced positive top line Phase 3 data for Daclizumab HYP in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Based on this study and previous clinical data we are working expeditiously to file an application for regulatory approval of Daclizumab. We believe that if approved, Daclizumab could be an additional effective therapeutic option to treat this heterogeneous disease. A number of our other clinical programs continue to advance.","In the coming 12 to 18 months we anticipate Phase 3 data from TYSABRI in SPMS as well as data from earlier stage programs including BIIB037 in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, neublastin in neuropathic pain, STX-100 in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, anti-CD40 ligand in general lupus and anti-LINGO in both acute optic neuritis and multiple sclerosis. We would like to take the opportunity to review our ongoing anti-LINGO clinical studies and clarify the timing of anticipated data readouts.","The Phase 2 program remains on track and includes two studies, one in MS and the other in acute optic neuritis. We believe the totality of data from these studies would provide us with a clearer understanding of anti-LINGO\u2019s potential in both clinical settings. The goal of the acute optic neuritis study is to demonstrate proof of mechanism in humans. We will examine whether anti-LINGO is able to protect and repair the optic nerve when given shortly after the acute damage caused by a demyelinating lesion of the optic nerve or optic neuritis.","The study will examine various end points including novel end points developed by Biogen Idec. The primary end point visual evoked potential will measure effects on optic nerve signal conduction. We will also use optical coherence tomography imaging to determine if anti-LINGO treatment impacts the viability of axons in the optic nerve and retinal ganglion cells. As an exploratory end point this study includes objective and patient reported outcome measures to examine any potential benefit on visual function. The study is fully enrolled and we expect to disclose top line results in January 2015 and full data disclosure at a 2015 medical meeting.","In the second study we are evaluating whether anti-LINGO can facilitate remyelination and functional improvement in patients with active relapsing MS. Primary end point is a clinical composite measure testing various aspects of both physical and cognitive improvement. As exploratory end points we will also examine various advanced brain imaging techniques to detect potential remyelination and axon preservation as well as numerous blood and CSF biomarkers.","The MS study is designed treat patients for approximately 18 months with the primary efficacy end points being evaluated at the end of that period. There will be a preliminary look at data after all patients have reached 12 months of treatment duration to inform future study planning. Based on current enrollment rates which are ahead of projections, we expect the interim look to occur in the second half of 2015. Investigators, patients and the study management team will remain blinded in order to preserve the integrity of the ongoing study. We expect MS study results to be presented at a scientific meeting in 2016.","We look forward to sharing additional data as our pipeline advances. I will now pass the call to Tony.","Tony Kingsley","Thanks Doug. The second quarter marked another strong performance for our commercial organization. We think we have demonstrated that we can launch multiple products while also maximizing our base business. This has been no small feed for our company and I am very pleased with how the commercial team has executed and driven results.","Let\u2019s start with MS. We continue to grow our MS market share through executing our franchise strategy. TECFIDERA in the U.S. continued on a solid trajectory. TECFIDERA has been broadly used across numerous patient segments, newly diagnosed switches prompted by efficacy and non-efficacy reasons as well as patients returning to the market. We believe TECFIDERA is generally viewed by physicians and patients as efficacious with an attractive safety profile and a manageable tolerability profile. Importantly, patient retention rates have been similar to other marketed MS therapies and in line with our expectations.","Outside the U.S., TECFIDERA is off to a strong start. In countries where we have launched, including Germany, the uptake for TECFIDERA has been encouraging, where we had been more cautious about uptake in Europe given TECFIDERA\u2019s later entry in the markets, where other orals had a stronger foothold, we now believe that we see launch trajectories that are similar to what we experienced in the U.S. We are also making good progress on reimbursement. Currently, we have obtained full reimbursement in six markets and TECFIDERA is also available in a number of other countries with limited reimbursement. In the UK, we recently received a favorable pricing decision from NICE and we expect to obtain full reimbursement in most of the other large MS markets by the end of 2015.","During the quarter, AVONEX gained share among interferon therapies. As expected, injectable therapies continued to decline as patients move toward oral therapies. While global units for AVONEX declined 7% year-over-year, AVONEX has shown staying power in a dynamic market. We look forward to the potential launch of PLEGRIDY to extend our leadership in interferon. We believe PLEGRIDY has the potential to provide MS patients a combination of strong efficacy, a safety profile consistent with the MS beta interferon class and a SubQ auto injector administered every two weeks.","Across markets, TYSABRI demand remains solid as physicians continued to choose this therapy for patients requiring high efficacy. The U.S. TYSABRI business improved as patient retention rates are stabilizing and are now similar to pre-TECFIDERA launch. TYSABRI performance in Europe was also favorable despite the increased oral competition. We continue to focus on execution and despite an increasingly crowded market we believe neurologists continue to view TYSABRI as having unique power to control disease.","Turning to hemophilia, ALPROLIX is off to a solid start since its introduction to the U.S. market in May. Our focus to-date has been in two areas raising awareness of the therapy\u2019s attributes and streamlining patient access. Our field forces build strong relationships with customers and is achieving its early goals of reach and frequency with hemophilia treatment centers or HTCs. As of the end of the quarter, approximately one-third of HTCs had prescribed ALPROLIX, which we believe indicates very good initial interest. Early indications suggest ALPROLIX has not faced significant hurdles with reimbursement. We have also established financial and patient support programs which have enabled a smooth initial launch. As expected, we believe the majority of ALPROLIX patients have started with once weekly prophylaxis, a significant improvement over the current standard of care of two or more prophylactic infusions per week.","Turning to ELOCTATE, we are pleased to have launched ELOCTATE in the U.S. last week with what we believe to be a competitive label. Our initial objectives are focused on extensive education to physicians, payers and advocacy groups. And we are also beginning to expedite access for patients starting on ELOCTATE. We are pleased with the performance of the commercial organization. Across an expanding portfolio of therapies, we believe we are demonstrating strong execution and solid results.","I will now pass the call to Paul.","Paul Clancy","Thanks, Tony. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.01 in the second quarter. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the second quarter were $3.49. I will provide additional details on the AIFA agreement, which benefited both revenue and earnings in Q2 in a minute.","Walking down the P&L let me start with revenues. Total revenue for the second quarter grew 40% year-over-year to approximately $2.4 billion. Second quarter AVONEX worldwide revenue was $774 million. In the U.S., Q2 AVONEX revenue increased 4% compared to prior year to $498 million. And outside the U.S., Q2 AVONEX revenue was $276 million, a decrease of 6% compared to prior year.","Global TECFIDERA revenue was $700 million in Q2. In the U.S., TECFIDERA revenue was $585 million. We\u2019re very pleased with the compliance in gross to net performance which provided a benefit to revenue in the quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately 3.5 weeks of inventory in the channel, which includes specialty pharmacies and wholesalers. This is a slight decline versus prior quarter. International TECFIDERA revenue was approximately $115 million as the launch in Germany has exceeded our expectations.","Germany represented approximately three quarters of our ex-U.S. revenues. TYSABRI worldwide revenue net of hedging was $533 million in the second quarter. These results were comprised of $250 million in the U.S. and $284 million internationally. TYSABRI benefited from two events which helped the year-over-year comparison. Recall during the first quarter of 2013, we increased inventory levels in anticipation of the asset transfer from Elan to Biogen Idec. This equated to in-market revenues of approximately $26 million, increasing Q1 of 2013 and decreasing Q2 of 2013.","In the second quarter of this year, TYSABRI revenues outside the U.S. included the impact of an agreement with AIFA. Our agreement with AIFA provided for the elimination of the reimbursement limit related to TYSABRI sales in Italy from February 2013 going forward. As a result, we recorded approximately $54 million of previously deferred revenues related to the period from February 2013 through March 31, 2014.","In the second quarter we recorded TYSABRI revenues in Italy at the full reimbursed price, which increased revenues by approximately $14 million versus prior trend. We continue to be in discussions with AIFA to resolve our dispute concerning the periods February 2009 to January 2013.","Nevertheless we\u2019ll be booking revenues at the full reimbursed price going forward. Adjusting for these items, we\u2019re very pleased to see TYSABRI experience low double-digit revenue growth in the second quarter.","Moving to hemophilia, ALPROLIX revenue in Q2 its first quarter on the market was $10 million. Turning to our anti-CD20 franchise, U.S. profit share was $285 million for the second quarter and royalties and profit-sharing sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. were $18 million. The result was $303 million of net revenue from unconsolidated joint business.","Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q2 cost of goods sold were $292 million or 12% of revenue. Q2 non-GAAP R&D expense was $446 million or 18% of revenue which includes approximately $40 million in milestone and other payments related to our collaborations with Eisai and Isis. Q2 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $540 million or 22% of total revenue. Our Q2 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 27%.","During the quarter, as part of our shared stabilization plan, we repurchased $1.2 million for a total of approximately $340 million. Our weighted average diluted shares were $237 million and we ended the quarter with approximately $2.6 billion in cash and marketable securities which approximately two-thirds within the U.S.","As a reminder, we expect to enter a period of large TECFIDERA CVR payments to the former shareholders of Fumapharm. In Q2, we accrued $150 million as we reached $2 billion in accumulative sales of TECFIDERA. This brings us to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $3.49 million for the second quarter, an increase of 52%.","Now, let me turn to our updated full year 2014 guidance. We now expect total revenue growth between 38% and 41%. Clearly, this change represents a meaningful increase from prior guidance owing primarily to the growth of TECFIDERA in the U.S. and EU, the strength of our other MS therapies and clarity on the AIFA pricing matter.","Let me provide additional color. First in the U.S. underlying demand for TECFIDERA, in addition to compliance in gross to net dynamics are all anticipated to be favorable throughout 2014 compared to our prior plan. In Europe, as Tony noted, we had originally assumed TECFIDERA would have experienced a slower uptake than the U.S. due to delayed launch. Our forecast now assumes TECFIDERA uptake in Europe similar to what we saw in the U.S. on a country by country rollout. We continue to expect Germany will be the primary TECFIDERA revenue driver outside the U.S. for 2014. And it does continue to appear that TECFIDERA has expanded the market.","Second, we believe AVONEX and TYSABRI performance will remain resilient each carving solid roles in the market. And our 2014 guidance now includes the impact of the agreement with AIFA as we picked up the previously deferred revenue and will no longer defer revenue for the balance of the year. The full year impact from the AIFA agreement is favorable by approximately $96 million versus prior guidance.","R&D expense is expected to be between 20% and 21% of sales. Our full year R&D forecast now includes greater than $150 million for the balance of the year for business development opportunities. Coupled with what we have spent on Eisai and Sangamo, this represents over $300 million for the full year in increase over prior guidance. This remains strategically important focus for the company. However, if we cannot find high quality pipeline assets by the end of the year, some of this amount may drop to the bottom line.","SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 22% to 23% of revenue. SG&A now includes increased investments in 2014 associated with the ongoing TECFIDERA and hemophilia launches. We realized this is a meaningful increase in SG&A dollars and remain committed to SG&A leverage in 2015. The result we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share between $12.90 and $13.10 and GAAP EPS to be between $11.26 and $11.46.","Turn the call over to George for his closing comments.","George Scangos","Okay, thanks Paul. So, in closing, we had another productive quarter. And we successfully executed against several key objectives. We said earlier this year that our goals for 2014 were aggressive and would require focus and dedication from our employees and we have made significant progress. Well, with the second half of the year yet to go, we still have a number of product launches and pipeline milestones ahead of us. So, our efforts over the coming months will focus on the launch of four new products in two distinct therapeutic areas, a real challenge for a company of our size. We will continue to launch TECFIDERA across the EU as we work to expand marketing approval across the globe. We anticipate both U.S. and EU launch of PLEGRIDY for relapsing MS. And that\u2019s an important part of our strategy for maintaining our leadership among the injectable products for MS.","And then the continued launch of our hemophilia products, ALPROLIX for hemophilia B in the U.S. and other countries, including Japan and ELOCTATE for hemophilia A, an important step towards revenue diversification. We also expect an important part of our long-term value creation will come from a number of mid-stage proof of biology and proof of concept readouts this year and next. Our strategy for sustainable growth centers on deep commitment to the patient leveraging our areas of expertise in neurology, hematology, and immunology while continuing to focus on innovation. We believe that if we anchor ourselves on these three tenets, patients will benefit and meaningful shareholder value creation should follow.","As always, I want to thank our employees who are dedicated to making a positive impact on patient\u2019s lives and the patients and physicians who are involved in our clinical development programs. The achievements we have made together could not have been realized without their steadfast passion and commitment. So, thank you all for joining us this morning. And operator, we will now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets.","Hey, great. Thanks. Good morning. On TECFIDERA just drilling down a little bit, the beat was just significantly higher than anyone would have thought, so just trying to understand the compliance you mentioned, do you think that that\u2019s actually getting better that there is less dropouts over time. Is there anything there that you are seeing? There are still lot of people out there suggesting that, that\u2019s a hindrance for some patients, who maybe just thinking about that compliance rate over last year? And then just as a follow-up for Paul, there has been a lot of things in the industry as it relates to M&A in domestic and foreign companies, have you rather been thinking about this, is there any comments you can make as it relates to tax strategy, are there things you can do to impact your margins such as it will be your AbbVie collaboration, maybe any comments around that would be helpful? Thanks.","Paul Clancy","Michael, this is Paul. I will try to take both of them. Yes, we are very pleased with the TECFIDERA results for the quarter, but I\u2019d say it was across both Europe and the U.S. When we refer to compliance, we are actually referring to essentially the number of pills patient takes over the course of the month, if you will. That\u2019s slightly different than discontinuation rates, which is \u2013 or persistency, which I think you had kind of referred to. The persistency in discontinuation rates, are still a little bit opaque for us. So, I think that what we said in the past around kind of 10% to 20% over the course of the year, I think we still believe that and that\u2019s kind of the triangulation of the data, but I think the TECFIDERA numbers were just kind of real good performance in compliance better than expectations in the United States on gross to net and certainly the German launch has exceeded our expectations. We are probably about 5.5 months into the German launch, were a little bit less time in a few other countries, but we are very pleased with the performance in Europe.","With respect to inversions, it\u2019s obviously a very topical, I mean, you can\u2019t kind of open up the journal any day without having \u2013 being able to read an article on re-domiciling. It\u2019s clearly something that we have thought about over the years, right. I mean, we didn\u2019t ask that purchase agreement with Elan a year ago. So, the course of time leading into that, we clearly thought about it, because the ability to do that has been around for a long period of time. I will give you a couple of perspectives on how we think about it, because I\u2019d certainly don\u2019t want you to lead into that we are all excited about it just given the press news. ","And kind of just a level point, let me explain our effective tax rate is kind of a combination of the RITUXAN cash flow, which is really all U.S. cash flow, so it\u2019s going to be a high 30s percent on that cash flow in everything else that is probably more biopharmaceutical like. Even re-domiciling without IP migration would not meaningfully affect the RITUXAN cash flow tax rate. And we generally cost share assets in our pipeline. So, that\u2019s the way to think about our tax rate as it stands now.","The way we conceptually think about a business combination which would result in re-domiciling is all the benefits of re-domiciling are essentially like a synergy. And of course you always want to try to get synergies in the business, but we don\u2019t think that\u2019s a rationale for a business combination, that it has to make the industrial logic first and foremost. So, if there is industrial logic which we just have not seen around a business combination, then there would be a possibility for that.","I think the other thing to point out for Biogen Idec, a major consideration for us, which is probably more acute than others is for our long-term shareholders, it would result in a meaningful capital gains, just the result of \u2013 we have shareholders that have been in the stock for a very long period of time. And with the capital appreciation in the stock, that\u2019s a major, major consideration that we think about. So, that\u2019s a little bit of perspective.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Ravi Mehrotra - Credit Suisse","Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. First one for George, it\u2019s been very nice this year that you flagged the intention to enter into new, early and mid-stage business development opportunities, given the fine form and front running commercial performance you have delivered in the first two [furlongs] [ph] of this year, do you see potential for either greater focus on these deals and which domains would you like to dominate by these deals? Let me sneak another one in for Doug, so on anti-LINGO, how will the RENEW and SYNERGY data influenced the Phase 3 trial endpoints? Do you see more of an evolution or revolution in endpoints normally seen in Phase 3 MS studies? Thank you.","George Scangos","Okay, Ravi, it\u2019s George. I will take the first part of your question. Look I think the \u2013 we have said for a while now that our strategy was to continue to build out our pipeline, so that we can have a high-quality pipeline of sufficient size to generate additional value as we go forward. We have done a number of business development deals already a couple this year, certainly several last year and we will continue to do them. I don\u2019t see any big divergence from what we have done in the past. As Paul said, we have money now in the budget for additional deals this year, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean we are going to go spend it, right. Then we have money available if and when the appropriate technologies or product opportunities come our way. We will focus in our areas of expertise, so neurodegenerative diseases, immunology, hematology, I think there is a big advantage to sticking to our knitting and focusing in areas where we have real expertise. A lot of this business is based on information arbitrage and getting some insights that are not everybody has and we believe that\u2019s an important part of our strategy. We have done that focusing now for years. And I will continue to work in those areas, where we believe we have a real depth of knowledge.","Doug Williams","And Ravi, this is Doug. I will take your question about revolution or evolution with respect to SYNERGY and the endpoints. I guess that\u2019s in the eye of the beholder, but I think what we are trying to do here with this study is learn as much as we can about the correlation between re-myelination and the impact on what we think are important parameters of disease progression in these patients. What we are hoping to see with the study is actually an improvement in EDSS and a change in cognition. Cognition is not a sort of traditional endpoint if you will from a regulatory approval perspective, but we think it\u2019s important in terms of understanding the totality of impact on re-myelination in the brain of patients with relapsing forms of MS and actually progressive forms as well. So, I think the study is designed to collect and capture as much information as we can. The paradigm that we are trying to put forward is to improve outcomes for patients and not just stabilize disease. So, I think in that regard, it\u2019s probably somewhat revolutionary. And I think that the study is designed in a way to guide us forward not only with LINGO, but with other strategies that we have got further back in the pipeline that are also geared towards re-myelinating, BIIB061 being the first candidate to go forward.","So, I think it\u2019s important that we run the study in a blinded fashion through the full 18 months of the study and that was the decision that we made and we have talked about in my comments in the earnings call. And I think that, that will give us the information we need to plan on appropriate Phase 3 study, where we are looking to change the treatment paradigm in MS by actually causing improvement in outcomes for patients as opposed to just stabilizing disease.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Your line is open.","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just one topic that hasn\u2019t been addressed yet on this call, but I\u2019d just like to get your dug analyses on the call, just get your current thinking at TYSABRI in SPMS, what will be the biologic rationale for TYSABRI to actually show efficacy in that indication? And then my second question, I promise is very easy, what\u2019s \u2013 Paul, what\u2019s the \u2013 can you just remind us roughly what the German prices for TECFIDERA and whether or not that could change? Thank you.","Al Sandrock","Hi, Mark. This is Al Sandrock. On TYSABRI SPMS, there is continues to be emerging data that gives positive signals potentially for how TYSABRI could work, one is that there was a publication earlier this year labeled, it was called the study of the proof-of-concept of Natalizumab in SPMS, it was published by a Danish group. And it shows that when you look at CSF neurofilament levels, that levels drop after starting TYSABRI treatment and kind of the drop occurred within six to nine months. So, I think that\u2019s yet of more evidence in addition to the evidence we have been talking about for a couple of years now, which is the CXCL13 decrease which is a market of follicular dendritic cells, which we think are important in organizing these meningeal lymphoid follicle that in about half the patients seem to be important for progression in SPMS. So I think there is continuing biological data that tells us that we could potentially see a positive effect with Natalizumab in SPMS.","George Scangos","Yes. And Mark, just for the quick response in the German price, it\u2019s in the low-20s on an euro basis, on an annual cost of therapy which gets essentially to right around $30,000 annual cost of therapy in Germany right now. And that as you know is in the one year \u201cfree pricing\u201d period. So it\u2019s actually important to keep in mind. So I appreciate you kind of pointing it out, important to keep in mind that as we spin into 2015, we will likely move into a different more negotiated price likely through the (AVONEX) process.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Porges - Bernstein","Thanks very much for taking the question and again congratulations on really terrific results with particularly TECFIDERA in Europe. I will try and slip into as it seems to be the fashion, could we just be clear on the LINGO MS study, we wanted to hear in 2015 the results of the 12-month analysis, but we will hear the 18 month results disclosed presumably not to \u201916. And then secondly Tony could you just give us a little bit more color on exactly where TECFIDERA is in the ex-German markets, not the smaller markets but the other big five European countries, when you expect to actually get the launch going there?","Doug Williams","Geoff, this is Doug. You are correct that the data flow is as you describe it. We will \u2013 a small team internally will have access to the 12-month data, but we have decided that it\u2019s important to avoid the possibility of creating bias in the study outcomes to maintain our disclosure in 2016. So once the study is fully complete, we will disclose the data at that time. And we think it\u2019s important to keep the study blinded between the 12 and 18 month timeframe and that will kick the disclosure over into 2016 as you described.","Tony Kingsley","Yes, it\u2019s Tony. On ex-U.S., so we have \u2013 you saw the nice opinion from the UK, the process once they have issued the (NASDAQ:FAD) is 6 to 8 weeks, we give guidance and then there is a couple of months to get funding and so thank you for. By the time the funding hits market we are in the market in France in a limited way in the hospital channel, negotiations ongoing. We also think that\u2019s Q4 timings in Italy would likely be 2015 well hard to handicap, but we think first half 2015.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen and Company","Thanks for taking the question. Maybe for Paul or George, it sounds like business is good, the revenue stream is increasingly diversified, the outlook is very favorable, you are building cash so I guess some, I am asking about your capital reallocation plan and thoughts on the dividend or a substantial share buyback.","George Scangos","Thanks Eric. Yes, important question. So we have certainly rebuilt the cash position over the last 12 months. If \u2013 as we have talked about this 12 months ago, following the asset purchase of TYSABRI we were running on fumes that has changed meaningfully as the business has performed quite well. We want to continue to be cognizant over the kind of next couple of year time period that we are probably greater than I would have expected have the potential for the CVR tech related payments just to come may be at a quicker phase. Those obviously turn out as people know, but we want to be mindful of that. We continue our strategic bias is remains these tuck-in acquisitions where we think its core of the business and great internal rates of return and all that. With that said, more than likely we have excess cash over the next number of years. We have been having very constructive conversations over the last couple of months with our shareholders. On this topic, not all of them, but a number of them, I think we completely agree it\u2019s one of the more important judgments that we have. We agree that it is \u2013 it is all about deploying this and returning it in the way that maximizes the intrinsic value. We will continue to have that dialog. I think it\u2019s a Mosaic in terms of preferences around which vehicle to return cash and we will have to synthesize that and get to our own judgment. So, nothing to report per say yet, but very high on the agenda of our conversations here George and I and with the board and hopefully we start to get clarity in the near term. George?","George Scangos","I don\u2019t have too much to add to that. I think look this is the topic as Paul said that we are in discussions with the board with a number of our shareholders. And as we have started to refill our coffers after the Elan acquisition becomes something were discussing more, but nothing really to add at this time?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Weber with Citi. Your line is open.","Yaron Weber - Citi","Great, thanks for taking my question. It\u2019s a question maybe for Al or Doug, when you look at the combination now admittedly, it\u2019s an animal models and the EAE model is not a great model, because it\u2019s inflammatory. But when you look at LINGO and AVONEX together there is some data suggesting maybe LINGO alone is just as good as the combo and perhaps LINGO is more synergistic with an oral like Gilenya. So, I wanted to get your thoughts on that? And then if you don\u2019t mind, I am just going to sneak in for Paul, the IMS data how good is that, it sounds like historically you have said that it\u2019s good predicting TECFIDERA. Excluding the stocking, although it sounds like a slight de-stocking yet you will be by about 30% the IMS stock on a prescription number. So, what are we missing there? Thank you.","Paul Clancy","So, on EAE question, it\u2019s been traditionally difficult to see a robust effect of interferon in EAE. So, it doesn\u2019t surprise me that adding LINGO to AVONEX doesn\u2019t give you very much more than LINGO. I think the bottom line is that the effect of LINGO either in a knockout setting or other settings is pretty robust on re-myelination animal models in general, including EAE. And then in terms of combining, is it better with Gilenya?","Doug Williams","We have some \u2013 we publish data that suggests that just to be cautious about these S1P antagonists, some of them actually have negative effects on all the good intersite differentiation and myelination. So, I think it needs to be studied further, but I think it\u2019s a very complex field, because many of these antagonists cross to multiple subtypes of S1P receptors and they can each have different activities. And so we are actually studying that quite extensively ourselves. I would also say that one of the issues that is still an open issue for us with respect to the Phase 3 study design as what we will combine with anti-LINGO assuming we get to Phase 3, what will combine with anti-LINGO as far as disease modifying therapy. And part of that will depend upon conversations with regulators in terms of what they are going to require vis-\u00e0-vis the kind of labeling that we would be able to achieve. So, that\u2019s an open question and one that\u2019s under active debate right now, but we will obviously require some input from the regulators in terms of how that proceeds in Phase 3.","George Scangos","Yaron, on your first part of your question as we have said in the past over time, IMS seems to be predictive in any given week or any given quarter. It can have some wobbling as it tracks. Our inventory in the channel actually as I mentioned modestly went down. So, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s kind of driving it. It maybe gross to net as I pointed out. We had originally thought in our plan that the gross to net percentage would approach AVONEX this year and it\u2019s probably really closer to mid-teens rate. So, we are getting a little bit of favorability, which pulled through in the second quarter that may account for some of it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Matthew Harrison - Morgan Stanley","Great, thanks. Good morning everybody. I just wanted to ask on when you launch TECFIDERA in the U.S. you obviously saw sort of a pattern of TYSABRI patients or some weakness in TYSABRI, it\u2019s hard for me to breakout what\u2019s going on in Europe given some of the agreements and one-time items. I am wondering if you think we should expect to see that in Europe as well or not. And then Paul can you just be specific on what the sort of gross to net swing for TECFIDERA in the U.S. was? Thanks.","Tony Kingsley","Thanks Mathew. It\u2019s Tony. So the short answer is, yes we have expected to see some TECFIDERA impact on TYSABRI but \u2013 in Europe, but substantially you did relative to what we saw in the U.S. the reality is in 2013 there was one of the issues with TYSABRI in 2013 is outside the U.S. and largely in Europe. We had a bunch of patients who would discontinue and switch to Gilenya. Any how we also had Gilenya in front of TYSABRI. So, we think we actually absorbed a lot of that impact of the oral switch frankly when we didn\u2019t have TECFIDERA in the market. We are going to see some switch from TYSABRI to TECFIDERA. We think it\u2019s less dramatic than in the U.S. frankly, because a bunch of it happened with Gilenya, I think 12 months ago.","Paul Clancy","And then Matt, with respect to the TECFIDERA kind of gross to net question, I wouldn\u2019t characterize it or portrait it as a swing. I think I would portrait more as our prior thinking and kind of conversations with you had been that we have \u2013 what we had thought originally was approaching AVONEX like which would have getting it close to 20 and it\u2019s probably more mid-teens-ish. And we are just benefiting from that vis-\u00e0-vis our original plan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. First on ALPROLIX anything notable about the early adopters that you have seen there and any thing we can read through to ELOCTATE. And I know it\u2019s still early there early days, but anything we can read through from ALPROLIX or ELOCTATE. And then Paul on SG&A leverage you mentioned a commitment there again I think consensus is modeling about 1% improvement is that the right order of magnitude? Thanks.","Tony Kingsley","Good question, Tony on hemophilia. So look with ALPROLIX we are pleased to be clear. We always said this was difficult to predict to be \u2013 what the trajectory would be because it\u2019s such a patient driven market and there hasn\u2019t been a new entrant in some time. Look having said that, we always thought there would be a cohort of patients that we can activate more quickly prophylaxis patients who are really bought the proposition were well-informed. And there were certainly investigators or others who are more familiar with the product. So I think we have demonstrated that that has happened and that\u2019s how we sort of captured is the early adopters, which is good. We are very pleased with that. We are getting access to HTCs, but on ALPROLIX I think the harder work begins now which is that next year patients convincing them this is the right value proposition and activating I mean getting the physicians ready. We feel very pleased with the execution.","ELOCTATE, yes, early days, too early to comment on the performance. We are also confident in the ELOCTATE product profile. It\u2019s a less simple cell frankly. The ALPROLIX once a week cell is a pretty straightforward message. It\u2019s easier to counter position. You only have to listen to some of the competitors\u2019 earnings calls to talk about what they are doing. So we have some work to do to get out and educate physicians and patients. We think the extended half life makes a big difference for patients. And we think we are going to be able to communicate that message to patients and also to hemophilia treatment center. So early days but pleased with where we are.","Paul Clancy","Terence, on the SG&A leverage question, so the 100 basis points I mean is certainly not crazy, I mean it\u2019s obviously going to be a function of revenue as we spin into 2015. I would hate to go get pinned down on that. Let me kind of give you more broadly the thinking. The thinking more broadly is look we have realized the SG&A growth has been pretty meaningful, right. I mean just in terms of raw dollars, it\u2019s been very meaningful. We have all along thought that that has been the right business judgment to make during this unprecedented time of launches for a company our size to go through the close to handful of launches. We needed to make sure we weren\u2019t as I have said before penny wise and pound foolish. Conceptually where we are thinking as we move into 2015 is that those launches we now moved to a time period of leverage. And I think that\u2019s both a cost and shareholder value perspective as well as a cultural perspective to make sure we don\u2019t kind of take a base that was designed for one reason and just keep building off the base and conceptually I think that we believe as we go into \u201915, \u201916, the resource allocation shift can actually move towards making sure we\u2019re building the pipeline.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS. Your line is open.","Matt Roden \u2013 UBS","Great, thanks very much for taking the question and congrats on the nice quarter here. Question on one of your pipeline opportunities in IPF with STX-100, I\u2019ve asked about this before, but in the past quarter, we\u2019ve gone to complete Phase III datasets from other IPF drugs and they look like they\u2019re going to be approved in the next year and so the question is if your Phase IIa data are positive in terms of the biomarkers and other signs and symptoms of disease. What would then be the next step for STX-100, would you go straight in the combination studies that will be additional Phase II work before moving into Phase III and then related, is there either one of the two assets that are out there that look more combinable or more attractive as a combination partner. Thanks very much.","Doug Williams","Hi, Matt, this is Doug. I think at the moment, the issue of combination versus whether you would target later stage patients, which presumably the labels for these two frontrunner drugs wouldn\u2019t cover. I think there is a variety of different ways that we can think about running the next series of studies. I think we\u2019re still exploring the data from both the intermune and the BI study, but I think there is a lot of options that are available to us. As you point out, one option is obviously looking at combination therapy. I can\u2019t give you a clear preference yet other than to say that there is a difference in the safety profile between the two drugs and that would lead one to believe that perhaps intermune will have a lag up in terms of market share and penetration so that might be a bit more attractive to think about from a combination perspective. But I think that the differential mechanisms lend themselves to combinations and also think that this is a market that\u2019s going to evolve much like other disease modifying therapy market, not unlike MS which is not every drug will work in every patient and so the market will evolve with space for multiple entries into that market overtime and I think that STX-100 represents an attractive opportunity either a single agent or potentially in combination with one or both of those agents.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Robyn Karnauskas, your line is open.","Robyn Karnauskas \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi guys, sorry about that, I was on mute. Thanks for taking my question. So on Alzheimer\u2019s program, can you just walk us through the rationale Al for I am targeting the insoluble form of A-beta versus the soluble form and why you think that will work. And then just any color on the second generation (exonerated) hemophilia product with AVONEX, what could be the timeline, what\u2019s the height \u2013 the science behind the longer halfway for that technology? Thanks.","Al Sandrock","Yes. Hi, Robyn this is Al. So we \u2013 if we have a drug that binds to soluble forms, it\u2019s going to have a hard time getting to the plaque and because there is soluble forms not only as circulating in the blood, but also there is going to be soluble forms all around the brain. So if you really want to \u2013 and many of the dystrophic neuritis are around the plaque, so we think the plaque if we can remove the plaque, we can remove not only the fibular forms of A-beta, but all the other smaller forms, the oligomers that we believe are toxic are not only to synapses, but also to nerve fibers. So I think having a drug that targets the plaque allows access of the antibody to \u2013 we think the core of where the toxic proteins are emanating from and that\u2019s our rationale. Also if we look back at the old paper that we are with the neuroimmune antibody came from, those are patients in that small study of 30 patients who developed antibodies to plaque amyloids. Actually, we are doing better around the patients who have not developed antibodies to plaque amyloid on targeted studies. And it was a basis of that paper that was published in Europe, 9 years ago that got us excited in the particular antibody.","Doug Williams","Robyn, this is Doug. I think you are alluding to the next generation factor 8 that utilizes the X10 technology that could come into the clinic as early as next year, that\u2019s our hope. And the technology behind that molecule is really based on the fact that if you look at all of the extended half life factor 8 molecules that are out there, they are all clustered around 1.5 to twofold greater half life than the unmodified versions of factor 8. That\u2019s because they interact with von Willebrand factor. And so we set about trying to engineer the molecule to sort of breakthrough that barrier and based on the preclinical data that we have accumulated thus far, it looks like that we have probably another twofold extension of the half life beyond what we have with a lock take right now, which could be very meaningful from the standpoint of further extending the frequency of infusions for patients with hemophilia A. So, we are hoping to bring that forward as early as next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Geoff Meacham - JPMorgan","Good morning, guys. Thanks for the taking the questions. One for Doug or Al, so when you look at anti-LINGO and MS, I know it\u2019s tough to say specifically, but mechanistically should there be a meaningful difference between 12 months and 18 months of treatment? And are you guys assuming for these novel endpoints a decline in the AVONEX-only arm? And then just a quick one for Tony on the Daclizumab, you have Phase 3 data in hand, just wanted to get the early kind of read about how you are thinking about positioning? Thanks.","Al Sandrock","So, Geoff, this is Al. I mean, as Doug said in his great answer to this question, what we are trying to do is to learn as much as we can. This is really the first well-controlled trial of any drug for re-myelination. What we are trying to do in the MS study and in the combination of the MS and optic neuritis studies to understand first, do we get re-myelination when we look at images? Second, do we get any electrophysiologic consequences? So, that\u2019s why we are looking at nerve conduction velocity in the optic neuritis.","And then the third and this is the most important thing is what\u2019s the connection of these biological changes, if you will, or electrophysiologic changes to clinical endpoints, because ultimately that\u2019s what we are going to have to show on Phase 3 is assuming we get re-myelination or preservation of axon, are we going to get improvement in disability, are we going to get improvement in cognition? And so \u2013 and the timing of these things is probably going to be different. For example, I could imagine that we will get a rapid effect on re-myelination more rapid and then you would have a delayed effect on axon preservation and even more delayed effect on cognition or disability improvement. I think it\u2019s the timing of this and the correlation as Doug said between these biological measurements of these clinical endpoints that we are trying to sort out in these two studies.","Tony Kingsley","It\u2019s Tony. On Daclizumab, look with obviously top line data that has been released, we will have to see as the full dataset gets released and so forth how the market reacts. So, we don\u2019t have a sort of detailed market bag, but we think there is clearly a place for this. It\u2019s got a nice combination of efficacy one times a month dosing. I think physicians are intrigued by the MOA, which gives them another option, the open questions through registration and labeling, where it comes out in terms of safety monitoring and all that other stuff. There is a meaningful switch population of patients still who are going to come off injectables, who are going to come off orals. And there are people for whom TYSABRI patients, (indiscernible) this might be appropriate. So, we are going to have do the more detail as we get the more detailed data, but it feels like there is \u2013 it\u2019s an interesting mechanism that has physicians intrigued and it feels like there is a package there that could have a meaningful place in the market.","George Scangos","So, Geoff, this is George, let me just pickup a little bit on the LINGO question, because at the end of 12 months, when we do the interim analysis, we will know the data, alright and which is the important aspect for us. And there will be a group of people in here who will know and that\u2019s important for us to know how to start planning for the Phase 3, how they design it. We are incredibly excited about this project as lots of people outside the company seem to be because of its potential and we just want to make sure we get it right. The important thing is that we get a good trial that gives us an accurate picture of the potential of LINGO and that we don\u2019t jeopardize that trial. It will be part of the registration package, it\u2019s not a Phase 3 pivotal trial, but it will be an important part of the registration package and so the two most important criteria is that we know the data so we can start planning and that we conduct the trial and don\u2019t impact the integrity of the trial. Unfortunately that means the likely delay of one we would tell you the data although, the trial itself seems to be somewhere ahead of schedule. So, that\u2019s \u2013 those are the reasons and we\u2019d like to be transparent as we always knew, but we have other considerations to think about here as well.","Operator","I would now like to turn the conference back over to our presenters.","George Scangos","Okay.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks there will be a question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) Claudine Prowse, VP Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Claudine Prowse ","Welcome to Biogen Idec\u2019s first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the investor\u2019s section of www.BiogenIdec.com to find the press release and related financial tables including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures that we\u2019ll discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in tables one and two. Table three includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results which we believe better represents the ongoing economics of our business and reflects how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussion related to this call. ","I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult our SEC filings for additional detail. ","On today\u2019s call I\u2019m joined by our Chief Executive Officer Dr. George Scangos; Tony Kingsley, EVP of Global Commercial Operations; Dr. Doug Williams, EVP of Research and Development; and our CFO Paul Clancy. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to George. ","George A. Scangos","Biogen Idec had an excellent start to 2014 with successful milestone accomplishments and solid financial performance. We secured approval for TECFIDERA in the EU, launched in Germany, and some other countries. ALPROLIX was approved for hemophilia B in the US and Canada. We continued to move two of our late-stage pipeline candidates, ELOCTATE for hemophilia A and PLEGRIDY for MS, through the registration processes towards anticipated approvals this year. We strengthened our pipeline through new collaborations with Eisai and Sangamo in areas that fit within our strategic therapeutic focus, and first quarter financial performance reflected 51% growth in revenues and 25% growth in non-GAAP EPS year-over-year.","So, this month marks the one-year anniversary of the US introduction of TECFIDERA. It\u2019s introduction has dramatically shifted the US market for MS therapy. We\u2019ve seen an expansion of the MS market and within that TECFIDERA is the number one oral MS therapy in the US, achieving over $1 billion in revenue during the first year of launch. We launched TECFIDERA in initially European countries, beginning in February and already there appears to be broad interest among physicians and patients. Based on the continued strong demand in the US and the encouraging early signs in the EU, we believe that TECFIDERA\u2019s attractive product profile positions it well for the long run.","The approval and anticipated launch of ALPROLIX marks an important milestone for our company as we expand into the hemophilia market. ALPROLIX is the first hemophilia B therapy to reduce bleeding episodes with prophylactic infusions at least a week apart. We believe that this therapy has the potential to change the standard of care in hemophilia and significantly improve patients\u2019 lives. As we\u2019ve done for so many years in multiple sclerosis, our goal is to bring a diligent patient centric approach to addressing the hemophilia community. Our keen focus on patients permeates everything that we do from our direct interactions with patients, to our assistance programs, to our continuing R&D efforts. We remain focused on making decisions that are right for patients.","Last month, the FDA extended the PDUFA date of PLEGRIDY, our subcutaneous peginterferon beta-1a candidate for relapsing forms of MS to allow additional time for review of the application, while obviously not the news we were hoping to hear, a three-month PDUFA extension is not uncommon, particularly for applications involving MS therapies. We look forward to the potential launch of PLEDGRIDYin the second half of the year. ","We\u2019ve continued to make strides to expand our global presence beyond Europe and the US. In Japan, we obtained marketing approval for TYSABRI and filed a marketing application for ELOCTATE. Japan is the second-largest pharmaceutical market in the world with attractive dynamics, and it is an important long-term priority for the company. ","So in summary, I think we\u2019re off to a great start for 2014, and I\u2019ll turn the call over to Doug.","Douglas E. Williams","We\u2019re excited about the approval of ALPROLIX. ALPROLIX is a recombinant DNA derived long-acting coagulation Factor IX concentrate indicated in the US for both adults and children with hemophilia B. In the US, ALPROLIX is indicated for the control and prevention of bleeding episodes perioperative management, and routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes. Starting dosing regimens for prophylaxis are 50 international units per kilogram once weekly or 100 IUs per kilogram once every 10 days. Dosing can be adjusted based on individual response. ","The safety and tolerability information including in the US label is consistent with data from the Phase 3 Study. The most common adverse reaction observed were headache and oral paresthesia. In summary, we\u2019re pleased to have obtained what we believe is an attractive and differentiating product label for ALPROLIX. ","Earlier this month, we along with our partner Sobi, announced topline results from the ELOCTATE Kids A-LONG Phase 3 study in pediatric patients with hemophilia A. These data demonstrated that twice weekly prophylactic dosing with ELOCTATE maintained low bleeding rates in children. We believe these results support the potential for ELOCTATE to address a significant need for children with hemophilia A by providing prolonged intervals between scheduled prophylactic infusions to protect against bleeding episodes. ","The tolerability, safety, and relative half-life were consistent with those observed in previous clinical studies and no inhibitors were detected. These data support applications for pediatric indications globally and are a necessary step to obtaining marketing authorization in Europe. The ALPROLIX Kids B-LONG study remains ongoing with data expected in the first half of 2015. ","Transitioning to our neurology programs, we continue to generate new data to support our products and better understand our pipeline candidates. At next week\u2019s American Academy of Neurology Meeting, we\u2019ll be presenting important new data for several of our programs. Specifically, we\u2019ll present TECFIDERA data that demonstrates strong efficacy in various patient subgroups including those with more active disease. Results from the TECFIDERA managed study show that GI symptoms experienced by some patients are often transient in nature.","For PLEGRIDY, we\u2019ll present post-hoc analysis from year one of the advanced study demonstrating a higher proportion of patients taking PLEGRIDY to achieve freedom from measured disease activity. We\u2019ll also present final two year data providing further support for this product candidate\u2019s efficacy and safety profile. ","Finally, new TYSABRI data demonstrate its efficacy benefits in patients switching to TYSABRI versus maintaining the use of alternative therapies. This quarter, we also completed a number of transactions that provide Biogen Idec with access to promising new clinical candidates. Our collaboration with Sangamo BioSciences is focused on an innovative gene editing technology with the potential to treat sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia. ","Our agreement with Eisai expands our efforts to develop disease modifying therapies for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. In recent years, meaningful advances have increased our understanding in both trial design and target selection for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The optimal therapeutic approach for AD remains uncertain, and we believe it\u2019s prudent to evaluate multiple therapeutic methods for treating the disease. With the Eisai transaction, we\u2019ve gained access to two-mid stage clinical candidates for AD, a small molecule BACE1 inhibitor and a monoclonal antibody targeting beta-amyloid. Combined with BIIB037 and our anti-tau program in preclinical testing, we now have four potential Alzheimer\u2019s disease candidates with three different mechanisms.","Looking forward, we also anticipate data from several clinical studies including the Phase 3 Daclizumab HYP DECIDE study in relapsing MS patients. Rather than a placebo controlled study design, the DECIDE study sets a higher standard with a compelling two to three head-to-head design versus interferon beta treatment. The primary endpoint is the reduction in annualized relapse rate. We remain on track for obtaining DECIDE data around the middle of this year. ","I\u2019ll now pass the call over to Tony.","Tony Kingsley ","During the quarter we continued to grow total MS patient share across our franchise. Starting with TECFIDERA, performance in the US remains strong and the global introduction is under way. After one year on the market, over 65,000 patients have been treated with TECFIDERA globally. In the US, we continue to be pleased with how broadly neurologists have adopted TECFIDERA. As of Q1 approximately 7,000 physicians have written TECFIDERA in the US and we\u2019re also encouraged by deeper usage among writers as approximately 75% of all TECFIDERA prescribers have written multiple subscriptions.","According to our market research TECIFDERA is the leading therapy for newly diagnosed MS patients. One year into the US launch we believe TECIFDERA is continuing to stimulate higher switch rates. While we anticipate the patient start and switch dynamics to remain strong, we continue to believe that the overall market growth rates will moderate towards historical levels during 2014. ","Outside of the US, we believe TECIFDERA is also performing well in other launch markets. In both Canada and Australia, our market research suggest the TECIFDERA is outpacing the other orals on the market when comparing the initial months of launch. In Germany, we\u2019re encouraged by the early signs. In addition to driving strong execution on promotion and education, we\u2019re actively engaging with reimbursement authorities across multiple markets. Australia gained full year reimbursement in December and we expect to gain government reimbursement in Canada later this year.","In year up we have secured full reimbursement, in [doorway] and Scotland. Our local market access teams are executing well and we continue to expect the series of reimbursement decisions across European markets in the latter half of the year. ","AVONEX continued to perform well globally in the first quarter. In the US as the injectable class continues to decline, the demand for AVONEX is softening as we anticipated. But within the injectable class we believe AVONEX is emerging as the interferon of choice. Outside the US we are maintaining strong AVONEX promotional efforts in advance of anticipated TECIFDERA launches and we remain committed to maintaining strong relative position for AVONEX among the platform therapies as that segment of the market declines. We continue to believe the convenience remains the key differentiator for this segment. ","Moving onto TYSABRI, in the US demand for TYSABRI remains solid as physicians continue to choose this therapy for patients requiring higher efficacy treatment. We\u2019re also encouraged by a recent uptick in patient retention rates. Importantly, in patients who have discontinued TYSABRI, approximately 70% have stayed within our franchise during the first quarter. In Europe we believe that as TECIFDERA is launched across individual markets TYSABRI may experience similar dynamics that we saw in the US. Overall, we continue to believe in TYSABRI as a leader in the high efficacy segment. ","Now turning to our new hemophilia business. We\u2019re currently in launch mode for ALPROLIX in the US and anticipate having patients on commercial therapy starting in early May. Based on NHF guidelines, traditional hemophilia B therapy requires prophylactic infusions two or more times a week. Given the clarity of our label, we believe our value is very clear for the majority of patients. 50 international units per kilogram will cover a patient for a week, or 100 IUs per kilogram starting every 10 days and adjusting the dosing based on individual response. Our market research suggests that reducing infusion frequency is the largest unmet need for this community and we expect ALPROLIX will directly address this burden. ","With the approval of ALPROLIX in the US, we are focused on two immediate objectives: first, to initiate comprehensive education to physicians, payers, and advocacy groups; and second, to facilitate access to patients starting on ALPROLIX. Our commercial team is actively establishing contracts with specialty pharmacies, finalizing the supply chain, and establishing the financial and patient support programs which we believe will enable a smooth launch. ","We believe that patients and physicians are anticipating the entry of long acting therapies to the market and we are excited to be first. Our commitment is to transform the care of people with hemophilia and facilitate expanded use of prophylactic treatment. A successful launch will require extensive promotional and educational efforts and our commercial organization is executing on this strategy. Our goal is to become market leaders in the mid to long term and we believe in the product and our ability to execute. ","Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with the performance of the commercial organization. Across an expanding portfolio of therapies we are demonstrating strong execution and good results. I\u2019ll now pass the call to Paul.","Paul J. Clancy ","Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.02 in the first quarter and our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.47. Before I walk through the P&L there are a number of items to remember with respect to the year-over-year comparisons. These include: the TYSABRI asset purchase which impacted revenue and COGS; the RITUXAN arbitration charge in Q1 last year; and an unusually low effective tax rate from Q1 2013. Also, this quarter\u2019s results were impacted by $118 million R&D expense related to our Eisai transaction as Doug reviewed. This agreement impacted EPS in the quarter by approximately $0.35.","Now, walking down the P&L I\u2019ll start with revenues. Total revenue for the first quarter grew to approximately $2.1 billion. First quarter AVONEX worldwide revenue was $761 million. In the US, Q1 AVONEX revenue decreased 3% to $476 million and outside the US Q1 AVONEX revenue was $285 million. TYSABRI worldwide revenue net of hedging was $441 million in the first quarter. These results were comprised of $234 million in the US and $207 million internationally. ","Global TECFIDERA revenue was $506 million in Q1. US TECFIDERA was $460 million. We ended the quarter with approximately five weeks of inventory in the channel which includes specialty pharmacies and wholesalers. We estimate that US TECFIDERA revenue includes an incremental inventory build of approximately $45 million versus the end of last year. International TECFIDERA revenue was $46 million in the first quarter with Germany being the primary contributor. We estimate approximately $10 million to $15 million of Germany sales in Q1 were related to inventory build. ","Turning to our anti-CD20 franchise, RITUXIN and GAZYVA US profit share was $275 million for Q1. Royalties and profit share in sales of RITUXIN outside the US were $22 million. The result was $297 million of net revenue from unconsolidated joint business. ","Now turning to the expense lines of the non-GAAP P&L. Q1 non-GAAP cost of goods sold were $279 million or 13% of revenue. The increase year-over-year was primarily driven by TYSABRI contingent payments and royalties. Q1 non-GAAP R&D expense was $527 million or 25% of revenue. The increase year-over-year was primarily driven by our recently announced agreement with Eisai where we recorded a $118 million R&D charge. This amount consisted of a $100 million upfront payment and $18 million reflecting the value of options for certain programs and geographic rights.","Q1 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $509 million or 24% of revenue. We continue to make significant investments associated with TECFIDERA and the upcoming hemophilia launches. Our Q1 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 27%. Weighted average diluted shares were 238 million and we ended the quarter with almost $2 billion in cash and marketable securities of which approximately 70% is within the United States.","This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which were $2.47 for the quarter, an increase of 25%. Now, turning to our updated full year 2014 guidance. We now expect total revenue growth between 26% and 28% an increase from prior guidance owing to AVONEX and TYSABRI buoyance compared to our prior expectations. Our 2014 guidance continues to exclude the impact of a settlement with AIFA as the timing of the final approval of this agreement remains uncertain. ","R&D expense is expected to be between 20% and 22% of sales unchanged from prior guidance. Our full year R&D forecast continues to earmark approximately $200 million for new early stage business development opportunities of which the Eisai transaction is included in this amount. SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 22% to 23% of total revenue also, unchanged. We anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share results between $11.35 and $11.45 and GAAP EPS to be between $9.85 and $9.95. ","Now, over to George for his closing comments.","George A. Scangos","In closing, we\u2019re off to a strong start for the year and looking forward we have several crucial milestones and activities that require our intense focus. First, expanding TECFIDERA into new markets as we seek to serve more patients with MS. We\u2019re launching three additional products ALPROLIX for hemophilia B and other potential launches this year including ELOCTATE for hemophilia A and PLEGRIDY for relapsing MS. We\u2019re advancing the next wave of new potential medicines. In the coming 12 to 18 months we anticipate a number of data readouts including Phase 3 results for Daclizumab HYP in relapsing MS and for TYSABRI in SPMS, as well as, early and mid stage data for a number of compounds in the pipeline including LINGO.","Continuing to focus on innovation we believe that Biogen Idec scientific acumen and robust pipeline program give us the opportunity to not only expand our leadership position in MS but also contribute to new treatment options for patients with other series diseases. These activities are at the very core of our mission and require determination and perseverance. We believe that our team is ready to meet these objectives and we look forward to providing updates on our progress throughout the year.","I\u2019d like to thank the patients and physicians who are involved in our clinical development program and our employees who are dedicated to making a positive impact on patient\u2019s lives, and all of you, for joining us this morning. Operator, we can now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra \u2013 Credit Suisse.","Ravi Mehrotra \u2013 Credit Suisse","Congrats on the progress, especially TECFIDERA\u2019s launch. It's obviously not Sovaldi launch, but it is okay. My question regards biomarkers in MS, can you just remind us of the work you\u2019ve done or are doing to look at the potential of biomarkers to predict response rates for treatment selection in MS patients? Specifically, on LINGO, is there any clinical data historical or ongoing to support the hypothesis that LINGO expression where activation is increased in MS patients? Just a very quick follow on, on the hemophilia, how should we think about gross-to-net revenues?","Douglas E. Williams","I\u2019ll take the first two and then let either Tony or Paul handle the gross-to-net question. Biomarkers, obviously that\u2019s very important part of the ongoing research activities here. There\u2019s really two major questions that we\u2019re trying to approach with the biomarker activity that\u2019s part of our clinical trial program. One is really trying to characterize patients who have either a more or lesser, in terms of aggressiveness, disease course to really try to match them up with certain therapies that may have greater activity and a higher level of disease activity, so for instance, with TYSABRI-like molecule in patients with more aggressive disease.","So, we\u2019re looking at things like RNA profiling, we\u2019re looking at all the laboratory tests that are collected in these patients, we\u2019re looking at MRI activity, clinical relapses, EDSS progression, and really looking across those data sets to try to see whether or not there\u2019s a signature and that signature can be one or more of those parameters that I just named that correlate with a greater level of disease activity. That information, at the time of diagnosis, may help physicians choose the appropriate therapy for their patients at the time of diagnosis.","The sort of bigger question we\u2019re trying to get at with respect to our own portfolio of drugs is, can in fact we use similar types of algorithms to predict patients who will have a greater or lesser response to our therapies or potentially may experience a safety event that we want to steer them away from. So, all of our studies have very extensive sampling embedded in them now, that\u2019s true of our MS studies, it\u2019s actually true of all of our clinical studies now, probably not unlike all of our compatriot companies out there as well. Again, the idea here is to try to match up the appropriate patient with the appropriate drug either in terms of the best response to therapy or steering them away from a potential safety event.","A lot of work still to be done, but I think there\u2019s progress being made and you can expect that we\u2019ll have data reading out over the course of the next months and years that will be presented at major medical meetings to describe what we\u2019ve been finding.","With respect to LINGO, a lot of the hypothesis around the use of LINGO is based on some data from several years back that was based on autopsy specimens from patients with MS showing that in lesions there were in fact pre-myelinating oligodendrocytes, so the cells that are capable of re-myelination are actually present in the lesions, but they are blocked from maturing by one or more factors. LINGO is clearly one of them based on the experimental data that we\u2019ve accumulated. ","I don\u2019t know that there is specific data in autopsy specimens that show an increased level of LINGO versus what\u2019s present in sort of normal brain tissue but it\u2019s clearly present. If you think about what\u2019s happening, we\u2019ve got essentially a targeted delivery of the drug because of the breakdown of the blood\/brain barrier in and around those lesions. So, where we\u2019re going to be able to reverse the inhibition of myelination and allow the maturation of those oligodendrocyte precursor cells is specifically in the area where the blood\/brain barrier has broken down.","You can see this very clearly happening in the animal models, so our expectation is that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen in the human situation as well; and the targeted delivery of the anti-LINGO molecule releasing the block on myelination and hopefully a sufficient level of re-myelination taking place to show clinical benefit in these patients.","Tony Kingsley ","On your question about channel discount, look it\u2019s steady state. Our research suggests that the gross-to-net in the hemophilia space tend to run higher, probably meaningfully higher than what we\u2019re used to seeing in MS. There\u2019s really two big pieces to that. One is the channel, so you have specialty pharmacies, specialty distributors, and home health. The second is there\u2019s a meaningful portion of the patients that go through 340B designated hemophilia treatment centers. We\u2019re going to have to see how that evolves, it will depend a lot on the mix of the patients, and I just think we\u2019ll have to look over the next handful of quarters. I think mix will be a big driver.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Michael Yee \u2013 RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Yee \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","You just launched TECFIDERA in Europe and I\u2019m just trying to understand, based on your feedback so far or your research, whether you think there\u2019s different demand dynamics in sort of the three different pools: newly diagnosed versus switchers versus the quitter pool versus say the US, and are there differences there that we should consider obviously other than price versus the US? Then just as a follow up to that, you\u2019ve mentioned now multiple times in slides and your 10-K about BIIB061, so as I think about the trajectory and longevity of your oral franchise that you\u2019re working on, can you say anything about that drug as to whether it\u2019s remyelinating or anything about BIBB061 that would keep down the suspense?","Tony Kingsley ","On Europe look, I think I\u2019ve said before we continue to believe in the product and are looking forward to launching it. We highlighted a couple of differences in general in Europe which were third oral to market. The other orals [inaudible] more traction perhaps less clear in participation by the community given the uncertainty and the regulatory delays. Like we said before, that\u2019s going to take hard work. We\u2019re working hard. ","If I look at Germany, we\u2019re getting great execution, we\u2019re getting reach and frequency, we\u2019re getting access to customers and we\u2019re seeing interest and we\u2019re getting patients on therapy so we\u2019re encouraged by the signs in Germany. In terms of talking about the trajectory and the mix across pools it\u2019s probably a little early to make that call. As I think you know, in Germany the data is more lag driven IMS basis, we\u2019re looking at shipments and various things like that so probably a little early to make a more specific mix but I think the message is getting access to customers and seeing interest and encouraged by the early signs. ","Douglas E. Williams","BIIB061 that is an oral remyelinating drug in much the same way disease modifying therapies are moving towards an oral platform approach, we see the same thing happening in the remyelinating space. So, as LINGO is the biologic and is the first generation of what we hope will be a successful remyelination franchise, BIIB061 is working through a different mechanism which we\u2019re not prepared to disclose at this point but does very much the same thing that LINGO does in the experimental models so we\u2019re quite excited about initiating the clinical program with the molecule.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group.","Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group","A couple of questions, one maybe for Paul, I just thought I\u2019d take this opportunity, you guys choose to include the upfront R&D payments in your non-GAAP EPS numbers. A couple of other companies out there don\u2019t do that, I\u2019m just wondering why it? It creates volatility on a quarter like this. That\u2019s an old school CFO question so I appreciate it. Then also, if they\u2019re already BG-12 contingent payments that were made in the quarter, would it be possible for you to tell us what they were? Then Doug, how does the base inhibitor from Eisai differ from Merck or AZ\u2019s drug which I think are already in Phase 3 so you guys are pretty far behind I guess and I\u2019m just wondering why you think you still have got a shot at being competitive?","Paul J. Clancy ","The delineation we generally make is purchase accounting items are in our GAAP P&L but not in our non-GAAP P&L so that has been a practice. Essentially what we view as these upfronts and milestones are part in parcel to the business, they come in lumps as we saw in this quarter, as we\u2019ve seen in last quarter but it\u2019s essentially part and parcel to the business but we do make that kind of delineation. ","Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group","Did you make a cash payment to Fumaderm in the quarter?","Paul J. Clancy ","We did. It was a cash payment that was earned in the fourth quarter and paid out technically in the first quarter of 2014.","Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group","Do you have the amount?","Paul J. Clancy ","Gosh, off the top of my head I don\u2019t. I believe it was $25 million.","Douglas E. Williams","With respect to the base compound, we did very extensive diligence on the compound before we licensed it in and actually thought the profile was very favorable from a safety perspective with the caveat that there\u2019s still a ways to go on development to really understand that completely. I would say the same thing is true with both the Merck compound and the AZ compound, nobody has actually gotten there yet so the opportunity is still very much there. We like the profile of the compound. We also like the ability, potentially, if the compound is successful in the clinic to start thinking about combinations between the base inhibitor and one or both of our anti-beta amyloid antibodies or potentially the anti-tau antibodies. So, we\u2019re looking at this from sort of a portfolio approach in addition to just the individual compound which we like the profile as we saw it.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen & Company.","Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen & Company","I was a bit surprised that AVONEX is doing so well within the interferon class. What do you scribe that to? Is there some kind of beneficial franchise effect going on there with TECFIDERA? Then for Paul, was there also an R&D upfront to Sangamo in the quarter?","Tony Kingsley ","A very good question. I think the short answer is yes, I think TECFIDERA has probably taken disproportionally from the high dose high frequency interferon\u2019s relative to AVONEX. I think that makes sense when you take into account those tend to be more [switch two] products relative to AVONEX. So, if TECFIDERA gets in front of that switch I think you\u2019re seeing a positive manifest. But, I would also add with an increased focus on promotion we think we\u2019re putting some very good effort to see the continuation of the story behind AVONEX so a little of each.","Paul J. Clancy ","Eric, there was a Sangamo payment in the first quarter that was for $20 million, upfront payment. That was actually in our original press release with Sangamo. The Eisai, if you recall, the financial terms weren\u2019t disclosed until today just because of the partnership at the time.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Geoff Porges \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein.","Geoff Porges \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein","Just a follow up on first of all the Eisai, Paul could you confirm whether if the products are successful you will report the revenue or whether that will simply be a profit sharing that reports below the line? Then further to the $200 million that you allowed for BD activity, with what you\u2019ve spent in the first quarter should we assume there\u2019s only 50 to 80 left for the balance of the year? Then lastly, with your step up in your revenue guidance and keeping the expense guidance the same it certainly applies that your expenses are going to be higher than you previously anticipated. Is that the right way to look at it and should we be expecting this higher level of SG&A spend to be the baseline going forward?","Paul J. Clancy ","All good questions. With respect to the first part of the question, Eisai essentially is about $118 million of the $200 earmarked and so what is the balance is exactly as you noted and we obviously had an eye towards the Eisai deal when we set up the original guidance. We actually continue to work on business development transactions but I mean, quite frankly, the pipeline was far more advanced right before the Eisai transaction than it is right now. I think it\u2019s much closer to an earmark. I don\u2019t know if it will be 100, or 60, or 80, but we\u2019ll update people along the way as we go. ","The Eisai transaction is essentially a 50\/50 split with the exception of certain geographies that are really dependent on Eisai. Specifically, the Japan geography of whether or not they want to bring that into the collaboration or not. From a perspective of development 50\/50 with a respect from a commercialization and 50\/50 in terms of profits assuming one or two of the products get to market. We haven\u2019t yet determined who would be taking the lead on different geographies and I think at this point in time that would probably guide our revenue model. So, it\u2019s a little bit early to tell how the geography lands in the P&L but it is in essence a 50\/50.","Then you\u2019re last part of the question yes, I think you\u2019re right is that implicit is a little bit of increase. It\u2019s probably in the $30 million, $40 million, $50 million range for SG&A spending. We have consciously over the last 12 months in this year made the decision on SG&A spending not to be penny wise and pound foolish. We\u2019re kind of at an unprecedented period of time in what we\u2019ve gone through in 2013 in launching TECFIDERA in the US. We\u2019re very excited to be launching TECHFIDERA in Europe after a lot of hard work in the back end of the year and the same thing on hemophilia.","I think that what we\u2019re doing right now is making sure we really appropriately fund all these launches and as we move into 2015 we\u2019ll take a much more critical eye towards really trying to get SG&A leverage which we\u2019ve talked about. I can\u2019t really exactly tell you the amount at this point but we\u2019re going to be taking a much more critical eye. So, I think we pivot mentally from really thinking hard about making sure we fund these critical launches to kind of pivoting towards looking to making sure we\u2019re not over funding and over expensing on the items in the P&L.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Roden \u2013 UBS.","Matt Roden \u2013 UBS","Tony, you mentioned the five weeks of inventory for TECFIDERA, we understand that weekly demand is still growing but are we getting to the point in the launch in the US that we need to think about normalization of that inventory as we think ahead to second quarter and second half of the year? Then also, you guys have recently commented on the pricing approach for ALPROLIX which on a net basis looks to be about parity, just wondering if we should assume you\u2019ll adopt the same philosophy with ELOCTATE as well?","Paul J. Clancy ","I\u2019ll take the first part of that. I think that\u2019s overall correct is that we will probably likely see not as much increase in terms of inventory in the channel. We keep a watchful eye on that. We are a bit of a player in that but certainly what\u2019s most important is to make sure the specialty pharmacies have product for the patient and the wholesalers don\u2019t have any kind of excessive product. I think if you just look at the run rate I think there may be a little bit of upward inventory over the next few quarters but I think it certainly moderates in terms of the impact.","Tony Kingsley ","On the ALPROLIX pricing as you know, the math can get complicated but I think your read of the basic intent is right. No comment at this point how that might translate to [other CPD].","Operator","","Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham \u2013 JP Morgan.","","Geoff Meacham \u2013 JP Morgan","A high level question for you Tony, when you look at US TECFIDERA you\u2019ve obviously been in the market for the year, what types of MS patients are coming on today and how does that compare to when you launched? Then a question for Doug, I know it\u2019s tough on the LINGO opportunity to say specifically, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a lot of data out there, but how does a compromised blood\/brain barrier correlated to disease severity, or say progression, or say relapse frequency, things like that that try to correlate that outcome to the clinical benefit or worsening?","Tony Kingsley ","Look, I think the interesting thing is there\u2019s not a dramatic change in the [inaudible] and it speaks a little bit more to the start the product got off too. As I think we pointed out early days, we got a meaningful portion of newly diagnosed pretty much out of the gate and captured a nice portion of the switch pool at a broad level. I think those dynamics are still true today. There\u2019s probably a little shift in the switch pool in terms of the nature of what patients were getting and what reasons between tolerability and efficacy but it\u2019s actually a little bit more the same. ","The only other wrinkle I\u2019d add to it, which is interesting, is we think TECFIDERA is keeping people from leaving the market. The market has a group of people that quite therapy every year and a group of people that return, what our research suggests is that there are fewer patients who might have quit the market absent this alternative who are staying in the market and I think that\u2019s encouraging. ","Douglas E. Williams","As far as the LINGO question and the relationship with the blood\/brain barrier, what happens when there\u2019s a new lesion that develops, a relapse if you will, is that you get local breakdown of the blood\/brain barrier. That\u2019s because the release of all the inflammatory mediators that takes place locally. The point I was alluding to is that because of that localized impact on the blood\/brain barrier you\u2019re going to get a relatively higher concentration of the drug in those lesions at the time the barrier breaks down which is not to say that you\u2019re not going to get drug to other older lesions, that should happen as well and in fact, the Phase 1 data confirms that we are getting sufficient quantity of drug to match the sort of IC90 level in the animal models in patients with MS in their cerebral spinal fluid.","So, we know we\u2019re getting drug into the brain in quantities that sort of match up with what we saw to be efficacious in the animal models, but on a relative basis, just because of the physiology of the blood\/brain barrier with a new lesion, you\u2019ll get relatively more delivered locally to a new lesion. "," ","Operator","","Your next question comes from Terence Flynn \u2013 Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn \u2013 Goldman Sachs","First on just the top line raise, I was wondering if you can give us anymore color behind the drivers there? Is that solely TECFIDERA or anything else you\u2019re seeing? Then the kind of follow up question to Eric\u2019s on AVONEX\u2019s resiliency on the US, is there anything different on the European side that we should consider as we think about that franchise and its resiliency in Europe? ","Paul J. Clancy ","The color on the raise that I give you, and this is versus our expectations and our kind of original guidance, is around the buoyance seen in AVONEX and TECFIDERA. So, it isn\u2019t per say that we see a different forecast on TECFIDERA. I think the US in TECFIDERA is kind of marching along our expectations is really five to six weeks into Europe and to Germany. So it\u2019s a little early to call for that on TECFIDERA. But, what we have seen kind of just one quarter in is just AVONEX and TECFIDERA not being as impacted as much in the last 90 to 120 days.","Tony Kingsley ","On AVONEX the answer actually differs market-by-market. There are some markets where we have higher dose high frequency interferon have lower share, etc., so I think it\u2019s going to be the sum of Europe is the sum of a bunch of different parts. We believe similar to the US that AVONEX should do as well or better on a proportional basis as the injectables proportion of the market declines. Again, that will differ market-by-market on average, that remains our belief but we\u2019ll have to see as TECFIDERA rolls out across market-to-market what the individual impacts are.","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Matthew Harrison \u2013 Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Harrison \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Just two quick ones for me, one on TECFIDERA in Europe you told us you\u2019ve gotten reimbursement in Norway and Scotland and that you expect reimbursement in a bunch of other geographies. I was wondering if you might be willing to help us think about what those geographies are. Then second, on TYSABRI the sequential growth in the US looks when I looked over the last couple years, what you saw this quarter was actually the second worst and the first worst was sort of when TECFIDERA launched? So I\u2019m just wondering if you can help us in terms of units? I\u2019m just wondering if you can help us think about what was going on there and was it TECFIDERA driven or something else?","Tony Kingsley ","So we haven\u2019t laid out a very specific schedule of what sequence we think the countries will get reimbursement in. As you know, it\u2019s multiple independent events. We\u2019ve said a lot of these markets it\u2019s a kind of 12 to 18 month timeframe and the generalization is the northern European markets tend to move on a little faster pace, the southern European markets then move on a little slower pace. But we think towards the end of the year and around the turn of the year we\u2019ll start to see some meaningful reimbursement decisions if you look at where [inaudible] national reimbursement processes typically goes on a timeline.","Paul J. Clancy ","I would want to point out there\u2019s a little bit of noise in the last five quarters that you kind of see even on the graph in the earnings slide deck and what I\u2019d point out is in Q1 and Q2 of last year there was inventory movement that arose out of the transaction. So Q1 actually kind of moved revenue up by about $25 million or $26 million and as a result Q2 was depressed by that amount in the United States. I believe it\u2019s in one of the footnotes. ","Then, as it relates to Q1 2014 the one thing I would point out is that just the uniqueness of the way we ship TYSABRI, Q1 2014 actually had 12 shipping weeks versus all the prior quarters last year had 13 shipping weeks and it\u2019s just a function of we essentially ship on Tuesdays. It\u2019s essentially a function of the number of Tuesdays in a quarter so it\u2019s quite peculiar. ","Now, if you rise above all that, when we look at our patient data, when we look at our discontinuations, when we look at our patient adds we still believe there\u2019s still a fair amount of homework to get TYSABRI moving in the right direction but we believe those metrics are moving in the right direction. Discontinuations were meaningfully impacted through the second and third quarter last year as many patients moved to TECFIDERA but we\u2019re seeing discontinuations come back to a more normal level and we\u2019re seeing actually patient adds coming into the TYSABRI franchise that is solid performance.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Weber \u2013 Citi.","Yaron Weber \u2013 Citi","I\u2019ve got a couple of quick questions. One, Tony, just housekeeping we\u2019re hearing that the TECFIDERA drop out due to the typical GI is around 15% to 20%. I think it was around 10 initially, it sounds up it went up a little bit, is that what you\u2019re seeing? Then secondly, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s for Doug or for [inaudible], but it\u2019s a question on LINGO. When you\u2019re looking at your primary end point whether it\u2019s optic neuritis, the fore field [inaudible] potential or in MS where you\u2019re using this neurofunctional neurocongnitive decline or stability in three or more months. My question is how validated are these end points in terms of your ability to adequately power against the control arm? Just help me understand a little bit how validated have you been on the studies just so we really kind of understand what to expect?","Tony Kingsley ","The short answer to your question is I don\u2019t think we have any strong signal that GI is moving up or down. We\u2019re obviously monitoring that on a regular basis through a whole bunch of different data sources and no signal that there\u2019s a meaningful trend in one direction or the other.","Douglas E. Williams","With respect to the endpoints, I think the endpoints that we\u2019ve chosen to use are well validated endpoints. I mean, certainly not only visual [inaudible] potential, it gives you a hard number in terms of nerve conduction velocity but also the low contrast visual acuity endpoint in that study is one that\u2019s been used for other drugs for registrational purposes. So the endpoints I believe are hard. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve released the power calculation but suffice to say that these studies are large enough and well powered enough for us to feel comfortable about whether or not we will make a go no go decision based on the data that comes out. ","I should also point out that the other endpoint in the MS study is ESS progression as well so we\u2019re looking at well validated tried and true endpoints in these studies on the basis of which to make our decision to go to Phase 3.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Brian Abrahams \u2013 Wells Fargo.","Brian Abrahams \u2013 Wells Fargo","On the Alzheimer\u2019s front you\u2019re looking primarily at imaging endpoints with 037 and clinical endpoints with 2401 so I\u2019m wondering how do you put all that information together to determine which antibody to move forward with, in what population you might proceed. Then real quick, I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019re expecting any shifts in US reimbursement dynamics in the MS space given some of the concerns out there for pricing for other specialty drug classes? ","Douglas E. Williams","With respect to the two different antibodies in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, you\u2019re correct that there is a straight cognition endpoint with the Eisai molecule. We\u2019ve also built that in as exploratory endpoints in the BIIB037 study so the primary endpoint of the study is based on imaging as you point out but we\u2019ve also built in [FDG PET] as sort of the surrogate for improvement in synaptic activity. We consider that to be sort of a surrogate clinical endpoint but we\u2019re also looking at cognition and we hope to see a trend in cognition in that study as well. So, there are a number of endpoints that will help drive the decision making with respect to BIIB037 including both imaging and clinical endpoints as well.","Paul J. Clancy ","On the second part of your question I mean no real additional color to provide. Certainly, we\u2019re cognoscente that it could be a challenging environment. In multiple sclerosis the patient mix is kind of 80% private. At this point we\u2019re very comfortable with our formulary status so we\u2019ll just have to continue to see where the landscape takes us. ","Operator","","Your next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas \u2013 Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas \u2013 Deutsche Bank","The first question, on LINGO I know that it\u2019s a six month trial and I\u2019ve heard from some physicians that some patients can recover faster than that especially with steroids so what are your thoughts on whether or not you\u2019ll be able to see a difference between the treatment control arm giving the time element and how quickly LINGO might be able to act? The second question, what percentage of hemophilia treatments [inaudible] trial and what percentage of patients do you think would be the people who would switch first to new therapy?","Douglas E. Williams","With respect to LINGO, you\u2019re correct that there are some patients that do respond to steroid therapy and show an improvement. The natural history studies that have been done looking at the kinetics of that improvement were taking into account when we actually powered the study to hopefully see a treatment effect in LINGO versus placebo. So, remember this is a placebo control trial that is randomized. It is on top of standard of care and so we took the natural history data into account when we designed the study both in terms of duration and in terms of the design of the endpoints.","Paul J. Clancy ","On the trail question on hemo, we\u2019re a little bit searching each other for that answer so I don\u2019t think we have it handy but what I would point out is a couple of things. It was only about 120 or 125 patients and in fact, it was a worldwide trial and part of the rationale in a worldwide trial with the worldwide approval but also because we just needed to get to sites around the world in order to get to those patient numbers. Fundamentally we don\u2019t believe the gating issue on launch is going to be the dynamic that you\u2019re poking at. I think we just fundamentally believe that there\u2019s a big unmet need in the marketplace for longer acting factors and that will probably carry the weight. ","Operator","","Your next question comes from Ying Huang \u2013 Barclays Capital.","Ying Huang \u2013 Barclays Capital","First of all, we know that there\u2019s potential the FDA could approve a generic version of [COPAXONE] in May. I was wondering your thought on the impact on the pricing for the whole MS therapy class? Then secondly, on your collaboration with Eisai here for the [inaudible], it looks like there\u2019s encouraging [CFF beta level] lowering which is also [inaudible] but then how much faith do you have that there is a correlation between that and then the clinical endpoint in the trials? For example the [inaudible]?","Tony Kingsley ","We\u2019ve said before our expectation and our business plan does assume that there will be generic [COPAXONE] in the market this year. Obviously, there remains some uncertainty around that but we plan for it. Short term, we think the impact is on branded [COPAXONE] itself. We\u2019ve also said it adds pressure to the overall market over time because it becomes an additional option that payers can use but we think it\u2019s a very tough thing for payers to force a step out or switch to generic.","Douglas E. Williams","With respect to the base inhibitor, as far as the target itself there is some pretty strong genetic evidence that the enzyme itself is an important target in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. That\u2019s based on some recent data from an Icelandic cohort showing that patients who had a specific mutation in an around the [cleavage] site where the base one enzyme clips, those patients had about a 40% reduction in the amount of beta amyloid peptide that they produced and that was completely protective for those patients if they had that mutation even in the face of ApoE4, that was a protected mutation. So, 40% seems to be the target at least in terms of lifelong inhibition of the enzyme. The [inaudible] data from Phase 1 shows that you can dose escalate the compound and get to levels of inhibition sort of north of 90% at safe doses.","So, we think that we have a compound that\u2019s capable of blocking the enzyme at levels that are sufficient to be meaningful and with respect to the ADAS-cog endpoint it is an accepted endpoint for clinical trials and we think it\u2019s probably the most sensitive and most validated measure to use for these studies. The target is good, the endpoint is good and appropriate and we\u2019ll wait to see the data.","Operator","","I will now turn the conference back over to our presenters.","George A.

We will do this instead of publishing press releases related to future earnings calls, earnings releases, and Investor Events via Newswire services. Our Twitter handle is @biogen.","Now I will turn the call over to Michel.","Michel Vounatsos","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.","First, let me begin with some financial highlights. Compared to the same period a year ago, Biogen's second quarter revenues grew 9% to record $3.4 billion, second quarter GAAP earnings per share grew 3% to $4.18 and non-GAAP EPS grew 15% to $5.80. Our performance for the second quarter was strong and we are raising our full year revenue guidance.","Now let me review the accomplishments we delivered in the second quarter. First, our MS core business including OCREVUS royalties delivered revenues of $2.3 billion, a decrease of 2% versus prior year, adjusting for inventory dynamics with the global MS revenues were stable versus prior year. The number of patients on our MS products globally remained stable versus the prior year as patient growth outside of the U.S. offset increased competition within the U.S. We were pleased to see that new patient starts for TECFIDERA in the U.S. in the second quarter were at the highest level since the launch of OCREVUS just over a year ago.","Outside the U.S., we continued our strong progress in several international markets such as Japan were close to half of MS patients are now treated with the Biogen products.","Second, SPINRAZA global revenues grew to $423 million, driven by quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year revenue growth in the U.S. and even greater revenue growth outside the U.S. The number of commercial patients on SPINRAZA increased by approximately 28% from last quarter and we now have over 5,000 patients on SPINRAZA, including the expanded access program and clinical trials.","In the U.S., we encouraged by the progress we are making with adults, as the number of adult patients on SPINRAZA grew by over 20% compared to last quarter. We remain focused on increasing our reach with adults by supporting the establishment of adult treatment sites, working to broaden our reimbursement coverage and communicating the potential value of SPINRAZA for this patient population.","Outside the U.S., the pace of reimbursement for SPINRAZA across multiple geographies lead to meaningful revenue growth with significant revenue contribution not just from Europe but also from Asia-Pac and Latin America. We expect the launch of SPINRAZA to continue expanding globally throughout 2018 and 2019. We have filed for regulatory approval in 7 additional countries including China, and we expect to file in up to 4 more countries by the end of the year. We also seek a formal reimbursement in seven additional countries and now have formal reimbursement in 24 markets.","Third, we made significant progress advancing our differentiated neuroscience pipeline, a critical source of potential future value generation for Biogen. We entered into an exclusive option agreement to acquire TMS-007, a Phase 2 compound being developed for acute ischemic stroke, which we discussed in detail during our webcast on June 28.","Today, we also announced we acquired an early stage program from AliveGen for muscle enhancement, which will initially be studying SMA and has the potential to benefit patients across a board range of neuromuscular diseases, including ALS.","In line with our expectation, this month, we completed enrollment of both ENGAGE and EMERGE, our two Phase 3 trials, studying our investigational treatment aducanumab in early Alzheimer\u2019s disease. And in May, we exercised our option with Neurimmune to further reduce the royalty rates payable on potential future sales of aducanumab.","Along with our collaboration partner Eisai, we announced positive top-line results of the final analysis of the Phase 2 study of BAN2401. We believe these results provide evidence to further support beta amyloid as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer\u2019s disease.","Importantly, our cash generation remained very strong and continue provide us with significantly optionality and flexibility to allocate capital. In addition to the two BD deals I discussed earlier, during the second quarter, we repurchased $2.75 billion worth of shares. We exercised our option to increase our ownership of Samsung Bioepis for approximately 49.9% and will pay approximately $700 million for these option shares.","We believe our share of Samsung Bioepis is worth significantly more. And we believe this investment is aligned with our goal of creating meaningful value for our shareholders. And we invested $1 billion in a new collaboration agreement with Ionis, which capitalizes on Biogen\u2019s expertise in neuroscience, R&D and Ionis\u2019 leadership in antisense oligonucleotides with a goal of meaningfully expanding our neuroscience pipeline.","As we have demonstrated in the past, we are committed to maximizing returns for our shareholders while continuing to bringing variety therapies to patients, something that demands a thoughtful approach towards all our investment over both the short and the long-term.","As we aim to continue allocating capital to expand our pipeline, this quarter we hired Daniel Karp as EVP, Corporate Development. We look forward to the contribution Daniel will make as we continue to refine our corporate strategy and evaluate new opportunities for potential business development and M&A.","In summary, Biogen executed on strategy and continued to deliver noticeable progress. Our core MS business demonstrated resilience. We continue to believe there is significant growth potential for SPINRAZA and we encouraged by a recent progress in reaching adults and expanding market access globally.","We enhanced our pipeline with addition of two more assets as we aim to diversify our neuroscience R&D portfolio and build decks in our core and emerging growth areas. We completed Phase 3 enrollments for aducanumab, which we believe is one of the most promising investigational therapy for Alzheimer\u2019s disease.","Together with Eisai, we announced positive top-line results for BAN2401, which we believe provides further support for the Amyloid Hypothesis. We have made progress implementing a leaner and simpler operating model designed for the future. And we strategically allocate capital as we invest to develop and expand our neuroscience portfolio again with the goal of maximizing shareholders return and bringing innovative therapies to patients.","I will now turn the call over to Mike for a more detailed update on our recent progress in R&D.","Michael Ehlers","Thank you, Michel, and good morning to everyone on the phone. This is a very exciting time for Biogen R&D as we have made meaningful advances across our industry-leading Alzheimer's portfolio, added two new clinical stage assets and continued to progress our broader neuroscience pipeline.","Let me review the progress we made across our core and emerging growth areas. I'll start with the significant advances we made in Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Earlier this month, along with our collaboration partner Eisai, we announced positive top-line results from the final 18-month analysis of the Phase 2 study of BAN2401, a beta amyloid antibody being studied in early Alzheimer's disease, including subject with mild cognitive impairment due to AD and a subset of mild AD.","Based on data from 856 patients, this study demonstrated both the potential disease modifying effect on clinical function and beta amyloid lowering in the brain. Specifically, the study demonstrated the dose dependent reduction in beta amyloid in the brain as measured using amyloid pet as well as a concompetent dose dependent slowing of the rate of clinical progression as measured by the Alzheimer's disease composite score or adcoms a novel endpoint which incorporates elements of validated measures including ADAS-Cog, CDR Sum of Boxes and the Mini-Mental State Examination.","While the study did not achieve its primary outcome measure at 12-months based on a Bayesian statistical analysis using conventional frequentist statistics, the highest treatment dose of BAN2401, 10 milligrams per kilograms by weekly showed a statistically significant effect on Adcoms as early as 6 months and also 12 months and 18 months. These new data provide compelling evidence for further support blocking or clearing beta amyloid as a therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease.","In this study, BAN2401 demonstrated an acceptable tolerability profile through 18 months. The most common treatment emerging adverse effects were infusion reactions and Amyloid Related Imaging Abnormalities or ARIA. These results will be presented by Eisai in an oral section at the 2018 Alzheimer's Association International Conference tomorrow July 25th, at 3:30 p.m. Central Time in Chicago. A live webcast of the presentation is expected to be available.","In addition to BAN2401, we continued to advance aducanumab, a distinct antibody that binds the both soluble and insoluble aggregated forms of beta amyloid, including oligomers, protofibrils and fibrils. Aducanumab demonstrated significant plaque removal as well as slowing of cognitive decline in the Phase 1b PRIME study. Both Phase 3 studies were aducanumab, ENGAGE and EMERGE are now fully enrolled.","Eisai also reported Phase 2 data for elenbecestat, a base inhibitor designed to reduce the production of beta amyloid. Elenbecestat demonstrated an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in this 70-patient study, and the results demonstrated a statistically significant difference in beta amyloid levels in the brain as measured by amyloid-PET. A numerical slowing of decline in functional clinical scales is also observed although this effect was not statistically significant. Elenbecestat is currently being evaluated in two Phase 3 studies.","Beyond beta amyloid, we are advancing a number of assets targeting tau, which we believe plays an important and complementary role in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Specifically, in the second quarter, we dosed the first patient in the Phase 2 Alzheimer\u2019s disease trial of BIIB092, the anti-tau antibody we licensed from BMS last year.","Turning to MS and neuroimmunology. We previously communicated data regarding the potential impact of extended interval dosing on reducing the risk of PML for TYSABRI. We have now finalized plans for worldwide prospective study to evaluate whether extended interval dosing provides a similar level of effectiveness to standard dosing. We believe this study will provide sufficient data to inform clinical practice and we plan to initiate the study by the end of the year.","Further, in collaboration with Alkermes, we continue to advance BIIB098 or diroximel fumarate as a novel oral fumarate in Phase 3 development for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis where we aim to provide a differentiated GI tolerability profile.","This quarter, we received data from the ongoing open-label long-term safety study that will be included as part of the new drug application to support registration. Safe data were consistent with what has been presented at prior scientific meetings and includes results from approximately 700 patients of which roughly 500 were treated for at least one year. Alkermes expects to file with the FDA by the end of the year.","In parallel, we continue to enroll the EVOLVE-MS-2 head-to-head tolerability study versus TECFIDERA with data expected in the first half of 2019. This study is employing an adaptive trial design in which results from Part A are used to inform Part B. We are committed to expanding our leadership position in multiple sclerosis and we believe this new generation fumarate is an important part of our strategy.","Turning to our progress in movement disorders. We are actively recruiting a Phase 2 study of our anti-tau antibody BIIB092 and progressive Supranuclear Palsy or PSP. BIIB092 is a potent selected anti-tau antibody that has demonstrated reductions in CSF pre-tau levels of over 90%. We expect to complete enrollment in this 52 week study in the coming months. The primary endpoints are efficacy as assessed by the PSP rating scale, a zero to 100 measure of disability across six domains as well as safety.","If the data from this Phase 2 study are positive, we believe there is a potential it could be registrational and could thereby possibly support a regulatory filing.","Moving to neuromuscular disorders, including spinal muscular atrophy. We continue to build on the growing body of clinical evidence for SPINRAZA as the standard-of-care in SMA. Earlier this month, at the International Congress on Neuromuscular Diseases, we've presented a new analysis of Type 3 SMA patients initially enrolled in the CS2 study between the ages of 11 and 14 followed by its open-label extension study. Of the 11 patients included in this analysis, 10 demonstrated stabilization or clinically meaningful improvement in motor function as compared to the decline over time expected based on natural history.","As we aim to bolster our leadership position in SMA, we are pursuing new therapies across multiple modalities. To that end, as Michel mentioned, today we are pleased to announce the acquisition of two programs from AliveGen targeting the myostatin pathway for potential muscle enhancement across a range of neuromuscular diseases, including SMA. ","Myostatin is a widely studied negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass that signals to ActRIIA and ActRIIB receptors. ALG-801, now known as BIIB110, and it's backup compound ALG-802 are subtle hybrids of the ActRIIA and ActRIIB receptors and act as ligand in Fabs to inhibit myostatin as well as other muscle suppressing ActRIIA, IIB ligands, including activin A and activin B.","Recent research has indicated that inhibiting both myostatin and activins maybe necessary to maximize clinical efficacy. However, previous approaches to simultaneously inhibit these ligands have resulted in an addition of BMP9, a related growth factor involved in both vascular and bone homeostasis, who's in addition increases the risk for vascular related toxicity. AliveGen is carefully designed BIIB110 with the aim of spearing BMP9 was sequestering the muscle inhibiting factors myostatin and activins A B conferring the potential for both greater efficacy and improved safety compared to other compounds in the class.","Preclinical data for BIIB110 have demonstrated compelling increases in muscle mass as well as improvements in bone density, which we believe make further differentiate the asset. BIIB110 is currently in the Phase 1a study in healthy volunteers. We believe there is a broad opportunity for BIIB110 with an initial focus on development as an add gene therapy for SMA but with potential applicability for other rare diseases such as ALS and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease or more prevalent condition such as Sarcopenia. Development in SMA, in particular, has the potential for complementary benefit when used in combination with the disease modifying therapy such as SPINRAZA.","As previously communicated, we have been working to advance our SMA gene therapy program in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania. We were recently informed that the FDA has placed our IND on clinical hold. We believe we have a path forward and we are working to lift the hold as quickly as possible. We are not able to provide details or updated timing, but we intend to bring the program to the clinic as soon as possible.","Moving to acute neurology, we have now begun initiating sites in the Phase 3 CHARM study of BIIB93, our first-in-class IV glibenclamide therapeutic targeting brain edema and large hemisphere infarction. And as Michel mentioned, during the second quarter, we also entered into an option agreement for TMS-007, which is the potential best-in-class thrombolytic drug candid currently in Phase 2 in Japan. Due to its highly targeted mechanism of action, we believe TMS-007 may have several important benefits compared to the current standard of care of Tissue Plasminogen activator or TPA, including a potentially longer treatment window and lower bleeding risk. I encourage you to review our recent webcast from June 28 for more details on BIIB93, TMS-007 and our overall strategy to target stroke.","Overall, we have made significant progress advancing our pipeline, including encouraging new data on Alzheimer's disease, continued new additions to our pipeline and strong execution across our clinical programs. Since the beginning of 2017, we have meaningfully expanded our pipeline by adding our advance in 14 clinical stage programs. We are building our pipeline with the goal of being the leader in neuroscience. We see compelling evidence. This is just the beginning of a period of transformative breakthroughs in the treatment of neurological diseases, we are positioning Biogen to take full advantage of the innovation and progress that we anticipate will continue to occur in neuroscience.","And with that, I will now pass the call to Jeff.","Jeff Capello","Thanks, Mike, good morning, everyone. I'll now review our financial performance for the second quarter of 2018 starting with revenues. Total revenues in the second quarter were $3.4 billion, growing 9% year-over-year.","Let me now provide more detail on our MS franchise revenues. Overall, our MS business delivered revenues of $2.3 billion in Q2, 2018, including OCREVUS royalties of approximately $113 million. MS revenues in Q2 '18 were down 6% versus prior year, but OCREVUS royalties were down 2% including OCREVUS royalties. Total ex-U.S. MS product revenues benefitted by approximately $42 million versus the prior year due to changes in foreign exchange rates net of hedging.","Global second quarter TECFIDERA revenues were $1.1 billion, a 2% decrease versus the prior year. And this include the revenues of US$826 million, a decrease of 6% versus Q2 '17 and $261 million outside the U.S., an increase of 11% versus the second quarter 2017. In the U.S., we saw an inventory drawdown of approximately $35 million. We also believe we experienced the final quarter of difficult comparisons due to the timing of the OCREVUS launch. Both of these factors weigh on our U.S. TECFIDERA performance for the second quarter.","We continue to see stabilization share of old prescriptions and growth in TECFIDERA share of new prescriptions, building on the capable trends we saw in the first quarter of 2018. New patient starts with TECFIDERA in U.S. in Q2 '18 were at the highest level since the launch of OCREVUS, just over a year ago.","In addition, we were very pleased with TECFIDERA outside the U.S., driven by strong year-over-year patient growth across each large routine market, solid emerging market growth and particularly strong performance in Japan where TECFIDERA has now reached over 25% market share. For the balance of the year, we expect continued patient growth for TECFIDERA outside the U.S. though we are closing monitoring some evolving pricing pressure in certain European markets.","Ex-U.S. TECFIDERA revenues benefited by approximately $17 million versus the prior year due to changes in foreign exchange rates net of hedging. TYSABRI worldwide revenues were $467 million this quarter, a decrease of 6% versus the second quarter of 2017. This included $266 million in the U.S. and $202 million outside the U.S.","In the U.S., revenues declined 8% versus the prior year, primarily due to the launch of OCREVUS. We are encouraged that this was a second straight quarter of stable U.S. volumes for TYSABRI as we saw stability in TYSABRI share of both new prescriptions and total prescriptions. Outside the U.S., TYSABRI revenues decreased 2% versus prior year.","TYSABRI patients increased in all major European markets versus the prior year along with strong double-digit patient growth in the emerging markets. Ex-U.S., TYSABRI revenues this quarter benefited by approximately $12 million versus the prior year due to changes in foreign exchange rates, net of hedging.","Interferon revenues including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY were $626 million during the second quarter, a decrease of 9% versus Q2, 2017. This included $445 million in U.S. and $181 million in sales outside the U.S. In the U.S., we saw a decrease of Interferon inventory of approximately $10 million in Q2, 2018. Ex-U.S. Interferon revenues benefited by approximately $12 million versus the prior year due to changes in foreign exchange rates, net of hedging.","Overall, U.S. MS performance versus prior year was impacted by both the launch of OCREVUS and channel dynamics. We expect both factors to be less significant on a year-over-year basis as we move throughout the year with the potential benefit if there is channel build again in the second half of this year.","Given the trends we see, combined with the anniversary of the OCREVUS launch, we expect second half 2018 worldwide MS product revenue to be stable when compared on a year-over-year basis.","Let me now move to SPINRAZA. Global second quarter SPINRAZA revenues were $423 million. This included revenues of $206 million in U.S., representing 10% growth compared to the first quarter and $217 million outside the U.S., representing 23% growth compared to Q1. This is the first quarter where revenues outside the U.S. exceeded revenues in U.S.","The number of patients on therapy in the U.S. increased by over 10% as compared to the end of the first quarter, including a greater than 20% increase in the number of adults on therapy as we continue to make progress in reaching adults in the U.S.","We saw continued increase in the revenue contributions for maintenance doses this quarter. In U.S., approximately 55% of SPINRAZA revenues in the second quarter were attributed to maintenance doses as compared to approximately 40% in the first quarter. In the second quarter, the average doses per patient was approximately 1.1 roughly the same as in Q1. ","In the second quarter, approximately 15% of U.S. SPINRAZA units were dispensed through our pre-drug program, a decrease from approximately 20% in Q1. As some patients enter the second year on therapy, we have benefited from proven insurance coverage we have today versus a year ago, allowing some patients to transition from pre to commercial product. We believe both inventory levels and dispensing allowances for SPINRAZA were relatively flat in the second quarter versus Q1.","We continue to believe there is a significant opportunity in adults in the U.S. and we are very encouraged by the progress we're making. We estimate we now have reached approximately 50% of all infants, 50% of pediatric patients and 10% of adults. Of note, our data indicates that approximately 5% of the prevalent SME population of infants, 35% are pediatric patients and 60% are adults, highlighting the large number of untreated adult patients that we believe could benefit from SPINRAZA.","Assuming a similar free drug percentage and continued progress in reaching adults, we expect to show continued stability in U.S. SPINRAZA revenues compared to the second quarter of 2018. Outside the U.S., the number of commercial SPINRAZA patients increased almost 50% versus the prior quarter, and there are still approximately 300 patients active in these standard access programs.","We've recorded revenue from over 25 international markets with approximately 75% of ex-U.S. SPINRAZA revenues in the second quarter coming from Germany, Italy, Japan, Turkey, Brazil, Spain and Australia. We continue to believe that the international opportunity for SPINRAZA is even greater than in the U.S. as we continued the momentum of new country launches, and we believe there is significant ex-U.S. opportunity, not just in Europe but also in Asia-Pacific and Latin American markets.","Let me now move on to our biosimilars business, which generated $127 million in revenue this quarter, a 40% increase versus the prior year. We estimate that more than 90,000 patients in Europe are currently receiving Biogen biosimilars. BENEPALI continues to be the market leader in countries such as UK, Denmark and Norway and we estimate BENEPALI market share of approximately 40% across all major launch markets. FLIXABI units grew 48% versus the prior quarter led by Germany, Italy and France where we estimate market share to now exceed 10%.","As more competitors enter the anti-TNF biosimilar market, we believe the continuity of our global supply chain may accrue to be a competitive advantage. We aimed to maintain a 100% uninterrupted supply, and we have delivered nearly 5 million doses since launch without an interruption.","Looking forward, we expect growth to moderate in the second half of this year as volume growth is offset by pricing pressure. But we expect to be well positioned in 2019 with the expected launch of IMRALDI in October this year. We estimate that the originaire product HUMIRA as annual revenues of approximately $4 billion in Europe, representing a large potential market for biosimilars.","Last month we exercised our option to purchase additional shares of Samsung Biopis, our joint venture with Samsung Biologics. We will pay Samsung Biologics approximately $700 million to increase our ownership share in Samsung Biopis to approximately 49.9%. We believe the intrinsic value of this additional equity is significantly greater than our expected payment. This transaction is subject to certain regulatory conditions as they expected to close in the second half of 2018, at which point we've been anticipate that we will begin to report our shares and net profits and losses of the JV below the operating line.","Turning to anti-CD20 revenues, we reported $490 million in Q2, an increase of 23% versus prior year, primarily driven by OCREVUS royalties. This includes our estimated OCREVUS royalties of $113 million for the second quarter.","Total other revenues were $109 million in second quarter more than doubling versus Q2 '17 as we continue to benefit from greater contract manufacturing. Although the timing can be difficult to predict for the third and fourth quarter, we expect roughly similar contribution from other revenues compared to the second quarter.","Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were 87%, a slight improvement versus Q1, due to lower contract manufacturing. Q2 GAAP R&D expense was 29% of revenue or $981 million. Q2 non-GAAP R&D expense was 24% of revenue or $819 million. Both GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense include $324 million out of the $375 million upfront payment to Ionis, with the remaining $51 million capitalized as prepaid R&D, which will be amortized into the P&L over the life of the agreement.","GAAP R&D expense also included $162 million comprised of the equity premium of approximately $94 million as well as a discount of approximately $68 million to reflect the effect of certain holding period restrictions, which will be amortized into the P&L for the next couple of years. The remaining $463 million, which is the difference between the fair market side of our investment in Ionis upon deal closing and the discount was reported as an investment and will be mark-to-market each quarter as a GAAP only expense.","Q2 GAAP SG&A was 15% of revenue or $516 million. Q2 non-GAAP SG&A was also 15% of revenue at $512 million. GAAP and other net expense, which includes interest of $35 million, in the second quarter versus $69 million in second quarter of last year. Non-GAAP other net expense was $40 million in Q2 versus $69 million in Q2 of last year.","In Q2, our GAAP tax rate was approximately 22% and our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 21%. Our weighted average diluted share count for Q2 was approximately 207 million shares and we finished the quarter with 201 million shares outstanding. We repurchased approximately 9.6 million shares in Q2 at an average price of $206 -- $286, excuse me, for a total value of $2.75 billion completing our previously announced $5 billion share repurchase authorization, which now brings us to our diluted earnings per share.","In the second quarter, we booked GAAP earnings per share of $4.18 per share, an increase of 3% versus last year, and non-GAAP earnings of $5.80 per share, an increase of 15% versus last year.","We generated approximately $1.1 billion in net cash flows from operations in Q2, which is impacted by approximately $537 million due to the Ionis collaboration agreement. We ended the quarter with approximately $4.4 billion in cash and marketable securities and $5.9 billion in debt. We believe we have and we will continue to have ample capacity to execute meaningful future business development, M&A activity, as well as return capital to shareholders. We will continue to be disciplined in our approach and focused on value creation.","Let me now turn to our updated full year guidance for 2018. We expect revenues of approximately $13 billion to $13.2 billion, which will represent year-over-year growth of approximately 6% to 7.5%. The low end of our guidance reflects emerging potential risk to our MS business in Europe including pricing pressure as well as uncertainty in channel inventory levels in US. We expect gross margin as a percentage of sales to be consistent with Q2 2018.","As a result of business development transactions in the first half of the year, we now anticipate GAAP R&D expense between 19% and 20% of sales and non-GAAP R&D expense between 18% and 19% of sales. Of note, guidance does not include any impact from potential acquisitions or large business development transactions as both are hard to predict.","We continue to expect SG&A expense to be approximately 15% to 16% of revenues. We anticipate our GAAP tax rate for 2018 to be between 21.5% and 22.5% and our non-GAAP tax rate to be between 20.5% and 21.5%. This reflects both the anticipated benefit of the U.S. corporate tax reform as well as the tax impact of the business development activities that's occurred so far in 2018. We anticipate full year GAAP diluted EPS of $21.80 to $22.40 for 2018, representing growth of 83% to 87% versus 2017, and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be $24.90 to $25.50, representing growth of 14% to 17%.","I'll now turn the call back over to Michel for his closing comments.","Michael Ehlers","Thank you, Jeff. We closed the second quarter with the record quarterly revenues, double digit non-GAAP earnings growth and increase for full year revenue guidance and exciting progress across our pipeline. Consistent with our strategic priorities, we're allocated capital to both invest for future growth and opportunistically return capital to shareholders. We do not intend to pause or slowdown here. We believe there will be plenty more exciting opportunities for Biogen as we move into the second half of the year.","Looking forward, within the next 12 months, we expect further progress across our neuroscience pipeline, including Eisai's presentation of the BAN2104 data tomorrow and assessing next steps, dosing the first patient in our Phase 3 studies in stroke and hepatic pain; data readouts across MS, Alzheimer's, neuropathic pain, ophthalmology and ALS, and filing for regulatory approval in the U.S. for BIIB98 in MS.","As Mike noted earlier, we continue to see compelling evidence across the neuroscience landscape that leads us to believe we are at the beginning of a period of transformative breakthroughs in the treatment of neurological diseases. We believe we are uniquely positioned to benefit from these potential breakthroughs and Biogen's goals is to be the long term leader in neuroscience as we believe it will become one of the most promising symmetric areas of investment for biopharma and growth investors.","To deliver on our aspiration, we remain focused on executing well on our strategic priorities to fortify our core business in MS and SMA and allocate capital to expand and progress our neuroscience pipeline.","Finally, I want to iterate our commitment to maximizing returns to our shareholders and bringing innovative therapies to patients over the long term. These demands that we continue to capital efficiently, effectively and appropriately, as we have demonstrated in the past, we will always strive to have an optimal capital structure as well as aimed for superior returns from the investments we make.","Once again, I would like to thank our employees around the world who are dedicated to making a positive impact on patients' lives and all other physicians, caregivers and participants in our clinical development programs. Our past and future achievements could not be realized without their passion and commitment.","With that, we'll open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Umer Raffat","Hi, thanks so much for taking our questions. I wanted to focus on BAN2401. And I didn't want to ask any questions on the data. We'll find it all tomorrow and we can discuss it. But instead to help us prepare, my question was, some clarity on trial design, so we\u2019re all on the same page going into it. And my question is this, was there -- so beyond the Bayesian stats, I am going to focus specifically on the traditional stats, was there a stat hierarchy? And if not, was there a multiplicity adjustment? And if that\u2019s the case, what\u2019s the statistical significance threshold we should be pegging most of the results to? I think that\u2019s really what I am trying to get clarity on. How many cuts of the data were there that we should end? And what\u2019s the P value of threshold we should be pegging all the results to? Thank you very much.","Al Sandrock","Hi, Umer. This is Al Sandrock. So we look forward to seeing the results tomorrow presented by Eisai, my colleague at Eisai, Dr. Kramer. So look, there was a single primary endpoint and the primary endpoint was a Bayesian analysis of 12 months where they were looking for the threshold was an 80% probability of seeing a 25% treatment effect. That\u2019s the primary endpoint. There were a number of secondary endpoints that were pre-specified and that\u2019s -- and Dr. Kramer, I believe, has a plan to present those pre-specified secondary endpoints. I hope that answers your question.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Cory Kasimov","I wanted to also ask a question on just the Alzheimer\u2019s kind of portfolio overall. And with the understanding, as Umer said, the 2401 data is tomorrow and you limit to what you can say on the data, I am curious on a broader level. How you see the key or what you see the key elements of read through from 2401 over to aducanumab? How much of these results impact your confidence on the ongoing studies there that you\u2019ve just completed enrollment in? Thanks.","Al Sandrock","Yes, Cory. Thanks. This is Al again. First I want to point some of the similarities between BAN2401 and adu. They both bind tightly to soluble oligomers as well as insoluble fibrils of Abeta. Protofibrils is just a type of soluble oligomer and thus both antibodies bind tightly to it. Neither antibody binds very well to monomers of Abeta. So they are both selective for aggregated forms of Abeta. Both antibodies bind to the end terminal portion of the Abeta peptide. And we believe that the linear epitopes are very, very similar. So they bind at very similar places on Abeta. But based on x-ray crystallography studies that we\u2019ve been doing lately, is that they bind in a different way because they are different antibodies? In the human trials, as we\u2019ve noted on the top-line, both antibodies clear amyloid plaques as seen on PET scans in a dose dependent manner, as Mike said this morning. And in human trials, both antibodies seem to slow the progression of cognitive decline at the highest dose. So you can see that there a lot of similarities. And so, we continue to believe that what we are doing right now in terms of these two large Phase 3 trials of aducanumab where we use an antibody that selectively targets aggregated forms of Abeta in the right patients is the right approach. And we think it\u2019s the most promising approach right now as we try to find the first disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer\u2019s.","Michael Ehlers","And Cory, this is Mike. I think Al summarized it very well. The only thing I might add to that is, we always started going into this trial in terms of the read through to aducanumab, would be the relationship between brain amyloid lowering and slowing of cognitive decline. And what we\u2019ve reported together with Eisai, and the top-line was that there was and observed both a reduction in brain amyloid by PET and the slowing in the cognitive decline. And that's what we were looking to in terms of the potential read through to Opicinumab.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ying Huang","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I have one question on BAN2401 data as well. Given that the trial missed the primary endpoint, but here maybe the key secondary point. Is it possible you could potentially file this data set with the FDA? Or this trial could potentially be a pivotal trial for registration purpose? And then, secondly maybe for Mike and Al. What's your thought on the Roche RO drug data in the SMA? I know you guys shifting that to $1 billion in the Ionis collaboration. But would you consider developing RO modality for SMA? Thank you.","Al Sandrock","Hi, Ying it's Al again, on the BAN2401. Look our next steps are to talk to FDA and other regulators. We'll see what they say. And I think it's too early to speculate as to whether or not we can file with this.","Michel Vounatsos","Yes, Ying, I'll take the question on the Roche PTC oral. I mean first, the comment relative to our broader deal with Ionis. I would say, of course, this oral while it really pretends to one specific target SM displacing and our broad collaboration with Ionis will be across many, many targets in many different mechanisms. So it's particularly related to the broader Ionis collaboration, I would say. But in terms of SMA, we're very interested to continue to seeing the data that Roche and PTC are reporting around their oral. So it's early days, but we've always said from the beginning that we welcome additional modalities. We think that there is going to be a roll in the future where there are multiple options for patients with SMA whether it's SPINRAZA whether it's potential gene therapies we're seeing where there are oral spice moderators. And these kind of combinatorial effects or complementary effects of different mechanism are things that we're actively exploring.","Al Sandrock","And I just want to remind everyone, we have a lot of people in queue. So we would really appreciate if you limit to one question each. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Matthew Harrison","I will not ask a BAN2401 question. I was hoping maybe you could just comment, you mentioned the couple of times and I think when you talked about guidance for the rest of the year. You talked about 2A stability for MS, but you also pointed the EU pricing pressure. Could you just expand upon what's happening in the EU? And what are the risks and the timelines for that playing out? Thanks.","Jeff Capello","Thanks, Matt. It's Jeff. So let me two parts to that question, one is the stability. One of the things we're looking forward to is and as we entered the back half of this year, as we now had a period in U.S. from an MS perspective, we're now up against the comparable period where we had OCREVUS in the market. So that's filled in terms of volumes where we're directed at kind of add equation. So we feel good about that in terms of our potential to kind of the stable in the U.S.","Outside the U.S. the volumes have been growing pretty well, outside of Interferon, so we believe that that will continue. The challenges of each European market is different and our pricing pressures. And we'll have to kind of work our way with those certain countries that are little bit more aggressive than others. So we'll have to kind of work through that as we work way to the back half of the year.","Al Sandrock","So let me add to the Jeff's comments, there is nothing new in the EU. We\u2019ve seen and we\u2019ve been facing year-after-year this type of pressure on price. The good news is that revenues growing strong and according to what we did plan. And in some major countries we have conventions and we have some timeline where we need to meet back with the authorities, regulators based on drug optimization and prices being negotiated. But it\u2019s too early to speculate, but nothing new from the European settings. It\u2019s a constant, I would say, engagement with regulators. The important element is that the underlying demand is going well mostly for the key products.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Geoffrey Porges","Thank you very much and congratulations on all the progress. Unfortunately back to BAN2401 and, perhaps Michel if you could give us a sense of Biogen's current corporate spends. At this stage, are you willing to commit to another Alzheimer\u2019s pivotal trial program and then perhaps if you could give us some view or insights on whether another pivotal would have to be of the same size and scale as the aducanumab pivotal trials? And if so, when we might hear about such a development plan? Thanks.","Michel Vounatsos","Thanks for the great question. That maybe little bit too early for us to answer. As you can anticipate we are encouraged by the news. We look forward to the presentation tomorrow. We are engaging very closely with our partners at Eisai. This later data lands well on the amyloid opportunities. This reinforces aducanumab we believe so. So we need to reconvene. We are well positioned with our portfolio that is already large. We believe as many of you that it\u2019s not one single treatment that will treat all the patients at all the stages. So we need to envision new studies, including potentially combination therapies or sequential therapies to best answer the unmet medical need. But again, too early to be precise on what we have to do. Clearly that is an investment case.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Michael Yee","Thanks for the question and congrats again on the BAN data. I guess, just to clarify some earlier comments about the next steps. Is it fair to say that you would want to seek to aggressively file or that the goal is clearly to start more trials in different patient populations. I guess what are the scenarios and more importantly I guess what\u2019s the timing of all this to get some more clarity of the industry? Thanks so much.","Al Sandrock","Hi, Michael, it\u2019s Al again. Yes, well, look, we can get a meeting with FDA pretty quickly, I believe. And I think we\u2019ll have to see what they say. A whole variety of options are available -- potentially available to us and we\u2019ll do the best I think that we can for AD patients who need a disease modifying therapy approved as soon as possible. In terms of the size and scale we'll have to do next, that will all be based on what these conversations say with respect to regulatory authorities, not just in the U.S., but also across the world.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Geoff Meacham","Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Another one on 2401. Obviously, we'll learn a lot more on the data tomorrow. But can you speak out for the ADCOMs a bit more, what\u2019s the regulatory view of it? What validation has been done? And then what animal studies have already been completed? I'm just thinking preclinical toxicity, things like that. Thank you.","Al Sandrock","Well, obviously, preclinical studies extensive ones were done in order to allow us to enroll -- both companies to enroll patients into fairly large trials even this Phase 2 trial with BAN2401 had more than 800 patients, so clearly a full and adequate preclinical package was done.","In terms of, sorry, I forgot the first part of your question Jeff. Oh the ADCOMs, yeah the ADCOMs. So the ADCOMs is a composite of three already well validated endpoints, the CDR Sum of Boxes, the ADAS-Cog and the NMFC. It chooses elements of -- it actually uses all of the CDR Sum of Boxes, which is about 60% of the composite endpoint and chooses the portions of the ADAS-Cog and the NMFC that increase the sensitivity of the outcome measure to change, in this early population, MCI and mild patients. And they published on this. And how the regulators will view it, we'll have to see what they say when we go to talk to them.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terence Finn with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Terence Finn","Hi, thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering if you deal the expanded all in your comments and your SMA gene therapy program in terms of maybe timeframe for getting off clinical hold. And then based on the orphan drug designation, it looks like you guys are using the same promoter that Novartis is. But are you willing to share what bacteria you're using at this point? Thanks.","Michael Ehlers","Yes, so this is Mike. All I can really say at this point is we believe we've got a path forward. We're working hard to get this off-clinical hold and we look forward to initiating the trial and getting patients as rapidly as possible. Once we're able to do that, we will have more to say about the precise nature of our gene therapy agent.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Salim Syed with Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Salim Syed","Hey guys, thanks for the question. One on BAN2401, if I may. When you're thinking about running additional trials versus filing, are those two decisions independent of each other? Or if you run additional trials, does that preclude you from filing off the data that you have thus far? Thank you.","Al Sandrock","Well, that's a tough question to answer without the benefit of the conversations we're about to have with the regulators. So I don't think I will have to respond.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Citi. Please go ahead.","Robyn Karnauskas","Hi, thanks so much for taking my question and congrats. Question on Opicinumab data that was presented yesterday for 110 weeks. It was confusing because it's versus placebo switch-overs, but it looks like the titration arm didn't do as well as the 10 mg per kg arm. Can you help us understand a little bit more what you think is going on at two years? And how to think about the drug and what's going on in that arm at that time? Thanks.","Al Sandrock","Hi, Robyn, and it's Al again. Yes, it is hard because we've lost the placebo control after one year. I think I do agree with when you look at the data, the 10 mg per kg arm group has always looked good since the very beginning and continues to look great. The titration arm, there is two questions related to that. One is that the dose was lower for period of time in order to try to mitigate the effects of ARIA, which it does. But the two things are happening. One is that you are starting with a lower dose, which we believe might be less effective initially. And then the time to get to the appropriate dose is a little bit later. However, when I look at the translation data, I have to say, I am pretty encouraged overall. I think it looks quite good and may not be as good as 10 mgs per kg. But I think the bottom-line also Robyn is that we\u2019ve lost the placebo control. We\u2019re down to very few patients at this point. I mean we were -- it was not a large trial to begin with. So trying to look at differences between dose arms is pretty hard with this small number of patients.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Phil Nadeau","One commercial question on SPINRAZA. We saw a deceleration new patient starts beginning in Q2. Is that simply the maturation of the product? Was there anything that can reverse that trend? And on the adult patients specifically you mentioned 60% of population are adults. What proportion of those adults do you think are appropriate for therapy and could be on therapy over the long haul? Thanks.","Michael Ehlers","Yes, I think, we were encouraged by the progress we made from this first quarter to second quarter. I think we mentioned that 20% growth in adult patients being treated, and I think you have the statistic right that 60% of the patient pool is in adults. So we think that still is a large underserved patient pool. The exact percentage of that is treatable. I think is still to be determined given some of the complexities, but we think it\u2019s a large percentage. So we continue to be encouraged by that patient sub-segment and we\u2019ve made good progress. And I think we continue to believe as we work our way through the year. Our efforts to focusing on those sites that treat adults, which we did not focus on before is going to pay dividends. Our adult branded and targeted campaign, it's like the patients who are going to pay dividends as well as the investment in sales force. So we continue to expect to see a growth. We will just have to see how much growth we get in the back half of the year versus next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with UBS. Please go ahead.","Carter Gould","I guess for Michel and Jeff, on the BD front which seems to be very active completing a number of tuck-ins and platform deals. Meanwhile you\u2019ve reiterated a number of times a preference for later stage assets. So may be if you could just kind of characterize where you sit now with your BD strategy. And if you see sort of any evolution on that front sort of after the first half of the year?","Michel Vounatsos","I will get started and Jeff will continue. So we always said that the early stage was the sweet spot for organization. This is where we can add the most value base on the quality of the team, our ability to best develop the compound. So we continue to be looking at opportunities that can meet and complement our current portfolio. It\u2019s very nice to see like the last year we\u2019ve done on muscle enhancement that it can reach towards different priority areas that we have. So this is very exciting. We look at order opportunities in later stage too by remaining very disciplined. And I will let Jeff continue on the answer here.","Jeff Capello","I think we are pleased by the progress we\u2019ve made. And then, since Michel has become the CEO we\u2019ve done seven deals now. All smart deals, many refer later stage deals that have really helped the pipeline if you look at the slides. So I think we feel good about the pipeline advancement. But as we said from the beginning, we continue to say we\u2019ve got ample capacity to both invest in early stage deals, late stage deals and return capital to shareholders. And that hasn\u2019t changed. The challenge is, I think, as everybody can appreciate is we have to find later stage deals where there is a good scientific rationale, strong international property, good synergies from a commercial and manufacturing perspective and it make sense financially. Those are lot of wickets to get through to kind a get a deal through. But there is no lack of attention and the focus on it. As Michel has said, we now have a strong Head of Business Development, Daniel Karp, who will be moving forward more aggressively looking at later stage deals. And we certainly hope to get something done, but it will be something that will be smart and appropriate and disciplined.","Operator","And your final question will come from the line of Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Brian Abrahams","Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the progress in the quarter. On Alzheimer's being that ADCOMS endpoints, I think, is somewhat new to many of us. I was wondering if you could speak to your views as to the bar for clinical meaningfulness or the goal on that particular endpoint maybe relative to CDR Sum of Boxes. And then maybe speak about how the 2401 results might affect your views of performing interim analysis for Opicinumab in the Phase 3 program? Thanks so much.","Al Sandrock","Hi, Brian, it's Al. First I'm going to start with the interim analysis and the answer that we give is that we're commenting on it. On the -- in terms of the ADCOMS, it's the new endpoint as you pointed out. I haven't seen any publications that relate to what the clinically meaningful difference is. I will say though that the BAN2401 was powered to on the Bayesian analysis, essentially to see a 25% treatment effect size and 80% probably with the threshold. So that answers that in terms of what the study was powered for. Whether what the community believes is the clinically meaningful threshold has not yet been published or determined to my knowledge.","Matt Calistri","Hi all, this is Matt.

We'll also be joined for the Q&A portion of the call by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Al Sandrock.","Now I'll turn the call over to Michel.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. In 2016, Biogen generated revenues of $11.4 billion, a 6% increase over 2015 and, on a constant currency basis, an increase of 9%. GAAP earnings were $16.93 a share, a 10% increase year-over-year, and on non-GAAP EPS was $20.22, a 19% increase versus full-year 2015. I am proud that the team was able to deliver such a strong results, and I aim to building on Biogen impressive track record as we move forward.","2016 was an eventful year for Biogen. Let me review some of our most important achievements. We announced the spinoff of our hemophilia business, now called Bioverativ, and aim to complete the transaction next week. We presented results from the SYNERGY study of opicinumab, a potential remyelinating therapy for MS.","We presented updated a-beta (03:15) data from the Phase 1b PRIME study of aducanumab for Alzheimer's disease and made significant progress enrolling the Phase 3 trial, exceeding our goal for the year. Aducanumab also received fast track designation in the U.S., and was accepted in the PRIME program in the E.U. Our partner, Eisai, initiated and began dosing patient in the Phase 3 program for elenbecestat, or E2609, a BACE inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease, and important complementary mechanism to our a-beta [amyloid beta] antibodies.","We received additional IP protection for TYSABRI as we were granted with a new patent in the U.S. with coverage to 2027. And we launched four new products: ZINBRYTA for MS, two biosimilars, BENEPALI and FLIXABI in European markets; and most recently, SPINRAZA, the first treatment for SMA, which was approved only three months after filing in the U.S.","2017 is already off to an exciting start. In the last two weeks, we began dosing the first SPINRAZA patient in the U.S. Further, we announced that we have agreed to enter into a settlement and license agreement with Forward Pharma, which we believe will help clarify our IP position for TECFIDERA.","Let me now provide you with a brief review of our commercial performance. Biogen remains the leader in MS as we've maintained our global market share of approximately 38% in a highly competitive market, and that number rises to 42% in those markets where we have a direct presence. Biogen remains the global category leader in the orals, high efficacy and interferon segments of the MS market. MS revenues for 2016 grew 3% year-over-year, or 5% on a constant currency basis.","While the revenue growth has attenuated recently, our portfolio delivered global patient growth of 4% in 2016, driven by patient growth for TECFIDERA of 9% year-over-year. In the U.S., we saw a slight decline in TECFIDERA patients year-over-year, attributed to competition among the orals, as well as continued moderation in the overall market. Total TECFIDERA patients outside the U.S. grew by 20% year-over-year, a major driver of revenue growth. Outside the U.S., our efforts are aimed at both new country launches and a renewed focus on early launch European markets such as France and Germany. Looking to 2017, we are pleased to have just received approval in Japan and plan to seek approvals and reimbursement in additional markets throughout the year.","TYSABRI added over 4,000 net new patients globally year-over-year and further strengthened its position in the marketplace. Our research indicates that the safety perception for TYSABRI in the U.S. is gradually improving as physicians become more comfortable with risk stratification of their patients. TYSABRI is also benefiting from a shift away from the platform therapies including our interferons to high efficacy products and the orals.","We are also continuing to advance our leadership position through new product launches in the U.S. Our data indicates high brand awareness for ZINBRYTA and that physicians are generally prescribing it consistent with the label for switch patients. Outside the U.S., we are encouraged by the launch in Germany, and we expect to receive reimbursement in all major European markets by the end of 2017. Across our MS portfolio, we are focused on operational execution and reinforcing our commitment to MS by pursuing life cycle management opportunities.","Switching to our biosimilar business, we are very excited with the continued progress as revenues grew by over 70% quarter-over-quarter, driven by BENEPALI. Our biosimilars operation in Europe is already profitable, and we are pleased with the progress of the JV in advancing additional compound.","The most exciting commercial opportunity for 2017 is clearly the launch of SPINRAZA for spinal muscular atrophy. And we moved quickly to make the product available in the U.S. We appreciate the anticipated demand for SPINRAZA in a disease area with such a high unmet medical need, but also realized it may take some time for the treatment centers to manage the complexities in administration, setup, scheduling of patients, as well as for insurers to develop coverage policies.","We are working with clinicians, payers and patient advocacy groups to try to expedite access to treatment given some likely capacity constraints in the system, as well as the need to secure reimbursement. Our goal is that no patient will forgo treatment because of financial limitation or insurance status. And we are pleased with the progress made so far.","These coverage decisions are made on a case-by-case basis with each payer. While we have seen some early challenges, such as the recent decision from Anthem, we have seen some early successes as well. We continue to expect a gradual uptake throughout the year as we work step-by-step over these launch dynamics.","Beyond the U.S., we aim to make SPINRAZA available to patients around the world as soon as possible. We have already filed in the EU, Japan, Australia and Canada as we see (09:51) broad global patient population that we believe will benefit from this therapy. We hope for immediate approval from the EU.","I'll now turn it over to Mike for an update on our efforts in R&D, the true engine of value creation for Biogen.","Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.","Thank you, Michel, and on behalf of employees and stakeholders around the globe, let me congratulate and welcome you to your new role and share the excitement and enthusiasm for the vision, energy, rigor and commitment you are really bringing to the helm of this great company. And good morning to everyone on the call.","2016 was a productive year for Biogen as we made important progress advancing our understanding of several key diseases and assets, received approvals for a broad range of therapies, and continued to shape our pipeline toward areas of high unmet medical need.","Let's begin with SPINRAZA. With FDA approval, SPINRAZA became the first and only treatment approved in the U.S. for spinal muscular atrophy, or SMA. We plan on submitting additional data this year to the FDA, including the final analyses from ENDEAR and CHERISH, the Phase 3 study evaluating SPINRAZA in later-onset SMA, with the goal of updating the label.","Earlier this month, we also presented new data from the final analysis of ENDEAR at the British Paediatric Neurology Association conference in the U.K. SPINRAZA met the prespecified primary endpoint in the final analysis, demonstrating a statistically significant reduction of 47% in the risk of death or permanent ventilation. In this analysis, 68% of untreated infants died or required permanent ventilation compared to 39% of infants treated with SPINRAZA. Commonly reported adverse effects were generally consistent with those expected in the general population of infants with SMA.","We plan to present further efficacy and safety results from ENDEAR in addition to CHERISH later this year. Specifically, we are submitting both ENDEAR and CHERISH to AAN for presentation in April.","In addition to being the first medicine for the treatment of SMA, SPINRAZA represents the first intrathecal antisense oligonucleotide approved for any indication. The success and favorable benefit risk profile of SPINRAZA highlight the potential for this previously untapped therapeutic modality in severe nervous system diseases more broadly. Working together with our collaboration partner, Ionis, we intend to leverage our leadership position to advance new therapeutics.","Moving on to our efforts in MS repair and regeneration, we are planning to initiate a Phase 2b study for opicinumab, or anti-LINGO, in the fourth quarter. We are also advancing BIIB061, a novel oral remyelinating agent with a different mechanism than opicinumab. We are applying learnings from the opicinumab trials to inform next steps for this asset and look forward to updating you in the coming months.","Across our MS franchise, we remain committed to fully understanding and maximizing the medical value and impact of our products as we continue to generate new clinical data and prioritize life cycle management opportunities.","Although not within MS, we believe the pursuit of natalizumab, or TYSABRI, for acute ischemic stroke is an example of how we aim to derive additional value. With over 1.7 million cases each year, stroke remains one of the leading causes of death and neurologic disability worldwide with limited treatment options. We believe natalizumab may be able to address the post-ischemic inflammation that leads to neurotoxicity.","We previously reported that in our Phase 2 study ACTION, natalizumab, when administered up to nine hours after stroke onset, failed to meet its primary endpoint of MRI infarct volume, but did show benefit on key prespecified secondary clinical outcomes, including the modified Rankin Scale and Barthel Index.","We expect the follow-on Phase 2b dose-ranging study ACTION 2 to be fully enrolled in 2017 and hope to show the results shortly thereafter. This study is assessing the clinical impact of natalizumab on functional independence and cognition when initially dosed within up to 24 hours of stroke onset, which would be a major advancement over the current standard of care, such as tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, which has a limited time window.","Now, turning to Alzheimer's disease, during the quarter, a number of exciting developments occurred for our lead assets. We presented new data from the Phase 1b PRIME study of aducanumab, our investigational treatment for early Alzheimer's disease, at the CTAD meeting in San Diego. We believe the totality of the data presented at CTAD, including additional data from our competitors, continue to support the a-beta hypothesis, as well as the design of our Phase 3 trials.","Also in Alzheimer's disease, as Michel mentioned, our partner Eisai recently initiated began (14:51) dosing in the Phase 3 program for elenbecestat, or E2609, an oral BACE inhibitor which aims to prevent the production of beta amyloid. Eisai has also recently completed enrollment in the Phase 2 adaptive design trial for BAN2401, a humanized beta amyloid antibody which exhibits a strong binding preference for protofibrils. Data from that trial are expected in the next 12 to 18 months.","We're working to advance BIIB074, a novel investigational state-dependent subtype selective sodium channel blocker for neuropathic pain. We completed enrollment in a small exploratory Phase 2a study in erythromelalgia and anticipate data in the coming months. We continue to enroll a Phase 2b trial for lumbosacral radiculopathy and are planning to initiate two Phase 3 studies in trigeminal neuralgia this year. Startup activities will initially be focused outside the U.S. BG00011, or STX100 for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is enrolling its final cohort in a Phase 2a study and we expect to present the data after the trial completes in the second half of the year.","We're also making important progress across our early-stage pipeline as we continue to shape our R&D engine for the future. With that said, although we are pleased with our pipeline, there's always room for improvement. We are building out our R&D leadership team and remain laser-focused on delivering meaningful new molecules to and through the clinic. Working closely with Michel, we are making important progress to refresh and augment our pipeline. We are looking to add assets across our pipeline and are working aggressively to optimize, prioritize, and reshape our R&D activities, focusing resources to rapidly advance assets based on compelling science and medical impact that present the greatest opportunity. Expect to hear more from us in the coming months.","With that, I will now pass the call to Paul.","Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.","Thanks, Mike. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.99 in the fourth quarter and $16.93 for the full year. GAAP earnings per share were negatively impacted by $1.55 related to the settlement in license agreement with Forward Pharma. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $5.04 in the fourth quarter and $20.22 for the full year. Total revenue for Q4 grew 1% year-over-year to approximately $2.9 billion and grew 6% for the full year to $11.4 billion.","Global fourth quarter TECFIDERA revenues were $1 billion. This included revenues of $800 million in the U.S., an increase of 2% versus Q4 last year, and $202 million outside the U.S., a decrease of 3% versus Q4 of last year. As a reminder, in Q3, we believe TECFIDERA U.S. revenue benefited by approximately $40 million to $50 million due to inventory build in the channel, which impacts the sequential quarter comparison. On a sequential basis, we believe inventory levels remained relatively constant.","For the full year, worldwide TECFIDERA revenues were $4 billion, an increase of 9% versus prior year. This included $3.2 billion in the U.S. and $799 million in sales outside the U.S. Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, were $688 million during the fourth quarter, a decrease of 7% versus Q4 last year. This included $488 million in the U.S. and $200 million in sales outside the U.S. For the full year, worldwide interferon revenues were $2.8 billion, consisting of $2 billion in the U.S. and $815 million in sales outside the U.S.","TYSABRI worldwide revenues were $474 million this quarter, a decrease of 1% versus Q4 last year. This included $289 million in the U.S. and $185 million outside the U.S. In the U.S., Q4 TYSABRI revenue was unfavorably impacted by an increase in discounts and allowances specific to this quarter. For the full year, worldwide TYSABRI revenues were $2 billion, a 4% increase versus the prior year. We recorded U.S. revenues of $1.2 billion and $781 million internationally.","Foreign exchange and hedge impact weakened full-year revenue by approximately $66 million for TECFIDERA, $79 million for interferons, and $62 million for TYSABRI versus prior year. As a reminder, with respect to ZINBRYTA, in the United States, we don't book in market revenue, we book a profit share. And in Q4, we experienced a contra revenue to the total revenue line.","Our Hemophilia products continued to perform well this quarter. ELOCTATE revenues for the quarter were $149 million, an increase of 47% versus Q4 last year. This includes $126 million in the U.S. and $23 million outside the U.S. For the full year, world-wide ELOCTATE revenues were $513 million. We recorded U.S. revenue of $445 million, and $68 million internationally.","ALPROLIX revenues in Q4 were $93 million, an increase of 31%, versus Q4 last year, including $74 million in the U.S. and $20 million outside of the U.S. For the full year, worldwide ALPROLIX revenues were $334 million. We recorded U.S. revenue of $268 million and $66 million internationally. Our Biosimilar business generated $53 million in revenues this quarter, and full-year Biosimilar revenues were $101 million.","Turning to our Anti-CD20 revenues, we recorded $318 million for Q4 and $1.3 billion for the full year. Total Other revenues were $51 million in Q4 and $316 million for the full year.","Now turning to the expense line on the P&L. Q4 GAAP cost of goods sold was $378 million; non-GAAP cost of goods sold was $363 million; both 13% of revenue. Full-year GAAP COGS were 1.5 billion or 13% of revenue. And full year non-GAAP COGS were 1.4 billion or 12% of revenue. Q4 GAAP R&D expense was $534 million or 19% of revenue. Q4 non-GAAP R&D was $531 million or 18% of revenue. Both GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense included a $50 million payment milestone to Eisai in Q4, following the dosing of the first patient in, in the Phase 3 program for the BACE inhibitor.","Full year GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense were $2 billion, both 17% of revenue. Q4 GAAP SG&A was $496 million; Q4 non-GAAP SG&A was $484 million; both 17% of revenue. Both full-year GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A were $1.9 billion or 17 % of revenue. Throughout the year, we continued to execute on a number of measures to curb operating expense growth, while continuing to invest in R&D in key commercial priorities. We believe the benefits materialized in both the fourth quarter and full year results.","We booked a GAAP-only charge in Q4 of $455 million related to our recent settlement and license agreement with Forward Pharma. Upon effectiveness of this agreement, we've agreed to pay Forward Pharma $1.25 billion plus potential royalties. The charge in Q4 represents the portion of the payment attributable to the sales of TECFIDERA during the period April 2014 through December 31, 2016.","GAAP other net expense, which includes interest was $48 million in Q4 and $217 million for the full year. Non-GAAP other net expense was $52 million in Q4 and $222 million for the full year. In Q4, our GAAP tax rate was approximately 23%, and our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 24%. For the full year, both GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were approximately 25%.","Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 217 million for Q4 and 219 million for the full year, which brings us to our diluted earnings per share. For Q4, we booked $2.99 on a GAAP basis and $5.04 on a non-GAAP basis. For the full year, GAAP EPS was $16.93, and non-GAAP EPS was $20.22, representing a strong 10% and 19% growth year-over-year, respectively.","During the quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares of the company's common stock for a total value of $651 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $7.7 billion in cash and marketable securities, with approximately 30% of this in the U.S. In 2017, we expect to continue repurchasing shares as part of our previously announced $5 billion share repurchase program.","Let me turn to our full year 2017 guidance. Guidance this year has a few more moving pieces due to the spin-off of Bioverativ: Our focus on Biogen's 2017 guidance; but also provide additional context on Bioverativ in what we call WholeCo, the combined companies. I'd refer you to the slides for today's call for reference.","There are a couple of items of note before I go into the substance of the Biogen guidance. First, there will be a stub period for the full month of January, where Hemophilia will be part of Biogen, not Bioverativ. Second, our, our GAAP guidance includes the minimum expense we expect to record in 2017 upon the effectiveness of our settlement and license agreement with Forward Pharma. The actual charges for this recorded will depend on the outcome of the patent office proceedings in the U.S. and EU. Third, our guidance does not include any impact from potential corporate tax reform in the U.S., repatriation or changes to the Affordable Care Act. And our plan is based on recent rates for foreign exchange.","Now, let's get into Biogen guidance, starting with revenues. We expect revenues of approximately $11.1 billion to $11.4 billion. This includes one month of Hemophilia revenues, which equates to approximately $75 million. This represents 5% to 7% growth on a pro forma basis, when you adjust for Hemophilia revenues, for both 2016 and January of this year.","Starting with MS, our plan assumes OCREVUS is approved this year and launches in the U.S. and Germany in the first half of 2017. We anticipate relatively stable demand for both TECFIDERA and TYSABRI in 2017 on a global basis. This is comprised of ex U.S. patient growth, offsetting modest patient declines in the U.S. We believe the number of patients using AVONEX and PLEGRIDY combined will continue to decline, as the market continues to shift away from the platforms. We anticipate continued strong growth from our Biosimilar business, predominantly driven by BENEPALI.","Moving to SPINRAZA. We're very excited about bringing this therapy to patients, with such high unmet need. We're assuming the vast majority of SPINRAZA revenue this year will be in the U.S. We're cognizant that there are near-term capacity constraints in the system and the need for patients to secure reimbursement. So, we expect the revenue uptake to be gradual in 2017. Nevertheless, clearly, the kinetics of the launch are the biggest ambiguity in our outlook.","Now, moving to expenses. We expect upward pressure on cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales in 2017, largely due to the increase in royalties related to the sales of SPINRAZA and our Biosimilars revenue becoming a larger portion of the business. We anticipate R&D expense between 16% and 17% of sales. We anticipate additional expense driven by advancing our Alzheimer's programs, notably, aducanumab and the BACE inhibitor; as well as the desire to build our pipeline to business development. Guidance does not include any impact from potential acquisitions or large late-stage business development transactions, as both are hard to predict.","SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 15% to 16% of revenues, a decrease from 2016, driven by the reduction in head count related to the Hemophilia spin and continued diligent focus on improving inefficiencies. We're re-allocating resources to maintain our leadership position in MS. Ad we have resourced SPINRAZA for an excellent launch.","From a tax perspective, we anticipate our tax rate for 2017 to be largely comparable to 2016. For Biogen, we anticipate GAAP EPS results of $18 to $18.80, and non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $20.45 and $21.25. Our shareholders will also benefit from the earnings of Bioverativ. As a reminder, eligible shareholders will receive one share of Bioverativ common stock for every two shares of Biogen common stock. On an apples-to-apples basis, we aim to grow earnings per share for Biogen in the double digits on a pro forma basis.","I'll now turn the call over to Michel for his closing remarks.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","Thank you, Paul. The following is my take on how Biogen is opening the page for 2017. We have a stable leadership position in MS, with the remaining lifecycle management opportunities, for which I'll come back to you at a later stage.","Our Biosimilars business is growing strongly. We are now the standard of care for SMA, and we believe intrathecal delivery opens up potential limited treatment modalities. I am very encouraged by the progress in our Phase 2 and 3 programs, such as (31:00), acute ischemic stroke, neuropathic pain, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and last, but not least, our Alzheimer's disease program. All of these are breaking new ground in important areas of medicines and aiming to address significant unmet medical needs.","We have reinforced our IP position for TECFIDERA and TYSABRI; we continue to be disciplined on expense management; and we aspire to continue delivering double-digit earning growth. With that said, good is not good enough, and we aim to do more. In 2017, we'll be focusing on flawless near-term execution, while laying the groundwork for Biogen's long-term sustainability and success, including our renewed prioritization on business development activities.","2017 will be a big year, and I could not be more excited to be taking over as CEO during such a critical time, as we continue to build our company and drive leadership in neurology and neurodegeneration. You can expect to hear more from me over the next six months as I work with the leadership team to reevaluate our strategy for long-term shareholder value creation, including efficient R&D investment and high return business development activities.","In closing, I'd like to thank our employees around the world, who are dedicated to make a positive impact on patients' lives; and all of the physicians, caregivers, and participants in our clinical development programs. The past and future achievements could not be realized without their passion and commitment.","With that, we open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Oh, hey, guys. How are you? First, thanks to the Biogen organization for all your support while I was out. You guys were just fantastic to my team and to me, especially to Paul, Al, and Matt. Second of all, I know you've been asked this before, but I just think it's so important that I'd love to hear you say it in front of the broadest audience possible. And that is just comment on the solanezumab results, and what implications they may or may not have for aducanumab. And then I'd like to know if Michel is a Patriots fan.","Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.","Mark, look...","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Because if he is, we're downgrading the stock.","Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.","Al will take the sola. But just on behalf of everybody here at Biogen, it's great to hear your voice, great for you to be back, and well wishes.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Thanks, Paul.","Alfred W. Sandrock - Biogen, Inc.","Hey, Mark, it's Al.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Hey, Al. Good to hear your voice.","Alfred W. Sandrock - Biogen, Inc.","I agree with Paul. It's great to hear your voice again.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Thank you.","Alfred W. Sandrock - Biogen, Inc.","So, on sola, there's a few key differences, right, between the sola trials and aducanumab. First of all, the patient population they studied was mild, with mild patients. We're studying the prodromal and the early mild. We continue to believe, and I think most of the community believes that the earlier the better, particularly for a-beta lowering therapies.","The second is the outcome measure they used ADAS-Cog. And they actually looked at CDR sum of boxes as a secondary endpoint, I believe. And we believe CDR is a very good endpoint for early-stage Alzheimer's, and that's what we're using in our Phase 3 trial. I believe the Lilly results showed a P-value less than 0.05 on the CDR sum of boxes, even in the mild population. So, I thought that was encouraging.","And finally, the difference in the antibody. Sola binds to soluble monomeric forms of a-beta, which means it binds to a lot of antigen in the circulation. The antibody probably, therefore, has a hard time getting to the brain. They actually couldn't show a lowering of amyloid plaque to a significant degree in the brain. Our antibody, in contrast, doesn't bind to the soluble monomeric form; it binds to the soluble oligomers. Binds also to the insoluble fibrillar forms. As a result, the antibody does get into the brain, and we have a substantial robust reduction in amyloid plaque in the brain at one year, which we published, dose-dependent.","So, I think for all those reasons \u2013 I'm not sure you can read too much into the sola result and infer anything on what we're going to see with aducanumab.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","And concerning your second question, I will not enter into the debate on what real football is, but I'm a fan of all the teams around here, including the Celtics and the Patriots.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Aaron Gal, Ph.D. - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. I got three quick ones. The first one, Abbey just moved their TAL program into Phase 2. We've been talking a lot about the strength and weaknesses of the amyloid beta hypothesis. I wonder if you would review for us how you think about the anti-TAL as a target. What has been proven about that target, and what has not? And what is generally your feeling about that overall field as a kind of secondary field in the Alzheimer's field?","Second, quarterly seasonality, we've seen it in the first quarter with the multiple sclerosis drugs. As we think about your revenue for 2017, should we think about the first quarter as being a lot weaker and growing over time? And then last but not least, I'm not sure you're going to be willing to say that, but as you're accelerating the quarter (37:23) for aducanumab, can you just discuss with us the stopping criteria both for fertility and early-stop conditions for this trial?","Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.","Okay, Ronny. This is Mike Ehlers. I'll start with the TAL question. So, we're very interested in TAL, because as you may know, one of the hallmarks of TAL pathology is that the pathology in the brain is more related to clinical status and progression. That's been one of the reasons why there's been such an interest in TAL. There's also a potential notion that this might be a mechanism that could intervene a little bit later than a-beta. And those have been some reasons for a lot of the excitement.","Other parts of this that get us interested is the data around the potential spreading of TAL extra-cellularly that leads to progression of the pathology. And I think that's led some additional credence to the notion that a monoclonal antibody might be able to intercept the core disease process. There's some open questions about the relevant TAL species and the best epitopes. And a lot of that will have to play out clinically.","There's tremendous advance, and we're certainly active in this in imaging agents for TAL pathology. And we think that if that comes to fruition, that has the chance to be as important to the field as amyloid imaging. I would say that in our portfolio, we have both the TAL monoclonal antibody, and we're also progressing, soon to get to a clinic, an antisense oligonucleotide type of TAL and our collaboration with Ionis that I kind of referred to in the line of the potential for intrathecal antisense oligonucleotides. So, we think there's great potential. A lot of it will play out in the clinic, and we're generally excited about TAL as a target.","Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.","Ronny, this is Paul. I'll try to address the seasonality question. Yeah, I think you're basically right that in multiple sclerosis, and in our expectations, we expect some normal seasonality headwinds in the United States. We generally anticipate seeing gross to net as a percentage move up just in Q1. That's pretty normal. U.S. patients are oftentimes moving around with respect to changes in insurance. And sometimes, there's a little bit of a unit slippage on that. And the TECFIDERA inventory levels in the U.S. that I had pointed out that got high in Q3 and stayed in Q3 could experience a little bit of a drawdown. That doesn't change anything with respect to the fundamentals going through the rest of the year or over the long term.","Alfred W. Sandrock - Biogen, Inc.","Yeah, sure. You guys gave me the toughest question. This is Al, Ronny. We don't want to comment on interim analyses or futility analyses, or any of those kinds of things, so sorry.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Co. Please go ahead.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks for the question. With the spin, was the revenue of $5 million in the first week on the market, is that a real sort of end user number? And when Michel says expecting immediate EU approval, are we thinking next week? Thank you.","Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.","Why don't Michel and I tag team this. This is Paul. The $5 million in Q4 was all channel build, Eric. So, as everybody knows, approved a couple of days before Christmas, 12\/23. Our team worked real hard the week between Christmas and New Year's. Inclusive of that was just some small channel fill that wasn't related to anything, with respect to patients.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","And concerning the EU approval, it's probably my accent. It's mid-year that we expect to have SPINRAZA approval.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for the question. And thanks to Paul for all the detailed guidance. And I'll say upfront, go, Falcons.","Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.","Next question.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Exactly. Exactly.","Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.","All right...","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So question for Mike or Al...","Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.","We'll talk to you after the call and put some money on it, Geoff.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Let's talk later on that, Paul.","Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.","All right.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So, for Mike or Al, just again to focus on Alzheimer's. For aducanumab, for enrollment, looks like you guys are more than one-third ways enrolled. Is there anything that's changed relative to some of the initial challenges that you faced? And does that make you feel better when you think about the patient identification down the road? And then just a real quick one. Have you guys have had to make any changes when you look at the protocol for engage or emerge to account for the seizure that you saw from the prime study? Thanks.","Alfred W. Sandrock - Biogen, Inc.","Hi, Geoff. This is Al. We have not made any changes in the protocol to account for the seizure. Look, I mean, enrollment, as Michel said, we exceeded our stretch actually goal for 2016. Things are improving, I think, in terms of two fronts. Since we require a positive PET scan, it's hard to get PET scans lined up for people in certain countries. And with time, we've been able to sort out a lot of the issues related to getting PET ligand to the centers, where they have the PET scans and getting patients scanned. And I think that is improving. And hopefully, that'll help with enrollment.","And then the other thing is that our publication last year really kind of continued to build excitement around our molecule, because we showed all the data we had from the preclinical studies and much of the data from the prime studies. So, that plus the CTAD results. So, think both of those things, I think, are encouraging, although, we still have, as you pointed out, a ways to go.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just was wondering, on 2017 guidance, recognize you guys don't typically give product guidance, but just wondering at a high level, if you can give us your thoughts on the MS franchise, volume price, the impact of the TECFIDERA label update and OCREVUS as well? Thanks.","Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.","I think, Michel, and I will try to tag team this, a bit. We don't give product guidance, Terrence. I think, what you didn't ask, and what we think is the biggest ambiguity is what I kind of pointed out in the prepared remarks, is SPINRAZA, obviously. I think the MS business is a stable business that we certainly, have thinking around OCREVUS is coming in. And we'll kind of take some share and probably hopefully expand the market, particularly around PPMS. The ambiguity there, obviously, is what the label looks like at the end of March.","Michel, any other additional comments?","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","Yeah. So, on MS, it's all about implementation and execution. And what we can see is that when we do that well, and we can always do better, then we are able to start improving. For example, in Germany, with the launch of ZINBRYTA, this is now four months that we can see the share grow up to two years of being stable. In France, improved implementation for TEC, all-time high during the last results, during the prior audited results. But it's not the case everywhere.","In the U.S., we've been a bit penalized as a market leader, with the contraction of the market in 2016. We believe this will normalize with the launch of OCRE, the way Paul said. This will expand the market, and the market will return to low single-digit growth. And the market leader will also benefit from that.","So, it's (46:03) situation based on a very respectable competitor that will be launched this year, and with very good data in clinical trial setting that has to be confirmed with the label, we'll see, but also in real world. So, but in the meantime, we have 250,000 patients on TEC. The safety perception and efficacy perception on our product is well characterized. And we have many cards to play and play well. And we are launching in Japan.","And last, but not least, for OCRE don't forget that we have tiered royalties in the U.S. from 13.5% to 24%. So, will be an exciting year. And again, I want to reassess that we remain fully committed in MS with the current portfolio and a lot of the current launches and lifecycle management opportunities.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. And appreciate all of the guidance clarity, as well. Wanted to ask a little more on SPINRAZA. You made some comments about managed care and things like that and some headwinds with the launch to get ramped. But I wanted to just ask, how many sites are available? How are you ramping this? How fast you think that could by the end of the year? And are people trying to write for Type 2 patients? And how is managed care handling all of that? Thanks so much.","Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.","Gosh, Michael, I mean, we don't have many more calls to be able to say, it's early days, but it's still pretty early days. As we've pointed out, it's 40 or 50 sites that is a big percentage of the business in the United States, and then it broadens out from there. We are doing meaningful medical education across United States. We have a go-to-market, if you will, that includes going and providing care to the families and understanding. But I would say, we're early days in trying to get through these capacity constraints and early days with respect to reimbursement in all the insurer coverage. I know it's a very important thing, and what we'll try to do is in Reg FD settings, update people along the way, as we move through the launch.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","So, what we can see is that it's a state-by-state opportunity, and this varies, obviously . This week we had the approval from a very large Medicaid coverage, but I will not say more at this stage on this one, because you saw also the Anthem decision. So, we believe that over time, logic will prevail in terms of having the patient access in therapy that is proven to save lives. And the demand from the patient side is there and is strong. This I can tell you.","Concerning the early access program that we have open, in the U.S., we had 62 patients in 15 sites and ex U.S. we have 146 patients in 13 countries. So, all of those factors are coming into play. And so far, we are satisfied with the progress that we are making.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Good morning, everybody Thanks for taking the question. I'm going to ask one, and I'm not sure if you'll answer, but I'll ask anyway. I think one of the major questions people still have after the TECFIDERA settlement is a scenario where you guys win the interference but lose the IPR. And I think a lot of people are wondering what that outcome could look like vis-a-vis the settlement with Forward, and if there really is any extended protection in that scenario. And why you might structure the settlement with Forward to allow that as a potential outcome? So, any confidence you can give us that, that sort of downside scenario can't happen?","Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.","Okay, Matt. This is Paul. We're going to have a hard time really engaging on this, obviously. So, I can't really get into specifics, because it does get into kind of legal strategy and all of that type of stuff.","The way to think about the announcement that we made a couple of weeks ago on Forward Pharma, I think, is probably twofold. One is which, obviously, you're getting at. But one is the economics, which we laid out. And that was all about trying to reduce uncertainty in what we thought was a very prudent deployment and a good structuring of the economics.","The second was kind of the structure and kind of keeping the interference going, and so on and so forth. And that was designed to attempt to ensure certainly, and that's what we believe, that we have the strongest patents over the long term across various scenarios, both in the U.S. and in the EU. So, there's lots of different scenarios. People have written about it. But that's probably about as far as I can. Thanks for the question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Josh Schimmer with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks for taking my question. I just want to come back to SPINRAZA. I guess I'm a little confused by some of the comments that you're obviously excited and well-resourced. You even expect upwards COGS pressure from the SPINRAZA royalty, but also projecting slow and gradual due to access reimbursement. I guess, given the evidence that suggests high misfunction in SMA, I'm surprised there'd be any tolerance for delayed uptake, either for logistics or reimbursement in this population. Maybe you can discuss whether awareness and urgency to treat this disease is really where it should be? And if not, why not? Thanks.","Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, I think that, Josh, what you laid out is what we'd agree is this is the ambiguity of the uptake. And we're only weeks in. The awareness of SPINRAZA, I think, is absolutely there, tight knit community, extremely tight-knit set of physicians as well. As people know, when we talked about and provided top line data on the second interim readout, we alluded to that there was a chance we'd get approval in the fourth quarter or early 2017. Even though we conveyed that, that actually was not the general belief in the physician community. I think people were thinking more like spring. So, we went to work, trying to get that ready. But there's still a little bit of work around capacity constraints.","And then what you point out is obviously the other big countervailing force, right? This is tremendous unmet need to patients that have a dire outcome. And I think we talk about that in Type 1, but I would say, that Type 2 is similar for any family that's burdened with this disease.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","So, a gradual uptake throughout the year is that we should envision realistically, and this is of course (54:22) that this is absolutely the way that we (54:26) And again, the demand is there, and patients, through the doctors, through the providers, or directly to the call centers are getting engaged. So, these are very positive signs, obviously.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.","Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.","He's probably an Atlanta Falcons fan.","Matthew Calistri - Biogen, Inc.","You might be on mute. If you're asking a question right now, we cannot hear you.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yep, you're right. I was on mute. And no, my Giants lost early, so. (55:12) So, I was really hoping to just get your thoughts on other Alzheimer's approaches, specifically the a-beta pros that probio drug is taking, and just given the interest there. And separately, the recent advancement of a gene therapy product targeting TAL. Just your thoughts and your inclination in terms of maybe duplicating those efforts.","Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.","Well, let me start, and Mike, I'm sure, will have other things to add. The probio drug approach is to go after plaque, essentially. The pyroglutamated form is thought to be (55:53) for the plaque. And it's a way to get after the plaque. I think in that sense, it's not that different from the aducanumab approach, which is to go after the plaque. I think it's an interesting approach. But as I said, I think it overlaps significantly with our approach.","And the other approaches to AD in addition to TAL, one of the things we're very interested in is neuroinflammation. There are genetics that point to neuroinflammatory pathways. Biogen has a strong history in inflammation and in neuro, and we have some real expertise internally. And so, we're going after some targets that are related to neuroinflammation. And then I think we like the idea of combining things ultimately. I think, ultimately, we're going to see AD treatment being a combination of approaches and all with different mechanisms of actions. So, that's how we're looking at things, but Mike?","Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.","Well, I guess, the only thing I would say specifically on this is, as Al mentioned, the pyroglu a-beta antibody is largely a similar core hypothesis, going after plaque beta amyloid. There may be some differences in specific epitopes that would have to play out. It's also kind of less clear how that intervention causes biomarker changes typical of other a-beta antibodies. That's another thing that would have to play out.","I think that things with gene therapy as a general approach was the other question you asked about. We're very interested in gene therapy. AAV is a modality, in general. I think there's a lot of excitement around that. We have very active programs in our collaboration with UPenn. There's still a lot of things that have to be worked out in terms of the technology, the safety profile, the manufacturing and bioprocesses. My own feeling is that this will initially be most beneficial in more severe genetic diseases, rather than genetically heterogeneous common diseases. That's the way that we're thinking about it, but we like AAVs as a general approach.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thank you. And I appreciate the comments that you've made on this market so far, but I had one more. So, if you look at IMS, it appears that TECFIDERA's declining, and I think AUBAGIO is growing. So, maybe you could help us understand what you're seeing on this trend, and what you might be doing to control the trend? And if there's any pricing pressure or anything like that on the orals from this on TECFIDERA in the U.S. and the EU? Thanks.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","So, I will not comment on the third-party's data. Let's have them answer. (58:50). They had a methodology change, so I have noticed what you have noticed. What is important is that we continue on the demand generation to perform, and that the team is able to generate the demand as expected. From the data we have, we see a very slight erosion of TEC around the 19.2%, 19.1% (59:14) slight erosion. We can certainly see the inroads of AUBAGIO from the whole activity low base. This we can see. And we have to do a better job at that.","Matthew Calistri - Biogen, Inc.","Yeah, we're going to take one more question.","Operator","And your final questions comes from Alethia Young with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, I was curious if you could provide maybe some potential color around like when you think about some of the prevalences in some of the other markets for SMA, like Japan, Canada, or Australia, which could be on the horizon in the next 12 to 24 months? Thanks.","Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.","Well, I know of no regional differences in the incidents of SMA or the prevalence. We actually have filed for approval in Australia, Canada, and Japan, as well as Europe. And so, yeah, I mean, we would love to ultimately \u2013 I think every child with SMA deserves treatment. And so, that would be our goal.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","So, we want to provide the product for the patient in need all around the globe. And in Asia-Pac, there are plenty of opportunities. I'll be with Al and all the members of the team flying at the end of the week to Japan to meet authorities to discuss also SMA, so we are committed.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Idec Fourth Quarter and Year End 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Claudine Prowse, Vice President, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Claudine Prowse","Thank you, Tiffany, and welcome to Biogen Idec's Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogenidec.com to find the press release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures that we'll discuss today.","Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results, which we believe better represents the ongoing economics of our business and reflects how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call.","I would like to point out we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from our expectations. I encourage everyone to consult our SEC filings for additional detail.","On today's call, I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. George Scangos; Tony Kingsley, EVP of Global Commercial Operations; Dr. Doug Williams, EVP of Research and Development; and our CFO, Paul Clancy. We'll also be joined for the Q&A portion of the call with our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Al Sandrock.","I'll now turn the call over to George.","George A. Scangos","Okay. Thanks, Claudine. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us today. 2013 was a very good year for Biogen Idec and for the patients we serve. We continue to grow our base businesses, our current MS and anti-CD20 franchises, we successfully launched TECFIDERA, our most recent MS therapy, we announced marketing applications for 3 potential new products, PLEGRIDY for MS and ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE for hemophilia and finally, we advanced a promising pipeline of potential new medicines.","And the solid operational progress was coupled with strong financial results. Revenue for 2013 was $6.9 billion, an increase of 26% from 2012, and non-GAAP earnings were $8.96 per share, an increase of 37% from 2012.","With TECFIDERA, we strengthened our positions in the MS market, and we believe that we now have leading therapies in the oral high-efficacy and injectable segments of the market. We believe that having this suite of therapies positions us well to address the diverse needs of MS patients.","The launch of TECFIDERA in the U.S. was a milestone event for us. We believe that TECFIDERA's broad and rapid uptake is a testament to its clinical profile, as well as excellent execution by our organization. We're very pleased that the launch of TECFIDERA now ranks among the best in the biopharmaceutical industry.","AVONEX and TYSABRI continue to provide a solid business foundation. AVONEX remains a multibillion drug 17 years after launch, and physicians, as well as patients, continue to look to AVONEX as a first-line MS therapy of choice. We believe that TYSABRI is a powerful MS treatment and remains a therapy of choice for patients needing high efficacy.","During the year, we completed an important transaction by acquiring complete ownership of TYSABRI, which strengthened our leadership in MS. This asset acquisition represents a prudent use of cash, and provides us with a larger portion of TYSABRI's financial benefits.","In addition, we believe that consolidating TYSABRI ownership provides us with greater flexibility and control over the positioning of our MS products to enable us to effectively compete in this market.","It has also been an eventful year for our anti-CD20 franchise. RITUXAN is the standard of care for NHL and CLL, and for years, it has been an important asset for Biogen Idec.","In the fourth quarter, the FDA approved GAZYVA, the first drug approved under the breakthrough therapy designation for previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We believe that GAZYVA strengthens our anti-CD20 franchise, and will enhance longevity of what already has been an incredibly impactful collaboration.","Biogen Idec is a patient-focused organization. This focus drives how we think on all levels, not only for our marketed products, but also for our pipeline where we're committed to develop new medicines for serious diseases with limited treatment options.","In 2013, we advanced many of our pipeline candidates toward important data readouts anticipated this year. We also took steps to strengthen our drug discovery platform. We've hired some leading scientists, including Dr. Spyros Artavanis, our Chief Financial Officer -- sorry, Chief Scientific Officer. We've also advanced our strategy to utilize academic consortia to foster collaboration and leverage the incredible science being carried out around the world.","In addition, we completed a number of transactions to enhance our pipeline, including agreements with Adimab, Amicus therapeutics, Isis Pharmaceuticals and Galapagos. More recently, we announced the collaboration with Sangamo BioSciences on an innovative gene editing technology, with the potential to treat sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia.","Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we expanded our agreement with Samsung Bioepis, our joint venture with Samsung to develop and market biosimilar therapeutics. We believe that this partnership leverages our manufacturing capabilities and positions us to compete effectively in biosimilar therapeutics, while maintaining our focus on our innovative pipeline.","So in summary, 2013 was a very good year for Biogen Idec, with a lot of significant achievements. And I'll now turn the call over to Tony.","Stuart A. Kingsley","Thanks, George. In 2013, we grew our global MS market share, executed our franchise strategy across our 3 core MS products. In the fourth quarter, TECFIDERA's U.S. launch continued to enjoy broad adoption and rapid uptake. According to our data, through December, over 6,000 physicians, representing approximately 85% of total MS prescription volume, have prescribed TECFIDERA. Additionally, our data show that over 30% of new TECFIDERA patients in Q4 were not on prior therapies, an increase from prior quarters. We believe both these figures reflect physician and patient confidence in TECFIDERA's clinical profile and real world experience.","We've also continued to improve patient access to TECFIDERA. As of January, almost all insurance plans in the U.S. provide coverage for TECFIDERA, with approximately 75% of patients having access without requiring a step edit. Nine months into launch, we believe TECFIDERA is in a very good position, but we understand that sustained effort is required to extend this initial success in the U.S.","In the EU, we received a positive opinion on new active substance designation from the CHMP in November. TECFIDERA was then referred to the European Commission, which grants marketing authorization for medicines in the European Union. If approved, it's our intent to quickly launch in Germany, followed by staggered launches in other EU countries over the next 6 to 18 months, coincident with obtaining product reimbursement.","Outside of Europe, reimbursement of TECFIDERA in Australia was approved in December. And we expect public reimbursement approval in Canada in the first half of this year.","AVONEX performed well in 2013, gaining share globally within the injectable segment. In the U.S., where TECFIDERA caused a significant contraction in the injectable segment of the market, AVONEX continue to hold up well. The injectable segment of the market represented approximately $11 billion of global revenue in 2013. And while we expect this segment will decline over time, we believe it remains a significant opportunity in the medium term.","We also believe convenience continues to be a key differentiator for the injectable segment, and that we are well-positioned with AVONEX PEN and potentially PLEGRIDY, should it be approved.","Moving on to TYSABRI. In the U.S., new prescription volume remained solid, and TYSABRI discontinuation rates continued to improve in Q4. We're encouraged with TYSABRI's recent improvement in the U.S.","In Europe, we continue to see pressure from oral competition. We remain focused on emphasizing TYSABRI's efficacy messaging, while continuing to provide the market with additional education on risk stratification. We believe this builds confidence in earlier treatment of patients with aggressive disease.","We also continue to feel that the MS market will migrate to increase efficacy over time, and that TYSABRI will benefit from this trend. We need to continue to execute well to ensure broad understanding of TYSABRI's profile.","Turning to hemophilia. We are continuing to prepare for our expected 2014 U.S. launches of ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE. We believe, over time, that these products have the potential to transform hemophilia care by reducing infusion frequency, the largest unmet need in this market.","Hemophilia is a new market for us, and one with well-established competitors. It is also historically a slow moving market, with physicians and patients who are reluctant to switch therapies without real world experience.","And logistical hurdles such as infrequent physician visits that extend the time line for starting a new therapy. So driving adoption will require hard work, but we believe in the product profiles and our ability to execute.","I'll now turn the call over to Doug to discuss R&D.","Douglas Edward Williams","Thanks, Tony. I'll begin by highlighting the major events from 2013, and then discuss multiple clinical trial readouts anticipated in the upcoming year.","Let's start with TECFIDERA. During 2013, significant new data were generated that deepened our understanding of this important therapy. We have further elucidated TECFIDERA's mechanism of action and demonstrated that the biological effects of DMF, compared to other fumarate molecules, are distinctly different. Also, data generated from the ongoing endorsed clinical study continued to support the long-term efficacy and safety of TECFIDERA.","During the year, TYSABRI was submitted for marketing approval in Japan, and we're anticipating a decision in the first half of 2014.","Beyond relapsing forms of MS, we continue to evaluate TYSABRI's potential efficacy in other indications. Enrollment was completed in the Phase III ASCEND study in patients with secondary-progressive MS, and data remain on track for 2015. We also initiated a Phase II proof-of-concept study in acute ischemic stroke. The study will utilize an imaging endpoint to assess infarct size, and determine if TYSABRI, given immediately post-stroke, can lessen lymphocyte-mediated tissue damage to the brain.","For the PLEGRIDY program. During the year, we obtained positive Phase III data from year 1 of the 2-year advanced study in relapsing-remitting MS patients. Patients in the study were dosed with PLEGRIDY, administered either once every 2 weeks or once every 4 weeks. PLEGRIDY has been filed for approval with the FDA and EMA, and remains on track for anticipated FDA approval decision in mid-2014, and an EMA decision in the second half of 2014 as well.","During the year, we generated new clinical data, which further supports the potential of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX as effective hemophilia therapies, with reduced dosing frequency, and which we believe will lead to better outcomes for patients. Both ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX were filed for approval with the FDA, and we're anticipating approvals for ALPROLIX in the second quarter of 2014 and for ELOCTATE in mid-2014.","So 2013 was a busy and productive year. I'll now discuss some of the upcoming R&D events. In mid-2014, we expect Phase III data for daclizumab in relapsing-remitting MS. Daclizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting CD25, a sub-unit of the IL2 receptor. Results from the Phase IIb SELECT study have demonstrated a robust impact on relapse rate and promising effects on slowing disability progression.","The ongoing Phase III DECIDE study is an 1,800 subject trial that compares monthly subcutaneously-administered daclizumab to interferon beta treatment. Primary endpoint of the study is the reduction in annualized relapse rate.","Turning to our mid-stage pipeline. We expect to have 6 proof-of-concept or proof of biology readouts during the year, including data on anti-LINGO and acute optic neuritis, BIIB037 in Alzheimer's disease, neublastin in neuropathic pain, STX-100 in IPF, as well as for a few of our partnered programs, SMNrx and SMA and anti-CD40 ligand in lupus.","Anti-LINGO is a monoclonal antibody that, in preclinical studies, promotes remyelination in axonal protection. There are 2 Phase II proof-of-concept trials underway: One in acute optic neuritis and the other in MS.","In the acute optic neuritis study, we're testing if anti-LINGO treatment is able to improve conduction of the optic nerve. Data generated in the optic neuritis study will provide important proof-of-biology data in an acute demyelination setting, and may be helpful for future development efforts in MS.","The ongoing second anti-LINGO study in patients with relapsing-remitting MS and relapsing SPMS measures several clinical imaging and biomarker endpoints to help define the potential Phase III clinical endpoints. Data from the Phase II MS study is expected in the second half of 2015.","BIIB037 is a human anti-beta amyloid monoclonal antibody for Alzheimer's disease. The ongoing Phase Ib study incorporates imaging at the start to confirm that subjects have quantifiable beta-amyloid. The study will utilize serial imaging to measure the ability of BIIB037 to deplete flack beta-amyloid levels in the CNS. The trial also incorporates FDG-PET imaging to assess restoration of brain synaptic activity, as well as exploratory measures of cognition.","Neublastin is a novel biologic therapy for neuropathic pain, another disease with significant unmet medical need, where current therapies are inadequate. Neublastin interacts with the GFR alpha3 receptor on pain-sensing neurons, and has been shown to promote nerve regeneration in preclinical models of nerve crush. We believe this may allow neublastin to promote rapid pain relief and also to be disease-modifying by promoting nerve repair. In the ongoing Phase II study, we'll assess clinical measures of pain in sciatica patients with peripheral nerve injury.","STX-100 is our antibody underdevelopment for the treatment of IPF, a progressive and almost uniformly-fatal disease. STX-100 targets the alpha(v)beta(6) integrin, which is selectively up regulated in several fibrotic diseases, and is essential for activating the TGF-beta signaling process in these tissues. We're conducting an innovative Phase IIa dose-ranging study that uses biomarkers to confirm target engagement and dose responsiveness. Using quantitative assays developed in preclinical studies, we'll measure the ability of STX-100 to inhibit downstream TGF-beta signaling, a pathway known to drive the fibrotic process.","We're also expecting important data from some of our partnered programs. ISIS-SMNRx is an antisense molecule and development for spinal muscular atrophy. There are 2 ongoing Phase II studies: One in infants with type 1 SMA, and the other in children with type 2, 3 SMA. Isis is moving these studies forward, and expects to have data in the first quarter of this year.","Data from these studies is expected to provide a clearer understanding of dosing parameters and of the preliminary clinical activity of SMNrx, and will inform the design of the next stage of the clinical program.","During the second half of 2014, we also expect Phase Ib data from our partner UCB for anti-CD40 ligand in general SLE. CD40 mediated signaling is involved in the regulation of both B and T-cell responses, which are aberrant in lupus patients.","I look forward to discussing the results of these studies with you during the year. I'll now pass the call on to Paul.","Paul J. Clancy","Thanks, Doug. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.92 in the fourth quarter, and $7.81 for the full year. The differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial results are outlined in the earnings presentation. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $2.34 and $8.96 for the full year.","Total revenue for Q4 grew 39% to approximately $2 billion, and grew 26% for the full year to $6.9 billion. Fourth quarter AVONEX worldwide revenue was $751 million. For the full year, worldwide AVONEX revenue grew 3%, and surpassed $3 billion.","In the U.S., Q4 AVONEX revenue increased 2%, to $475 million. For the full year, U.S. AVONEX revenue increased 6%, to $1.9 billion.","Outside the U.S., Q4 AVONEX revenue was $277 million, a decrease of 3% compared to the prior year. And for the full year, international AVONEX revenue decreased 1%, to $1.1 billion.","Foreign exchange weakened AVONEX international revenue for the full year by approximately $9 million, compared to a $25 million gain in the prior year.","TYSABRI worldwide revenue, net of hedging, was $427 million in Q4. These results were comprised of $251 million in the U.S. and $176 million internationally. For the full year, worldwide TYSABRI revenue to Biogen Idec was $1.5 billion, net of hedging. We recorded U.S. revenue of $814 million and $712 million internationally.","The final approval of the settlement with AIFA is still pending. As a result, fourth quarter TYSABRI revenue was unfavorably impacted by $14 million of deferred revenue and $54 million for the full year.","Global Q4 TECFIDERA revenue was $398 million in Q4 and $876 million for the full year. U.S. TECFIDERA revenue includes incremental inventory build of approximately $42 million in Q4.","Turning to our anti-CD20 franchise, which now includes GAZYVA. U.S. profit share was $253 million for Q4 and $1.1 billion for the full year. Royalties and profit-sharing sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. was $17 million in Q4 and $39 million for the full year. The result was $269 million of net revenue from unconsolidated joint business for Q4 and $1.1 billion for the full year.","Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q4 non-GAAP cost of goods sold were $259 million or 13% of revenue. For the full year, non-GAAP COGS were $858 million, or 12% of revenue. The increase year-over-year was driven by TYSABRI contingent payments in third-party royalties.","Q4 non-GAAP R&D expense was $421 million, or 21% of revenue, an increase of 22% over last year, in part driven by our recently-announced agreement with Samsung Bioepis where we recorded a $36 million R&D charge. For the full year, non-GAAP R&D expense was $1.4 billion, or 21% of revenue. Q4 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $495 million, or 25% of revenue, an increase of 32% over prior year. For the full year, non-GAAP SG&A expense was $1.7 billion, or 24% of revenue, an increase of 32% over 2012. These increases were primarily due to the investments on TECFIDERA and the anticipated hemophilia launches.","Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was 28.8%, driven by a larger percentage of our profits coming from within the U.S. due to the strong U.S. launch of TECFIDERA. We expect our tax rate to remain at this level through 2014 due to U.S. profits, but believe this rate will decline in 2015 and 2016.","Our weighted average diluted shares were 238 million, and we ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion in cash and marketable securities, of which approximately 85% is within the U.S. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $8.96 for the full year, an increase of 37%.","Now I'll turn to the full year 2014 guidance. We expect total revenue growth between 22% and 25%. Let me characterize how we're thinking about our products. Our plan assumes TECFIDERA will represent the largest contributor to our revenue growth. In the U.S., we anticipate the rate of patient switches in TECFIDERA new prescriptions to moderate.","In the EU, our business plan assumes TECFIDERA is approved in Q1. And as Tony described, we expect a gradual country rollout over the next 6 to 18 months. And we anticipate Germany will make up the majority of TECFIDERA revenue outside the U.S. in 2014.","We believe TYSABRI is now largely through the abnormally high discontinuations in the U.S., experienced during the initial months of the tech launch. In Italy, we continue to pursue a resolution with the settlement of AIFA, however, our 2014 guidance does not include the impact of this settlement, as the timing of the final approval remains uncertain.","Moving to AVONEX and PLEGRIDY. Our plan assumes a midyear launch of PLEGRIDY in the U.S. and a second half launch in Europe, with Germany being the primary contributor. We believe we're well-positioned with AVONEX and PLEGRIDY and anticipate gaining share within the declining injectable segment.","Based upon current approval timelines in our anticipation of a gradual uptake for ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE, we expect revenue from our hemophilia product launches in 2014 to be quite modest. We expect R&D expense between 20% and 22% of sales. We expect this spending will move to greater investment in mid and early stage development programs. Additionally, this guidance includes strategic investments as we've earmarked over $200 million for potential business development opportunities in 2014. Our focus remains on building out our early stage pipeline.","SG&A expense is expected to be between 22% and 23% of total revenue. We expect to continue to see upward pressure in SG&A dollars in 2014, driven by investments in TECFIDERA in the EU and from the anticipated hemophilia launches. As a result, we anticipate non-GAAP EPS results between $11 and $11.20, and GAAP EPS to be between $9.74 and $9.94.","I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments.","George A. Scangos","Okay. Thanks, Paul. So in 2013, the company has strong financial results, coupled with excellent operational progress, which position us well for the future. And as I think about 2014, we appear to be at an inflection point, going from 2 major marketed products in 2012 to 3 in 2013, and now to potentially up to 6.","This type of growth will be a challenge for most organizations, and we're no different. It's essential that we successfully complete the registration processes and effectively launch each of our products, while we continue to focus on the needs of tomorrow. So with many accomplishments behind us, and with patients as a focal point of our work, we'll continue to focus on execution.","As leaders in MS, we're committed to identify and develop medicines for the great unmet needs that still remain. Today's treatments help slow the progression rate, but for approximately 1\/4 of patients, secondary-progressive MS remains an issue, with no approved medicines on the market.","We're committed to advance TYSABRI and SPMS to potentially offer a new option for this important group of patients. We're also developing anti-LINGO, with a hope to halt or reverse MS damage. If anti-LINGO does work, it will represent the first therapy to actually repair CNS pathology, which potentially opens up a new way of understanding how to deal with diseases of the brain.","The potential approval and upcoming launches of ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE for hemophilia patients will mark an important new chapter for Biogen Idec. ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE represent true innovation for patients and a significant long-term opportunity for the company. Hemophilia is an area where there's been minimal innovation for many years. This gives us an opportunity to change the prophylactic treatment paradigm from short-acting to long-lasting therapies. We believe that this may lead to a lower burden of disease, improve compliance and better outcomes.","Finally, we need to ensure that we continue to drive innovation by bringing the best science to the company. Our R&D strategy concentrates on neurology, immunology, non-malignant hematology in adjacent diseases, where patients have poor therapeutic options today. We prioritize indications in which we have a good understanding of disease etiology, and make prudent decisions in advancing compounds in the clinic. We also need to continue to seek business development opportunities that will strengthen our research capacities and complement our novel pipeline.","In closing, as always, I'd like to thank our employees for their continued hard work and dedication. I'm very proud of the many accomplishments that we achieved together last year. As an organization, we've advanced the business to make a meaningful difference in patients' lives.","So thanks to all of you for joining us this morning, and we'll now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ravi Mehrotra - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First part, probably for George. You've recently talked more about business development, and obviously, [indiscernible] and the provisioning -- the 2 remaining goals provision for 2014. Can you give us more color on the type and characteristics of the deals you envisage? And part 2, probably for Tony. Interested in your view on 3x a week Copaxone and potentially generic Copaxone rights [ph] in this year impact on the MS market?","George A. Scangos","Ravi, good catch actually. For the past 2 years, we've done a number of business development transactions, but we had no earmarked business development budget. And we were able to fund those out of the R&D budget or other ways we have managed to find the money to do that. This year, we've earmarked $200 million for business development activities. And I think that reflects our belief that these are very important to the future of our company. We've improved the science in the company. I think we've improved the throughput of our internal R&D group, but that won't supply all of the compounds that we need to go forward. So part of that $200 million will go to bolster our pipeline, and we're looking primarily for Phase I, Phase II compounds, maybe late preclinical. Part of it will go to increase our technology platform. I mean last year, we did deals with Adimab, and one of the deals we did with Isis really were to give us a better platform to increase the quality and the speed of our internal R&D, and we'll continue to do some deals in that nature as well. So I think we'll look for both pipeline additions in the 3 areas that I mentioned, as well as technologies that increase the efficiency of our own R&D.","Stuart A. Kingsley","So 3x a week cop in the plan expected. Look, I think 2 things happen. The first is, it will create competitiveness noise in the marketplace, which we are prepared to deal with. The second thing is, it's going to put something like 85,000 patients in play for switch. We think we have good alternatives for those patients, so we're going to have a strong presence in offices competing for that. Generic cop, also in the plan, also expected. First-order impact we think will be on branded Copaxone itself. Second-order impact is it will add to the toolkit that the payers have to put some pressure on the credit category. We have said that there's more pressure on gross than net. That's a little bit -- that has been a piece of that story that we've been telling in the guidance we've been giving on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Sort of another big picture R&D question, maybe for George. The guidance is calling for 25% or so year-on-year growth in that line. I think when you joined the company a few years ago, you suggested you were going to bring down R&D to maybe 20% of sales long term. I think the question is, what convinces you you're going to get a good return on the incremental R&D spend? Obviously, you can afford it, but just a good investment or not? And are you still targeting more like a 20% of revenue long-term target?","George A. Scangos","Yes, well, somewhere in that range is the honest answer to that question. We don't target a particular percentage of revenues to R&D. Look, I think most important thing for me, Eric, in our R&D budget is that we don't waste money. That we don't spend money on projects that are just dragging on and haven't met their goals, that are not well thought through, and they're not critically executed and are not competitive. And so when I first came and when Doug came, we eliminated a lot of projects that we thought met those criteria. And so we are going forward now with a pipeline where we believe meets the criteria that we have there, well thought-out, there's good basis for taking them forward. It doesn't mean they're all going to work, of course, but they're all good bets. And so that's the way we think about R&D. As we -- our revenues are -- we anticipate that they will grow. And the percentage we spend on R&D next year may not be the same as we spend the year after as our revenues continue to grow, R&D may not increase at the same rate. So it may come down over time, but we believe we have to make some investments now and -- to generate the pipeline and the value that will continue to give us growth a few years out. And we are very cognizant of not wasting that money. I think we are very critical of how we spend that money.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I know Doug is there. I don't know if Al is there. But I wanted to maybe ask my question on anti-LINGO, if I may. I just think this is an area people are pretty focused on from a stock perspective. And maybe just take a couple of minutes and just walk us through the -- what you know from the preclinical data? And then in humans, do you know that this drug crosses the blood-brain barrier in sufficient quality -- in sufficient quantities that exert the effect that you need. And related to that, the trial that you're doing, I think, if I'm reading controls correctly, an optic neuritis has just one dose? So can you help us understand how we can have confidence that you know that you've already nailed those? And then when you all see the data later this year, should we -- do you think that there's a requirement for statistical significance? Or is this trial just way too small to hold it up to that kind of a standard and how would you move forward? So that's a lot of questions, but basically just walk us through the anti-LINGO proposition, what we know -- what we should be expecting from the trial, and specifically blood-brain barrier and brain concentrations in those?","Douglas Edward Williams","Mark, this is Doug. You have both Al and me here on the call. So we'll tag team the answer. Let me address the one that you just came back to; which is, does the drug actually cross the blood-brain barrier? And the answer to that is, yes. We know that from the Phase I study, both the SAD and MAD study, we actually looked at CSF levels of the antibody in patients who received the anti-LINGO antibody. And what we found was detectable levels of the antibody that roughly matched the levels that we knew were efficacious in the mouse models of remyelination. That was a key observation in those studies. We wanted to make sure that across the dose range we were testing in both single-dose and multiple-dose format, that we could, in fact, get to a level of drug in the CSF that was consistent with efficacious doses in the animal models. So we can check that box off. Your question about optic neuritis and why did we only choose one dose, we choice the highest dose. Remember that we're viewing this is as a proof of biology study. So we wanted to run a placebo-controlled study looking at the highest dose of drug versus placebo, and really simply asking the question of whether or not we could facilitate remyelination and thereby measure that quantitatively with the endpoints in the study. And I'll let Al talk to you a little about some of the sort of basic biology observations that had driven our enthusiasm for the program from the beginning.","Alfred W. Sandrock","So in terms of the preclinical experiment, there were 2 types, the in vitro experiments and the animal experiments. And let me just briefly say that in vitro, what we did was we added anti-LINGO or we decreased LINGO expression by other methods and we can get oligodendrocyte precursor cells to differentiate much better when you have less LINGO present. And when you throw in neurons into the same cultures, you do co-cultures, we actually see myelin formation, and many of our colleagues externally have been doing that -- that type of experiment for years, had never seen myelin quite as well formed in vitro before blocking LINGO. In the animal experiment, there were sort of 2 types there. One is the knockout experiments and the overexpression experiment. And if you knockout LINGO from a mouse, you see early myelination in the spinal cord, which is functional so that it improves nerve conduction in the spinal cord when -- in the LINGO knockout animals where you have early myelination. In the other animal studies, what we did was induced demyelination by several methods. One, by using a detergent, focally, injected focally or by feeding the animals cuprizone, or by inducing EAE, so an autoimmune attack against myelin. And each of these 3 animal models of demyelination, we saw rapid reconstitution of myelin, and we know it was remyelination because when we did electro microscopy, we saw very thin, but the kinds of myelin that we expect to see in remyelination, so it's thinner than normal. And also, we had improvement in function in the EAE animal, so that they move better. So -- and I think as Doug pointed out, we were very careful in each of those experiment to understand the concentration of anti-LINGO that was necessary to produce these in vivo effects. And so we took that information into the human studies. Moreover, what we did was we used larger animals were we could test out some of the novel imaging methods, such as magnetization transfer ratio and diffusion sensor imaging to verify that we could actually look at remyelination using these imaging methods. And we're applying those same methods that we used in the animal models in the humans. So it's all novel. We're in new territory here. And as George pointed out, not everything is going to work, but we're very excited.","George A. Scangos","I think you had one other question about the possibility of seeing a real treatment effect in the relapsing-remitting study. That's ongoing, the second of our Phase II studies. And that's a very robust study in the sense that it's 4 different doses of anti-LINGO versus placebo. We're looking at a broad array of potential endpoints, some of which we hope would represent the primary endpoint for a Phase III study. But candidly, as Al said, this is new territory. So we're learning which of these endpoints is going to actually be the most sensitive measure of a remyelinating event, and then carrying that forward into the design of the Phase III study. So it's very innovative, very broad clinical program, but it is also a very proper, straightforward Phase IIb dose-ranging study that's very robustly designed to look at a variety of potential treatment effects.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Actually, just wanted to follow up on the one on anti-LINGO. So, Al, you mentioned the larger studies or studies in larger animals to look at imaging. Was just wondering if that employed systemic delivery or local delivery of anti-LINGO. And if you looked at the concentration in those animals, was wondering how that compared to the mouse models you mentioned given you used local delivery there.","Alfred W. Sandrock","Well, we actually did both local and systemic. And in many of the later experiments, it was almost all systemic, so. And they were nonhuman primate models where we injected lysolecithin, but what was local was the lysolecithin injection, which was done directly into the corpus callosum which is a heavily myelinated fiber track. But we gave the anti-LINGO systemically and looked by MTR.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Porges with Bernstein.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Maybe I'll continue on the same vein, Doug and Al. Could you give us the same explanation of your confidence in the SPMS study for TYSABRI, certainly a big incremental market, but conventional wisdom has been more of a gradual degenerative process rather than inflammatory one. So what's the basis biologically for committing to that? And secondly, related to that, do you have any other short-term goal in SPMS in the rest of your portfolio? Are there any of these other early drugs that you might contemplate in that disease?","Alfred W. Sandrock","So SPMS, there's 2 sort of largely 2 prevailing theories. One is that, it's purely a neurodegenerative process, whether it's a primary process or whether it's secondary to demyelination people argue about that. The other theory, though, is that there's ongoing inflammation, but it's a different type of inflammation. It's inflammation that is sort of behind blood-brain barrier that there are these germinal -- ectopic germinal centers that form the lymphoid follicles that form in the sub-meningeal space. These have been associated with cortical areas of cortical demyelination. And so -- whereas the inflammation that's due to peripheral white blood cells entering the brain may be less, there is this lymphoid follicle idea. Now the thing about TYSABRI is that it disrupts the formation of these lymphoid follicles, and we think that, not only from the animal experiments, but in humans, we see a decrease in the chemokine signature that's been associated with the lymphoid follicles. And so that's why from a biological point of view, we think that TYSABRI, SPMS has a decent chance. Now the other reason why we're optimistic cautiously is that we're using a more sensitive endpoint in the clinic to get as a composite measure of disability progression. And we've gotten agreement with FDA under SPA and also we've gotten good agreement with European regulators on the use of this model endpoint. So for both of those reasons, we're cautiously optimistic about TYSABRI, SPMS.","Douglas Edward Williams","And Jeff, this is Doug. As far as other shots on goal, as you described it, obviously, the anti-LINGO program is also geared towards the possibility of working in secondary progressive, but primary progressive as well. There's a possibility for that drug across the spectrum of MS subtypes. There's also some discussion about the possibility of taking TECFIDERA in that direction. You could, again, based on what Al described about the possibility of there being an immune component, that is involved in some patients with SPMS. Obviously, there's a mechanism that makes sense there with TECFIDERA in terms of down-modulating immune responses. But also the possibility of improving neuronal protection with the antioxidant effects of that molecule. So that's a sensible thing for us to consider. Stay tuned for more information on that as we consider that one. And then from the standpoint of where are we focusing our basic science resources and our neurology discovery program, it's primary and secondary progressive disease. I mean, that's really the focus for new target discovery and validation, really to try to understand the pathways that are involved better. That's where the real opportunity and need is from our perspective over the long term, and we're really focusing the basic science, resources in our neurology discovery group in that direction.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So I'm going to move to commercial a little bit in TECFIDERA, and it's sort of a two-part question. One, for Paul, inventory was -- that sounds like it's $134 million for the year, it's about 5 weeks. I mean, historically, for products that are launching kind of 4 to 5 weeks is typical as they grow. So I'm trying to get a sense, is that -- should we even think of it as kind of sort of real inventory? Or is that going to be just a normal churn that you're going to see in the growth product and it's going to get slowly, over time, to 2 weeks kind of range? And then secondly, just on the commercial, the new patients and the returning quitters are 30%. I'm trying -- I don't know if you could split it better, kind of what's new versus returning? And do you -- that's been kind of consistent. Do you think that -- it sounds like you're thinking it's going down, and then why is that?","Paul J. Clancy","Yes. Let me start with the inventory question, Yaron. Great question. The 5 weeks represent the combined inventory in wholesalers, as well as the SPPs, specialty pharmacies. So given the way we launched in the United States, we actually have that visibility all the way through. When we talk about just -- and then just to note, when we talk about AVONEX, the visibility we have really is just wholesalers. And the combination of -- when we talk about AVONEX, we try to -- in the United States, we try to look at around 2 weeks, which is what we also look at in wholesalers specifically, which is what we look at for TECFIDERA, and then SPPs make up the balance of that to get to 5. And I think that -- we think in the United States that, that represents, so the cumulative amount right now represents about what we will have for our run rate. As we move to 2014, it really will depend on kind of the sales trajectory of tech in the U.S., whether or not there's a little bit more upward pressure, but I think it's really just more indicative of the launch year.","Stuart A. Kingsley","Yes, Yaron, it's Tony. On the 30% new to therapy, frankly, difficult to break that down to measure what the mix of genuinely na\u00efve versus potentially returning quitters. There are constantly some returning quitters into the market and some people that go out of the market, so it is a portion that's difficult to break down. I think what we've said launched data prior quarters that we thought that number was around 25%. So it's actually up a little bit in the recent quarter. Not clear that, that should go down. We think it's an encouraging statement. It's an encouraging statement about the market acceptance of the product, that it's becoming a -- it's capturing a meaningful share of new patient starts that speaks to the confidence the market has in the product profile.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","A question maybe for Al or Doug on SMNrx. I know there's some data coming soon. We've seen previous childhood data, but there's also infantile data coming. Just wanted to understand what you can actually glean from infant data? And whether you're looking at anything else besides mortality in the short study, gene copies, maybe measurements of SMN protein. Is there anything you can glean out of that, that can help give us some confidence, obviously, rather than going into Phase III a little bit blind?","Alfred W. Sandrock","Yes. I mean, in the infantile study, we're looking at things like weight gain. Are the kids -- are the babies gaining weight on a trajectory. Normally, they start to lose weight because they get muscle atrophy. But the main thing is to look at survival and ventilator dependence. Those are the 2 key events that we're looking at.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a quick one, again, on LINGO. So you've talked before about optic neuritis disease as new lesions and relapse-remitting, we have new and old lesions. So just curious in the relapse-remitting MS study, will you able to see if LINGO by imaging has an impact on new and old lesions and how are you doing that? And how does this effect -- ultimately if these trials are successful, does it matter? How does this affect the market opportunity?","Alfred W. Sandrock","Well, yes, we can look at old and new lesions in the relapsing-remitting study. We anticipate that the patients who come into that study will have lesions that have been there potentially for years. And they recognize that it's T2-hyperintense lesions. And so we often talk about burden of disease, and we look at T2-hyperintense lesions. So we can look at those lesions that are no longer enhancing. They're so old that there's no inflammation or blood-brain barrier breakdown, and yet we can see -- look into those lesions and see whether they change their imaging characteristics that would be consistent with remyelination. I think if that were to occur, if old lesions start to remyelinate, then you can treat people who are in the late stages of SPMS even when they have no new lesions forming, and that's what happens in SPMS, is that the number of new lesions that form start to get very, very infrequent, nevertheless they continue to progress in terms of disability. So it would indicate that you could go pretty broadly all the way from the very earliest events in MS to the late stages of secondary-progressive MS, and as Doug pointed out, potentially even primary progressive MS.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rachel McMinn with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, I was hoping you could talk about discontinuation rates on U.S. TECFIDERA. Paul, I didn't quite catch what you said was assumed in your guidance for 2014? And then apologies, but another LINGO question. You guys had said last -- 2 weeks ago that you felt that if there was positive proof of principal data for optic neuritis that, that could help you accelerate your MS Phase III plans. And I was just trying to understand the gap between when you have data in second half of 2014 in optic neuritis and when you get your MS data in the back half of 2015, what kind of things would you be doing that would accelerate plan?","Stuart A. Kingsley","Rachel, it's Tony. On discontinuation rates, look, we don't think it's settled out yet because we're still in a pretty dynamic portion of the trajectory. But we said it appears that TECFIDERA is headed what is sort of a normal discontinuation rate for therapy to the market. No evidence that suggests it's going to be dramatically better, no evidence that suggests it's going to be dramatically worse. For existing products, including the orals, we think those numbers tend to run in the low 20% -- low-20% range.","Paul J. Clancy","And Rachel, that's consistent with what's essentially embedded in the guidance.","Douglas Edward Williams","And Rachel, this is Doug. With respect to a positive readout from the optic neuritis study and the impact that could have on the time line for the relapsing-remitting study, essentially, there's a lot of study start-up activities, there's a lot of planning activities that go on with respect to designing the protocol. A lot of that can get front-loaded, and we would likely spend some additional money at risk based on a positive outcome from the optic neuritis study, anticipating a positive outcome in the relapsing-remitting study. So yes, it's hard to give you specifics on exactly what those steps would be, but there's a lot of legwork that goes into planning for a study, which we could move up and likely would if we had a robust readout in the optic neuritis study.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.","Charles Anthony Butler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Again, apologies, but back to LINGO very briefly. When you think about remyelination, how do you come to grips with the notion that remyelination is actually occurring contiguously? And you're going to say, \"Well we do get functionality in some of the non-primate models.\" But the part B of the question is, that may be true, but aren't these animals still youthful and growing, and therefore, the translation into an adult MS patient or young adult MS patient might actually be substantially different than a young and growing animal? I'm just curious how you -- if there's more data behind that.","Alfred W. Sandrock","Yes. So there is some spontaneous remyelination if you will going on in MS patients. It's just incomplete. And some of the data suggests that there are groups of patient that do it better than others. Certainly, younger people do seem to remyelinate better than others, but there may be inherent differences among people in terms of their ability to remyelinate. And so we would like to boost what we think is a natural phenomenon that's not very complete, and it's certainly not in all patients. And then in terms of the growing animals. I mean, we do -- it's true and mice, they are growing, but in a non-human primates, they were older animals. And so we think that the data are still suggestive that we could have efficacy in the adult MS patients we're treating.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Had a few for Tony. So when we think about the rollout of TECFIDERA in Germany, are there any subtleties in the MS market versus the U.S. in terms of the distribution of na\u00efve patients or quitters? And then when you -- many of the initial TECFIDERA patients in the U.S. were on TYSABRI for quite a while, so just curious what you see today from TYSABRI switches to TECFIDERA.","Stuart A. Kingsley","Yes. So good question. Not dramatic differences I don't think in German market. Among European markets, like the U.S., it does tend to have a pretty broad sort of more community based set of positions as opposed to being just center-based. We'll put promotional effort against it that makes sense for that kind of market. So hard to articulate the big differences from sort of market and patient characteristic standpoint. In terms of TYSABRI switches, we did see, as we said, a bolus of switches at around the launch of TECFIDERA in the months following that. And then the majority of those were going to TECFIDERA. The discontinuation rate on TYSABRI in the U.S. has moderated since that time. We are still seeing a meaningful portion of those go to TECFIDERA. So we're keeping them within the franchise, which is, obviously, net positive.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I actually wanted to ask about STX-100. I was wondering if you could talk about the endpoints you're looking at the Phase II trial. What you need to see in that trial as a basis for a go or no-go decision? And then finally, the clinical regulatory pass if it is a go. Can you move straight in to Phase III here or is that too aggressive of an assumption? And then related strategically, does this drug fit into your portfolio? And if it's successful, is this a new vertical or is there some other plan for the product?","Douglas Edward Williams","Okay. I'll try to get all of those, if I can. This is Doug. So with respect to the endpoint of the Phase IIa study data that will readout this year, it is really a biomarker driven study, and it's based off of some nonhuman primate work that was done with a molecule to allow us to look directly at the TGF-beta signaling pathway. Remember that that's how this drug works. It basically blocks an activator of the TGF-beta pathway that's specifically up-regulated in tissues undergoing fibrosis like the lung in IPF patients. So we're administering increasing doses of the antibody, 8 weekly doses. And then we'll be harvesting bronchoalveolar lavage cells directly from the lung from these patients, and assessing the TGF-beta signaling pathway, looking at the immediate downstream signaling event when TGF-beta binds to its receptor. That's the [indiscernible] endpoint. That's a very quantitative way of looking at that signaling pathway. There's also a collection of genes that are up-regulated, again, downstream of TGF-beta binding to its receptor, and we validated those endpoints in the primate preclinical studies. And so what we're looking for in this study is -- and in addition to the TGF-beta signaling pathway, in a dose-dependent fashion, taking cells directly from patients with IPF, directly from the tissue of interest. We think that, that will give us really good insights into the appropriate dose to take forward into the next clinical study, which we haven't yet defined whether that will be a Phase III study or whether that would be a Phase II, III type study. Again, we're still working through that. But with respect to -- right to Phase III, it's really going to be a function of how robust that data is. As far as strategic, we have identified fibrosis as one of the areas of expansion for the organization. It's sort of a logical extension beyond the chronic inflammation space that we're already in with some of our programs. And fibrosis is the consequence of long-standing inflammation in many different diseases. So we see it as a natural adjacency to the immunology portfolio. And it's a specialty market, which fits very well with the type of drug candidates that we're going to be developing in the various markets that we're in. So we see it as really a perfect fit with the expansion plans for the organization in terms of our R&D portfolio and eventually our sales programs.","Operator","I now turn the conference back over to our presenters.","George A.

[Operator Instructions] Ms. Wendy Gabel, Vice President, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Wendy Gabel","Thank you, and welcome to Biogen Idec's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogenidec.com to find the press release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures that we'll discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results, which we believe better represents the ongoing economics of our business and reflects how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. As usual, we'll start with the safe harbor statement.

Words such as believe, expect, may, plan, will and similar expressions are intended to identify such statements. Actual results could differ materially from our expectations, and you should carefully review the risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings slides, earnings release and in the Risk Factors section of our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC.

We'll also be joined for the Q&A portion of the call by Dr. Al Sandrock, Senior Vice President of Development Sciences and Chief Medical Officer. ","Now I'll turn the call over to George.","George A. Scangos","Okay. Thanks, Wendy, and good morning, everyone. By now, I'm sure that most of you had a chance to review our press release for the first quarter of 2012. We reported revenue growth of 7% year-over-year to $1.3 billion and earnings per share of $1.40. ","While most of our performance measures met or exceeded expectations, the EPS number, of course, is below the external estimates, although it is in line with our internal estimates. While every quarter includes a lot of gives and takes, this quarter was a bit more complicated than usual. The bottom line, though, is that AVONEX orders were below expectations in January and without this factor we would have met the external estimates, even with a significant investment for the future that we made during the quarter. ","So the question is whether or not there's an underlying issue with the AVONEX business or whether there were isolated factors that contributed to the January results, and the answer is basically good news. We believe that the fundamental demand for AVONEX remains solid and that the January revenues were the result of isolated events, which we'll go into a little later in the call. ","While we're not satisfied with these events, we're heartened by the fact that AVONEX sales rebounded quickly with both revenues and units on track in February and March. ","So let me now turn to the many positive aspects of the quarter. Both TYSABRI and RITUXAN delivered double-digit revenue growth in Q1, and TYSABRI was particularly strong with 14% year-over-year growth. ","TYSABRI net patient adds continued to show strength, as we began to roll out risk stratification based on JC virus antibody status to the neurology community. RITUXAN also had a strong quarter and sales of FAMPYRA in EU were encouraging. All of these aspects, of course, are positive and with AVONEX back on track, we're quite optimistic about the full year. Paul will go into the details, but I just want say here that we believe we're now on track to achieve an EPS this year of greater than $6.15. ","During the first quarter, we achieved a number of very important product and pipeline milestones. The AVONEX PEN was approved in the U.S. and launched last week, improving AVONEX administration for patients and reinvigorating physician interest. ","We simultaneously received approval for the titration kit, known as AVOSTARTGRIP, which will help reduce the incidence and severity of flu-like symptoms for new AVONEX patients. We gained FDA approval to include the JC virus antibody status as part of risk stratification for PML in the U.S. TYSABRI label. This change allows the sales force to talk to physicians and health care professionals about all 3 factors of risk stratification, which is a very important step towards realizing the full potential of this therapy. ","At the American Academy of Neurology meeting last week, our pipeline was the subject of 49 platform presentations and posters, including new data for TYSABRI, BG-12, FAMPYRA, daclizumab, dexpramipexole and Anti-Lingo. ","We were able to present the full data for CONFIRM, the second registrational trial for BG-12, and highlight the efficacy and safety data for the program. The AAN also provided a platform for us to showcase the AVONEX PEN and titration kit for the U.S. market. We made further progress this quarter ongoing our early-stage pipeline with our acquisition of Stromedix, thereby adding to our pipeline a novel humanized monoclonal antibody for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or IPF.","IPF is a debilitating and almost uniformly fatal disease in which patients experience progressive difficulty breathing due to scarring of the lung. More than 200,000 patients in the U.S. and Europe have IPF, and there is a high unmet need for better therapies for these patients. ","Adding to our early-stage pipeline, we entered a collaboration with ISIS earlier this quarter under which our companies will develop and commercialize ISIS anti-sense investigational drug for the treatment of Spinal Muscular Atrophy or SMA. ","SMA is a genetic neuromuscular disease characterized by muscle atrophy and weakness and it is the most common genetic cause of infant mortality. And of course most notably, we submitted applications for marketing approval of BG-12 in the U.S. and the EU this quarter, ahead of our internal target. And I'd like to thank the BG-12 team and the many people of Biogen Idec who worked many hours to make this happen. Our EU application has been validated by the EMA and is formally under review. As most of you know, a couple of months have passed since we filed the BG-12 NDA with the FDA. All of our interactions with the agency to date, including recent conversations, have led us to believe that our application is on track and will be accepted with standard review. ","We anticipate a confirmatory letter of acceptance within a couple of weeks. We continue to make progress in our clinical programs as well. Factor VIII, Factor IX and dexpramipexole remain on track for data readouts later this year, and PEGylated Interferon for a readout in the first part of next year. So all in all, a very productive quarter for product and pipeline accomplishments. ","So let me now turn the call over to Doug Williams, Head of R&D, and I'll come back at the end for a few concluding comments.","Douglas Edward Williams","Thanks, George. During Q1, we continued to make progress on several aspects of our R&D programs, starting with important advances on the regulatory front. ","This quarter, the FDA approved the AVONEX PEN, the first intramuscular auto injector, and simultaneously approved AVOSTARTGRIP, a new dose titration regimen. As you know, we submitted BG-12 for marketing approval with the FDA and EMA earlier this year. As George indicated, we believe we are on track for the U.S. review process and expect a confirmatory letter in the coming weeks stating that our NDA has been accepted. ","In addition the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, has validated Biogen Idec's marketing authorization application for a review of BG-12 in the European Union, and we recently filed for marketing approval of BG-12 in Canada and Switzerland. ","The NDA filing for BG-12 was the largest Biogen Idec has done to date, and it was the commitment of many dedicated people that made this happen. We continue to move closer to making this potential new oral treatment for MS available for patients. ","Last week, important data on our neurology franchise were presented at the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting, where the strength and quality of our neurology pipeline was demonstrated with 49 company-sponsored platform and poster presentations. ","We shared comprehensive data for CONFIRM, the second registrational study of BG-12, at 3 platform presentations. Results from CONFIRM showed that BG-12 demonstrated strong efficacy across a variety of measures, including annualized relapse rate, and also met MRI endpoints in a cohort of patients, demonstrating a significant effect on these measures of disease activity. ","In a platform presentation focused on the safety profile of BG-12 and CONFIRM, both dose regimens of BG-12 showed favorable safety and tolerability profiles, which were consistent with those seen in DEFINE. The incidence of serious infection was slow and balanced across the study groups and there were no opportunistic infections. There were no malignancies seen in the BG-12 arms at CONFIRM, while there was one malignancy seen in the placebo and 4 malignancies seen in the Glaterimer Acetate arms of the trial. The most common side effects for BG-12 were flushing and GI events, which decreased substantially after the first month and resulted in a low incidence of discontinuations. ","Lastly, the poster presentation of a Phase I study of BG-12 in combination with aspirin in healthy volunteers demonstrated that the PK profile of BG-12 was not affected by aspirin and that pretreatment decreased the incidence and severity of BG-12-related flushing without any adverse impact on GI symptoms. ","Turning to TYSABRI. 14 posters and presentations were presented at this year's AAN meeting, highlighting the high standard of efficacy that TYSABRI has set in the MS market. The initial data from the TYSABRI observational program, or TOP, indicated that patients experienced significantly reduced annualized relapse rates after 4 years of treatment with TYSABRI and the level of disability progression, as measured by EDSS, remains stable over time. ","Additionally, interim results from the ongoing STRATIFY 2 trial supported what has been seen in other clinical research, where the overall anti-JCV antibody prevalence among MS patients was approximately 50% to 60%. Recall that the primary objective of STRATIFY 2 is to demonstrate, prospectively, that the PML risk in TYSABRI-treated patients who are anti-JCV antibody negative is lower than the PML risk in patients who are anti-JCV antibody positive. ","An interim analysis conducted with data collected as of February 2012 showed that there was a significantly lower incidence of PML in anti-JCV antibody negative versus positive patients. ","STRATIFY 2 also showed that anti-JCV antibody prevalence was lower in females than males and increased with age. Treatment with TYSABRI did not appear to affect patients' anti-JCV antibody status. ","Initial findings from the TYNERGY study, a 12-month trial looking at MS-related fatigue in patients with relapsing-remitting MS, showed that TYSABRI treatment was associated with improved MS-related fatigue. This result was very important, as 50% to 60% of MS patients report fatigue as one of their most disabling symptoms, which can contribute to both cognitive and physical difficulties. ","We also presented further details of the daclizumab SELECT trial in the scientific program highlights plenary session, as well as the baseline features of the EMPOWER study, our first Phase III clinical trial of dexpramipexole for patients with ALS. ","Since the design of EMPOWER and the entry criteria are the same as the Phase II trial, we're hopeful that we can replicate the results we saw in that study. ","Turning now to other important aspects of our MS pipeline. We presented data from 2 Phase I studies of Anti-Lingo monoclonal antibody or BIIB33 that has been shown an animal models to promote remyelination and axon survival. The first Phase I study was a single ascending dose study in healthy volunteers, while the second study was a multiple ascending dose study in patients with relapsing-remitting MS or secondary progressive MS. Primary endpoints for both studies were the incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events, as well as other safety evaluations. ","Secondary end points for both studies included several measures of serum and CSF levels of BIIB33. Data presented indicated that single and multiple doses of BIIB33 appear to be safe and well tolerated in both healthy subjects and subjects with MS, and that CSF levels achieved were in the predicted range needed for efficacy, based on animal models of demyelination. ","Importantly, the result supported advancing the development of the agent into Phase II proof of concept studies, which we expect to initiate in the second half of 2012. ","Moving on to other early-stage compounds in our portfolio, I'm pleased with the progress that we've made expanding our early-stage pipeline this quarter. Through the recent acquisition of Stromedix, we added STX-100, a noble humanized monoclonal antibody that disrupts the TGF-beta signaling pathway, specifically in tissues where fibrotic changes are occurring. ","We're excited about STX-100 because it exhibited significant activity in preclinical animal models of fibrotic disease and demonstrated an attractive safety and tolerability profile in the Phase I program. ","Stromedix has also identified a series of pathway-specific biomarkers in the lung to inform dose selection of STX-100 for proof of concept studies. Molecule has potential in several additional fibrotic indications, given the selective mechanism of action and the central role of TGF-beta in fibrosis. We expect to initiate the Phase II study in IPF by midyear. ","This quarter, we also began dosing patients in the Phase I program for ISIS-SMN for the treatment of Spinal Muscular Atrophy and expect to see results late in 2013. ","As we move forward into 2012, I look forward to providing you key top line data readouts from 3 pivotal trials in the second half of this year, namely the A-Long study of our long-lasting recombinant Factor VIII in Hemophilia A patients, the B-LONG study of our long-lasting recombinant Factor IX in Hemophelia B patients in the second half of 2012. And finally, the data readout from EMPOWER, the first study of dexpramipexole and ALS is expected in the fourth quarter of this year. ","With that, I'll now pass the call to Tony Kingsley, our EVP of Global Commercial Operations.","Tony Kingsley","Thank you, Doug. AVONEX continues to show resilience, and we believe our strategy of focusing on frontline execution to drive share gains within the ABC or E class is succeeding, both in the U.S. and internationally. ","In the U.S., unfavorable channel dynamics drove lower-than-anticipated unit shipments. We'll walk you through the channel dynamics in greater detail shortly. ","Outside the U.S., we continue to maintain our leading market share position, as the AVONEX PEN continues to drive healthy unit demand in the U.K., Germany, Canada and The Netherlands. ","Last week, we introduced the AVONEX PEN and AVOSTARTGRIP in the U.S. market. We believe these new innovations will help drive additional interest and allow for greater share of voice within the ABC or E market segments. The benefits of once weekly treatment and the importance of staying on therapy make AVONEX PEN an attractive option for patients. This message is driving share growth in countries where we've launched the PEN, and we believe we are poised to experience similar success in the U.S. market. ","Moving on to TYSABRI. First quarter global TYSABRI units increased 18%, while revenues to Biogen Idec increased 14% versus prior year. In the U.S., first quarter TYSABRI units grew 9% year-on-year. This is the sixth consecutive quarter where we've delivered unit growth for TYSABRI. ","Outside of the U.S., TYSABRI units grew 24% in the first quarter versus prior year. We saw positive patient trends during the first quarter, as we added over 1,900 net new patients. Commercially, we continue to drive TYSABRI's strong efficacy message, use the assay to build physician confidence with TYSABRI's benefit risk profile and move the product earlier in the treatment paradigm. ","Based on the U.S. data, discontinuation rates remain stable quarter-over-quarter and TOUCH forms increased at their highest level since 2008. TOUCH forms for newly diagnosed, previously untreated patients have historically been a low single-digit percentage, but were in the high single-digits this quarter. This provides us confidence our commercial strategy is succeeding. ","We continue to believe TYSABRI's growth may see periods of lumpiness in net patient adds, but we remain confident in an overall solid growth trajectory. ","The FAMPYRA launch continues to progress as planned, as the product became commercially available in Canada last month. This innovative therapy is also available in Germany, the U.K., Australia, Denmark, Norway and Iceland. ","We are actively working with government agencies across Europe to achieve favorable reimbursement. We expect feedback published from IQWIG tomorrow, which is the next step in the German process. ","At the same time, our team continues to drive awareness in the patient physician communities, which is leading to healthy patient demand. In addition to showcasing our world-class scientific research during AAN last week, the significant foot traffic at our booths during the conference was an indicator of physician interest in our recently introduced innovation, such as AVONEX PEN and titration kit and other commercial products. ","We are also making significant progress and are on track for successfully executing multiple potential product launches in the coming years. We expect an early 2013 launch for BG-12 and 2 launches in Hemophilia in 2013. ","As mentioned last quarter, we continue to make investments in product positioning and promotional planning, scientific outreach, shaping our patient support services and supplier chain. These developments, in addition to the strong patient demand in TYSABRI seen during the quarter, demonstrate our commitment and ability to drive longer-term commercial results, and we look forward to building upon this encouraging progress. ","With that, I will turn the call over to Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer.","Paul J. Clancy","Thanks, Tony. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.25 in the first quarter. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results are outlined in the earnings presentation and include $43 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles. ","Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.40. We had expected the first quarter to be impacted by the ANGIOMAX royalty stepping down and the $29 million payment to ISIS. So while we need to overcome the shortfall in AVONEX from Q1, we are on track for a full year financial plan. ","Let me now walk down the P&L. Total revenue for the first quarter grew 7% to $1.3 billion. In the U.S., AVONEX grew 3% to $401 million. Inventory in the channel ended at just over 2.2 weeks of slight decrease compared to the prior quarter. U.S. unit volume was down 8% versus both prior year and last quarter. ","As George noted, our AVONEX U.S. business was unfavorably impacted by what we believe were temporary channel-related headwinds as ongoing patient metrics remain solid. We believe that a few pharmacy wholesalers, which are downstream from our customers, had very soft purchases in January, presumably the result of advanced purchases in the fourth quarter. There was also a transition from Accredo to CVS Caremark to serve as the federal employee program prescription benefit. With this transition, Caremark built up inventory last quarter for these patients, while Accredo wound down inventory in Q1. ","While January often experiences some modest channel swings, this year the impact was exaggerated. We estimate that the unfavorable impact in Q1 was approximately $19 million to U.S. AVONEX revenue. We provided the monthly breakdown of AVONEX U.S. units in our earnings slides. As shown, the channel affects were isolated primarily to January and our shipments have normalized over the following months. ","Internationally, Q1 AVONEX revenue was $261 million, an increase of 2% compared to first quarter 2011. The impact of foreign exchange weakened AVONEX revenue by $8 million, which was offset by a $4 million hedge gain in the quarter. ","Additionally, AVONEX worldwide revenues were impacted by a voluntary product recall of some material whose expiration date were shorter than stated on the label. This unfavorably impacted AVONEX revenue by approximately $7 million. In certain geographies, we either withdrew product or accounted for the withdrawal without a corresponding resupply, as the execution was in the last week of the quarter. ","As a result, the temporary impact to worldwide AVONEX revenue in Q1 from the channel dynamics in product referral was approximately $26 million. ","Moving to TYSABRI. Worldwide end-market sales were $399 million and Biogen Idec reported TYSABRI product revenues of $286 million. In the U.S., TYSABRI revenue to Biogen Idec grew 19% to $87 million. ","Q1 international TYSABRI revenue was $198 million. The first quarter revenues were impacted by $17 million of deferred revenue in Italy, which is the same issues we highlighted in the fourth quarter 2011 related to the Italian National Medicines agency claim. We hope to have a commission meeting in the coming months with the Italian authorities, and we're working to have resolution in 2012. ","The impact of foreign exchange for the first quarter softened revenue by $5 million for TYSABRI versus the prior year, which was offset by a $2 million gain from hedging. ","U.S. RITUXAN sales were $792 million, up 10%, driven by a number of factors, including an increase in the maintenance setting in NHL, continued uptake in CLL in longer treatment duration. ","Our U.S. profit share was $258 million. Royalties and profit share on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. were $27 million. The result was $285 million of revenue from unconsolidated joint business in Q1, up double-digit. ","FAMPYRA revenue was $15 million. Royalties were $29 million, an increase of 13% year-over-year, but a decrease of 45% versus the prior quarter. As mentioned, ANGIOMAX royalties reset to a lower royalty rate in Q1, as seen in previous years. ","As we move to the second half of 2012, we expect to benefit from increased ANGIOMAX royalties. ","Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q1 cost of goods sold were $133 million or 10% of revenues. This includes approximately $9 million of write-offs and $6 million related to funding the JC virus assay testing. ","Q1 R&D expense was $354 million or 27% of revenues, which was driven by the $29 million payment to ISIS and the maturing late-stage pipeline. ","Additionally in Q1, we expensed approximately $26 million for product development and manufacturing campaigns for the Factor VIII in dexpramipexole programs. These expenses were incurred early in the year due to the manufacturing lead times associated with each product. ","Q1 SG&A expense was $300 million or 23% of revenues, an increase of 23% over last year and 6% sequential quarterly increase. This was driven by increased investment medical affairs and medical education to support the marketed therapies and the potential product launches in 2013. ","Continuing down the P&L, our collaboration profit sharing line totaled $86 million. Other income and expense was a gain of $15 million in Q1. Included in this amount were $11 million of net gains related to various strategic investments, including a onetime $9 million gain for our prior equity investment in Stromedix. ","Our Q1 non-GAAP tax rate was 22%. From a year-over-year basis, we benefited from higher orphan drug tax credits and determination of certain intercompany royalties. Also in Q1, we benefited from a onetime determination from the IRS, allowing us to deduct the pharma [ph] fee expense for our RITUXAN business. ","In the first quarter, our weighted average diluted shares were $242 million. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 4 million shares for a total cost of $463 million, completing our share stabilization program for 2012. ","We ended the quarter with $2.7 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 70-30 between the U.S. and outside the U.S. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $1.40 in the first quarter. ","Now turning to our updated full year 2012 guidance. We expect full year revenue growth of mid-single-digits at the higher end of our previously communicated range. Our expense targets as a percentage of sales are unchanged from previous guidance, with cost of sales expected to be between 9% and 10% of total revenue, R&D between 24% and 25% of total revenue and SG&A between 22% and 23% of total revenue. ","We expect our tax expense in 2012 to be between 24% and 25% of pre-tax income. We also plan to execute an additional $500 million share repurchase under our existing share authorization with the objective of returning capital to shareholders. We'll plan to execute this with open market purchases over the balance of 2012. ","As a result, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share results to be above $6.15 and GAAP earnings per share above $5.54. This modest improvement in EPS guidance reflects continued execution of our business plan and delivering the benefits of the new share repurchase program. ","Now I'll hand over the call to George for his closing comments.","George A. Scangos","Okay. Thanks, Paul. Because of the successes we had in 2011, we entered 2012 with a lot to do, and we're focused on execution. Our goals for this year: to grow our leadership in multiple sclerosis by growing TYSABRI market share; stabilizing worldwide AVONEX market share; and growing FAMPYRA revenue. And we're on our way to accomplish those goals. ","We're also appropriately investing to ensure that we're well prepared for the potential launch of BG-12 in MS and Factors VIII and IX in Hemophilia A and B. These activities include a ramp-up of medical and commercial capabilities for both BG-12 and Hemophilia to ensure successful future product launches. ","We'll continue to advance our Phase III programs for dexpramipexole and PEGylated Interferon, which will read out later this year and early next year, respectively, as well as the trials for Daclizumab and for TYSABRI in secondary progressive MS, which will read out in 2014 and '15, respectively. ","And of course, we continue to advance and grow our early-stage pipeline to ensure that we're poised for future growth. As we sit here, we're eagerly anticipating the Phase III data readouts later this year for the long-lasting blood factors for Hemophilia and for dexpramipexole, which is a therapy that has the potential to be the first treatment for ALS patients in more than 15 years. ","We expect to accomplish all of that while at the same time delivering revenue and EPS growth. So we're updating our guidance to reflect our confidence in the business and our plan for the future. Lastly, we look forward to presenting highlights of both our early and late stage R&D programs, as well as our commercial strategy at our upcoming Analyst Day on June 12. We'll provide additional details about this event later this month. ","And so with that, I will close our remarks and open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just -- first maybe, Paul, if you could comment a little bit on R&D spend, you're doing a lot of Phase III trials right now and next year those might fall behind. How do you see R&D spend going forward next year? Do you think it will fall off a little bit or will be offset by the movement of these Phase II products forward?","Paul J. Clancy","Well, yes, no, we talked about this in the past. And while we're just a little bit reticent to give exact targets for next year, I mean certainly, the upward pressure on spending this year is the result of a very fortunate late stage program, set of programs that we have. Our company supports 6 or 7, depending on how you count it, late-stage programs that the bulk of our spending, as I've characterized it in the past, if you look at this on a project basis, the late-stage programs consume over half of the R&D expenses. When we spin a post pivotal trial and certainly the spinning doesn't go away, we're seeing that this year with BG-12 while patients have moved out of the trial, we continue to have spending on BG-12 for the extension study. We continue to have spending for a product as you move into safety. But it does decline on a project-by-project basis. So I think that we don't have the upward pressure on R&D spending as we go into 2013 that we're seeing now. As I also noted, for Q1, we had some spending for DAC on manufacturing campaigns, as well as the blood factors. Those are at risk. Those are things that we, nevertheless, feel important to do. So if these products do get to the marketplace that we're getting to the marketplace with the most, the adequate product supply, obviously, in good kind of product presentations, which are complex kind of for both of those programs. And then obviously in the first quarter, we had the $29 million payment to ISIS. So I think that's kind of directionally where we see it going as we move into 2013. And then I think the other key factor, obviously, is the range of business development activity, which to date has really been focused on building the early-stage pipeline which, by and large, consumes a far more manageable amount of spending.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marshall Urist from Morgan Stanley.","Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So just wanted to get a few more thoughts on TYSABRI. We did see the net patient adds pick up this quarter. It'd be great to get your thoughts, Tony, on how the assay's rolling out, what you've been able to accomplish so far there, and how you see that playing out over the balance of the year for TYSABRI volumes.","Tony Kingsley","So I think we feel good about the trajectory. As we said, country-by-country, month-by-month, quarter-by-quarter, you may have some lumpiness in the way patients get added. But overall that's on a positive trajectory, both in the U.S. and externally. As I said discontinuations in the U.S. have remained stable quarter-over-quarter. I think the key thing is we are seeing increased demand. We're seeing nice increases in the U.S. and TOUCH forms and in demand outside the U.S. And I think that's based on increasing physician confidence, given the risk stratification, increasing interest in patients on and we do see evidence of moving patients to TYSABRI sooner, earlier switches to get the benefit of the efficacy. So I think we're going to continue to see more of that as we go through the course of the year and we feel very good about the trajectory.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So disclosed in the 10-K was some commentary about BG-12 new potential patent extensions. Can you just sort of walk through base case for your patents on BG-12 and then what you're filing and how you see that extension play out as noted in the 10-K?","Paul J. Clancy","Yes, Michael, this is Paul. The base case is -- really needs to be framed out U.S. versus Rest of World. In the United States, we have patents that take us late into this decade, 2019. And we are -- our planning assumption is some extension with respect to kind of a Hatch-Waxman extension. Outside the United States, we feel good that data exclusivity will protect us and the planning assumption we're using outside the United States is 8 years plus 2. So that almost lines the product up on the North Atlantic basis in a very similar time period. We're working hard, but really don't have any specifics to share with respect to everything we can do to extend that. But certainly, nothing to report at this point in time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt from Cowen and Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","A question for, probably, Paul on AVONEX. I see on Slide 24 you're reporting the unit shipments. I'm just wondering if, for the price increases, I guess one in December and one in early March, has any impact on inventory fluctuations. And then sort of Part B of that question, what percent of the price increases are actually being realized these days?","Paul J. Clancy","Yes, good questions, Eric. We don't typically kind of put out Page 24. But we thought it was important to put that level of detail out because the concern and the question on AVONEX in January. As you can see, and this is units, as you can see, January kind of came down. That happens occasionally, but it was certainly exaggerated in 2012. We think it's probably owing to what you alluded to in that there were advanced purchases downstream from our customers in the fourth quarter or potentially even earlier. I don't think the March impacted any at all impacts that was very much associated with the PEN getting approved in a very similar time period.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from ISI Group.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Number one, Celgene on their earnings call talked about an inventory work down in the U.S. in the 1Q, driven largely by the merger of the 2 major PBMs. And I appreciated your detailed comments. It wasn't entirely clear to me, it may have just been me, it wasn't entirely clear to me if you also saw impact from that particular merger. So I was wondering if you can comment on that, Paul. And then, maybe for George, the $500 million share repurchase program you announced today, that sounds great. But you're sitting on $2.7 billion of cash. And so why not do more? Especially ahead of the BG-12 launch and data, things that look like certainly they could inflect the stock price again. Certainly from the outside, it looks like you might be accreting cash to do something a little bit more dramatic. And I was wondering if you could talk me off the ledge.","Paul J. Clancy","Stay on the ledge, Mark, first of all. The inventory that was noted last week by one of our peer -- I think many of us probably have a similar broad dynamics but the specifics are different. We did not experience, due to the consolidation of PBMs, that issue. The doughnut hole issue was a minor issue as well for us. Our specific issues were what we believe is the 2 that were noted in terms of downstream purchases and then this CVS and Accredo kind of owing to the federal employees. George, you want to?","George A. Scangos","Yes. Look, I don't think you should interpret anything based on our $500 million stock buyback. We are doing a $500 million stock buyback. That's not to say that's the only stock buyback we will do. It's what we are prepared to talk about today. And we have really nothing to add to our comments here. We'll continue to use our cash for stock buybacks, for what Paul has termed tuck-in acquisitions. So I think no major deviations from what we said in the past. So I think you can get off your ledge, and not by jumping.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from JPMorgan.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A question for you on TYSABRI unit growth in the U.S. When you look back the past couple of quarters, I think the past 3, it's grown about 0% or 1% sequentially. And so my question is, aside from the JCV assays or something unique about the U.S. market for TYSABRI, and then in terms of a benefit from price increase, maybe remind us of the gross, the net and how much that's changed over the past few quarters?","Tony Kingsley","Thanks, Geoff. It's Tony. So I think the U.S. story is pretty straightforward in that risk stratification has gotten us back on the efficacy message, to be honest with you. And so what we're seeing is nice, healthy increases in patient demand in addition to patients over time. And I think that's driving the -- I think that's driving the unit growth. I don't think it's a lot more complicated than that from a sort of how you model it out standpoint. From a pricing standpoint, the last TYSABRI price, I think, was increased slightly by A-LONG at the end of the year. That's typically been a end of year or midyear kind of time frame. We have managed to capture the benefit of the price increases that have happened over the last couple of years. The issue, of course, is at the customer level, because of ASP plus 6 dynamics. We need to make sure that our customers are continuing to have attractive or not unattractive economics, and there's always a little bit of disruption quarter-to-quarter as you shift over that time frame.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ravi Mehrotra - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Thanks for taking my question, it's for George. As we move into 2013 and think about your BG-12 ramp up and launch, should we think about the SG&A costs for that as incremental, or are they cost reallocation? Apparently you have an established MS franchise.","George A. Scangos","I think it's a mix, right? There are certainly customer facing people that we'll add. We want to make sure that we don't take the -- our foot off the accelerator for AVONEX or for TYSABRI, both of which we'll continue to be very aggressive about. And at the same time we need to introduce BG-12, and that simply requires more customer facing people. At the same time, we have a lot of infrastructure, as you said, on which we can piggyback. So there will be some additional costs. But certainly, not as many additional costs as we would have if we weren't already in the MS space.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tony Butler from Barclays Capital.","Charles Anthony Butler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Paul, you've explained AVONEX U.S. very well. The question I have, though, is internationally on the $7 million that's due to a product recall. What prevents that for not necessarily occurring again in the future? Then, is this just simply one country or one area where the expiry did occur and more of a why could that not be larger in the future? And along the same lines, could you also just elaborate a little more about your expectation for international demand? Is it just going to weaken or will it be relatively flat?","Paul J. Clancy","Good question. George and I are going to take this one, Tony.","George A. Scangos","Yes, let me start out with the expiry -- expired material. Look, the issue had to do with how a small number of lots were stored for a period of time last year. And although at that time we felt that it was fine, those storage conditions led to shorter dating for some of the product and we pulled that back from the market and replaced it with other material. We know the cost. It was an isolated event. It's material that we've made both before and after is fine. And so we are not concerned that this is an ongoing problem. This is a onetime event limited to a specific set of lots. So I think that answers part of the question, and I'll turn the other part over to Paul.","Paul J. Clancy","Yes, so I think, Tony, you're kind of asking about international demand from an MS broadly, at least that's how I'll try to address it. What we have seen for a number of years is kind of U.S. kind of category, kind of in the low single-digits and outside the United States, being 5% or 6% or 7% above that. So high single-digit growth from a total MS perspective. I would expect that we'll continue to see that in the near term, and it's very traditional where we're seeing kind of Europe growth a little bit slower, but other parts of the world being accretive with respect to growth perspective. And then fundamentally, I mean certainly, there is a thesis that we believe that BG-12 has the potential to expand the market broadly, both in the United States as well as rest of world, just kind of fundamentally innovation bringing some quitters, if you will, some patients that aren't on therapy back into the marketplace. I don't want to exaggerate that point, but I do think that that's certainly a strong tailwind for the business as we move into 2013.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Birchenough from BMO Capital.","Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just still wanted to dig in to the comment on lumpiness on TYSABRI, it suggests alternating tailwinds and headwinds. Are you seeing anything specific in terms of headwinds ahead that might be predictive of lumpiness or the wrong direction in the next quarter? And then specifically, just on the dynamics around the JC virus cast. Could you maybe describe the proportion of patients that are on TYSABRI that are negative versus positive, have we got most of the patients who are positive off the drug? And is there any [indiscernible] of patients coming off that might be candidates for discontinuation?","Tony Kingsley","Yes, thanks, it's Tony. Thank you for the question. So no, we don't see any particular -- when I talk about lumpiness, if you look at country-by-country, month-by-month, as the assay has rolled out, people got tested, we've generated more demand, in some cases you've had more -- it can be a little lumpy month-to-month. We've just seen that over the time frame. But we feel collectively, when you add those all together, the pattern looks good, and we feel like we're on the right trajectory. So no particular headwinds, just always to caution it on a short-term basis. The exact dynamics in the patients can go up and down a little bit. But we see, as you saw in the unit growth numbers and in the overall patient growth numbers, we feel very good on that front. In terms of testing dynamics no, all positives have not, by any means, come off. I think we're very early days in that cycle. We've actually seen the majority of positives continue to stay on the product. The long-term discontinuation for that group, I think, is an open question. We think we will lose more positives over time. But today, it's been actually quite sticky with the majority of positives staying on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rachel McMinn from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just on BG-12, curious what you're going to do with the aspirin results and how we should be thinking about just your positioning on the tolerability profile we see in the initial trends in GI and flushing affects, whether you'll be able to go out with a message, with data of how to manage that better? And then I don't think you commented, but on this expectation for standard versus priority review, your timeline suggests that you are planning for a standard review, but would you be prepared to go forward with -- if you got priority review to launch the product this year?","George A. Scangos","Yes, this is George. Maybe I can take that question. Look, the aspirin study was an interesting study. I think it showed some very encouraging results, indicated that the flushing can be dealt with, with aspirin. That was not a label-enabling study. I don't think we expect to be -- have that on the label and be promoting on it. But it's an important piece of information, I think, for community to know. In terms -- what was the second part of the question, was standard versus priority review. Let me say, all of the indications we've had and based on interactions with the FDA indicate we will have a standard review. If we are surprised and we get a priority review, we certainly will be ready to move forward on that basis, but we're not expecting that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber from Citigroup.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I have 2 questions. Just help us understand a little bit with TYSABRI, the $17 million in deferred revs related to the Italian subsidiary, is that something that once it's resolved you will re-book that as a revenue that's going to hit the revenue line? Or is that going to be more of a balance sheet issue? And then second, just, Paul, relating to AVONEX inventory. I mean, it sounds like there are kind of 2 things going on. One is sort of inventories not at the direct wholesalers, but sort of at specialty pharmacy. And then there was the $7 million withdrawal related to the products recall. Do you have a sense as to where inventories at sort of at that channel is going to be going forward? Is that going to be stable, or is there going to be some more fluctuations into Q2?","Paul J. Clancy","Yes, thank you, Yaron. Yes, so look, the accounting -- deferred revenue is just that. If it gets resolved and back to the price per unit that we agreed with the original 2006 claim, that will come back to the P&L. But I just want to caution you on this, there's lots of different scenarios of how it gets resolved. We've tried to describe that in fairly great detail in our 10-K filing. We'll kind of update that in the 10-Q. Nothing really meaningfully in terms of an update. But if it got resolved to, with respect to a favorable, that would be certainly the deferred revenue would come to the P&L at the quarter that it got resolved. In addition, the Q4 deferral is in the same vein. With respect to AVONEX, the AVONEX inventory, it's exactly how you referred to. We have a very good pulse on the inventory levels with our customers in the United States. In fact, we have contractual relationships where they exchange, electronically exchange data with us in order for us to supply and in order for us to know those inventory levels. And those are monitored very, very tightly. And look, the inventory situation in January or the first quarter, while it was meaningful and we wanted to point it out, I do want to frame it out that it is less than a one-week of inventory in the channel. So it's just, I want to just kind of frame it up. But it is exactly what you said, is that downstream from those, the specialty pharmacies or the retail pharmacies for that matter, could have increased their inventory levels. We don't think that, that is a long-term thing. I mean, it's just, but it did kind of impact us for the quarter, and we're going to continue to work hard on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams from Wells Fargo Securities.","Brian Abrahams - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I know it's early days. But I was wondering if you might be able to comment on the extent to which you may be starting to see TYSABRI capture any share potentially lost by Gilenya since some of those additional safety concerns emerged for that drug and the monitoring requirements were updated there? And just wondering if there's anything with respect to commercial strategy you might be able to do to enable you to further capitalize on that?","Tony Kingsley","Thanks, Brian. It's Tony. So I think it's early days. We have seen strength in TYSABRI overall and we've seen some strength relative to Gilenya, it's hard to put a number specifically on in the recent period. The article [indiscernible] review really just came out only a couple of weeks ago. We'll compete, so it does short term. I think if there is some hesitance to add as many new patients to Gilenya, which is what the impact of that may be, I think we're there with both AVONEX and BG-12 -- sorry, AVONEX and TYSABRI as great alternatives for that. So I think it's not as specific sort of targeting that opportunity so much as executing the strategy we have placed very well against that patient.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Roden from UBS.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just want to circle back, Paul, you made a comment that your belief is that the BG-12 launch will result in a larger market size here in multiple sclerosis. But if you look at the 2013 consensus for BG-12 sales, it's about $360 million which is a good bit below what Gilenya did in its first 12 months of sales. So I guess, for Tony or Doug or whoever wants to take this, when you look at the Gilenya and BG-12 profiles, would you expect a similar or different launch in terms of capturing switches, new patient starts, motivating quitters to come on the therapy?","Tony Kingsley","Yes, thanks. It's Tony. Let me take that.  I think, given the profile as it's shaping up for BG-12, we are optimistic and believe that we should outperform Gilenya in terms of patient acquisition over the first 12 months. The logic for that is, again, as the profile appears to be shaping up but mostly where the label comes out, it lacks some of the upfront, logistical complexity and monitoring appears at will, which would be a relative advantage. We have existing relationships with a lot of customers and we think that based on a -- and last week there's certainly a lot of interest in the market. So from a patient acquisition standpoint, we've certainly set the goal commercially to exceed what Gilenya has done in the first 12 months.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Wei from Jefferies.","Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Maybe just to follow up on the last question, could you help us understand your most recent research on how large the pull of these quitters are, both in the U.S. and Europe? And then just separately, how long does it take to do a manufacturing run of dexpramipexole?","Paul J. Clancy","Tom, this is Paul. So look, I don't think we have very precise data on the untreated and -- or the treated but unsatisfied quitter population on the sideline. Our estimate has always been about 100,000 patients in the United States. And probably, a little bit smaller amount of patients outside the United States. But that's a very -- I mean, if you think about that, that's a very sizable number on what is currently in the magnitude of 640,000 to 650,000 treated patients on disease modifying therapies. Certainly, all of those won't come back to therapy simply for a safer oral, but there's certainly a big number of those. And the second part was with respect to the DAC. Let me give you a little bit more flavor on both of those, and I'm probably getting out of my league here a little bit. But Factor VIII, it just takes a number of -- a long lead time to really, to get to manufacturing campaigns done. And we're doing some product development work, important product development work, such that the product presentations that we bring to the market and that it gets right down to kind of viables and all that type of stuff in kind of devices is highly competitive, vis-\u00e0-vis, the incumbents in the marketplace. And DAC is simply a matter of a little bit of a complicated API that we wanted to make sure that we're kind of well ahead of that. Obviously, DAC is the kind of meaningfully at risk spending that we're doing. But given this patient population, the high unmet need, we felt that it was important to put that average month spending to work.","Douglas Edward Williams","And just to follow up on that. I mean, we're recently operating within time lines where we're producing material at risk, as Paul says. But that material will essentially come off all of the quality testing and be released in time for sort of the aggressive time lines that we would have for approval of either of those products. So we're sort of front-loading, if you will, the manufacturing process. The real time to having product available comes from the release testing that goes on, particularly for dexpramipexole. But the whole goal here is to have product available at the time that we might be able to launch.","Operator","And we have time for one more question. Your last question comes from the line of Gene Mack from Mizuho.","Gene Mack - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","A couple on dexpramipexole. First, I saw on those slides, on the data readouts, that there's 2 planned data readouts for DAC. And I'm just wondering is it mostly ongoing Phase III and if one is a long-term follow-up. And then from the Phase II trial, are any of those patients still being followed currently? And then are there any plans for presenting that data if those patients are still being followed? And then just the last thing I was wondering is are there any ongoing efficacy studies right now or do you plan to do any ongoing efficacy studies at higher doses for DAC? So it's just the 2 data readouts that you have on the slides, the patients from the Phase II, if any of those are still being followed and will you present that, and then anything on the higher doses?","Douglas Edward Williams","So Al and I will take this. This is Doug. In terms of the timing of top line data, we're still expecting fourth quarter this year. So that date has not changed. I know that there was a statement made at AAN about perhaps December, perhaps January and maybe that's where some of the confusion is coming in. But top line data for the EMPOWER study is expected from us in the fourth quarter of this year. And then as far as following patients from the Phase II, I'll let Al handle that one.","Alfred Sandrock","So there is a second star on dexpramipexole out of 2014, and that's that there is a plan to do a second study if we need to. And in that study, we are thinking about potentially incorporating a higher dose, and we're evaluating that potential now. And the safety extension study does go on from the Phase II. We're not reporting any results from that yet, but we plan to report that at a future scientific meeting.","Wendy Gabel","Thanks, everyone. That was our last call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen fourth quarter and year-end 2015 financial results and business update. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Matt Calistri, Senior Director of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.","Matthew Calistri - Senior Director of Investor Relations","Thank you, and welcome to Biogen's fourth quarter and full-year 2015 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of Biogen.com to find the press release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we'll discuss today.","Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call.","I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult our SEC filings for additional detail.","On today's call, I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. George Scangos; Dr. Al Sandrock, our Chief Medical Officer; and our CFO, Paul Clancy. Now I'll turn the call over to George.","George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. In 2015 Biogen generated revenues of $10.8 billion, an 11% increase over 2014, and non-GAAP EPS of $17.01, a 23% increase over 2014. Although the revenues were less than we'd anticipated at the beginning of last year, I'm pleased that we were able to take appropriate action in the second half of the year to maintain healthy earnings growth while we continue to advance the potentially transformative therapies in our pipeline.","TECFIDERA's demand has been stable in the U.S., and combined with growth in Europe we expect TECFIDERA to continue to drive our global leadership in multiple sclerosis. TECFIDERA is now not only the most prescribed oral MS therapy worldwide; it is also the most prescribed of all MS therapies in Germany, France, and the U.K. Overall, more than 170,000 patients have been treated with TECFIDERA. Our hemophilia products, ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX, generated over $0.5 billion of revenue in their first full year on the market in the U.S. In November, the European Commission approved ELOCTA for the treatment of hemophilia A in the EU, which we believe will help to contribute growth in hemophilia this year as our collaboration partner Sobi commercializes ELOCTA in additional markets.","We also made progress in business development. We acquired Convergence Pharmaceuticals and raxatrigine, their lead compound. Raxatrigine is an oral small-molecule Nav1.7 blocker with promising Phase 2 data that will move into Phase 3 this year. We licensed amiselimod, or MT-1303, from Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma, a late-stage S1P1 inhibitor for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. We entered into a collaboration agreement with AGTC to develop gene-based therapies for multiple ophthalmic diseases. And this month BENEPALI was approved in the EU. BENEPALI, the first etanercept biosimilar approved in the EU, is the first of three potential anti-TNFs to advance under our Samsung Bioepis joint venture with Samsung Biologics. Under our agreements with Samsung Bioepis, we will manufacture and commercialize BENEPALI in the EU.","Meanwhile, we continued investing in 2015. We purchased land in Solothurn, Switzerland, and this Friday, January 29, will break ground on an advanced, next-generation Biologics manufacturing facility there. And we purchased Eisai's drug product manufacturing facility and supporting infrastructure in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. We also took actions to return capital and change the capital structure of the business. We fully implemented our $5 billion share-repurchase program, and a portion of that repurchase was funded through the $6 billion debt offering that we completed in September.","In R&D, we moved forward several exciting mid- and late-stage assets in our pipeline. It may seem like a long time ago now, but it was Q1 2015 that we presented the aducanumab data showing a statistically significant removal of plaque and slowing of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's patients. We presented data suggesting that our anti-LINGO antibody is biologically active in remyelination. And the Phase 2 data for nusinersen generated by our partner Ionis, looks increasingly encouraging as a potential therapy for spinal muscular atrophy. We also initiated Phase 1 trials in ALS and Parkinson's disease. Al will discuss the many advances we made in our pipeline in more detail, but I think this progress is a testament to our commitment to patients and our world-class capabilities across the breadth of R&D.","We also continued to strengthen our early-stage clinical and research capabilities. We bolstered research talent in our neuroscience group and established collaborations with first-rate academic centers around the world. As a result, I believe we're now in a better position than ever to both discover novel therapies and accelerate drug development while minimizing risk.","Lastly, summarizing 2015 would not be complete without commenting on the restructuring we implemented in October. Although it was a difficult decision, we've already seen positive results from the steps that we took. With the majority of the restructuring now completed, there's a palpable reinvigorated focus on our key commercial initiatives and high-potential pipeline candidates, and our operating expenses are trending at a rate that we believe can continue to provide healthy earnings leverage going forward.","So all in all it was a busy and eventful year, and we believe that the progress we made and actions we took positioned us well for a potentially transformative 2016 and beyond. And with that, I'll pass the call along to Al for an update on R&D.","Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer","Thanks, George. 2015 was a productive year for the R&D organization. We advanced the next wave of potential medicines through the pipeline, added important assets through business department and acquisitions, and expanded our research leadership by hiring world-class scientists. I believe our pipeline and our organization are stronger than they have ever been.","Starting with Alzheimer's disease, last year we presented compelling interim Phase 1b data for aducanumab, the first investigational drug for Alzheimer's disease to demonstrate both a significantly reduction of amyloid plaque, as well as slowing of cognitive decline. In August, we began enrolling patients into two pivotal Phase 3 trials of aducanumab in early Alzheimer's disease. We are pleased with the progress of these studies but recognize the inherent challenges in recruiting patients with early Alzheimer's disease and the limited availability of PET scanners. Fortunately, owing to the strong results from our clinical trials to date, there has been substantial interest in the program, which we believe has helped with recruitment. That said, we continue to anticipate that the Phase 3 enrollment duration will be similar to other large clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease. Looking ahead, in the second half of 2016, we expect to share additional safety data from the ongoing titration arms of the Phase 1b PRIME study for aducanumab.","Our other two midstage clinical candidates for AD that are partnered with Eisai continue to advance. Eisai has indicated that they anticipate releasing interim safety data this year for E2609, a small-molecule BACE1 inhibitor, and we're also expecting to see top-line efficacy and safety data for BAN2401, a monoclonal antibody targeting beta amyloid.","Moving to anti-LINGO, you may recall that last year we presented Phase 2 data in acute optic neuritis. To our knowledge, this was the first clinical trial to show evidence of remyelination following an acute inflammatory demyelinating injury in humans, and we believe that these results support our ongoing development efforts. Our Phase 2 SYNERGY study in MS is a 418-patient double-blind multicenter study assessing four doses of anti-LINGO versus placebo when added to interferon beta therapy. It utilizes a composite endpoint comprising outcome measures of disability, cognition, and physical function. We believe that a separation from placebo on any of these measures could be clinically meaningful. We're also looking at imaging endpoints that reflect the integrity of myelinated nerve fibers. Any differences in treatment effect between pre-existing and newly acquired lesions will also be of interest. We believe that the robust design of this clinical trial will enable a better understanding of the therapy's potential in MS. And if the results are positive, the trial should provide valuable insight into the design of our Phase 3 program. Results for SYNERGY are anticipated in mid-2016.","Now turning to nusinersen. Our partner Ionis recently completed target enrollment of the Phase 3 CHERISH study in children with childhood-onset SMA. And by the first half of this year, we hope to complete enrollment in ENDEAR, the Phase 3 study evaluating nusinersen in infants with infantile-onset SMA. This progress sets the stage for data from both of these trials to be available in the first half of 2017. Whereas the data from the early-stage open-label clinical trials are encouraging when compared to data from natural history studies, the well-controlled Phase 3 studies are designed to definitively assess the safety and efficacy of nusinersen. We are meeting frequently with regulators from Europe, Japan, and the United States with the goal of making the drug available to SMA patients as rapidly as possible.","Moving on to our hemophilia therapies, last month at the 57th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting, we presented new data demonstrating that ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX effectively managed bleeding into joints and maintained low annualized bleeding rates in people with severe hemophilia A and B, reaffirming the benefits of these two therapies. In addition, teams from the University of Pittsburgh, the Hemophilia Center of Western Pennsylvania, and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center presented data showing that immune tolerance induction using ELOCTATE was successful in three children with inhibitors, including a child previously failing recombinant factor VIII immune tolerance induction. The time to achieving tolerance in the study was four to 12 weeks, which appears to be significantly shorter than with the standard of practice, which can take several months to several years.","During the quarter we, in collaboration with Ionis, also announced the initiation of a Phase 1\/2 clinical study of an antisense drug against superoxide dismutase, or SOD1, in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. I am pleased to announce that last week we dosed our first patient in the trial. Mutations in the SOD1 gene result in the second most common form of familial ALS, affecting approximately 2% of all ALS patients.","We also continued to make excellent progress toward initiating multiple late-stage clinical trials in 2016. Next month we anticipate sharing additional Phase 2 study results for TYSABRI in acute ischemic stroke at the International Stroke Conference in Los Angeles. While a single dose of natalizumab administered up to nine hours after stroke onset did not reduce focal infarct volume, treatment was associated with meaningful improvements in clinical outcomes over the course of 90 days. The clinical profile and treatment window supports further investigation of natalizumab as a potential novel approach for treating acute ischemic stroke, and we intend to conduct a Phase 2b trial.","Amiselimod, or MT-1303, an S1P1 inhibitor for inflammatory bowel disease, is anticipated to advance to Phase 3 trials this year. In the second half of the year, we plan to initiate Phase 3 studies for both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. We currently have no plans for the asset in MS but expect to continue to evaluate other options for the molecule in collaboration with our partner Mitsubishi Tanabe. Raxatrigine, a small-molecule inhibitor of the Nav1.7 sodium channel, is in development for several pain indications. In the second half of the year, we anticipate initiating a Phase 3 trial to confirm the efficacy of raxatrigine in patients with trigeminal neuralgia. We also plan to initiate a Phase 2 trial in patients with sciatica later this year.","I'll now pass the call over to Paul.","Paul J. Clancy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Al. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.77 in the fourth quarter and $15.34 for the full year. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.50 in the fourth quarter and $17.01 for the full year. Total revenue for Q4 grew 8% year over year to approximately $2.8 billion and grew 11% for the full year to $10.8 billion. Foreign exchange, offset by hedging, weakened fourth quarter revenue by approximately $35 million versus prior year and by approximately $227 million for the full year versus prior year.","Global Q4 TECFIDERA revenue was $993 million. We recorded revenues of $785 million in the U.S. and $208 million outside the U.S. TECFIDERA U.S. revenue benefited from an increase in wholesaler inventory by approximately $30 million versus prior quarter. At this point, we believe TECFIDERA's safety perceptions and physician intent to prescribe have largely stabilized in the U.S. We're seeing positive leading indicators for the recently launched marketing campaign for TECFIDERA, including increased visits to our website and higher call volume into our patient services organization. In Europe TECFIDERA continued its trend of solid patient growth this quarter, especially in more recently launched markets such as the U.K., Italy, and Spain. The European label for TECFIDERA was updated in December, and we're actively educating physicians on appropriate patient monitoring. For the full year, worldwide TECFIDERA revenues were $3.6 billion, consisting of $2.9 billion in the U.S. and $730 million in sales outside the U.S. Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened full-year TECFIDERA revenue by approximately $27 million versus prior year.","Interferon revenues including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY were $740 million during the fourth quarter, which includes $506 million in the U.S. and $233 million in sales outside the U.S. For the full year, worldwide interferon revenues were $3 billion, consisting of $2 billion in the U.S. and $951 million in sales outside the U.S. Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened full-year interferon revenues by approximately $88 million versus prior year.","TYSABRI continued to add patients this quarter, with worldwide revenues of $481 million. These results were comprised of $278 million in the U.S. and $203 million internationally. For the full year, worldwide TYSABRI revenues were approximately $1.9 billion. We recorded U.S. revenue of $1.1 billion and $783 million internationally. Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened full-year revenue for TYSABRI by approximately $90 million versus prior year. Physicians continue to choose TYSABRI for patients requiring high efficacy, and nearly 10 years after approval we believe its well-understood safety profile positions TYSABRI well.","Turning to hemophilia business, ELOCTATE revenue for the quarter was $101 million and $320 million for the full year. ALPROLIX revenue in Q4 was $71 million and $234 million for the full year.","Turning to our anti-CD20 unconsolidated joint business, which includes our profit share for RITUXAN and GAZYVA in the U.S., as well as our profit sharing royalties on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. We recorded $334 million for Q4 and $1.3 billion for the full year. While there was a slight inventory drawdown for RITUXAN in the fourth quarter, we ended the year with a higher inventory level than we had anticipated. We also benefited from a $6 million payment from Roche in exchange for access to data supporting the development of ocrelizumab.","Corporate partner revenues were $69 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $40 million in the prior quarter. The increase was related to contract manufacturing for Samsung Bioepis and another strategic partner. For the full year, corporate partner revenues were $189 million. During the quarter, we booked a total GAAP charge of approximately $93 million related to the restructuring announced in October.","Now turning to the non-GAAP expense lines on the P&L. Q4 cost of goods sold were $332 million or 12% of revenue. For the full year, COGS were $1.2 billion or 12% of revenue. Q4 non-GAAP R&D expense was $542 million or 19% of revenue, which includes a $60 million payment to Mitsubishi Tanabe. For the full year, non-GAAP R&D expense was $2 billion or 19% of revenue. Q4 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $583 million or 21% of revenue. For the full year, non-GAAP SG&A expense was $2.1 billion or 20% of revenue. Other net expense was approximately $82 million in the fourth quarter, which includes $67 million in interest expense, primarily related to our recent bond offering. Full-year other net expense was $124 million, including approximately $96 million in interest expense. Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 23% for the fourth quarter, as we benefited from the reinstated R&D tax credit. Our full-year tax rate was approximately 24%.","During the year, we repurchased approximately 16.8 million shares of our common stock, completing our previously authorized $5 billion share repurchase program. Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 221 million for Q4, 231 million for the full year, and we ended the year with approximately 219 million basic shares outstanding. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $4.50 for the fourth quarter and $17.01 for the full year, representing a 23% increase for the full year.","We ended the year with approximately $6.2 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 40\/60 between the U.S. and ex-U.S. So overall, we had a strong quarter benefiting from favorable inventory dynamics for TECFIDERA, stronger-than-anticipated contract manufacturing in RITUXAN revenue, and the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit.","Let me turn to our full-year 2016 guidance. We expect revenues of approximately $11.1 billion to $11.3 billion.","Starting with multiple sclerosis. Our plan assumes relatively stable demand for TECFIDERA in 2016 in the United States. While we're hopeful our recently launched marketing campaign can reaccelerate growth, we remain cautious, as we believe we will not ascertain the impact until the second quarter of this year. In Europe, we anticipate constant pricing for the rest of the year and continued patient growth, particularly in recently launched markets.","For TYSABRI, we believe the therapy will remain on a stable trajectory. We believe the number of patients using AVONEX and PLEGRIDY combined will continue to decline as patients move toward orals, though we remain well-positioned within this segment of the market. Our financial guidance assumes no U.S. price increases for AVONEX, PLEGRIDY, and TECFIDERA for the remainder of the year.","With respect to foreign exchange, our plan is based on the current spot rates. Of note, we had an approximately $170 million in hedge gains in 2015. Given our hedges are usually placed 12 months forward, we expect limited hedge gains in 2016, so the year-over-year comparison is less favorable.","Moving to our hemophilia therapies. We anticipate continued growth with ELOCTATE, as we believe there remains a significant portion of the patient population that can benefit from long-acting therapies. We're assuming moderating patient adds for ALPROLIX, given the rapid uptake and penetration so far.","In 2016 we're assuming our profit share for RITUXAN and GAZYVA will decrease to 39% from 40% upon FDA approval of GAZYVA in RITUXAN-refectory indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Our plan assumes ocrelizumab will launch in 2017.","Moving to an expense perspective, we anticipate slight upward pressure on cost of goods sold rate, largely due to increases in contract manufacturing, biosimilars, and increased hemophilia royalties. We anticipate R&D expense between 19% and 20% of sales, which includes approximately $100 million earmarked for business development activity. We plan to invest in a number of R&D programs across our late-stage pipeline, including aducanumab, nusinersen, raxatrigine, and amiselimod for inflammatory bowel disease. SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 17% to 18% of revenue.","The head count reduction and restructuring announced in October is expected to benefit operating expenses by approximately $250 million. We've also planned to reduce targeted fees and services expenses, which are largely reflected in SG&A.","From a tax perspective, we anticipate upward pressure on our 2016 tax rate, as our profitability mix shifts toward the U.S. We anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share results between $18.30 and $18.60 and GAAP EPS to be between $16.85 and $17.15. Our plan assumes share stabilization with a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 219 million.","From a cash perspective, we expect to pay $1.2 billion in CVR payments to Fumapharm in 2016 related to the sales of TECFIDERA, and we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $800 million to $850 million, an increase over 2015, primarily driven by the investment in the Swiss manufacturing plants.","So the business plan is designed to provide investment to support TECFIDERA, surgically look to control spending, and ensure we're utterly focused on investing in and progressing the pipeline.","I'll turn the call over to George.","George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer","Okay, thank you, Paul. Clearly the commercial trajectory of TECFIDERA was not what we thought it would be at the beginning of last year, and as a result our revenues fell short of our initial projections. While obviously not happy with that, I'm very pleased with the way the company responded. We put additional marketing muscle behind TECFIDERA, we reduced costs and focused the company, and we accelerated our stock repurchase program. As a result, we maintained healthy earnings growth at the same time as we continued our investments in aducanumab, LINGO, and the other exciting programs in our pipeline.","We also continued to invest in additions to our pipeline. We acquired Convergence and its lead compound raxatrigine; we licensed amiselimod from Mitsubishi Tanabe; we completed the gene therapy relationship with AGTC; and we brought additional compounds into the clinic from our own and our partners' research efforts.","Our commercial portfolio continued to expand globally, as we extended our position as the worldwide leader in multiple sclerosis and significantly grew our hemophilia business. In 2016, we plan to remain focused on commercial execution and advancing our pipeline, which we expect to be the primary source of value creation over the long term. We're looking forward to many updates over the next year, including insight into the potential impact of TECFIDERA's recently launched marketing campaign by the second quarter; Phase 2 top line results for anti-LINGO in MS in the middle of the year; Phase 2 data for BAN2401 and E2609; continued Phase 2 data for nusinersen from Ionis, followed by Phase 3 data next year; and Phase 1b titration data for aducanumab in the second half of the year. We expect to launch up to three compounds this year: BENEPALI in Europe following approval from the European Commission earlier this month, ZINBRYTA pending approval in the first half of the year, and potentially an infliximab biosimilar also in Europe.","Thinking even further ahead, we believe that we're entering the early years of a potentially transformative era in neurogeneration drug discovery and development, and we believe that our commitment to research has the potential to yield results that are truly meaningful for patients and shareholders. As I said at the recent JPMorgan conference, I believe that our pipeline and our approach, which has the risk inherent in all truly innovative and groundbreaking approaches, is measured and thoughtful. The combination of a much better understanding of disease biology, the focus on genetically validated targets, the use of biomarkers to learn early whether or not our compounds are having the desired biological effects, and the adoption of multiple therapeutic modalities may meaningful increase success rates and identify those projects likely to fail early in the process, before large amounts of time and money are spent. Our strategy is evident in the design of the aducanumab Phase 1b trial, the Phase 2 study of nusinersen, the Phase 2 studies of anti-LINGO, and our recently initiated Phase 1 trial for SOD1 ALS. We have additional examples, some of which we'll talk about as the year goes on.","In closing, and as always, I'd like to thank our employees, who are dedicated to making a positive impact on patients' lives, and also the patients and physicians who were involved in our clinical development programs. The achievements we made together could not have been realized without their passion and commitment. So thank you all for joining us this morning, and the operator will now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just have a couple of quick ones, one on the commercial side. I know it's early days, but are there any initial metrics on the TEC DTC campaign when you look at things like new starts or returning patients? And then the second one is on the pipeline. When you look at the ENGAGE and EMERGE studies, Al, are there lessons to be learned from Lilly in terms of managing PET scan facilities? And what do you think identification of early-stage Alzheimer's patients means to the market opportunity? Thank you.","George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Geoff. Let me start with the TEC DTC question. I guess I'd reinforce what we said in our prepared remarks around, that really to try to discern it we're going to be looking kind of in Q2 time period. I mean, clearly Q2's not a light switch to determine that. We're seeing early data with respect to, as I had mentioned, kind of hits to the website, conversations into our patient services organization, which lean us to think that it's positive. We haven't seen a discernible, yet, change with respect to specifically your question, but our judgment is that this takes a little bit of time. It was really first week of October. Obviously script data as we come through the holiday time period, as everybody knows, gets a little bit noisy in Thanksgiving and December. So we are going to look really hard probably 60, 70, 90 days out from now.","Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer","Hi, Geoff. This is Al. Well, we have learned a lot from our predecessors, including Lilly and others, and we are employing actually pretty innovative ways of finding where the patients are and where the sites are, and which includes where the PET scans are, because the scanners have to be pretty close to where the ligands are made, and of course the patients have to get there. The other thing we're doing is to screen patients before they need PET scans by using a neuropsychological test battery to make sure that by the time they get to the PET scanner, there's a high likelihood they'll actually have amyloid.","And then in terms of early AD, what we mean by early AD are prodromal and the earlier stages of mild Alzheimer's. And in terms of what it means for the marketplace, I do believe that there's going to be a change ultimately in the way the patients are diagnosed early. Perhaps, and certainly before there are functional deficits, but when they have mild cognitive impairment, I believe the healthcare system will set up ways of identifying those patients who need treatment early. And we're working on many of those, too, along with many colleagues outside who are also thinking about the same thing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Maybe another one for Al. It looks like you're going to be faced with a couple of go\/no-go decisions on Phase 3 programs in 2016. I'm thinking specifically for LINGO and for the BACE compound E2609. I'm just kind of wondering what kind of hurdle you've set for yourselves in terms of going forward. And maybe you could also further justify, if the hurdle is going to be kind of the low-end hurdle \u2013 I sense that's what you've been signaling to investors \u2013 why it makes sense to move forward with two fairly risky programs of lowish-end hurdle.","Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer","Well, I wouldn't say that the hurdle's very low. I think what I'm trying to say with LINGO is that this is a Phase 2 trial, and it's pretty novel territory we're on, where not too many people have looked at repair strategies for any neurologic disease, including MS. So I would say that we're going to look at the totality of the data. We're going to combine the clinical outcome measures along with the imaging outcome measures, learn as much as we can, and really decide, does the program deserve a continued investment? And if so, can we go to Phase 3? Are we ready to go to Phase 3? Because in Phase 3, we're going to have to employ outcome measures that everybody agrees \u2013 including regulators, obviously, but also the MS community \u2013 everybody agrees will provide answers on whether or not the treatment effect is clinically meaningful.","And in the case of the BACE inhibitor, the main thing we're going to be looking at is safety, and I don't think it's uncommon \u2013 in fact, I think all of our competitors have gone from early-stage safety data right to large registrational trials, and I think there are good reasons for that. We are confident in the pharmacodynamic effect that we see, in that when we look at A beta 42 levels and CSF, we get nice, very strong dose-dependent decreases in A beta 42. So we're not going \u2013 I mean, as George said, we want to manage the risk by making sure we have the desired biological effect, and we're pretty confident already that we have that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Two quick ones. On TYSABRI, it looks like you're seeing stabilization. Wondering if you could talk a little bit about the dynamics you're seeing there amongst patients since the SPMS data was reported? And then for Paul, just curious \u2013 you earmarked about $100 million for BD next year \u2013 how the sector pullback amongst the smaller biotechs might influence your capital allocation strategy this year. Thanks.","Paul J. Clancy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, why don't \u2013 I'll try to take the TYSABRI one as well, but Al can chime in here. Thanks, Brian, for the question. Yeah, we did not see a discernible change kind of coming out of the SPMS readout. It may be early; it may not. I think that was to some extent our thesis as well. Patients that are doing very, very well and have an individual experience with TYSABRI that's generally quite positive.","With respect to the earmarking for $100 million, it's \u2013 we always debate this internally. Should it be more than that? Should it be less? Should we trade it off against R&D dollars? All that type of stuff. But we try to earmark some level of money that obviously is expense money, which has been \u2013 we've been a little bit biased that way, with the earlier stage biotechs over the last number of years have had opportunities, right? The IPO window has been open. It's been very open for them to continue on. There's a potential that with the change in the biotech sector, that as we've looked at corporate development, business development type deals, clearly one of the last hurdles to get through is financial valuation. There's a change that that dynamic is changing in favor for us. George will maybe add some comments as well.","George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Look, if you're in a smaller biotech company, and it's pre-commercial, and you have to raise revenue, there are only a couple of ways to do that. And as it gets more difficult and less attractive to raise money from the financial markets, obviously other alternatives become more attractive. And we hope that and we believe that will all move in the favor of companies like us who are out to in-license or acquire additional compounds. So we'll see. It takes a while for that to happen. We'll take the current views of the market to hold for a while or deteriorate further. If that happens, then I believe there'll be interesting opportunities for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. Hey, Paul, Al, George. Thanks for all the transparency after the guidance lowering last year and on the call today. Really appreciate it. I think the Street does, too. Just a couple questions since everyone's breaking the one question rule.","George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer","I think you started that trend, Mark.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","No, well, I'm like the fifth question. Everyone's asked two. So it's not me. I'm a good boy. On TECFIDERA, Paul, I remember last year \u2013 I know you're not providing TECFIDERA guidance for 2016, but I think last year you gave some color on your expectations. I'd be curious to know if you'd be willing to do that this year. And specifically what are you expecting for price and volume in 2016 in the U.S.? Should we be modeling any price, any volume? And then on LINGO, Al, this has come up in prior questions, but just to push you a little bit, when you say separation, should we think of that as common-sense separation on the clinical endpoints would be clinically relevant? Or in that we don't necessarily need statistically a T-value of under 0.05 when you're analyzing the data in order to make a go decision into Phase 3? Thanks a lot.","Paul J. Clancy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Mark, this is Paul. The only additional \u2013 I really don't want to provide anything additional, no comments further. Just \u2013 but reinforce what I did say in the prepared remarks. On TECFIDERA, our plan assumes stable demand for TEC in the United States, right? We're looking and aspiring for more, but that's what the plan assumes. And that's really what we've seen for a number of quarters. On the U.S. pricing side, our financial guidance assumes no U.S. prices for TECFIDERA for the remainder of the year.","Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer","On LINGO, Mark, we have a trial with about 80 patients per arm. And so it's not \u2013 it's a robust trial. But, yeah, I think we're more on the common-sense side, as you put it. We want to know \u2013 and we can look at separation in several ways. I mean, we can look for proportion of patients who are improving relative to placebo, and we can look at patients who are slowing \u2013 their progression has slowed. So we can look at both ways. And that's sort of what I mean by separation. But I think it's more on the common-sense side. And I tried to indicate that there's a lot of exploratory pieces to this trial, because \u2013 and some of these endpoints have really never been employed in any significant way in large trials. So that's what I was trying to say, Mark.","George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer","I think, Mark \u2013 this is George. The decision on the LINGO trial will be whether or not we have a meaningful clinical impact on endpoints that the regulators would consider approvable endpoints in a Phase 3 trial. All right? And there are many endpoints that we're going to be looking at in the trial, and there could be some combination of them. So we're not going to have a low bar, but it is a Phase 2 exploratory study, and as we look at those endpoints, we'll make decisions. But I wouldn't characterize it as a low bar. I'd characterize it right now as a little bit of an undefined bar until we see the data.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks for the question. On SMNRx \u2013 and I refer to it as that because I can't pronounce your new name \u2013 could you just talk a little bit about some of the data you've seen so far? And how you're \u2013 some of your commentary has changed around that a little bit to the positive, which is fine, but I guess it always comes down to comparing historical literature, and there's a lot of different things out there. So, Al, can you maybe just talk a little bit about your confidence in the literature and the range of median survival there and what you think is going on here? You previously talked about weight gain, but I haven't really heard about that. So I guess maybe talk a little bit about that and what you're seeing, and I guess why versus historical literature you feel I guess a little bit better.","Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer","Yeah. So the main data we're looking at is the Type 1 SMA, or the infantile onset. And, as you know, we're comparing it \u2013 we and with our partner Ionis \u2013 are comparing it to natural history. And those things are always tricky, because natural history \u2013 the care of patients change over time and stuff like that, and you have to sort of find matching patients, patients that are similar to the ones that you looked at in your open-label study. My confidence grows with every passing day because, as you know, these children are supposed to \u2013 their median survival is two years. And so we're at the point where many of these babies are getting to that point or going beyond it, and so I think that if they're surviving, our confidence grows. And also \u2013 we're also looking at whether or not they're gaining, whether they're making improvements. These children generally don't improve, and they're hitting motor milestones that are not commonly seen in the natural history.","So we believe the data are looking promising, but there are caveats to comparison to natural history studies, and we have to be cautious, because everybody, including parents and the whole world, wants to see a cure for these babies. So our bias is certainly leaning toward wanting to see something, and we have to be cautious about that. So the Phase 3 trials are sham-controlled, they're blinded, and I think that's where we believe the definitive data will come from.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, and good morning, everybody. So I'm going to ask two. One on Alzheimer's \u2013 we've recently had a handful of physician feedback that there's a dearth of skilled readers for some of these endpoints in these studies. Can you just talk a little bit about what you're doing to make sure the readers are well-trained, especially given that a small change in the endpoints is likely to demonstrate the benefit of the drug? And then just on LINGO, can you remind us what our expectations should be? I remember in 2015 when you moved out the timelines, you said that a small internal group would be seeing some of the LINGO data ahead of sort of the full analysis, and they'd be planning for Phase 3. Should we expect if you decide to move ahead for Phase 3 you'll be able to talk about that pretty quickly when we see the data? Thanks.","Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer","Yeah. Let me get the second question first. I want to be sure that the trial remains fully blinded. Nobody at Biogen has broken the blind and looked at the unblinded data. So that small team \u2013 there's no small team looking at any data.","And in terms of the AD, there are \u2013 it is sort of an art to read PET scans. I don't know if that's what you're referring to, but the readers of these images have to be trained, and we actually employed a quality-control step in a blinded way, where we had somebody in Minnesota, an expert, reviewing every single scan. Moreover, in terms of the cognitive testing, the clinical outcome measures, the main thing we want is consistency over time, and we're doing a lot of the things that we actually do in MS, where we do a lot of training, we have examining neurologists, and we separate them from the neurologists that actually treat the patients for side effects and things. So I think we've employed sort of state-of-the-art methods for collecting these data and hopefully avoided many of the pitfalls.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, thanks, guys. Just a couple of quick commercial questions. Paul, on TECFIDERA you guys called out the $30 million of inventory during the quarter, and I think Q3 saw $10 million to $15 million, if I recall correctly. So how should we think, I guess, about Q1? Are we talking about $40 million to $45 million that needs to be burned off, or is there some other dynamic there that we should be modeling?","And then also on PLEGRIDY, just wondering if you could share any insights on, as the launch has progressed, any change specifically in the source of patients, either from AVONEX or other beta interferons? And I guess I ask this question because some of our checks seem to indicate there's been a shift where PLEGRIDY is taking patients now from other beta interferons versus more from AVONEX early on. I'm just kind of wondering if that's what you're seeing, too, or if there's something else going on there? Thanks.","Paul J. Clancy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Chris, great questions. It's Paul. TECFIDERA, let me just kind of level-set and just clarify, because you're exactly on it. What we had noted in Q3 is that our estimate at the time was that there was about $10 million to $15 million of build in the SPP, in the specialty pharmacy part of the combined channel. And that was mostly what we believe related to a government purchase related to kind of their fiscal year timing. I think our belief is that that's largely burned through. On a quarter-to-quarter basis within specialty pharmacies, there is sometimes ebbs and flows on inventory levels, and we'll try to do our best to point that out, but we think it's at \u2013 and I would think that we may have things like what we had in Q3. But I think that's largely burned through.","What we noted in Q4 is actually related to the wholesaler portion of the channel, and on a quarter-over-quarter basis, that there was a little bit of build. So I think as we move into Q1, we're really probably dealing with the $30 million to get to kind of on a sequential quarter basis. We always \u2013 just to complete the thought \u2013 we always deal with kind of Q4-to-Q1 dynamics that sometimes we don't have great visibility on, the so-called shoebox effect, the change in Q1 with respect to the patients on insurance, and which is related obviously to shoebox. So Q1 oftentimes, in gross to net changes, so discounts and allowances rate goes up in Q1 as well, for us as well as the industry. So we're always \u2013 be mindful of that.","On PLEGRIDY, it's very interesting. Your checks are probably are consistent with what we're seeing as well. We saw early on, and to some extent it was our marketing strategy early on, was a conversion of AVONEX patients. And we hit some speed bumps along that early on in the launch in the last quarter of 2014 and going into early into 2015. We're starting to see both from what we're trying to do in our marketing strategy, but we're also starting to see the benefits of PLEGRIDY being seen as sourcing volumes from the other interferons. Look, this is a great product vis-\u00e0-vis kind of capturing our, and penetrating and capturing share within that interferon segment of the marketplace. Great question. Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Cameron Bradshaw - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, this is Cameron filling in for Terence. Thanks for taking our question, and congrats on your approval of your ENBREL biosimilar in the EU. I was wondering, is there anything you can share regarding your pricing and commercialization strategy there? Thanks.","George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer","Cameron, obviously we're in discussions country by country, but really can't share anything, so no comment on that. We'll try to as we begin to post revenues, to try to provide some commentary.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Roden from UBS. Your line is open.","Matt M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the question, and thanks for delivering a nice quarter and guidance here. I think as a sector we needed some good news. So I had kind of a specific on the BACE inhibitor E2609. The Phase 2 study is in 700 patients, but my understanding is that the data that we'll get on this year's disclosures is just on safety from the initial cohorts, not the whole 700 patients. So can you just clarify what we should expect to see from this disclosure this year and help us understand what exactly you'll be looking for and how this information would pertain to a go\/no-go decision? And then lastly just when we'll get initial efficacy findings from this program. Thanks.","Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer","Yeah, you're right, Matt, were going to look at the first cohort. And the original plan was that the first cohort would then trigger a second cohort. The main thing we're going to look at is the safety data from the first cohort and also to confirm the pharmacodynamic effect that we saw with our Phase 1 study. So it's really safety and repeat, or confirmation of pharmacodynamic effect in the CSF.","Matt M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then does that pertain to any go\/no-go decision?","Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer","Yeah.","Matt M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","And then when should we expect to see initial efficacy?","Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer","Well, with the number of patients in the first cohort, I have low expectations in terms of efficacy, and it will lead to a go\/no-go decision to Phase 3.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang from the Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe for Al, you mentioned that you should expect the enrollment, a full enrollment of aducanumab Phase 3 similar to the timeline of the other Phase 3 trial. Does that mean we should probably expect 18 to 24 months or potentially even longer for the enrollment be accrued?","And then also secondly, I was curious your thought on TYSABRI, because ocrelizumab could be approved probably towards end of this year. We know that about 30% of the JCV-positive patients are all on TYSABRI \u2013 I mean, sorry, 30% of TYSABRI patients are JCV-positive. And then there's also a certain level of off-label use from PPMS and SPMS. So if you could provide some thought on that. Thank you.","Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer","So in terms of enrollment, I don't want to hazard a guess as to exactly how long it's going to take to enroll patients. I think we're pleased with what we've seen so far, but it's early days. And right now our timelines are assuming the enrollment rate on a patients-per-site basis to what we've seen with other Phase 3 trials.","And then in terms of ocrelizumab, it's great to have a new drug for patients, particularly for PPMS patients. I don't think there were a lot of PPMS patients who were on TYSABRI, if that's what you're asking. There probably are some people who have SPMS on TYSABRI, because our label says relapsing forms of MS, and patients with SPMS have relapses in their early stages of SPMS. So it would be on label to be on TYSABRI if you have relapsing SPMS. Now, ocrelizumab I don't think will have a label for SPMS, as far as I understand. I don't recall that they did a trial on SPMS, so I don't see how that would affect the SPMS piece very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, guys, and thank you for taking the questions. I guess first for Paul, on capital allocation, now that you've finished the $5 billion share repurchase program, do you have plans to start another one? I'm just curious how we should be thinking about share count in 2016. And then also, Paul, in your comment with regard to price increases not being assumed in your 2016 guidance, can you just remind us how you've build that into past guidance in prior years? And is this a change that's simply the result of the current pricing environment and controversy? Thanks.","Paul J. Clancy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. With respect to \u2013 let's kind of start on capital allocation and share repurchases. And you're right, we've exhausted the $5 billion share authorization that was authorized and approved by the board back in the spring of 2015. George and I are in constant contact and constant dialogue and constant discussion about best deployment of capital. I think our thinking right now is a bit focused on strategic deployment, but I would continue to emphasize that we always frame this as one or the other. And it's \u2013 over a long period of time, it's appropriately a mix. And I think the cash flow generation of the company remains quite robust such that we can deploy capital in a lot of different ways, all with the objective of increasing intrinsic value per share. So we'll look towards a lot of different means. I mean, I know I'm being a little bit vague and opaque, but I think it's just because that's a little bit where we are right now in thinking through all the dynamics of that. No real comment on the pricing dynamics for the balance of the year. The financial guidance for this year does not assume it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Birchenough from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Nick Abbott - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, this is Nick in for Jim this morning. A couple of quick questions. In terms of the remyelination programs, you have the oral remyelination agent BIIB061. Clearly, remyelination is a very complex process. Have you looked at combining that with anti-LINGO? Do you see remyelination as a single-drug opportunity, or do you think it's going to need combination therapy in perhaps some subsets of patients? And if the Ionis SOD1 trial \u2013 for these kinds of trials where you're looking at these very rare defined sort of mutations or correction opportunities, do you see the pattern repeating that we saw with nusinersen that you can generate enough compelling data in a Phase 1 trial in affected patients that you can jump into a potentially registration enabling trial? Thanks.","Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer","Yeah. Thanks for those questions, Jim. On the remyelination, right now we're thinking of it that we would use one agent for remyelination, based on our preclinical studies. Of course the remyelinating drug would probably be combined with an anti-inflammatory or an immunomodulatory drug, and that's exactly how we're conducting the SYNERGY study of anti-LINGO-1 in MS. We're adding it to interferon. But right now we don't have any plans to combine the two remyelinating drugs that we have in our pipeline. That may change over time, but that's our current plan.","And then terms of the Ionis SOD1 Phase 1 trial, yeah, we've done a lot of work \u2013 \"we\" meaning Biogen, also the ALS community \u2013 on biomarkers and not only in human studies, because you'll recall that there was a prior antisense study with a less potent antisense in SOD1 patients. And there's been some \u2013 a lot of animal work. And we actually have CSF measures that we could employ that we think will predict parenchymal spinal cord SOD1 levels. The whole point of what we're trying to do is to reduce levels of SOD1, because we believe that the mutated forms of SOD1 are toxic. So we have actually validated, we believe, very good measures that we can use to take the program from the current trial to a registrational study.","George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer","And this is George. I think that's often the case and the advantage of working on genetically homogeneous diseases, the result of a single gene.","So look, I want to thank everybody for your attention this morning and for your interest. We are going to go back to work and do our best to deliver a great 2016 for everyone. So thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session.","Thank you. I now would like to turn the call over to Mr. Matt Calistri, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Matthew Calistri - Senior Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Dan. Thank you, everyone, and welcome to Biogen's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the press release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the GAAP-to-non-GAAP financial measures that we'll discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in tables 1 and 2. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP-to-non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call.","I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult our SEC filings for additional detail.","On today's call, I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. George Scangos; Dr. Michael Ehlers, EVP of Research and Development; our Chief Commercial Officer, Michel Vounatsos; and our CFO, Paul Clancy. We'll also be joined for the Q&A portion of the call by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Al Sandrock.","Now I'll turn the call over to George.","George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'd like to begin with a personal statement.","I'll be stepping down as CEO of Biogen sometime within the next few months. The board and I recognize that this is an excellent time for a transition. The company's doing well now. The management team is complete and extremely capable, the commercial and R&D activities are going well, and we're on our way to adding to the pipeline through internal and external opportunities. It's a good time for a new CEO to take the helm and see Biogen through to what I believe is a very exciting future. This also is an opportune time for me to return to the West Coast, take on one more set of activities, and spend more time with my family.","I've been at Biogen for six years. I'm proud of the company and what we've been able to accomplish in that time. We've introduced six new products onto the market and increased our revenues, earnings, and stock price, all by several fold. And I believe that we're well-positioned to keep delivering on our potential to bring even more therapies to patients and returns to our investors.","Our R&D and commercial organizations are now world-class, joining our already industry-leading biologics manufacturing capabilities. All aspects of the company are operating at a high level. We've brought several potentially game-changing compounds into later stage development and are in the process of adding further to that pipeline. With the addition of Michel Vounatsos, Mike Ehlers, and Paul McKenzie, the company has a full and vibrant leadership team that's capable of moving the company thoughtfully forward. I truly believe that the company has a bright future, and it's with mixed emotions that I leave at this time and not see that future come fully to fruition.","We're making the announcement now in order to provide an orderly transition for the company and to allow the board to conduct an open and effective search. I'll work with the board to find a great successor who can continue to build on what we have accomplished. We expect to consider both internal and external candidates, and I'm confident that we'll identify an outstanding new leader. I expect to remain as CEO until a successor is identified and can begin. In the interim, I'll continue to work with the board and management team to accomplish Biogen's goals for 2016. I believe that we're on a good trajectory, that we have great new additions to the management team, and I look forward to a successful second half of the year. So enough about me. Let's turn to the business.","Biogen had a solid second quarter, delivering strong financial performance and important advances in our pipeline. For the second quarter of 2016, Biogen generated $2.9 billion in total revenues, a 12% increase from the same period a year ago. Our GAAP earnings were $4.79 per share, a 22% increase year over year, and non-GAAP EPS was $5.21, a 23% increase year over year. We continue to grow our leading MS franchise and our hemophilia business. And our efforts to maximize revenues while thoughtfully managing expenses helped to drive attractive earnings growth. As a result, we've raised our financial guidance for the full year. And today we announced that our board of directors has authorized a program to repurchase up to $5 billion of our common stock.","Looking back, we had quite an eventful second quarter. To begin, we welcomed three new members of our management team. A new head of commercial, Michel Vounatsos, joined us in April. He's completed a thorough assessment and has identified four key priorities for driving our MS business forward, which he'll share with you later in this call. Our new head of R&D, Mike Ehlers, joined us at the end of May. Mike is a brilliant neuroscientist and an established R&D leader who has excelled in both academic and corporate settings. Mike has demonstrated the ability to translate science into the development of important new medicines, and he's already bringing terrific leadership to the organization. And finally, with John Cox preparing to lead the new hemophilia company, we've promoted Paul McKenzie to oversee our Pharmaceutical Operations & Technology group. These three new leaders bring a wealth of experience and expertise, and we believe that they're poised to take Biogen into its next phase of growth. I'm proud to have them in our organization.","Last quarter brought a number of positive developments for both our commercial products and our pipeline. We announced our intent to spin off our hemophilia business. That business continues to perform well, with combined second quarter revenues of over $200 million for ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX. ALPROLIX also was approved by the European Commission for the treatment of hemophilia B and will be commercialized in the EU by our collaboration partner, Sobi.","We had a positive label update for TYSABRI in Europe, including an extended indication. We received regulatory approval for ZINBRYTA in both the U.S. and the EU for the treatment of relapsing MS. FLIXABI, an infliximab biosimilar referencing REMICADE, received approval in Europe. This will be the second anti-TNF biosimilar that we'll manufacture and commercialize in the EU. And SB5, an adalimumab biosimilar candidate referencing Humira, has been accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency. Aducanumab was accepted into the European Medicines Agency's PRIority MEdicines program, known as PRIME. It was one of only four applications accepted out of 18 submitted and the only Alzheimer's disease therapy in development that was accepted.","On the early-stage research front, we entered into a broad collaboration and alliance with the University of Pennsylvania and two world-renowned gene therapy experts, Drs. James Wilson and Jean Bennett. This quarter we also reported the top line results of the SYNERGY trial for opicinumab. As you are all aware, opicinumab missed both the primary and secondary endpoints, which certainly was disappointing. However, the rigorous design and planning of SYNERGY has yielded an abundance of data that will help us make a well-informed decision about our path forward with opicinumab and our work in remyelination generally. These results are indicative of the significant challenge of targeting neural repair. During the upcoming ECTRIMS conference in September, we expect to present more detailed efficacy, biomarker, and safety data.","I'll now turn the call over to Mike. And we're eager for you to get to know Mike and experience his passion for our business.","Michael D. Ehlers - Executive Vice President-Research & Development","Thank you, George. And good morning, everyone. By way of introduction, I spent a number of years in academia as professor and Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator at Duke University, where my research was focused on cell biological and circuit mechanisms of brain function and the normal, developing, and diseased nervous system. My career took an exciting turn six years ago when I joined Pfizer. I served as the Chief Scientific Officer for the company's Neuroscience and Pain research unit and ultimately became group leader for Bio Therapeutics R&D with responsibility over rare disease, the Centers for Therapeutic Innovation, and all large biomolecule sciences.","I'm just now finishing my second month at Biogen, so there's still a lot I'm getting up to speed on. But I can tell you from the outset that I am working to reshape and progress our pipeline while aggressively pursuing promising assets both internally and externally. I plan to update you on progress on these fronts in the future. In the meantime, I will comment on the important clinical study readouts this quarter and note some good progress made in advancing our clinical programs.","Starting with opicinumab or anti-LINGO, as George discussed, the top line results from the Phase 2 SYNERGY study were reported, in which opicinumab unfortunately missed both the primary and secondary endpoints. However, evidence of a clinical effect with a complex, unexpected dose response was observed. The SYNERGY top line efficacy safety and biomarker results will be presented at ECTRIMS in September.","Continuing in MS, EC approval was received for an extended indication for TYSABRI in highly active relapsing remitting MS patients with an adequate response to prior MS therapy. TYSABRI was previously only indicated for patients who had failed to respond to beta interferon or glatiramer acetate. This label extension follows recent EC approval for a new patient management plan, including an updated risk algorithm based on JC Virus antibody index values. These changes will allow physicians to have more individualized benefit-risk discussions with their patients.","Turning to other promising late-stage assets, our collaboration partner Ionis continues to execute the Phase 3 studies of nusinersen for infants and children with spinal muscular atrophy, both of which are now fully enrolled.","In Alzheimer's disease, it was recently announced that aducanumab was one of only four applicants accepted into the European Medicines Agency's PRIority MEdicines program, or PRIME. PRIME aims to bring treatments to patients faster by enhancing the EMA's support for the development of investigational medicines for diseases without available treatment or in need of better treatment options. We continue to work diligently to enroll our aducanumab Phase 3 trials. Looking ahead, safety data from the titration arm of the Phase 1b study is anticipated by the end of this year.","We are working toward the start of Phase 3 trials for amiselimod or MT-1303 in inflammatory bowel disease and BIIB074, formerly known as raxatrigine, in trigeminal neuralgia, and initiation of a Phase 2 trial with BIIB074 in patients with neuropathic pain from lumbosacral radiculopathy is planned for later this year. In further activities, natalizumab's clinical profile and treatment window supports its continued investigation as a potential novel approach for treating acute ischemic stroke. And the first patient was recently dosed in a second Phase 2 study in stroke called ACTION 2.","Encouraging data was recently generated on earlier stage assets BIIB059 or anti-BDCA2 for systemic lupus erythematosus, and BG00011 or STX-100 for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Anti-BDCA2 data in healthy volunteers and a lupus cohort of 12 subjects has provided confidence to move into Phase 2, with trial initiation planned to begin over the summer. These data are anticipated to be presented later this year. The BG00011 study is enrolling its final cohort, and it is expected that data will be presented after the trial completes.","Finally, as George mentioned, Biogen announced a broad collaboration and alliance with the University of Pennsylvania and Drs. James Wilson and Jean Bennett to advance gene therapy and gene editing technologies. The expansive research and translational development collaboration has multiple objectives and will primarily focus on the development of therapeutic approaches that target the eye, skeletal muscle, and the central nervous system.","Again, I am pleased to participate in my first earnings call here at Biogen. I anticipate sharing more detail on the advancement of the Biogen pipeline in the coming months as the company works diligently to deliver new therapies to patients. With that, I will now pass the call to my good colleague, Michel Vounatsos.","Michel Vounatsos - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP","Thanks, Mike. I'm very pleased to be with you this morning. I'll share my initial thoughts on the MS market and our MS portfolio, outline my priorities going forward, and then I will discuss this quarter's results for MS products.","Since I arrived at Biogen three months ago, I have spent time in the field with our operations team meeting with patients, the neurology community, and many of the scientific leaders in multiple sclerosis. Also, I have engaged with the strong Biogen leaders across our commercial organizations. I have listened and learned a lot, and together with the team, we have prioritized immediate opportunities across four key areas. We believe these opportunities will benefit our MS franchise today and at the same time prepare the organization for potential future product launches.","Before speaking about our therapies, I think it is important to note MS is a growing market, with approximately 850,000 treated patients worldwide out of a global prevalence estimated at 2.3 million, which includes progressive forms of MS. We estimate the number of treated patients worldwide is growing in the mid-single digits on an annual basis, driven by low single digit growth in the U.S. and high single digit growth in Europe. The relatively higher market growth rate overseas is largely due to increasing rates of diagnosis and treatment. And as a leader in MS, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from this trend over time.","Using the U.S. as an example, where we have the most detailed data, we estimate that approximately three-quarters of the 300,000 treated patients are stable and presumably satisfied on their current therapy. We believe Biogen is holding a clear leadership position in the stable segment of the market. We believe the dynamic opportunity of patients in the U.S. is comprised of approximately 15,000 newly diagnosed patients and approximately 60,000 patients changing medication each year. We believe that Biogen also holds a leadership position in new-patient starts within this dynamic portion of the market.","Turning to our MS portfolio, we believe that the value of our products is well-recognized in the eyes of many of our customers, as reflected in our leading global market share of approximately 38%. We believe the breadth of our portfolio is and will continue to be a source of strength in the marketplace by allowing physicians to describe the right drugs to the right patients at the right time. As the most-prescribed oral therapy for MS worldwide, TECFIDERA benefits from a compelling combination of efficacy, convenience, and relative safety. As a result, we estimate that TECFIDERA captures roughly 25% of newly diagnosed and switching patients. Our market research indicates that TYSABRI is clearly viewed and differentiated in terms of efficacy and retains an important role for patients with highly active disease, capturing roughly 30% of all patients switching for efficacy reasons.","Our interferon products, AVONEX and PLEGRIDY combined, hold leading share amongst the interferon therapies. Despite facing headwinds due to the uptake of the orals, we believe these products will continue to play an important role going forward. We are also preparing to launch ZINBRYTA next month in the U.S. and Germany. ZINBRYTA is the first in a new class of MS therapies. We believe it will be used by patients switching for efficacy reasons, benefiting from once-monthly at home subcutaneous administration and a differentiated mechanism of action.","Going forward, we will concentrate our work in the commercial organization across four key priorities, namely portfolio strategy, commercial excellence, medical leadership, trust and value. With portfolio strategy, we plan to further define our strategy for products, market segments, and geographies. We will work to ensure that our targeted growth opportunities drive consistency across our resource allocation, messaging, marketing tactics, and sales force execution. Within commercial excellence, we will work to increase our sophistication in multichannel marketing, including enhancing our digital capabilities while also strengthening our engagement with key customers at the local level. While clearly perceived as a leader in neurology research and clinical development, we believe we also have an opportunity to further enhance our medical leadership. This includes close collaboration with our medical field teams and partnership with scientific leaders. Finally, trust and value. We will work towards developing innovatives beyond the pill solution for our customers to enhance our reputation and strengthen our partnership and role as a leader in MS. I think that, as the leader in MS, we have this responsibility.","Today we already have a well-defined plan outlining next steps and target dates, which we have started to implement across the organization. We are initiating this with the aim to accelerate our business to be more focused, to make conscious choices, and to be diligent in resource allocation. We believe that this work will be beneficial for our company and our shareholders. For competitive reasons, I am not prepared to go more into the details of these four initiatives, but I look forward to updating you on our progress at future meetings.","Turning to the results for the quarter, total MS revenues were $2.2 billion this quarter, an increase of 9% versus Q2 of last year. We believe our global market share continued to grow. Starting with TECFIDERA, in the U.S. we saw a modest increase in demand compared to the first quarter, largely due to a normalization of seasonality typically seen early in the year. All of our metrics lead us to expect a continued stable trend for TECFIDERA going forwards. Outside the U.S., we continue to see increased adoption in the UK, Italy, Spain. In fact, the number of TECFIDERA patients in Europe has increased approximately 40% over the last year.","PLEGRIDY is now available in roughly 20 markets in Europe and, well launched, we believe it is helping to slow the rate of decline of our interferons. TYSABRI continued to add patients this quarter. We recognize the potential for increased competition from other high-efficacy therapies, but we believe TYSABRI's 10 years of post-marketing experience and well-understood safety profile position it very well.","In collaboration with AbbVie, we are actively preparing to launch ZINBRYTA starting next month. We are particularly encouraged by the broad indication and data reinforcing the product safety included in the EU label. We are also making progress in our biosimilar businesses this quarter. We are seeing strong initial uptake for BENEPALI, the first biosimilar approved in the EU referencing Enbrel, and we expect to launch FLIXABI, our biosimilar referencing Remicade, in the coming weeks. While we only expect a modest contribution from biosimilars in 2016, we do believe this is an attractive opportunity in the longer term.","So the team delivered a very solid quarter. I look forward to taking Biogen into what I believe is an exciting future. With that, I turn the call over to Paul.","Paul J. Clancy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Biogen, Inc.","Thanks, Michel. In the second quarter, our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.79, a 22% increase year over year, while our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $5.21, an increase of 23%. Total revenue for Q2 grew 12% year over year to approximately $2.9 billion. It's important to note we had $173 million in foreign exchange hedge gains in the full year of 2015, which impact our year-over-year revenue comparisons this year.","In Q2, versus prior year, revenues were unfavorably impacted by $45 million from hedging. Combined with the $1 million benefit from foreign exchange rates, overall revenue was weakened by approximately $44 million year over year. I'll highlight the impact of foreign exchange and hedging on each of our major MS therapies.","Global second quarter TECFIDERA revenue was $987 million, an increase of 12% versus the same quarter last year. This included revenues of $780 million in the U.S. and $206 million outside the U.S. In the U.S., TECFIDERA modestly benefited from an inventory rebalancing in the wholesaler channel versus prior quarter. Outside the U.S., foreign exchange and hedge impact weakened TECFIDERA revenue comparison by approximately $13 million.","Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, were $728 million during the second quarter, an increase of 6% versus the same quarter last year. This included $519 million in the U.S. and $209 million in sales outside the U.S. In the U.S., AVONEX also modestly benefited from an inventory rebalancing in the wholesaler channel versus prior quarter. Outside the U.S., foreign exchange and the hedge impact weakened interferon revenue comparison by approximately $17 million.","TYSABRI worldwide revenues were $497 million this quarter, an increase of 7% versus the same quarter last year. This included $305 million in the U.S. and $192 million outside the U.S. Foreign exchange and the hedge impact weakened TYSABRI revenue comparison by approximately $13 million.","Turning to our hemophilia business, which generated $205 million this quarter. ELOCTATE revenue for the quarter was $125 million, and ALPROLIX revenue in Q2 was $80 million. We continue to work toward spinning off our hemophilia business and related assets and plan to file the Form 10 later this summer and complete the distribution in early 2017.","Turning to our anti-CD20 revenues. We recorded $349 million for Q2, an increase from prior quarter, driven by solid demand. Total other revenues, which include revenues from collaboration relationships, royalties, and contract manufacturing, were $79 million.","Now turning to the expense lines on the P&L. Q2 GAAP cost of goods sold were $370 million, or 13% of revenue. Non-GAAP cost of goods sold were $354 million or 12% of revenue. As a percentage of sales, COGS was impacted by increased inventory write-offs versus the low seen in prior quarter. In addition, based on our evaluation of our small-scale manufacturing capacity needs, we booked a GAAP-only charge for accelerated depreciation related to our intent to close or divest our small-scale manufacturing facility in Cambridge.","Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense was $473 million or 16% of revenue, which includes $20 million related to the gene therapy collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania. Overall, R&D reflects relatively low business development expense, though this remains a critical strategic priority for us as we look to bring in high-quality assets.","Q2 GAAP SG&A was $492 million or 17% of revenue. Q2 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $489 million, also 17% of revenue. We remain committed to achieving savings by reducing lower priority fees and services for the balance of the year. Recall, over the last few years we've gone through a number of product launches and thought it was the right decision to invest behind these products. Starting in 2015, we pivoted and took a number of actions to curb operating expense growth, including a restructuring and further efforts to reduce costs, which is reflected in our operating leverage for the quarter. This will also allow us to reinvest in the pipeline.","Other net expense was $59 million in Q2, which includes $66 million in interest expense related to our 2015 bond offering. In Q2, both our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were approximately 25%. Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 219 million for Q2.","This brings us to our diluted earnings per share, which were $4.79 on a GAAP basis and $5.21 on a non-GAAP basis for the second quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $7.3 billion in cash and marketable securities, with approximately 40% of this in the United States. Today we also announced a $5 billion share repurchase program, which we anticipate will be executed over the course of the next three years. We believe this leaves ample room for flexibility for strategic deployment.","So, overall, we had a strong quarter driven by revenue growth from our MS therapies, rebounding from the seasonality seen in the first quarter; continued growth from our hemophilia business; and diligent cost controls.","This now brings us to our full-year 2016 guidance. We now expect revenues of approximately $11.2 billion to $11.4 billion, a modest improvement from prior guidance. Our outlook assumes continued stable patient demand for TECFIDERA in 2016 in the United States. We believe TYSABRI will also remain on a stable trajectory for the balance of the year. Our outlook assumes AVONEX and PLEGRIDY patients combined will continue to gradually decline as patients move toward orals. For ZINBRYTA, we anticipate a modest revenue contribution in the U.S. and EU, as launches are expected to begin in August. And our revenues outlook is based on stable foreign exchange rates.","From an expense perspective, we anticipate upward pressure on cost of goods sold due to the unexpected issuance by the U.S. Patent Office of a patent to a third-party related to recombinant interferon beta protein. This patent, issued on June 28 and expiring in June 2033, is relevant to AVONEX and PLEGRIDY. We will pay royalties in the mid-single-digits during the life of this patent. For the remainder of 2016, we expect the royalty payment to be approximately $50 million. We anticipate GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense between 17% and 18% of sales, and GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A expense to be between 16% and 17% of revenue. We anticipate GAAP EPS results between $18.10 and $18.40 and non-GAAP EPS to be between $19.70 and $20.00.","Our outlook assumes a very modest reduction in our full-year weighted average diluted share count. Of note, this guidance assumes contribution from our hemophilia business through the balance of the year, as we expect the spin-off to complete in early 2017. Additionally, this guidance does not include any impact from potential acquisitions or large, late-stage business development transactions, as both are hard to predict. Overall, this increase in guidance reflects the solid revenues seen this quarter, combined with the continued operating expense control.","I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments.","George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you, Paul.","Financially, I'm pleased with where we are so far this year. Our results year to date have been better than expected. We've raised guidance, and we have a new share repurchase program authorized by the board. We've made good progress towards the three focus areas I discussed after the first quarter: careful management of expenses, maximizing revenues, and rapidly advancing the pipeline.","As I look forward and think about the future growth of Biogen, I want to stress how those key focus areas will evolve. The team expects to continue managing expenses, but as you know we can't save our way to growth. Maximizing revenues and rapidly advancing the pipeline will become front and center, especially with Michel and Mike now in their respective roles.","Michel's four key priorities of portfolio strategy, commercial excellence, medical leadership, and trust and value will be the pillars we use to maximize revenues. And, under Mike's leadership, we intend to reshape the pipeline, rationalize existing programs, and aggressively pursue promising assets, both internally and externally. We believe this focus will help advance more assets through the pipeline and ideally deliver more therapies to patients.","At the same time as we're bringing focus and investment to our core area of expertise in neurology, we'll continue to be opportunistic when we see internal and external opportunities to enhance shareholder value. As a result, we've progressed some of the most promising earlier stage assets that we have in our pipeline, even outside of neurology. We've invested in our biosimilar joint venture to leverage our competitive strengths in manufacturing and commercialization. We've chosen to spin off our growing hemophilia business, because we believe it's the right decision to ensure fit and focus. And, as we've announced today, we'll buy back shares when appropriate.","So we've delivered strong financial results this quarter while making progress advancing our pipeline and our commercial business. We have a great leadership team and a passionate group of employees who come to work every day to make a positive impact on patients' lives. It's been an honor and privilege to serve this organization as the CEO for the last six years, and I remain committed to leading the company until my successor is identified.","I want to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees for their hard work and dedication. And I want to thank you all for joining us this morning. And the operator will now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI.

But \u2013 and efficacy is an exploratory endpoint. I'm sure at some scientific meeting we'll be able to disclose that for completeness' sake. And in terms of enrollment, we're not really commenting on it except to say that we're pleased and that things are on track and we hope to update you more on that in the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question. My congrats to George as well on all your accomplishments, and best of luck in the future. I guess a question on the business development front. As you talk about aggressively reshaping the pipeline and pursuing promising assets, I'm curious your latest thinking in terms of stage of development, sizes of potential deals, the types of assets therapeutically that you might focus on. How are you thinking these days about balancing maintenance of focus on neurology versus further diversifying the business, and how does the CEO transition potentially affect all these goals? Thanks.","George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, well, first, let me take that last point first. I don't think the CEO transition affects these goals at all. The company's committed to bolstering the pipeline, and we're working aggressively to do that. And, actually, we would look at deals at all stages of development from pre-clinical through Phase 3. And we are currently doing that. We're in a number of discussions now, and we hope to bring some of those to conclusion.","We are focused largely on neurology. That's where we have our core expertise. And I think we believe that the \u2013 you can make more sophisticated decisions about things in areas that you understand really in detail. So mainly we're looking in neurology. With Mike's arrival, we have a new person here who's got his own set of expertise, his own views on things. And I would say we wouldn't rule out things outside of neurology, but the bar gets higher as they get further from our center of excellence. As Mike put it yesterday, we want to have kind of laser vision, but we don't want to have tunnel vision. We want to be open to things that are interesting and can provide shareholder value.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges, from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you very much for taking the question. And, George, we're not sure what's so special about California, but all the very best of luck with your next chapter. And thanks again for all the information you've shared with us and for the success you've had at Biogen.","George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Geoff. I would say if you're not sure what's special about it, you haven't been there.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","So, one question \u2013 a couple of questions for Michel, actually. Michel, could you give us a sense of what your contributions from price and volume were on the MS franchise during the quarter on the U.S. side? And then what your price \u2013 contributional price effect was on the ex-U.S. side? And then could you secondly add, as you look at the MS franchise, presumably you will have no role in ocrelizumab's commercialization, but nevertheless they're your partner. Could you give us your view of how you see that playing out, in terms of the effect that that drug might have in the MS market and on the outlook for Biogen's own products? Thanks.","Michel Vounatsos - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP","Thanks for the question. And let me start with ocre, and Paul will comment on the other part of the question.","First, I would like to say that we are very pleased and we applaud any new innovation in MS, for which we have contributed, we contribute, and we continue to invest in our pipe. So this is a great news for patients in need, that there are still gaps in therapy. And I think this is a great news, and Roche's results on PPMS is even more encouraging. So we are very happy about that.","Having said that, we have a strong presence in the high-efficacy segment of the market. And this is basically a market trend where we can see that basically providers are treating earlier \u2013 and physicians \u2013 treating earlier, more aggressively. And TYSABRI is holding a very strong position in the highest efficacy segment, and ZINBRYTA will come and will complement this presence here. So I anticipate that ocre will be playing into this segment also, and we will see how it plays. But, for the time being, there is no risk-benefit assessment. So we have to be very cautious before talking. So I'll wait to see regulator stands, but I would say the first approach from, again, a humble but leadership position is to take care of our assets and elevate the capability of the organization, and the four capabilities that we are launching will just do that.","Paul J. Clancy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Biogen, Inc.","Geoff, this is Paul on the price versus volume question. I think the way you framed it is probably pretty accurate, is that it's a tale of two cities. In the United States, the lion's share from a change year-over-year basis is price, and is pretty stable unit trends on TECFIDERA, pretty stable unit trends on TYSABRI and modest, gradual decline on the interferon franchise.","Ex-United States, we are not seeing any pricing on a year-over-year basis, and all of the gains are attributable to volume and unit expansion. TYSABRI is holding well outside the United States, as well as the interferon business. And we continue to, in a small way, penetrate some markets and get some accretive benefits of things, even outside of Europe. And TECFIDERA continues to expand on a year-over-year basis and gaining market share, particularly as we are moving into relatively early launch timing in Southern European countries and having very good success in the UK.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question, and congrats, George. Good to see you leave on a high note. Best of luck with the next opportunity. Maybe just a quick one for Paul on this new interferon patent that you're paying royalty on or expect to pay royalty on. Can you clarify a little bit whose patent that is and what happened to your own interferon patent that you thought was, at one point, going to be able to extract royalties from others?","Paul J. Clancy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Biogen, Inc.","Yeah, great question, Eric. Thanks. It was, as I noted, unexpected that it is not actually related \u2013 despite it is on the recombinant interferon beta protein, it's actually not the same. It has to do with JFCR. In the Q this afternoon, we'll actually have the patent number for you. I just actually don't have it handy for myself, and it's a mid-single digit royalty. We aren't disclosing the name of the third party, but \u2013 so just a third party at this point in time. And we expect it will be $50 million impact, all in the second half, effectively, and will be a bigger impact as we go into 2017 on a full-year basis. The '755 patent, we continue to feel like that was a \u2013 despite its \u2013 was like back to 2009, when it was issued, but we still feel and we're still in litigation with other parties on that. But there's a chance that we're coming towards the end of that process; hope for something favorable.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Morning, guys, Thanks for the question. George, also want to offer my congrats. You will be missed.","So I had a question for Michel, maybe a bigger-picture commercial question. Now that you've had a chance to look at the products, the assets at Biogen, and a fresh look at the MS market, maybe just give us some perspective on what you see as the bigger growth opportunities ahead on a volume basis. Is it geographic? Is it rest-of-world opportunities? Is it new product launches? And then maybe for Paul, just wanted to check and see what you guys learned from the DTC campaign for tech and the sustainability of that. Thanks.","Michel Vounatsos - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP","Thank you for the great question. You know, in my 25 years' experience around the world, I have never seen such a situation whereby we have five or six assets in the same therapy area. The 20 years of very solid \u2013 unique, I would say \u2013 experience in MS, a solid portfolio today. A solid pipeline. A remarkable group of talent with clinical experience and scientific experience within the company. So it's a leadership position on interferons, a leadership position on orals. A leadership position on high-efficacy products. So this is a remarkable situation. And on top of that we are launching ZINBRYTA. So the dynamic is very good.","Having said that, when you peel the onion and you get to discover the opportunity and the operations, you find ways to do better. And this is why together with the team we have prioritized four key areas, portfolio management, five, six assets in the same therapy area. It's a challenge on how to manage that well. Commercial excellence, medical leadership, trust and value. And I believe that, with those, we'll be able to make a further difference. Geographically, also, we can see that some parts are better managed than others. And I have already started to make some decisions. We don't wait. And you can expect that more will come.","So this is what I would like to say \u2013 and, you know, the portfolio management doesn't mean that all the products will be resourced and promoted equally. It's all about the growth opportunity, the way that you outline. And this is where there will be a clear, I would say, alignment between those, resource allocation, and execution.","Paul J. Clancy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Biogen, Inc.","Geoff, the beginning part of your question is \u2013 yeah, just to confirm, we have sunsetted the television campaign as it relates to TECFIDERA. I think our \u2013 I mean, look, it was a innovative \u2013 I'd applaud our organization for thinking about it and giving it a try. I think that our judgment at this point is that it didn't have a discernible movement on scripts. And potentially came \u2013 this more, as much from anecdotal \u2013 with some drawbacks as well. Michel actually confirmed his \u2013 from his perspective that there quite possibly is much other levers that are still like DTC-related and multichannel-related that we can reallocate resources toward. So I think that's probably our learnings in a nutshell. We didn't run the test case, so we'll see what \u2013 but I think that's our learnings.","Michel Vounatsos - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP","Thank you, Paul. This is Michel. If I can add \u2013 I mean, at the outset, and I was not here, the main objective was increase awareness, and I think that this was achieved. But I didn't see any inflection on any trends. We need to circle back to the alignment of the organization on four priorities for which we need to have some very strict resource allocation decisions, and I don't think that broadcast TV will be there in the foreseeable future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Whitney G. Ijem - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. This is Whitney on for Cory. I'll add my congrats to George as well. I guess just to circle back on Alzheimer's. I guess, where are you with sort of combinations, and I guess what's the desire or urgency to get some of the combos into the clinic before you maybe have Phase 3 data on any of the individual components?","Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer","This is Al, Whitney, and we like the idea of combinations. I think one day we will be using combination therapies for Alzheimer's disease. One of the reasons why we brought in BACE inhibitor into our pipeline with our collaboration with Eisai, the reason why we have tau programs internally and that we're in search of even other things potentially to add to the mix is based on, in part, on that belief, that combination could be helpful. And you can think of it in two ways. One is to combine two drugs, each of which are active, to increase the efficacy overall, or to reduce the dose of two active therapies so that you get better safety or tolerability for the same efficacy.","And also there may be sequential treatments where you start early, perhaps even before symptoms, with one type of medicine and then treat with something else when you have a high plaque burden, and then something else still when tau starts to progress. When you start to think about combination therapy, though, it's often difficult to do the right studies without some evidence of efficacy of each drug as monotherapy. And then you can start to think about the right dosing regimen. And so I hope that's helpful.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Oh, hey, thanks. Good morning. My appreciation to George as well. Happy to see you joining me on the West Coast. I'm lonely out here, so happy to have you back here. Hey, a question for Al. There will be LINGO data presented at ECTRIMS. Can you maybe revisit this briefly and give us some color about what is going on here in terms of what we saw? Because obviously that was a surprise. And I guess is there anything specific that we should pay attention to at ECTRIMS that you've done work on that would pique our interest back here? Or is there some issue here with the remyelination pathway and that would bring our questions into your oral. So how does this change our thinking about remyelination and what we saw here? Thanks.","Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer","Yeah, Michael, thanks for the question. So first I want to say this is a really large and rich data set. Really the first of its kind, not only in MS, but to my knowledge, in neurology where we're in the early stages of figuring out how to repair the brain and how to measure measurements of \u2013 outcome measures of repair.","The things we're focusing on right now when we look at this rich data set are what are the right cohort of patients to treat? In this trial, we looked at relapsing MS patients all the way to secondary progressives. So it's a wide range of patients. What's the optimal cohort? What's the right dose? We studied four different doses, and we saw a complex dose-response curve. What we actually saw was a sort of a bell-shaped curve where we lost efficacy at the highest dose, and in the middle doses we think we see a signal of efficacy. And so we'll share some of that at ECTRIMS. What's the right concomitant medicine to use? We envision that these repair therapies will be added to immunomodulators, and so we'll be looking at that. And, in particular, whether ongoing inflammation in the brain impedes repair. And finally how do we actually measure the effects of repair if it occurs, particularly on clinical outcome measures?","So some of these questions will be answered by doing further analyses, which we're in the middle of doing right now intensively. And we'll share whatever we find out at ECTRIMS, and some may need another study. And so what we're honing in on is what's the next step? What's the next study? And obviously this will be a judicious investment. If we can go to Phase 3, we would try. I don't know until I see the specific design. It could be a Phase 2, it could be a Phase 3, it could be a Phase 2\/3. And that part we probably won't be able to share at ECTRIMS, but sometime soon we hope to be able to share that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, guys, thanks for taking the question. I guess, George, I remember meeting you when you first became the CEO, and I remember you talking about refocusing the company and like getting rid of certain pipeline products, and it was so well-needed at the time. It really changed Biogen. And so now I think the company's a different company, and there's been pipeline success and there's been some failures. What do you think Biogen really needs from a new CEO at this point in time versus when you came in?","George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer","Well, look, the company now is a very different company from what it was a few years ago. We have a full and excellent management team. We have a pipeline that is, I think, quite exciting but needs to grow. So I think the company needs good management. I think the strategy of the company is solid. And what we need is good leadership and somebody who can work with the people who are here \u2013 work with Michel, maximize the commercial potential, work with Mike, maximize the potential of our pipeline, grow the pipeline, and can work with the rest of the organization to ensure that we go forward in a way that is responsible, where we minimize expenses but that where we invest aggressively in those areas that really have the potential to add value. So being CEO is complicated, and I think those are the priorities I would set. Of course the search will be conducted by the board, but I don't think they would view it too differently. I think there'll be a continued focus on innovation, and I'm confident we'll get someone excellent.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Ronny Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, and thank you my questions. Two questions first. Biosimilars, you had a pretty good first quarter. Can you describe a little bit to us where you've launched already, where you're still expecting to launch? And now that you have a little bit of \u2013 wetted your feet in that market \u2013 can you just give us a feel for your thinking about kind of the three- to five-year trajectory for this franchise and for biosimilar for anti-TNFs? In Europe in general, should this be 30% of the market, 50%, 70% of the market overall? And then separately, you kind of mentioned the impact of high detectible copays on the U.S. sales in the first quarter. Has there been still some impact to those in the second quarter? That is, as we look from the outside of revenue, should we see another step up in revenue per unit in the third quarter, or has it been fully incorporated in the first quarter, and kind of the run rate for pricing in the second quarter is roughly what we should see going forward?","Michel Vounatsos - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP","So this is Michel. Thanks for the great question. So as you have seen, two great companies came together with complementary capabilities in order to launch anti-TNFs to get started with, and then we see what is the follow-up opportunities. So as far as Biogen involved together with the partners, we have launched the products; the three anti-TNFs for which we have the agreement on, two out of the three are approved and on the way to be launched. The preliminary results are very encouraging.","As you can imagine, there is a tremendous level of variation \u2013 variability between countries in terms of tendering, in terms of [aggressivity of petition] in terms of provider decision-making, and it's difficult to take an overall, I would say, recipe on how to best launch. What I can say is that the three anti-TNFs that we'll have the opportunity to launch will be addressing a current market that is higher than $9 billion in Europe. So this is significant. And with Biogen quality. So we have put together a standalone BU that is flexible, agile, in order to launch the product, and we learn country after country. Today, mostly in the Nordics and Scandinavia, where we have had very, very good results. But, as I said earlier, it's still early to comment much on the results that are negligible for 2016 but will be more important moving forwards.","Paul J. Clancy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Biogen, Inc.","Ronny, this is Paul. Thanks for the second part of that question. It's a good catch. I think the answer is that we absolutely saw our insurance dynamics mostly impact AVONEX in the first quarter. And we're pleased to see that that choppiness settled out and benefited the second quarter results. Don't expect it to be a meaningful difference for the balance of year now.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Chris Raymond from Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, thanks for squeezing me in, and congrats, George, from us as well. Just a question I guess on TECFIDERA. In the context of \u2013 I think you highlighted in Q1 a $20 million inventory drawdown. Could you maybe quantify \u2013 I think you highlighted generally there was an inventory effect in Q2. Can you quantify what that was? And then also if I can on TECFIDERA, continuing, I hear what you're saying on the television ads, but one of the things that has struck us the most with our checks is TECFIDERA, for some time, has been sort of far and away the most requested disease modifying therapy among patients. I guess I'm wondering, what additional levers can you pull to sort of increase that? Or is there some other aspect like maybe working at better efficiency programs to get that request converted into a script? Is there some other aspect besides just getting patients to request the drug?","Paul J. Clancy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Biogen, Inc.","Yeah, thanks, Chris. It's Paul; I'll talk the first part. It's quite simply, I think we're at a \u2013 pretty normal inventory levels on TECFIDERA, so it's really just a sequential quarter rebalancing off of the seasonal low that we generally see in Q1.","Michel Vounatsos - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP","So on the levers and the performance, 12% growth Q-over-Q is not bad. The share continues to grow to 15% globally, is also pretty good, mostly driven by the newly launched markets in Europe, 40% patient growth percentage is also very encouraging.","I have, from my field visits and from talking to leaders, identified one major issue, which is the discontinuation due to GI safety. Those patients during the first phase on the product are suffering, for some of them, on abdominal pain, diarrhea, discomfort, that is leading, in some cases, with very high level of variability, to discontinue the product. And this impacts not only the outflow but eventually the inflow. Variability is tremendous. I was in the field lately, and on the Eastern coast in the U.S., 1.5% of the patient discontinued at six months. In some others, it was 30%. So, with Mike Ehlers, we are fully aligned in order to work together with the community, with the physicians, with peer to peer in order to best assist, best educate, and bring down an average which is at 20% today to lower levels.","George A.

Scangos, Ph.D. - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Carlo. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today.","There are two sets of data on which most of you have been focused, so let me lead with those issues. First is the commercial trajectory. So versus prior year, we achieved 7% revenue growth and 21% non-GAAP EPS growth, good numbers but certainly lower than we had anticipated a few months ago.","We had expected to see a reacceleration of TECFIDERA this quarter, but that did not happen to any appreciable extent. Rather, TECFIDERA experienced modest sequential patient growth as we continued to work through the same commercial challenges experienced in the first quarter of the year. We continue to believe that TECFIDERA remains the preferred oral option in the MS market based on its strong efficacy and favorable safety profile. And we're working hard across the organization to improve TECFIDERA's trajectory.","With that said, our multiple sclerosis portfolio continues to add patients globally. TECFIDERA is the most prescribed oral MS therapy globally, and has now been used to treat over 155,000 patients.","We believe that PLEGRIDY is on its way to becoming the interferon of choice, as we continue to make it available in new markets around the world. And TYSABRI, which we believe is viewed as the preferred high-efficacy therapy, continued to add patients this quarter. Second, development with the recent announcement of the new data from aducanumab Phase 1b study at AAIC [Alzheimer's Association International Conference]; by now, you've all seen the data, which we take to be positive, in line with, and supportive of the data we reported earlier. Doug will provide some additional details on this analysis later on the call.","We've initiated sites for two pivotal Phase 3 trials for aducanumab in early Alzheimer's disease and are screening patients for enrollment. Millions of people worldwide are living with Alzheimer's disease and no disease modifying treatment options. We believe that this important investment has the potential to be a significant future growth driver for Biogen.","Moving on to other areas, through our joint venture with Samsung Bioepis, we announced positive results across our anti-TNF biosimilar portfolio at the EULAR [European League Against Rheumatism] conference in June. With these results, we believe that we're well positioned to bring these widely used anti-TNF therapies to physicians, payers, and ultimately the patients who need them most next year.","Just this month, we announced our intent to build a new next-generation manufacturing facility in Solothurn, Switzerland to support our emerging pipeline, a significant step towards ensuring a long-term global supply of new world-class therapies for patients. We expect to break ground on the facility early next year and start manufacturing activities in 2019.","So we had a busy second quarter with an important second half of the year ahead of us, in which we'll focus on improving the trajectory of TECFIDERA and ensuring that we execute important clinical trials to move our pipeline forward as quickly as possible.","Now I'd like turn the call over to Doug, who will update you all on our progress in R&D.","Douglas E. Williams - Executive Vice President-Research & Development","Thanks, George.","Earlier this week at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference, we presented additional interim results from the aducanumab Phase 1b study in subjects with prodromal and mild Alzheimer's disease. To remind you, we previously presented results for the 1 mg\/kg, 3 mg\/kg, and 10 mg\/kg patient cohorts at six months and one year, and for the 6 mg\/kg cohort at six months.","The new results now include one-year data for 30 subjects treated with 6 mg\/kg of aducanumab and for an additional ten subjects randomized to placebo. The 6 mg\/kg one-year results demonstrated a statically significant reduction on brain beta amyloid levels versus placebo, as assessed by PET imaging. The results at six months and one year show very strong dose and time-dependent reduction of brain beta amyloid and extend our previously reported observations. We observed a numeric improvement on the MMSE and CDR sum-of-box clinical measures compared to placebo, though the results did not achieve statistical significance.","The 6 mg\/kg dose at one year was intermediate in effect to that seen with the 3 mg\/kg and 10 mg\/kg doses on the CDR score, which will be the primary endpoint for the Phase 3 program. The safety results were consistent with previously reported results. Overall analysis of the 1 mg\/kg, 3 mg\/kg, 6 mg\/kg, and 10 mg\/kg clinical results at one year demonstrated a statistically significant dose-dependent impact on MMSE and CDR sum of boxes compared to placebo. Additional analyses demonstrated strong positive correlations between reduction in beta amyloid levels in both CDR and MMSE scores. We believe that the totality of the aducanumab Phase 1b study results strongly support development and registrational studies.","Based on feedback from regulatory agencies, we've recently finalized the aducanumab Phase 3 study design. The Phase 3 program includes two identically designed placebo-controlled studies, referred to as ENGAGE and EMERGE. Each study is expected to include 1,350 subjects with early Alzheimer's disease. Study subjects will be screened by PET amyloid imaging to confirm elevated beta amyloid plaque levels in the brain.","The primary endpoint will be CDR sum of boxes, a clinical measure including both cognitive and functional components measured at 18 months. In each Phase 3 study, APOE4 non-carriers will be randomized to receive 6 mg\/kg, 10 mg\/kg, or placebo, while APOE4 carriers will receive 3 mg\/kg, 6 mg\/kg, or placebo. Study dosing will include an up-titration period in an effort to reduce ARIA and maximize aducanumab's benefit\/risk profile. The Phase 3 program will be conducted globally and is planned to include more than 300 sites. Good progress has been made in operationalizing the studies, and initial investigational clinical sites for ENGAGE and EMERGE are now active and screening patients.","Moving on to our other programs, I'm pleased to mention that the European Medicines Agency has accepted the marketing application of ALPROLIX for the treatment of hemophilia B, signifying the initiation of the review process. Last week our partner, Sobi, exercised its opt-in right for ALPROLIX to assume final development and commercialization in certain territories, including Europe.","Our collaborator, Isis Pharmaceuticals, recently presented additional results from the ongoing Phase 2 studies evaluating SMNRx in infants and children with spinal muscular atrophy. We believe the available data are increasingly supportive of SMNRx having a therapeutic effect. Two Phase 3 studies for SMNRx are active, with enrollment currently ongoing.","We recently obtained Phase 2 study results for NEUBLASTIN in moderate to severe sciatica. The clinical results observed did not achieve our target product profile. And while we've made the decision to terminate this program developing new therapies (9:32) for pain remains an area of focus for Biogen. We've made good progress advancing development plans of our Nav 1.7 inhibitor acquired from Convergence, and we expect to begin enrolling patients into a Phase 3 study in trigeminal neuralgia next year.","We've also obtained Phase 2 study results for TYSABRI in acute ischemic stroke. Study results did not demonstrate an impact on the change in infarct volume, the primary endpoint of the study. However, secondary and exploratory endpoints, including the Modified Rankin Scale evaluating stroke recovery, suggest that TYSABRI may have had a beneficial impact on the functional deficits experienced by stroke patients. We believe that the benefit observed, if confirmed, would be clinically meaningful. We're evaluating additional study designs to pursue development of TYSABRI in stroke.","Earlier this month, we announced a collaboration with AGTC to develop gene therapies in ophthalmology. The collaboration is focused on adeno-associated virus-based gene therapy, with the goal of developing one-time transformative treatments for XLRS and XLRP. Expansion of our pipeline into these orphan ophthalmic indication represents a natural extension of Biogen's focus in neurology. Furthermore, through this collaboration, we've further bolstered Biogen's capability to utilize gene therapy as a therapeutic approach.","Before I turn the call over to Tony, I want to say that, as many of you know, this will be my last earnings call for Biogen. I'll be leaving the company at the end of next week to take on the role of CEO of a new startup company. During the last four and a half years at Biogen, I've had the opportunity to work with many extraordinary people, and the company has been transformed in many ways.","We've strengthened the pipeline and put a strong emphasis on discovery science excellence, which will pay off over the coming years. The R&D team is in very capable hands with Al and Spyros, and the company is performing extraordinary science in the labs and in the clinic under their guidance. I'd like to thank George and my colleagues at Biogen for giving me such a great opportunity, and I look forward to many more successes for the company.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony.","Stuart Anthony Kingsley - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","Thanks, Doug.","Our basic strategy in MS remains the same, to position TECFIDERA as the standard of care in the marketplace, to establish PLEGRIDY at the interferon of choice, and to leverage TYSABRI as the leading high-efficacy agent. In light of continued headwinds affecting TECFIDERA, we saw moderated patient growth for our MS portfolio as a whole this quarter.","Our 2015 business plan for TECFIDERA made two important assumptions: first, that TECFIDERA would continue to stimulate higher than historical market growth in switch rates as it drives the market from injectables to orals; and second, that TECFIDERA, with what we believe is a strong all-in profile, would continue to capture a high rate of both new starts and switches. Through the second quarter, both of these were weaker than planned, particularly in the more mature and larger markets of the U.S. and Germany.","In the U.S., total market growth and switch rates remained lower than our original expectations and appear to have returned to historical averages typically seen in the market before the launch of TECFIDERA. We believe the safety event reported in late 2014 is creating greater caution on the part of both physicians and patients about switching to orals. Our U.S. market research indicates a moderation in physician intent to prescribe, though in Q2 TECFIDERA continued to gain patients in the U.S.","We believe our promotional and educational efforts are strong and well resourced. In the U.S., we remain focused on emphasizing TECFIDERA's strong efficacy profile while ensuring physicians and patients are educated on proper monitoring requirements for lymphopenia, and we believe we are making progress. We have recently increased our share of voice across print and digital media to increase patient awareness and have also ramped up TECFIDERA sales calls by our field teams.","In more mature markets in Europe such as Germany, TECFIDERA has faced similar dynamics as in the U.S. On a patient basis, this has been offset by robust uptake in newly launched markets such as the UK, Italy, and Spain, where the launch curves to date have mimicked prior experience of very rapid uptake. For example, in the UK where full reimbursement funding really came into place around the turn of the year, we believe the uptake curve through June has actually exceeded what we saw in the U.S. and Germany. While patient growth for Europe as a whole was robust, total European TECFIDERA revenue was dampened both by the change of price and softer demand in Germany.","In Europe, our promotional strategy is similar to what I described in the U.S., maintaining high reach in frequency and emphasizing the strong value proposition of the product. However, in Europe we have been more limited in our ability to educate physicians about any new monitoring requirements as we are still waiting for an updated European label.","We continue to believe in TECFIDERA's competitive profile and believe the product can drive future patient growth, although at a more moderated rate. Establishing TECFIDERA as the standard of care in MS remains a primary focus, and we will be tireless in those efforts.","We believe that AVONEX and PLEGRIDY will continue to play an important role and that we are gaining share among interferons. PLEGRIDY has seen steady early uptake and has continued to source patients broadly.","TYSABRI continues to set itself apart in the market with an increasing number of alternatives. TYSABRI demonstrated positive patient growth again this quarter, and we believe this strong performance is a testament to the high level of efficacy that TYSABRI provides to patients.","Finally, in MS, we are gearing up for the potential launch of ZINBRYTA with our collaboration partner, AbbVie. If approved, we believe ZINBRYTA could be an important new therapeutic option for relapsing MS patients.","Turning to our hemophilia business, ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE continue to grow market share this quarter in the U.S. We continue to broaden both breadth and depth of prescribing amongst physicians and educate the community about the importance of maintaining protection from bleeding with less frequent infusions. Recent market research suggests that the product awareness continues to increase and that the convenience of our products' dosing schedules is well appreciated by patients. Outside of the U.S., we have also seen strong initial uptake of ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE in Japan, which we believe is an attractive long-term growth opportunity.","I'll now pass the call to Paul.","Paul J. Clancy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Tony.","Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.93 in the second quarter. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.22. Total revenue for Q2 grew 7% year over year to approximately $2.6 billion. Foreign exchange offset by hedging weakened total revenue by approximately $79 million year over year.","Global second quarter TECFIDERA revenue was $883 million, an increase of 26% versus second quarter of last year and an increase of 7% versus the prior quarter. This quarter's TECFIDERA revenues consisted of $721 million in the United States and $163 million outside the U.S. U.S. gross-to-net adjustments were lower this quarter than Q1 by approximately 400 basis points. We estimate we ended the quarter with approximately 2.5 weeks of inventory in the U.S. wholesale channel for TECFIDERA, a similar level to last quarter.","In Germany, TECFIDERA sales are being recorded at \u20ac12,800 as the free pricing period ended in mid-February. Largely driven by this, ex-U.S. TECFIDERA sales decreased 8% versus prior quarter, despite unit growth of 14%. Foreign exchange impact offset by hedging weakened TECFIDERA revenue by approximately $10 million year over year.","Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, were $690 million during the second quarter, including $455 million in the U.S. and $235 million in sales outside the U.S. Compared to the first quarter of 2015, U.S. interferon revenues decreased 12%. We estimate that approximately $50 million of the decrease is due to an inventory drawdown in the U.S. wholesale channel. We believe this was the result of rebalancing of inventories subsequent to the launch of PLEGRIDY. Foreign exchange impact offset by hedging weakened Q2 interferon revenue by approximately $27 million year over year.","TYSABRI worldwide revenue was $463 million in Q2. These results were comprised of $269 million in the U.S. and $195 million internationally. As a reminder, TYSABRI sales outside the U.S. in the second quarter of 2014 included $54 million of previously deferred revenue related to our AIFA [Italian National Medicines Agency] agreement. Foreign exchange impact offset by hedging weakened TYSABRI revenue by approximately $35 million year over year.","Moving to hemophilia, ALPROLIX revenue in Q2 was $54 million, and ELOCTATE revenue was $74 million. Our U.S. profit share for RITUXAN and GAZYVA as well as our profit sharing royalties on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. were $338 million.","Turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L, Q2 costs of goods sold were $286 million, or 11% of revenue. Q2 R&D expense was $491 million, or 19% of revenue. In Q2, SG&A expense was $492 million, or 19% of revenues. Our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 24% for Q2, which benefited by approximately 50 basis points related to a discrete item.","We ended the quarter with approximately $4.5 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 50:50 between the U.S. and ex-U.S. Our weighted average diluted shares at the end of the quarter were 236 million. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $4.22 for the second quarter.","Let me turn to our updated full-year 2015 guidance. We now expect revenue growth between 6% and 8%. This substantial decrease from our prior guidance is primarily driven by a change in our estimate for TECFIDERA's trajectory. Our balance-of-year forecast assumes limited patient growth for TECFIDERA in the United States. Additionally, in Europe overall reimbursement is below our original plan. Our revenue estimates for the rest of our MS portfolio remain largely unchanged.","Moving to operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, OpEx is unchanged as we work to contain costs for the balance of the year. R&D expense is expected to be between 19% and 20% of revenue, unchanged from prior guidance. Assuming deal closure, we will book an approximately $40 million expense to R&D in the third quarter related to our collaboration with AGTC. SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 20% to 21% of revenue, unchanged from prior guidance.","I'd like to point out that we'll owe Neurimmune a $60 million milestone payment upon dosing of the first patient in the Phase 3 trials for aducanumab. This payment will be an expense and presented within the non-controlling interest line in the P&L.","We anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share results between $15.50 and $15.95, and GAAP EPS to be between $14.25 and $14.70.","From a cash perspective, we now expect to pay approximately $850 million in CVR payments in 2015 related to the sales of TECFIDERA, a reduction from prior guidance.","We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $650 million to $700 million, an increase over 2014, as we continue to expand our manufacturing footprints. Included in this forecast is the recently announced agreement related to the Eisai's Research Triangle Park campus.","Overall, we're very disappointed in the change of outlook for the year. Nevertheless, we remain committed to working tirelessly to turn around the commercial performance, and we'll aggressively look for opportunities to reduce expenses while simultaneously ensuring we invest in the pipeline.","I'll turn the call over to George.","George A. Scangos, Ph.D. - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thanks, Paul.","Look, we obviously have a lot of work ahead of us as we strive to maximize the success of our commercial business and execute on our operational goals. Over the long term we expect that the primary source of value creation will be from the introduction of new therapies. So in closing, I'd like to highlight several pipeline programs that may be future value drivers for the company.","ZINBRYTA is currently under regulatory review as a potential new therapeutic option for relapsing MS patients. If approved, we believe that ZINBRYTA could be an interesting addition to our MS portfolio and provide Biogen with an additional treatment option for patients.","Later this year, we anticipate Phase 3 results for TYSABRI in secondary progressive MS, a form of the disease impacting approximately 30% of MS patients, and for which there are no proven effective therapies today. We also recently obtained Phase 2 results suggesting that TYSABRI may improve clinical outcomes in stroke patients, and we're rapidly moving forward to better understand TYSABRI's potential as a post-stroke therapy, with hopes to offer a new potential therapeutic option for the millions of patients experiencing this debilitating condition.","The Phase 3 SMNRx program, developed with our partners at Isis Pharmaceuticals, represents another important opportunity for Biogen. SMNRx is being developed with the goal of improving and extending the lives of patients with spinal muscular atrophy. The available clinical results increasingly suggest SMNRx may indeed be having this effect. We look forward to obtaining Phase 3 data late next year or early 2007.","We're eagerly awaiting the anti-LINGO Phase 2 MS results next year and expect to provide an update on the AON data at ECTRIMS [European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis] in the fall. While available MS therapies slow the course of the disease, anti-LINGO has the potential to work in a fundamentally different way, by acting as a restorative therapy.","And of course, Alzheimer's disease is an area of intense focus for Biogen, with several active clinical programs. In addition to aducanumab, our lead program, we're working with our partner Eisai to develop BAN2401 and E2609, potential disease-modifying therapies in Phase 2. BAN2401 is an anti-beta amyloid antibody, while E2609 is an oral base inhibitor that seeks to block the production of amyloid plaque. Clinical results are expected for both product candidates next year, and we look forward to providing updates on the progress of our R&D efforts as we continue to advance the pipeline.","Before I end the call, I want to take a moment to acknowledge Doug Williams's contributions to Biogen. Doug joined Biogen over four years ago, and since then has been a great friend and colleague and has done an amazing job helping to invigorate Biogen's R&D. I think that the progress that we've made should be obvious to everyone. So, as Doug prepares to leave the company, I'm sad to see him go, but I'm happy for him that he has the opportunity to move to a new role that truly excites him. I want to publicly thank Doug for all that he's done and wish him all the best in his next endeavor.","Fortunately for us, Doug has helped build a deep team, including for us (26:10) physicians and scientists who continue to advance Biogen's R&D efforts. Leadership for the research and development organization will be assumed by Al Sandrock, our Chief Medical Officer, and Spyros Artavanis, our Chief Scientific Officer. Both Spyros and Al are extremely talented and accomplished and I'm confident in the continued success of our R&D organization.","Finally, as always, I want to thank the many Biogen employees who have contributed to our success. Through good and challenging times, I'm always gratified to see the consistent dedication to patients and shareholders exhibited by our employees, and I'm confident that we'll all continue to work hard to accomplish our ambitious goals.","So with that, we'll end the call and open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question is from Geoffrey Porges with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Craig Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks very much, and I'm sure there will be lots of questions on the TECFIDERA and the rest of the MS portfolio outlook. Paul, I wanted to ask you a question first about margins and on a related basis about capital allocation. As you've had a chance now to look at this revised guidance and the outlook for the core business and then the various clinical trials that you're planning, what confidence do you have that the 48% to 49% operating margin you have today can be maintained over the next two years to three years?","And related to that, you have a very strong balance sheet. You mentioned the $4.5 billion in cash and marketable securities, next to no debt. Some of your competitors have used their balance sheet quite effectively, and we're wondering, are you contemplating that? Would you take on leverage? If so, how much, and what are your capital allocation priorities now? Thanks.","Paul J. Clancy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Geoff, thanks for the question, pretty expansive, so let me try to tackle it. On the margin front, certainly I'd point to what the guidance now assumes. I think from a multi-year perspective, we certainly would continue to still want to drive towards margin improvement. The dynamics of our margin improvements obviously over the next couple of years are going to be a little bit different. As the revenue growth has attenuated, we're going to have to work harder to control costs, and I think that we came into this year starting to do that with our SG&A. We are certainly doing that with the balance-of-year forecast, maintaining the OpEx targets as a percentage of sales that effectively assumes not an insignificant pull-back in our spending.","We're coming off a period that we purposely, and as I've articulated that we didn't want to be pennywise and pound-foolish, we had an unprecedented number of product launches for a company our size. I think that was appropriate, and we need to pivot towards making sure any and all waste gets out of the organization. That will be a very fine, delicate balance because we want to continue to invest in the pipeline, and we will absolutely make that an incredible priority. So we'll navigate through that. It will be a little bit of a challenge, but there's no doubt that we're up to it.","With respect to capital allocation, the balance sheet leverage, George and I will tag-team this one now. Certainly, we have a pristine leverage profile and a pristine capital structure. I don't, as I said before, don't think that should be measured on a quarter-in or quarter-out basis, but I think this company can and we would love to have a capital structure that has more debt on it. But that will be driven by the opportunity to be able to do that as opposed to falsely trying to do that.","As people noted, we have authorization from the board for a $5 billion share repurchase program. We have cautiously communicated that that would be done within five years' time. If the stock is under pressure, as it was in pre-market today, I suspect that we will look for opportunities to lower the share base. And capital allocation is much broader than that. Obviously, we continue to look for M&A opportunities. They've got to be the right thing. They've got to be the right value, and I'll let George pick up on that as well.","George A. Scangos, Ph.D. - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Paul. Thanks, Geoff. The question is are we willing to use our balance sheet and our debt capacity for M&A, for acquisitions, for projects, product, compound acquisitions. The answer is certainly yes. We are constantly looking, and we will be aggressive when we find opportunities that we think are attractive and consistent with our strategy.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, thanks. I guess a question for Al or Doug. I guess to start with Alzheimer's, which is, maybe you could give some more specific comments about your interpretation of the recent data, specifically six milligrams, and how we should interpret the clinical meaningfulness of this. I think people are looking at MMSE and then CDR and not confident on that clinical meaningfulness. So maybe you can give some more perspective on that data and why I guess you're confident now that you've disclosed also the doses. Thanks.","Douglas E. Williams - Executive Vice President-Research & Development","Hi, Michael, this is Doug. I'll start. Al will jump in as well. Look, I will simply say that when Al and I looked at the data from the 6 mg cohort, I think we were both very happy to see that it lined up very nicely with our expectations for what we thought should have happened. I think the fact that for CDR, it's slotted right in between the 3 mg\/kg and 10 mg\/kg dose cohorts. You couldn't ask for a better outcome, frankly, in terms of how that data shook out. As I mentioned in the call earlier, that's the primary endpoint for the Phase 3 study, so I think we're increasingly confident that the data is continuing to be very, very consistent across multiple parameters. We believe that this data is increasingly strong, and we're very confident setting up and starting the Phase 3 study based on the results we've seen.","I will go back in history and say that the last time that I personally was associated with a study at this stage where the results were this consistent across multiple parameters was back in my ENBREL days. So again, I believe that we have a really firm basis on which to go forward into Phase 3. The MMSE data, a little bit of wobble in that. That's the only data point that I can think of across the entire spectrum that didn't just line up almost perfectly. So we're strong believers in this product and feel very confident moving it forward.","Alfred W. Sandrock Jr., M.D., Ph.D. - Group Senior Vice President, Chief Medical Officer","I completely agree with Doug and I have nothing to add.","Operator","The next question is from Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. I apologize, I have the flu, if I sound a little down. First, I'd just like to just say congratulations to Al. As you know, Wall Street loves him, as do I.","George A. Scangos, Ph.D. - Chief Executive Officer & Director","We do too.","Paul J. Clancy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We do, too.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","In a friendly non-romantic type of way. So I just wanted just a couple points. Hey, Paul, I just want to be really clear. You're basically telling us that from a volume perspective, TECFIDERA is basically going to stay flat this year. I just want to make sure. That seems like a core \u2013 I just want to make \u2013 there are all these numbers flying around. I just want to make sure that that is the message here in the U.S.","And then I wanted to ask you \u2013 I wanted to push you guys a little bit on M&A, now with the unexpected slowing of the core business and a very interesting pipeline. But several years before it's going to contribute to the P&L, it would seem just obvious that plugging in some new products here, like Celgene perhaps has been doing, could make a lot of sense. You guys haven't really been very active on the M&A front. I think the last thing you did was the Elan transaction, which is just buying something you really knew. So can you talk about that? I think the Street would love to see you get more aggressive. Stocks go up every time acquirers buy a company. And I'll leave it at that and I'll get back in the queue. Thanks a lot.","Paul J. Clancy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Mark, I'll take the first part. Your interpretation is exactly accurate. There's some very modest patient growth, but it's essentially what we're assuming. And I know there will be an assessment of whether or not we're being conservative or not. But essentially, what we're assuming is extremely limited patient growth on a sequential basis for the balance of the year in the United States. Our aspirations are obviously \u2013 commercially we're aspiring for much more than that, but that is the assumption that we have in the balance-of-year forecast.","George A. Scangos, Ph.D. - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Look, Mark, on M&A, I think what you see, your observation is certainly is right. Every time there's some M&A event, stocks go up. We are certainly not engaged in M&A for any short-term stock performance. But we certainly are, I would say, increasingly aggressive about wanting to add additional compounds to our portfolio and to our pipeline. And we will be aggressive when we see good opportunities that are consistent with our strategy. So I think you can count on that.","Operator","The next question is from Ying Huang with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I want to probe you a little bit further on TECFIDERA. So we now have a second confirmed case on PML, even though it's off-label. And then we will see ocrelizumab data in RMS in Phase 3. So if you take a longer-term look at TECFIDERA, what do you think those could affect the growth trajectory for TECFIDERA?","And then also second question I have on the SPMS trial, I know you have a special product agreement with the FDA on the Phase 3 trial for TYSABRI in SPMS. Can you elaborate a little more? What do you need to see in order to be able to file for approval here? Thank you.","Stuart Anthony Kingsley - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","Thanks, Ying. It's Tony. So on the second PML case, let me talk about that and then talk about ocrelizumab. I guess it's still early days but it's certainly been several weeks that the information is out in the market. So we think the market has had some chance to absorb it.","Look, the first PML case was a pretty significant change statement for the profile of TECFIDERA, given its very pristine safety profile at the time. Our sense is that the second one is a much less significant change statement. The cases within the expected profile, still exceptionally rare. So in discussions that we've had with physicians, with thought leaders, they seem to be \u2013 the appearance is that they are processing that much more straightforwardly. We've also monitored media pickup, social media pickup, other things like that, and to date have seen very significantly less reaction on that front. So this feels like a significantly different and more muted reaction to date than the first case.","Ocrelizumab, look, I think consistent with what we've said before, we have seen increasing excitement in the market about ocrelizumab, particularly among specialists. We don't know the full data. It looks like a product that will play in the high-efficacy space. It's likely to appeal to the specialists, particularly the TYSABRI user, the RITUXAN user. That we think is more of an issue, frankly, for TYSABRI as it competes in the high-efficacy space and probably in a narrower customer, more specialized customer base over time. So we think of that as probably less relevant to TECFIDERA.","Look, in terms of TECFIDERA's long-term profile, which is where you had asked that, I'll say this. To date, when we look at our market research, the indicators and the leading indicators of brand health we believe continue to be pretty favorable. Our market research says the benefit\/risk profile has changed, but we believe it's still overall very positive. It's the most requested product by patients based on our research. Physicians state that they intend to use more, again, from market research, and they see it as appropriate for a broad set of patient types. So in the current environment, that's essentially why we're doubling down in what's been a slow market. The market has been more cautious and we think a lot of it is on the margin more cautious. But for a big brand like TECFIDERA, on the margin matters. So reach and frequency, patient outreach, and emphasizing the benefits of the product continue to be where we'll put our efforts.","Alfred W. Sandrock Jr., M.D., Ph.D. - Group Senior Vice President, Chief Medical Officer","Hi, Ying, this is Al Sandrock. I'm still blushing from Mark's comments, but I'll try to answer this question on SPMS. As you pointed out, it was important to get a SPA approval prior to starting because this is the first time the drug would be approved using a new composite measure of disability progression, and so that's why it was important to get a SPA agreement. This composite measure, I think that whether or not the drug gets approved is going to rest almost entirely on whether or not the drug is statistically significant on this measure, which by the way, this measure has the EDSS standard, EDSS one-point change that we've been using for a long time in relapsing MS, but also in addition has two other pieces, a nine-hole peg test, a certain percentage change in the nine-hole peg test, as well as the timed 25-foot walk. So we believe that increases the sensitivity to change, so we will see disability progression better and therefore increased chances that TYSABRI will show a treatment effect.","Operator","The next question is from Matt Roden with UBS. Your line is open.","Matthew M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Great, thanks very much for taking the question. While I share the love for Al and say congrats to your promotion, I also want to say congrats to Doug on a great run at Biogen and good luck on your next venture.","Douglas E. Williams - Executive Vice President-Research & Development","Thank you.","Matthew M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","The question is on the Alzheimer's program. So the new information for us today is the dosing in the Phase 3 program. If you look at the numbers you have on CDR, sum of the boxes at 3 milligrams and 6 milligrams, would you get stat-sig, statistical significance if the sample size were 1,350 patients, which is what you're using in ENGAGE and EMERGE?","And I guess related, just to better understand the strategy of using the multiple doses here, is it meant to enable patients in the real world to move up and down dose, or is it meant to just take people all the way up to 78 weeks in a particular dose and then reassess? I'm just trying to understand whether or not the clinical trial is capturing what you mean to do in the real world. Thanks.","Douglas E. Williams - Executive Vice President-Research & Development","Again, Al and I will tag-team this. I think the intent here, obviously, we've analyzed the data very carefully, and it's a very small sample size coming out of the current Phase 1b study. But what we've seen in terms of consistency of response across the doses I think has allowed us to do some very nice statistical modeling and make some assumptions about sample size that obviously we think will allow us to achieve statistical significance with the sample size, with the increased duration of dosing because as you recall from the previous look at the data, the longer you dose, the more amyloid you remove. And what we've shown in the most recent presentation is that there is a very nice correlation between amyloid removal and improvement in cognition. So I think all of these factors have come into play to both size the study and to pick the dose.","And I would say what we're trying to do is to actually push the dose and to push it as high and as hard as we can to remove as much amyloid as possible because we know that that seems to be an important parameter for efficacy with our drug. So all of this has been factored into the sample size, and I think we've designed a study now that allows us to take into account the fact that increasing doses work better, increasing durations seem to work better. And stratifying, based on APOE4 status is an important parameter for allowing us to both push the dose but at the same time try to minimize ARIA. And I think the up-titration is another element to the study that will improve our chances of maximizing the benefit\/risk.","Alfred W. Sandrock Jr., M.D., Ph.D. - Group Senior Vice President, Chief Medical Officer","I think anytime we go from Phase 2 to Phase 3, we do a discounting, if you will. We assume that the variability will increase. We assume that \u2013 and we look at 95% confidence intervals of what the actual treatment effect is, and that's what Doug was saying about the modeling. And so I think we're pretty confident using this sample size that we will achieve a statistical significance.","In terms of how we view this drug to be used once it's approved, I do think that people will get genotyped and the dose will be based on genotype, not (45:37) on whether or not they're APOE4 carriers. And then we'll have to look at the data to see which dose is superior in each of the subgroups, the carriers and non-carriers, and that will probably be the recommended dose. And then the other complication is if there's some ARIA whether or not people would dose-reduce because that's what was typically done in the Phase 1b trial. People dose-reduced, then most people were able to continue dosing with the dose reduction. So that's how I see it playing out.","Operator","The next question is from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, thanks for taking my question, maybe just two quick ones for me. First is just TECFIDERA, as you think about the out-year trajectory in the U.S., I know your outlook for this year is flat, but just help us think about the dynamics in terms of what really drives the trajectory change there.","And then just on Alzheimer's, I was wondering if you can remind us of any similarities or differences between BIIB037 and the Eisai antibody and the endpoint they're using in that ongoing Phase 2 trial. Thanks.","Stuart Anthony Kingsley - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","Thanks, Terrence. This is Tony, just maybe some qualitative comments on the outlook. We believe that the market continues to move to orals. We continue to believe that we have the best oral. So those are the two core things. And as I said, based on what we see in the market today, we continue to believe that we have a very good product profile. We think that we can continue to add patients. It's harder work at this point given where it is in the product life cycle.","Alfred W. Sandrock Jr., M.D., Ph.D. - Group Senior Vice President, Chief Medical Officer","In terms of the BAN versus BIIB037, the BAN trial is using a composite measure that includes some of the measures that we've looked at in the BIIB037 study. So it's a different kind of measure that is rather unique actually. I think it was developed by the scientists and clinicians at Eisai.","In terms of the differences in the antibodies, BAN binds to a different epitope than BIIB037. BAN is a humanized mouse antibody, whereas BIIB037 is a fully human antibody derived from human B-cells. And also BAN tends to bind to protofibrils. And so exactly which species of A-beta in terms of the aggregation status and fibrillar status, there are probably going to be some differences, although I would say that BIIB037 also binds to the ligamers as well as the fibrillary beta. So those are the differences.","Operator","The next question is from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thanks for taking the question. I want to ask just on stroke. Can you clarify exactly what you saw on those functional endpoints, how similar or different they might have been from TPA, and then when we should think about some sort of Phase 3 design or plan for that, and when we might see that data. Thanks.","Alfred W. Sandrock Jr., M.D., Ph.D. - Group Senior Vice President, Chief Medical Officer","This is Al Sandrock. The primary endpoint was the volume of the stroke basically based on MRI at day five. And as Doug said, that was not statistically significant, so we missed on the primary endpoint. What was surprising to us is then when we looked at the other clinical outcome measures at day 30 and day 90, we saw some interesting trends. And in some cases at certain times with certain measures there were statistical significance.","And the other measures that were looked at were the Modified Rankin Scale, the Barthel Index, and the NIH stroke scale. Those are the typical stroke scales. And in fact, people often combine them into the global scales. When we look at those, we see some interesting trends, as I said. With odds ratios \u2013 so then the other way to look at it is the odds ratios of reaching a favorable outcome on these endpoints individually and as a composite global score. And when you look at that, it's actually in the range of what was seen with TPA, which makes us interested in what we saw.","And so you mentioned going to Phase 3. I'm not sure we'll jump right into Phase 3, but we're still mulling over the data. We're looking at it in every which way that we can. We're discussing it with stroke experts. And we'll let you know what we're going to do next, but I think it bears further study.","Operator","The next question is from Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Co. Your line is open.","Eric Thomas Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks for the question. Maybe, Paul, I think we've touched on TECFIDERA's growth trajectory, but it sounds like your guidance for the second half of the year essentially on the top line implies no growth in revenue over the first half of the year. And I guess if there's no growth H2 over H1, maybe why should we be optimistic for growth in the future as well? So perhaps you could just talk about the overall top line growth trajectories that you're expecting over the next six to 12 months.","Paul J. Clancy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We've got to still sort that out as we move into 2016. I think that's what you're getting at, Eric. The guidance assumes that TECFIDERA patients in the United States are relatively limited growth, and that is clearly what we have to get motoring along. So that's the homework assignment. Outside the United States, we are growing in terms of patients. We had a hiccup this quarter versus Q1, as noted from the German pricing. That's a dynamic that will now settle out. But certainly, we've got some work to do on the commercial front.","Operator","The next question is from Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. So just to take a step back and just help me feel more comfortable around the rest of the year, two things. Again, it's early, but have you seen any impact from generic COPAXONE as push-back on price or utilization?","Second, when you thought about TECFIDERA and flat sales, to what extent do you think there will be people stopping the drug versus just minimal growth, and how are you thinking about that?","And then third, given the lack of growth in one of these core products, you talked about share buybacks. I guess this is going to a point that was made earlier. Has that changed your interest in bringing in something that will be a growthy driver, an M&A potential candidate that might help the company grow during the time in which you're developing your pipeline and you're facing such headwinds? Thanks.","Stuart Anthony Kingsley - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","Okay, Robyn, it's Tony. First on GLATOPA, generic COPAXONE, absolutely to date within our expectations, which I think we've talked about for a while now is we think that product largely has an impact within the COPAXONE molecule category.","Last I looked, which was probably a couple weeks back to early July, there were 400 or 500 Rxs, 90%-plus of them were switches. 97% of those switches were from COPAXONE QD, so to date absolutely where we expected it to be. You've seen probably the WAC, which is $63,000 \u2013 $64,000. I don't have clarity on what their contracting strategy will be, but absolutely within the expectations that we had.","Douglas E. Williams - Executive Vice President-Research & Development","And then good point, Robyn, what you're bringing up with respect to TECFIDERA. Certainly one of the dynamics that we've seen that we didn't expect was a modest but not trivial increase in discontinuations in TECFIDERA in the United States in particular.","That probably we think traces back to the monitoring to some extent. It traces back to efficacy breakthroughs, which is typical for most of the disease modifying the majority in it traces to some of the GIs. So both dynamics are actually happening. We're hopeful that we can actually bring that back to a bit normal state, but TBD as we move forward.","George A. Scangos, Ph.D. - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, and this is George, Robyn. Look, on the M&A question, I think as we've said before, we have a good balance sheet. We have debt capacity. We will not be shy about using it when we see opportunities that are interesting and consistent with what we want to do. I don't think we're in any panic situation to go out and be desperate. But there as we see good opportunities, we will be aggressive about bringing them in.","Operator","The next question is from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question, one for Tony and one for Doug or Al. So for Tony, you guys have talked about Europe being as big as the U.S. in terms of peak potential for TECFIDERA. I was just wondering if that was still the case and how you think about how quickly you could reaccelerate growth OUS.","And then for Doug or Al on aducanumab, maybe help us with the criteria for beta amyloid elevations and PET scans. I know you guys had a correlation between beta amyloid levels and cognition. But is there a threshold that you're looking for that you feel like you'd have maximal efficacy, or does it matter? Over an 18-month period, do you feel like just clearance of the plaque, even a marginal clearance, would have some sort of effect on cognition? Thank you.","Stuart Anthony Kingsley - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","Good, thanks. It's Tony. On Europe, the short answer is basically mathematically impossible for Europe to be as big as the U.S. given the differential in pricing and therefore net revenue per patient across. You have a big patient population in Europe. As I said, more mature markets like Germany, we believe we've seen dynamics that are a little bit more like the U.S. But launch markets we're seeing really nice uptake, and we believe it's very consistent with what we saw in the other launches.","So the total dynamic is we have seen good patient growth in Europe. We have had both net price and also FX working against us this year. We are basically through all the major reimbursement decisions at this point. And when all the dust has settled, the net prices we were able to achieve over there were certainly lower than our aspiration and what I think our plan was.","We always cautioned that given how broadly TECFIDERA would be used, you'd have a gravitational pull-down to the platform therapies. The argument for us with the pricing authorities obviously was superior efficacy, better profiles than the platforms. That has been a very tough row to hoe. It was made tougher by AUBAGIO, which went ahead of us and took what was a pretty low price strategy that increased the pressure over there. So I think Paul referenced it, and I talked a little in my comments. The net revenue per patient in Europe is just structurally substantially lower than the U.S. and for TECFIDERA specifically has come out lower than we would certainly have aspired to given those market dynamics.","Douglas E. Williams - Executive Vice President-Research & Development","And on the question about the lowering of amyloid, what we did there was to look to see whether there was a PK\/PD relationship essentially. And it was a scientific question. Does the effect on cognition need to go through the effect on amyloid lowering? And in a way it's asking is the amyloid hypothesis correct? And what we saw was that it's consistent with the amyloid hypothesis being correct.","Your question goes to another thing, which is are we going to be using this as a biomarker in the clinic when it's approved, and will there be some sort of threshold effect being used in clinic? And I think it's far too early to speculate on that. I think it might go to that part, but I would not say that this one standard deviation unit that we chose to look at would be that threshold. I think there's a lot more work that has to be done before we get to that stage.","Operator","The final question is from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to go back to aducanumab and see if you could provide a little more clarity on the titration there. I'm just not clear. Can anyone go up to 10 mg\/kg if they're tolerating the drug? And what's the trigger to up-titrate? And then also, how much would the planned titration schedule informed by the titration cohort you added to the Phase 1b trial? Thanks.","Douglas E. Williams - Executive Vice President-Research & Development","We haven't actually released the specific details on how the up-titration is going to work except to say that all of the patients will undergo that process as they get to their final dose in the study. Again, I think we'll have more clarity on that once we actually begin enrolling patients. But for the moment, I think we'll simply say that that is based on a variety of parameters, primarily that there are two things we know correlate with the incidence of ARIA. One is obviously dose, so a lower dose has a lower incidence of ARIA. And the second is time. Most of the ARIA occurs during the first five doses of administration. So the hypothesis that's being tested right now with this cohort you mentioned is whether or not at a lower dose for a period of time you can get through this period of risk, I'll call it, for developing ARIA and end up with a lower overall incidence on your way up to the final dose.","Carlo Tanzi - Director-Investor Relations","Okay. With that, we'll bring the call to an end. Thank you all for calling in today. Thanks for all the questions, and we can all get back to work now. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Idec Q2 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Wendy Gabel, Vice President, Investor Relations. Ms. Gabel, you may begin your conference.","Wendy Gabel","Thank you, Sarah, and welcome to Biogen Idec's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogenidec.com to find the press release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures that we'll discuss today.","Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results, which we believe better represents the ongoing economics of our business and reflects how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call.","As usual, we'll start with the Safe Harbor statement. Comments made in this conference call include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Words, such as believe, expect, may, plan, will and similar expressions are intended to identify such statements. Actual results could differ materially from our expectations, and you should carefully review the risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings slides, earnings release and in the Risk Factors section of our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC.

I'll also be joined for the Q&A portion of the call by Dr. Al Sandrock, Senior Vice President of Development Sciences and Chief Medical Officer.","Now I'll turn the call over to George.","George A. Scangos","Okay, thank you, Wendy, and good morning, everyone. We had an excellent second quarter, and we're on track to achieve our financial business and R&D goals for the year. Revenues and earnings for the quarter were solid. Costs were in line with expectations. We continue to make headway preparing for the approval and launch of BG-12. We completed enrollment in the trials for long-lasting Factor VIII and Factor IX and expect to have top line data within the next several months. We continue to expect data for dexpramipexole in ALS later this year, and we made real progress advancing the rest of our pipeline as well.","So some highlights for the quarter. Total revenues grew by 18% year-over-year to $1.4 billion, and non-GAAP diluted EPS were up 34% to $1.82. These numbers are a bit inflated since a year ago, we took a charge related to Genentech's arbitration with sanofi. However, even with that charge backed out, we posted solid double-digit revenue and earnings growth.","AVONEX had a particularly strong quarter with revenues of $762 million, up 16% year-over-year. The introduction of the AVONEX PEN autoinjector and AVOSTARTGRIP titration dosing regimen in the U.S., as well as our continued rollout in the EU and Canada, is not only improving the AVONEX experience for patients, but also driving renewed physician interest in one of the world's most trusted MS therapies.","Global in-market sales of TYSABRI grew 2% to $395 million while revenues to Biogen Idec were $280 million, which is flat compared to the second quarter last year, primarily due to the deferral of revenue in our Italian affiliate. While revenue growth slowed, TYSABRI unit sales were up 10%, as we continued to roll out risk stratification based on JC virus antibody status.","Patient demand for FAMPYRA in the EU continues to be encouraging, and RITUXAN revenues from our partnership with Roche and Genentech generated $285 million for the quarter.","Turning to our pipeline. We achieved a number of important milestones in the second quarter. While Doug Williams will provide more details, I wanted to highlight a few of those achievements: U.S. and EU regulatory authorities accepted our marketing applications for the review of our oral MS drug candidate, BG-12, and we submitted additional filings in Australia, Canada and Switzerland. In addition to completing the enrollment in our Phase III trials for long-lasting Factor VIII and Factor IX, we initiated 2 global pediatric clinical studies for the programs to support our global regulatory strategy. And ultimately, we hope to address the significant need for longer-acting therapies for children with hemophilia.","Through a second collaboration with Isis Pharmaceuticals, we added an interesting preclinical program intended to develop and commercialize a treatment for myotonic dystrophy. This program fits squarely within our strategy to focus on highly differentiated therapies for serious unmet needs in neurology.","So it was a productive quarter in which we delivered strong revenue and earnings growth while continuing to invest in the company's future success. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Doug Williams. Doug?","Douglas Edward Williams","Thanks, George. We recently had an Analyst Day that many of you attended where we discussed in detail the progress that we've made as an R&D organization over the past 1.5 years. But for those of you who weren't able to attend, let me briefly recap some of the important takeaways from that meeting.","We've executed very well on our Phase III pipeline either meeting or beating our internal time lines. The same time, we've strengthened the early stage pipeline by advancing internal Phase I and Phase II candidates and bringing in 4 high-quality innovative candidates that fit squarely within our areas of strategic focus.","More recently, we've stepped up the pace of revitalizing our discovery efforts. I believe that an increased focus on target identification and validation, both internally and through growing collaborations with Academia, is a key to that effort. Research into the underlying biology and genetic causes of disease points to pathways that other companies aren't already chasing and paves the way for us to discover first in class, truly novel approaches to address the difficult and devastating diseases in our sights.","In short, our goal is to build a world-class R&D organization that promises to deliver significant innovation over the long term. We continued to make progress on those fronts during Q2, positioning the company to launch a series of highly differentiated new drugs that address significant unmet needs for patients and that poise the company for future growth.","Starting with the late-stage pipeline, we began 2 global pediatric clinical studies, Kids A-LONG and Kids B-LONG, for our long-lasting recombinant Factor VIII and Factor IX Fc fusion proteins in hemophilia A and B. For children with hemophilia in their parents, long-lasting factor products would offer less frequent injections, which will reduce the treatment burden and potentially provide better long-term outcomes. The initiation of these studies represents an important clinical development milestone, as they're required for regulatory approval in the EU and support our broader global regulatory strategy. We expect to enroll approximately 50 patients in the Kids A-LONG trial and approximately 26 patients in the Kids B-LONG trial in sites around the world.","Moving on to daclizumab. We completed enrollment in DECIDE, the second registrational trial for daclizumab in relapsing-remitting MS with more than 1,800 patients. The trial will determine whether the significant reduction in annualized relapses and disability progression seen after 1 year of treatment in the SELECT trial can be sustained or enhanced over a period of 2 years. Top line data from DECIDE is expected in 2014.","I'm also pleased to announce that we enrolled our first patient this month in the Phase IIa study for STX-100 in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or IPF. IPF is a debilitating and almost uniformly fatal disease, in which patients experience progressive difficulty breathing due to fibrosis of the lung. More than 200,000 patients in the United States and Europe have IPF, and there's no FDA-approved treatment for the disease at this time. We expect to enroll about 30 patients at 15 U.S. sites in this study.","Turning now to the early-stage pipeline in research. I'm pleased with the progress we've made in building out the early-stage pipeline over the past year. As George mentioned, we recently added a promising preclinical program targeting myotonic dystrophy or DM1 through a second collaboration with Isis. DM1 is a debilitating neuromuscular disease that affects about 150,000 people in the U.S., Europe and Japan. It's caused by a genetic defect in the dystrophia myotonica-protein kinase or DMPK gene, and there are currently no disease-modifying therapies to treat DM1.","As discussed during our Analyst Day, one of our focus areas within neurology is genetically well-defined diseases. DM1 fits squarely within that particular approach. The disease is caused by the accumulation of toxic RNAs in the nucleus of affected individuals because of CTG repeats. And the Isis molecule is designed to specifically correct this accumulation. Isis is working to discover the lead drug candidate for the program, which we hope to take into Phase I next year.","Consistent with my earlier comments about revitalizing discovery, last week, we announced that we entered into a consortium that brings together world-class ALS researchers from 6 institutions to obtain the complete sequence of the genomes of up to 1,000 ALS patients over 5 years. The effort should give us a deeper understanding of the fundamental genetic causes of ALS, potentially yielding new targets for therapeutic intervention or patient stratification.","Biogen Idec is funding the project, which will be led from Duke University and HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology and include top researchers from Columbia University, Stanford University, the University of Massachusetts Medical School and the University of Montr\u00e9al. We plan to supplement these activities with additional collaborations and internal efforts to better understand the cell biology of ALS.","Looking ahead, we have a steady drumbeat of data readouts over the next few years, starting with long-lasting Factors VIII and IX, the first potential innovations in hemophilia treatment in more than 2 decades. Then dexpramipexole, a therapy that has the potential to be the first advance for ALS patients in more than 15 years. Those will be followed early next year with PEGylated interferon and then by a series of molecules expected to provide data and proof-of-concept studies thereafter.","I look forward to providing you with updates on our progress in the coming quarters. And with that, I'll now pass the call off to Tony Kingsley.","Tony Kingsley","Thank you, Doug. In the second quarter, we had double-digit revenue growth, driven by strong execution of our product strategies. Second quarter global AVONEX units increased 11%, while revenues increased 16% versus prior year. We continue to experience share gains within the ABCRE class in both the U.S. and outside the U.S.","Our strategy of focusing on first-line use and bringing convenience to the marketplace has allowed us to further differentiate AVONEX in the injectable segment, making the once weekly treatment a compelling choice for both patients and physicians.","The AVONEX PEN and AVOSTARTGRIP were recently introduced to the U.S. market. The AVONEX PEN has been shown to help reduce the anxiety patients may experience while self injecting. And for patients initiating treatment, titration could reduce the incidence and severity of flu-like symptoms that they may have when beginning AVONEX therapy. We're pleased by the early indications and believe that the strong demand in the U.S. AVONEX business was a combination of both patient demand for the PEN and PEN inventory stocking relating to the recent launch.","Market data also suggests there's been a strong conversion to the AVONEX PEN from existing patients, and that the majority of patients new to AVONEX therapy have chosen the PEN. The AVOSTARTGRIP performance has also shown very positive preliminary signs in the U.S. During the quarter, approximately 2\/3 of all new starts on AVONEX were with the AVOSTARTGRIP. Outside the U.S., we continue to maintain our leading market share position, and the AVONEX PEN continues to drive healthy unit demand in the U.K., Germany and the Netherlands.","Now turning to TYSABRI. Second quarter global TYSABRI units increased 10% versus prior year. In the U.S., second quarter TYSABRI units grew 9% year-on-year. This is the seventh consecutive quarter where we've delivered unit growth for TYSABRI. Outside the U.S., TYSABRI units grew 11% in the second quarter versus prior year.","We believe risk stratification is working. There is high awareness of the assay among neurologists, testing volumes are growing nicely -- our most recent estimates are over 100,000 tests completed globally -- and an increasing portion of patients tested are new TYSABRI candidates. While we continue to see some fluctuations in discontinuation rates among JCV antibody positive patients, overall, discontinuations are modest. We're seeing solid growth in new patients with 2,400 added during the second quarter.","We continue to see success with FAMPYRA as revenues approach $20 million in the second quarter, largely driven by Germany. FAMPYRA is now approved across the entire EU, Norway, Iceland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. We expect regulatory filings in 30 additional countries in 2012 and have planned launches in many EU countries. We are actively working with government agencies with a goal of achieving favorable reimbursement.","In Germany, our interactions with the GBA this quarter continued as we further demonstrated the benefit that FAMPYRA has for patients with MS. The GBA will issue the final assessment in early August 2012, at which time pricing negotiations will commence. We will continue to focus on strong execution of these product strategies in the second half.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer.","Paul J. Clancy","Thanks, Tony. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.61 in the second quarter. The primary differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results are outlined in the earnings presentation and include $51 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles.","Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.82. The financial results this quarter were obviously very strong. We always have puts and takes across the P&L. This quarter, we're fortunate to have a disproportionate number of favorable items. These included a resupply in certain AVONEX international markets, benefits from hedging on AVONEX, a step-up in our ANGIOMAX royalties, a low level of write-offs, and we gained a P&L benefit from collections in Spain. I'll highlight these as I walk through the financial results. Nevertheless, we're quite satisfied with where we are on a year-to-date basis.","Q2 AVONEX worldwide revenue was strong, growing 16% versus prior year to $762 million. In the U.S., AVONEX grew 13% year-over-year to $464 million. U.S. unit volume was down 2% versus prior year and up 7% versus last quarter. Inventory in the wholesale channel ended at just under 2 weeks, a decrease compared to prior quarter. We're heartened that the U.S. channel dynamics we experienced in the first quarter appear to have been isolated.","Internationally, Q2 AVONEX revenue was $298 million, an increase of 19% year-over-year. For AVONEX, the combined impact of currency and hedging was not a headwind for us in the year-over-year comparison. Foreign exchange weakened AVONEX revenue by $23 million. It was offset by a $10 million hedge gain in the quarter as compared to a $15 million hedge loss in Q2 2011.","AVONEX second quarter global sales also benefited by approximately $7 million from the resupply arising out of the voluntary product recall, which drew down sales at the very end of Q1. And additionally, we benefited from the timing of tender sales in Brazil.","TYSABRI worldwide in market sales were $395 million, an increase of 2% year-over-year. Biogen Idec recorded TYSABRI product revenues of $280 million. In the U.S., TYSABRI product revenue to Biogen Idec grew 15% to $93 million. Q2 international TYSABRI product revenue was $187 million to Biogen Idec.","There are 3 drivers why units increased double digit year-over-year and revenue growth did not match. First, revenues were unfavorably impacted by $16 million of deferred revenue in our Italian affiliate related to the Italian National Medicines Agency claim. Second, the impact of foreign exchange for the second quarter softened revenue by $19 million for TYSABRI versus the prior year, which was offset by a $4 million gain from hedging compared to a $3 million hedge loss in the prior year. The amount of the hedge gain that helped mitigate the effect of currency during the quarter for TYSABRI was more modest than AVONEX as we have a natural hedge in our collaboration profit-sharing line. And third, we experienced a modest price in country mix shifts.","U.S. RITUXAN sales were $784 million, up 5% versus prior year. Performance is solid in the maintenance setting in NHL, CLL, RA and the new vasculitis indications. Our U.S. profit share was $259 million. Royalties and profit-sharing sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. were $25 million. The result was $285 million of revenue from unconsolidated joint business in Q2.","FAMPYRA revenue was $20 million for the second quarter, primarily driven by sales in Germany. Our 1-year anniversary of the FAMPYRA launch in Germany is in August. At that time, we won't have a fixed price from an accounting perspective as our negotiations with the GBA will be ongoing. As a result, we plan to record revenue at a lower price until the price negotiations are final. And therefore, we expect revenues for the remainder of the year to be approximately half of year-to-date sales.","Royalties were $37 million, an increase of 29% year-over-year. Second quarter royalties were favorable to our business plan, which was the result of achievement of a higher royalty tier on ANGIOMAX sales during Q2. We had previously anticipated to reach this new tier in the third quarter. We recorded $22 million of corporate partner revenue, driven by manufacturing contracts with strategic partners.","Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q2 COGS were $139 million or 10% of revenues. The increase in COGS year-over-year was driven by higher AVONEX and FAMPYRA revenue and includes approximately $7 million related to funding the JC virus assay testing. We experienced essentially no write-offs this quarter.","Q2 R&D expense was $329 million or 23% of revenues, which includes the $12 million payment to Isis on the DM1 program. Q2 SG&A expense was $301 million or 21% of revenues, an increase of 13% over last year and essentially flat versus first quarter. Our collaboration profit-sharing line totaled $79 million.","Other income and expense was a gain of $3 million in Q2. During the quarter, we had a high level of collections in Southern Europe, particularly in Spain where the Spanish government executed a program across the pharma industry to pay down past due receivables, many of which were greater than 1 year old. We received $120 million of accounts receivable due from various Spanish regions. In addition to improving the balance sheet, this resulted in a positive impact in the P&L statement of approximately $5 million due to accelerating previously imputed interest. This was recorded in the OI&E line.","Our Q2 non-GAAP tax rate was 24%. In the second quarter, our weighted average diluted shares were $241 million. During the quarter, we made great progress in the $500 million share repurchase program we announced 90 days ago. We purchased approximately 3.3 million shares for a total cost of $447 million, and we completed this program in early July, and all shares have been retired. We ended the quarter with $2.9 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 60-40 between the U.S. and outside the U.S. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $1.82 in the second quarter.","Now I'll turn to our updated full year 2012 guidance. We expect full year revenue growth of mid-single digits, unchanged from previous guidance. I'll provide some detail on our revenue outlook. We're encouraged certainly by the second quarter AVONEX strength, yet remain mindful about a couple of dynamics, including that downstream retailers are managing both PEN and prefilled syringe inventories. And in the U.S., we anticipate a second competitive oral to be approved later this year.","While we're working to resolve the IE for TYSABRI claim in Italy, our current guidance does not include a resolution in 2012 and assumes we continue some TYSABRI product revenue being deferred for the rest of the year. If we resolve this, this obviously would be upside.","Our current guidance does not include sales from BG-12 as we expect launching in early 2013. Regarding FAMPYRA, as I previously mentioned, the balance of year assumes that revenue will be approximately half of year-to-date sales owing to the German reimbursement process.","Our expense targets, as a percentage of sales, are unchanged from previous guidance. Cost of sales, expected to be between 9% and 10% of total revenue. R&D, expected to be between 24% and 25% of total revenue. Included is a $23 million milestone payment to Portola, which we expect to occur in the third quarter.","SG&A expense is expected to be between 22% and 23% of total revenue. During the second half, we expect increased investment in prelaunch activity closer to the BG-12 launch.","We expect to put our Denmark large-scale manufacturing facility into service in the second half of this year, which is a very positive milestone. The P&L impact of this will be a change from capitalizing interest to expensing it. The result is that we expect our other income and expense line to go from approximately $18 million of favorability year-to-date to approximately $10 million to $20 million of expense for the second half of the year.","We expect our tax expense in 2012 to be between 23% and 25% of pretax income. As a result, we now anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share results to be above $6.20 and GAAP EPS above $5.44. This modest improvement in non-GAAP reflects the continued investments in the late-stage pipeline in preparing for upcoming product launches, which intensify in the second half.","Now I'll hand the call over to George for his closing comments.","George A. Scangos","Thanks, Paul. So at this mid-year mark, we're on track to achieve our 2012 goals, which include growing our leadership in MS by increasing TYSABRI market share, stabilizing worldwide AVONEX market share and growing FAMPYRA revenue, prudently investing to make sure that we're well prepared for the launch of BG-12 in MS and Factors VIII and IX in hemophilia A and B and continuing to advance our late-stage pipeline and strengthen our early-stage pipeline to make sure that we're poised for future growth.","We expect to accomplish all of this, while at the same time, delivering revenue and EPS growth. We have a busy 9 months ahead of us, preparing for the BG-12 launch and 4 pivotal trial data readouts for the long-lasting blood Factors VIII and IX, dexpramipexole in ALS and PEG-Interferon.","So in closing, we feel good about where we are as a company right now, and we believe the best is still to come.","So with that, we will stop and open up the call for questions.","Wendy Gabel","Thanks, George. Operator, we're ready to open the call for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we're ready for that first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams from Wells Fargo Securities.","Brian Corey Abrahams - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk in a little bit more detail about the TYSABRI discontinuation rates. You mentioned that there's been some fluctuations there. I was wondering if you could talk more specifically about any differences you're seeing in U.S. versus European dynamics there, if you think this is starting to stabilize somewhat in Europe and whether or not you're seeing any changes and shifts as patients who are JCV positive reach 2 years.","Tony Kingsley","Thanks, Brian, it's Tony. So what -- as we've said in the past, country-by-country, as we work through testing the existing patient base, we've seen some lumpiness in the discontinuation rates. But overall, we feel like it would stabilize over the course of this year. We continue to feel that way. The discontinuation rates have continued to be within the broad ranges that we thought we have, and there aren't, I don't think, significant differences between the U.S. and Europe in the discontinuation rates. We're seeing reasonably similar patterns across countries at this point. So no substantial shift on that front.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from Bernstein.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Tony, could you give us a little bit more color on AVONEX in the U.S.? Really strong result there. I'm just wondering if you could break it down for how much of it was the stocking of the new product images and then how much was price. You mentioned volume was actually down. And could you also talk a little bit about the dynamics in the overall market, what you're seeing in terms of treated patient numbers right now in the U.S. and Europe?","Paul J. Clancy","Yes, Geoff, thanks, this is Paul. Let me kind of give a little bit of a sense for the underlying strength. On a global basis, a very strong quarter for AVONEX. We did try to point out that on a global basis, we benefited from some resupply from the kind of Q1 very end that was more the international markets as well as the Brazil tender. We, from a wholesaler demand, a channel perspective, we -- our inventory levels ended up at under 2.0 weeks, which is very favorable for us. We don't have visibility with respect to the retailer inventory levels, and we're just a little bit cautious that they're probably likely managing both PEN and lyophilized inventory levels in that we may have benefited a little bit modestly from that. But nevertheless I think Tony and his team, I'll turn it over to him, are feeling very good about the acceptance of AVONEX PEN and the dynamics and the ability to compete in the marketplace. Tony?","Tony Kingsley","Yes. Thanks, Paul. So in terms of sources of growth, we did, I think Paul said we did see units down 2% year-on-year but up 7% quarter-on-quarter in the U.S. Some of that reflected the dynamics in the first quarter, but we feel comfortable that we are getting good unit growth, and that we're getting some share growth within the ABCRE segment. It's still relatively early days with the PEN in the U.S. and titration, but we track the leading indicators. I mentioned some of them on the call in terms of the percent of patients who are choosing the PEN, what percent of new starts we're getting. And we feel comfortable that we're seeing a repeat of the experience that we've seen in some other markets. In terms of the total market, we still see the U.S. market this year growing as expected in terms of total patients in low-single digits. Europe is typically higher than that, sort of mid-single digits. No big change in the market growth relative to what our expectation was.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew Roden from UBS.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So your cash balance is growing here, can you share your latest thinking on what's on the table and what's off the table? With respect to use of cash, perhaps, prioritize how you think about putting that cash to work. And then more specifically, if I may, do you have any thoughts on the potential merits of consolidating TYSABRI economics as bapineuzumab plays out? Would you look at global TYSABRI rights as a purely financial consideration, or would you consider it strategic to consolidate the brand?","Paul J. Clancy","Yes, I mean, Matt, I mean George will answer it. Obviously, we can't comment -- we appreciate that it's quite topical coming off of last night's news, but really just no comment. But George, if you can kind of give a broader perspective, it'd be great.","George A. Scangos","Well, sure. And so but just on bapi, the first trial didn't meet its end point, but there are other trials yet to come. So I think that final word there isn't out yet, and we don't have too much to add to what we've said previously about our cash usage. We have, over the past few years, done a combination of what Paul has from small tuck-ins, so little deals, small acquisitions. We've bought shares back, and we'll continue to think about it the same way as we move forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marshall Urist from Morgan Stanley.","Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So just on TYSABRI. Tony, maybe you could talk about patient mix in terms of what you're seeing right now kind of post the assay in terms of first line, second line, third line mix. Any impact of Gilenya so far that you can kind of discern in the market kind of post the label changes? And then finally, just a little bit of better insight on why units, rest of world units, looks like were actually down quarter-over-quarter. So just trying to understand what all of those, how all those dynamics tie together.","Tony Kingsley","Yes, thanks, Marshall. So patient mix, we are -- as I said, one of the things we look at with the assay is what's the portion of patients who are existing patients versus candidates. And we're seeing a nice increase, in fact the majority of patients tested now are candidates for TYSABRI, which is a good news, very, very positive. We continue to see evidence that we're seeing, as a result of that, TYSABRI used earlier in the treatment paradigm. I'm not sure I can break down very specific metrics on second line, first line, third line, but we are continuing to see evidence in the patient demand that we're seeing patients tested and then -- or new patients moved on to the product, which is very positive. Not a lot of news from our standpoint on Gilenya. We continue on FTY, we continue to see them sort of chugging along nicely at the level that they have. Again, we think that TYSABRI has a significant efficacy advantage, and with risk stratification, a significant advantage for patients who really need that higher efficacy. So just, it netted out. We did add 2,400 net patient adds in the quarter, which we feel was a very good performance.","Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then just on the rest of world units?","Tony Kingsley","Yes, it's owing mostly, Marshall, to emerging markets. So as we pointed out in the past, both for AVONEX and TYSABRI, we have some wobbliness quarter-to-quarter. Emerging markets, AVONEX benefited this quarter from Brazil tender sales. Last quarter, TYSABRI benefited from some of the emerging market tender sales. So it's really that if you kind of strip that out of it, both in Europe, as well as in the emerging markets, it's a very kind of very normal nice trend moving in the right direction.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Deutsche Bank.","Navdeep Singh - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's Navdeep substituting in for Robyn. Just a couple of questions on TYSABRI. So can you describe what percentage of your EU TYSABRI patients have been tested with the JCV assay, and what percentage of the JCV positives are staying on? And when you expect the discontinuations of the JCV positives to wash through?","Tony Kingsley","Okay. So in terms of the percent of patients, the existing TYSABRI patients that have been tested, I think over the course of the later part of last year, post the launch of the commercial assay in the EU, we saw different trajectories country-by-country. But the vast -- we believe the vast majority of patients, country-by-country, got tested over the 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-month time frame last year. I can't tell you that every existing patient has been tested, but as we tracked it, we believe that most of the existing TYSABRI patients have been tested. And again the testing mix is shifting now. We still have a significant number of existing patients being tested because people will be retested over time, but it's shifting more to new candidates over time. Discontinuation rates, again, we track that through a variety of indirect measures in the EU, including market research and speaking with physicians and other things. We think among the positives, the majority of positives had continued to stay on the product because of the efficacy advantage. And we think the discontinuation rates have been relatively stable with a little bit of month-to-month up and down lumpiness.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rachel McMinn from Bank of America.","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess I wanted to ask a few questions just on, can you quantify the Brazil tender offer for 2Q? And can you also talk about whether the pricing for the tender has actually gone down? I guess J&J made some comments on its call that the actual pricing for tenders has substantially declined. And then my second question is just when you talk about some of these emerging growth markets for AVONEX, is there any growth left from converting those into direct market sales as you've done in the past?","Tony Kingsley","Why don't I start with...","Unknown Executive","Yes, go ahead.","Tony Kingsley","So I was in Brazil last week, Rachel. Good question. On the tenders, so the tenders in Brazil are administrative tenders as opposed to competitive tenders. But each year, you have to go negotiate with the government, who tries to grind a little price out of you. So it's not a competitive dynamic so much as a, you have an opportunistic payer in Brazil that comes back every year and looks for a little something. But we do see, for example, in Brazil, MS continues to be under-diagnosed. There's lots of opportunity for both -- to get to your question, both AVONEX and TYSABRI, given the population growth and what's going on with the economy in general. In terms of AVONEX potentially in the rest of world, we still think that there is a potential. And we continue to invest both in direct markets and distributor markets. I don't think we have any news to announce on additional entry in direct markets. We're constantly looking at that and the trade-off of the economics, yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from ISI Group.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I -- a lot of my questions have been actually asked. So I'm going to ask 2 that are a little bit off the wall that I just thought I'd get out there. So one is that I know years ago, you guys applied for BG-12 in Germany for psoriasis and then the application was withdrawn. I think your regulatory filings just said that you want to focus on multiple sclerosis. The question I had is did you ever get any feedback from the German regulators on that application or did -- around, especially around safety obviously? And if so, if you'd be willing to share with us or did you just withdraw before you ever got any feedback? And the second is on FAMPYRA. Can you just confirm please if that's just the reason revenues are going to be down is strictly an accounting, a conservative accounting assumption you're making, but the end user, you're expecting to be flat or up. I just want to make sure I heard that right.","Paul J. Clancy","Yes, no, let me go with the second question, and I appreciate it because it's a great point of clarification and importance. And then Al's going to try, at least, I don't think we have a lot of perspective on BG-12, but he'll give a little bit on that. Yes, it's exactly what you said. The IQWIG, GBA process now is such that the price that you go into the market, you keep and you have that \"free price\" through your 1-year anniversary. Subsequent to the 1-year anniversary, we will be in price -- we expect to be in price negotiations. Those price negotiations, we expect that they could bleed into the first quarter of 2013, and whatever that is decided, it goes retroactively back to the first, to the date of the first year anniversary. As a result, as you know, there's 4 requirements for revenue recognition. One of those requirements is a fixed and determinable price. Given that there'll be ambiguity, it is very much strictly an accounting perspective that we'll take a view of what our fixed and determinable prices and be -- we expect to be booking revenue at that lower -- at a lower level. That will be reconciled once we get the final kind of price negotiations. So I think it's probably pretty close to the way you characterized it. But -- and it really -- and as you know, what we came out of the IQWIG process with so far is a pretty wide range in terms of -- and actually, a range that is within what our price today is in Germany. So I think it's an accounting convention that we'll be living with for the second half. And I think as importantly, we'd underscored that the actual demand for the product is quite strong in Germany. And as we move into the other markets, we expect it to be quite strong. So exactly how you characterized it. Al, BG-12 psoriasis?","Alfred Sandrock","Mark, this is Al Sandrock. Your memory of ancient history is amazing. I had my head down in neurology, and I didn't really pay much attention to what was going on in psoriasis at the time. At the time we decided though to shift our strategic focus, I do remember this, away from dermatology and psoriasis and on to MS. And so that feedback was -- if it had been gotten was so long ago that not sure that it would have played much of a role in our thinking currently anyway. So I'm sorry. I just don't remember.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt from Cowen and Co.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Paul, I'm still struggling a little bit with the AVONEX number in Q2, the $762 million, and what in that is sort of real versus more of a onetime nature? Could you take a stab at maybe more quantifying what the issues or the benefits were, the Brazil tender, the resupply in Europe, any inventory you can guess at? And I guess it seems like your guidance implies that AVONEX has to go down in the second half of the year relative to Q2. Is that what you mean to say?","Paul J. Clancy","Yes, well, yes. I mean there's a chance it doesn't. We're just trying to be mindful of it. Certainly, there are 2 things we can definitively point to, the Brazil tender. That's a little less than $10 million. And that the coming in the global markets, we had about $7 million of essentially resupply from the voluntary product withdrawal recall that was at the very end of Q1. We're just trying to be mindful that around the world and certainly in the United States, there may be some retailers that are managing kind of both PEN and lyophilized. We may be getting a modest benefit from that. So I think really that's it. Nevertheless, I think we feel it's a very, very strong, strong quarter. And then broadly speaking, the guidance is -- we're hoping -- we're going to be pushing hard as much as we can for the balance of the year, but the guidance also certainly is trying to point out that we have intensification of some of the prelaunch expenses for the second half as we get closer to BG-12 launch and even as we start to invest a little bit and prudently in Factor VIII and Factor IX potentially over the next 6 months.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from JPMorgan.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a few on TYSABRI. So last quarter, you all called out trends then in TOUCH forms, so I'm curious if you could do that for this quarter. And then maybe a question for Paul. The impact from TYSABRI from your Italian affiliate, I'm just curious if this is part of the normal course of business or do you think that you have a risk of this happening in other countries across Europe.","Paul J. Clancy","So I'll start with TOUCH forms. So TOUCH forms being essentially the prescription, if you will, and in the U.S., which we track. We have continued to see the ability to drive nice growth in TOUCH forms. Obviously, they go up and down, week-to-week basis, but the trends are consistent with what we saw last week. We think the sales force is generating good front-end demand.","George A. Scangos","Yes, Geoff, with respect to the IEFA situation, I mean, what we understand is that there are a number of pharmaceutical companies in upwards to 50 or 100 different \"products\" under IE for review. Ours is kind of unique. We've tried to disclose it that it has to do with a dispute with respect to the price cap going way back to the first 2 years of the launch of the product. So ours is a -- results in accounting -- in having deferred revenue that is quite unique. We are hoping and expect to be in front of IEFA in the fall, and we're hoping to get resolution around that. In terms of broader macro, the forward pricing environment is certainly a risk factor for our business. In the big 5, we have experienced the -- and it's already embedded in the P&L in -- if you think about Germany, there was pricing actions in August of 2010 across the industry. In Spain, in spring of 2010, there was a 7.5% rebate. So I think we're in some of these countries, we're getting past it, but we're still mindful that it's a macro risk factor for the industry, but we're working hard to mitigate all those impacts.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber from Citi.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I have -- and for Paul and for George, maybe 2 quick questions. So just one, just so we understand with respect to the FAMPYRA revenues, it sounds to me that if you're sort of guiding for half the revenues in the first half, you're making some kind of an assumption as to where you think your price is going to be. Is that the way we should look at it? And would there be essentially a true-up payment then in Q1 to Acorda or how should we think of it? And then secondly, the dexpramipexole, I noticed the second study hasn't started yet. It sounds like it's on track now for 2013. I'm just trying to get a sense as to why the holdup, and kind of what are you waiting for to start that study.","George A. Scangos","Let me start with the first part, Yaron. The projection that I outlined in the guidance assumes the lower end of the range that IQWIG has come out with. So that is the planning case that we're going with right now. We'll have another data point by Q3, which will be GBA's assessment. So we'll include that in the facts as we attempt to estimate a price. With respect to the relationship from Acorda, the royalties to Acorda are on GAAP sales. So it will flow with the ebbs and flows of the accounting treatment for the product quarter-by-quarter.","Douglas Edward Williams","This is Doug. With respect to the second study for dexpramipexole, back a couple of quarters ago, we discussed this. And the reason for delaying the start of the second study is really to be able to incorporate any learnings from the first study into the design of the second, should we need it. So that was a purposeful decision on our part to really have the opportunity to take a look at the data from the first study and then incorporate any learnings into the second.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. But you're still planning on testing the higher dose, or is that not necessarily the case anymore?","Douglas Edward Williams","Yes, I think that's still an open question, and one that we would like to answer, because as you recall from the Phase II study, we didn't really top out on the dose response curve. So it's an open question, and one that we'd like to answer.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ravi Mehrotra - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A question for Tony. You've previously commented that BG-12 will have a separate sales force. Could you walk us through the thinking of this, rather than the other extreme of putting, I guess, 3 products in 1 bag?","Tony Kingsley","Yes, good question, Ravi, thanks. So let's talk about the 3 assets that we'll have as DMTs. AVONEX competes in a segment that's not going to disappear overnight, which is the injectable segment, which is promotionally sensitive. I think we've demonstrated that over the last couple of years and couple of quarters in the results. So we think we need to continue to keep meaningful promotional effort against AVONEX within that segment with the strategy of continuing to outperform other injectables. BG-12 has potential to -- obviously, we're excited. It looks like it's a great product profile. It will be the third oral into market probably. It's going to require significant promotional investment. It's going to require a significant physician-facing investment in education, and we think it requires that. TYSABRI, we've talked about risk stratification, the ability to grow that product. Again, it's a product that requires significant customer-facing resources. So we think it would be penny wise and kind of foolish to try to get a lot of leverage on the sort of customer-facing end. That may be something that happens over the long term, but in the short term, we think you've got to put a lot of effort against these things to turn them into the kinds of products and kinds of share products that we think they can be.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Actually, a question for Doug or Al. Actually, I'm thinking about LINGO next year. Can you get any proof-of-concept data or can you talk about any data next year in LINGO? And what are you actually looking at to determine remyelination? Can you walk through a little bit about that, how you'll actually be able to talk about remyelination or show that?","Douglas Edward Williams","Yes, Michael, we're unlikely to get data next year. We'll be well on our way to getting data, but probably won't get a readout next year. The ways we're going to look at remyelination are in 2 ways. One is in the optic neuritis trial to look at visual function by looking at visual contrast acuity, also looking at nerve conduction by looking at multifocal, visually both responses and also looking at neuro protection by looking at ocular coherence tomography, because we think that remyelination will lead to neuro protection. In the other trial, we will be looking -- using state-of-the-art imaging technology to look very closely at MS lesions at the time they form, and then the evolution of those lesions in the month thereafter, where we think that some remyelination occurs naturally, but we hope to enhance that natural process with anti-LINGO. And so it will be a lesion-imaging assessment essentially, and so both I think are important.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tony Butler from Barclays Capital.","Charles Anthony Butler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to ask a question for Tony on AVONEX. As you alluded to 3 different sales forces depending on what was being sold, if the PEGylated form of AVONEX is successful in the market or for in clinical development, how do you actually fragment that with that first injectable sales force, if I could just call it that, given it's extraordinarily promotionally sensitive? Does that sales effort have to actually expand dramatically, and do you actually just quit talking about AVONEX itself and just really stay with the PEN and with the PEG form?","Tony Kingsley","No. Good question. So I think we think about not just AVONEX but the interferon franchise over time and what it will take. So my statements about competing in the injectable segment and out-competing really referred to the AVONEX PEN, and then we would hope PEG. Look, PEG, the kind of profile that PEG potentially could have, makes it the clear winner in the injectable segment in my mind for patients. I mean the convenience factor of a once every 2 week or once a month, if that's the way that plays out is very good. So we would likely see the interferon franchise transition over to PEG over time. And we would -- so you wouldn't have a significant increase in sales force and promotion other than what you normally would have around what's essentially a pretty significant line extension.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Wei from Jefferies.","Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I had a question on the other AVONEX factors that you mentioned for the second half, the new oral competition. You referred to that as a cautionary note in the prepared comments but actually didn't raise it during one of the answers I think to Eric's question in the Q&A. And I was wondering how we should -- or how you're all thinking about the near-term impact on AVONEX as a result? If there might be a lower bar to initiating patients on that therapy relative to Gilenya? And does that, in your mind, lead to a bigger or more immediate impact on AVONEX in 2012 as a result?","Tony Kingsley","Good question. It's Tony. So again, we are -- this is a -- we don't know when it's going to get approved or how it will shape up, but we expect a good effort in the latter half of the year. It's a product that looks like it could compete for some new start patients, and it certainly could compete for some tolerability switches. We think AVONEX has a superior value proposition to the new oral, and we think we fight it out in the, at the field level and at the promotional level. We think we can prevail in that game, but it's a meaningful new entrant that will attract some attention. You are correct that it looks like it will have a lower, sort of lower complexity, relative to FTY, and some people may find that appealing. The real question will be is there an efficacy story there that merits choosing that product relative to a well-understood one like AVONEX.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ian Somaiya from Piper Jaffray.","M. Ian Somaiya - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I just wanted to revisit the pricing discussion in Europe. You've made some comments related to the big 5, but there was more of a historical perspective speaking to price declines in 2010. Some of your pharmaceutical peers have spoken to continued price erosion in the 5% to 6% range, and I wanted to get your take on whether that's a fair representation of what we should expect for your products going forward.","Paul J. Clancy","Yes, this is Paul again. So I think it's a scenario that we're thinking about. So it's very -- it's actually hard to predict on a product-specific basis because country-by-country, certainly different things are happening. The -- we are kind of being mindful of the broad macro concerns, and that historically, what you could essentially count on in our business is kind of flat to down 1% or 2% pricing. And I don't think it's a far reach to say that, that accelerates to 3%, 4% or 5%. So we're kind of thinking through that and trying to be mindful about it but nothing exact to report out on at this point.","Wendy Gabel","Thanks. That was our last question.

Thank you and welcome to Biogen's third quarter 2017 earnings conference call.","Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the press release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we'll discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call.","I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail.","On today's call, I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Michel Vounatsos, and Dr. Michael Ehlers, EVP of Research and Development. We will also be joined for the Q&A portion of the call by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Al Sandrock, and Dr. Paul McKenzie, EVP of Pharmaceutical Operations and Technology.","Before I conclude, I would also like to note that, starting with the Q1 2018 earnings call, Biogen intends to cease publishing press releases related to future earnings calls, earnings releases, and investor events via newswire services. We will post these materials on the Investors section of Biogen's website, www.biogen.com, and issue a statement on Twitter when they become available. Our Twitter handle is @biogen.","Now, I will turn the call over to Michel.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.","For the third quarter of 2017, Biogen generated revenues of $3.1 billion. On an apples-to-apples basis, excluding hemophilia, revenues grew 13% from the same period a year ago. Revenues grew 4% when we include hemophilia revenues in the prior period.","We enjoyed record earnings this quarter, with GAAP net income of $1.2 billion and non-GAAP net income of $1.3 billion. Our GAAP EPS was $5.79 and non-GAAP EPS was $6.31, both at a record level.","In July, we communicated our strategy to become the leader in neuroscience by developing transformational therapies to address what we believe are becoming the world's most significant unmet medical needs. In pursuit of becoming this leader, we are focusing our R&D efforts mostly on four core growth areas.","We also highlighted five priorities. The execution of those is important to successfully implement our strategy. This strategy requires us first to fortify our core business while also ensuring that we create new sources of value. Today, we are sharing exciting developments with each priority in turn.","Overall, we are making encouraging progress on our core, meaning maximizing the resilience of our MS business, accelerating performance in SMA [Spinal Muscular Atrophy], and creating a leaner and simpler operating model. All are important for generating significant cash flow. We are putting this cash flow to work in the form of the final two priorities, reprioritizing capital allocation efforts and developing and expanding our neuroscience portfolio.","We believe we have the ability to be the leader in neuroscience, and we are committed to building out our pipeline through both our internal R&D efforts and prudent but high-impact business development and strategy collaborations. We believe this strategy will maximize long-term shareholder returns.","With that context, I am very pleased to discuss our Q3 performance. First, in the third quarter, our MS core business held up to our expectations. We continued the strong launch momentum on SPINRAZA, as we have meaningfully grown the number of patients treated in the U.S. and globally. We made progress advancing our neuroscience pipeline. We improved our collaboration arrangements with Eisai and Neurimmune, and we made progress streamlining our operations as we evolve towards a leaner and simpler operating model. We are eager to build on this momentum as we close 2017 and progress into 2018 and beyond.","Let me start with our first strategic priority, maximizing the resilience of our MS core business. Our MS business is expected to be the driver of near and midterm performance for Biogen and a significant source of cash generation. MS revenues, including $65 million of OCREVUS royalties, were $2.3 billion, close to the all-time high we had in Q2. We continued to add patients globally, with a 3% increase versus the prior year and a relatively stable patient count versus Q2. This core franchise helped drive $1.1 billion in free cash flow this quarter, which is key to fueling our investment for future growth.","We have also improved our overall position on U.S. formularies for 2018. We are very pleased with this progress. We have seen a trend of five major national plans that have recently embraced an open access strategy. And just last month, Aetna placed TECFIDERA, AVONEX, and PLEGRIDY on their preferred list. I give a lot of credit to our team in the U.S. They have really executed on building trust and demonstrating the value of our portfolio to payers.","Now the performance of our core MS products, TECFIDERA maintained its global market share and remains the leading MS therapy \u2013 overall MS therapy. Global revenues were a strong $1.1 billion this quarter, a 3% increase versus the prior year, as we saw 9% increase in total TECFIDERA patients over the same period.","U.S. TECFIDERA revenues declined 4% to $836 million in the third quarter compared to a record high in Q2, primarily due to a slight decline in patient demand. As a reminder, in Q3 2016, TECFIDERA benefited by approximately $40 million to $50 million due to an inventory build, which impacts the year-over-year comparison. In Q3, inventory levels for TECFIDERA were flat relative to Q2.","In Europe, TECFIDERA patients grew approximately 16% year over year and 4% quarter over quarter, while in Japan, TECFIDERA has rapidly grown to over 10% market share.","TYSABRI remains the leading high-efficacy MS therapy, with global revenues of $469 million. U.S. TYSABRI revenues were $267 million, an 8% decline from the prior quarter and an 11% decline year over year. We have seen an uptick in discontinuation, particularly amongst JCV-positive patients, as OCREVUS continues its launch in the U.S.","Outside of the U.S., TYSABRI revenues were $203 million. In Europe, TYSABRI patients grew by 2% versus last quarter, as it benefited from updated label, providing improved clarity on the re-stratification and patient management.","While our MS business has shown some signs of resilience, we are not stopping here. We are continuing to evolve our operating model in MS, including the recent rollout of a new regional structure in the U.S., which we believe will increase accountability and bring us closer to the customer.","Next, I would like to talk about our second strategic priority, accelerating SMA. We see SPINRAZA as a key current and future growth driver for Biogen. We are very pleased with the growth being delivered by the global launch of SPINRAZA, as we generated $271 million in revenues in the third quarter, including $198 million in the U.S. We saw a 75% increase in the number of patients on therapy in the U.S. as compared to the end of Q2. As a reminder, Q2 revenues in the U.S. included approximately $30 million of inventory build, while inventory levels remained flat in Q3.","Approximately 10% of U.S. SPINRAZA revenues in the third quarter were attributed to maintenance dose, as a large number of patients who completed the four-dose loading regimen in prior quarters did not receive a dose in Q3 due to the once every four months maintenance dosing. Additionally, over 65% of patients currently on therapy are Type 2s and Type 3s, and a growing 20% are over the age of 15 years old, suggesting that the most serious patients are treated first, and also significant opportunity remains in the other patient population.","Infrastructure in the U.S. continued to improve. As of the end of the third quarter, over 180 sites have administered SPINRAZA, an increase from 145 sites last quarter. And we now have over 250 sites that have submitted start forms. Importantly, we have received hundreds of start forms from patients that are not yet on therapy, a great indicator for demand. We are diligently trying to help these patients start on SPINRAZA while also working to reach the thousands of older SMA patients who are either not aware of SPINRAZA or have not yet indicated an intent to start treatment. To help reach this broader population, we are expanding the size of our U.S. SMA team.","Outside the U.S., SPINRAZA revenues were $73 million in Q3. Revenues and volume from ex-U.S. launch this quarter surpassed what we saw in Q1 of the U.S. launch. We have now launched in 11 European countries as well as in Japan, and we recorded revenues from named patient sales from multiple countries across the Middle East and Latin America.","So far, we have submitted 20 pricing and reimbursement dossiers in Europe. This quarter, SPINRAZA was approved in Brazil and Switzerland, and we filed in Argentina. Over time, we aim to make this therapy widely available across the globe.","For our strategic priority to create a leaner and simpler operating model, we intend to streamline our operations and relocate resources, with a goal of redirecting up to $400 million by the end of 2020 to be reinvested in prioritized research and development and commercial value-creation opportunities. To achieve this, we expect to make total expenditures of up to $170 million, primarily in 2018, through a restructuring program across a number of strategic operational and organizational initiatives.","Moving to our biosimilar business, revenues grew 12% to $101 million, and the European Commission granted the marketing authorization for our adalimumab biosimilar, IMRALDI. Biogen is now the first company with approved biosimilars in Europe for the three most prescribed anti-TNF biologic treatments.","So it was an exciting quarter, with healthy progress in our core business. We saw resilience in our MS franchise. We accelerated our achievements in SMA with several strong country launches, and we continued to grow our biosimilar business. We believe this foundation gives us an even greater ability to create more value for patients and shareholders in the future. We are incredibly excited about the work that is underway to both develop and expand our existing portfolio as well as to invest in building our pipeline.","And now I would like to transition to our plan to create new sources of value. The team has been working tirelessly to ensure that we have the right capabilities and pipeline to win in this area, including: optimizing partnerships to better position us for new growth; advancing R&D candidates; actively looking for pipeline assets; enhancing our BD capabilities; and further building our senior management team.","Before I turn it over to Mike, a few highlights; first, we renegotiated our agreement with our partner, Eisai. Biogen will now receive 55% of profits in the U.S., 68.5% of the profits in Europe, and 20% of the profits in Japan. This leverages Biogen's strong presence in the U.S. and Europe and Eisai's distinct advantage in Asian markets. Eisai also exercised its option to jointly develop and commercialize adalimumab. We are pleased by this demonstration of Eisai's confidence for our lead Phase 3 Alzheimer's assets. We also agreed to decrease our royalty obligations to Neurimmune. We believe both of these new agreements will improve the long-term economics of adalimumab.","Second, we announced new data for the long-term extension of our ongoing Phase 1b study on aducanumab. We are encouraged by these results, as they are consistent with our previous reported data and support to the design of our ongoing Phase 3 studies. We will present detailed data from this analysis at the CTAD [Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease] conference next week, and Mike will provide more details shortly.","Third, we advanced multiple assets in our pipeline. We completed enrollment for natalizumab in stroke and BIIB054 in Parkinson's disease. We initiated trials for natalizumab in epilepsy for our tau ASO in Alzheimer's disease in collaboration with Ionis and for opicinumab in MS. And we had a positive readout of STX-100 in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.","Finally, we continued to build our new senior management team, which we believe is critical to maintaining this momentum. We could not become the leader in neuroscience without our world-class talents.","Camille Lee has joined Biogen as Senior Vice President, Alzheimer's Therapeutic Area. Dr. Sanjay Jariwala has joined as Senior Vice President, Worldwide Medical. Anabella Villalobos has joined as Senior Vice President of Biotherapeutic Medicinal Science. In addition, we are progressing well in our search for a new CFO and hope to make an announcement in the near future.","I will now turn the call over to Mike for an update on our recent progress in R&D.","Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.","Thank you, Michel, and good morning, everyone.","Last quarter, we provided additional clarity on Biogen's R&D strategy, which highlighted our vision to be the leader in neuroscience. We continue to believe that no other area of medicine represents as much patient need, global economic burden, and scientific opportunity as neuroscience. We are enacting an R&D investment strategy aimed at definitive leadership in neuroscience. I would now like to spend some time highlighting the significant progress we have made this quarter within our core and emerging growth areas.","Starting with MS and neuroimmunology, we are committed to investing in R&D for MS to address key unmet needs. This week, Biogen is releasing new data through more than 80 oral and poster presentations at the seventh joint ECTRIMS and ACTRIMS meeting, including comparative effectiveness data for TECFIDERA and TYSABRI, as well as an update on several real-world initiatives we are advancing to improve the diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression.","One of the key highlights for Biogen at the meeting will be the presentation of a post-hoc analysis of data obtained in the Phase 2 SYNERGY trial, which we believe identifies a patient subset exhibiting sustained clinical improvement upon treatment with opicinumab, a first-in-class human monoclonal antibody directed against LINGO-1. At the 10-milligram per kilogram dose, we found that opicinumab was associated with a greater and more durable treatment response in patients who had been diagnosed with MS within the last 20 years and in those whose brain MRI suggested lesions with lower myelin content as measured by magnetization transfer ratio, blood preserve, relative tissue integrity as measured by diffusion tensor imaging radial diffusivity. These characteristics provide a biologically and clinically plausible hypothesis that we will test in our Phase 2b AFFINITY trial.","Specifically, AFFINITY, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 2b study that aims to enroll 240 patients with relapsing MS, was initiated earlier this year. The trial was designed to evaluate the potential for opicinumab to improve pre-existing disability in relapsing MS patients through remyelination. A fixed dose of opicinumab that closely replicates the 10-milligram per kilogram dose from SYNERGY will be studied as an add-on therapy in patients who are adequately controlled on their anti-inflammatory disease-modifying therapy versus the DMT alone and who exhibit characteristics consistent with the potential SYNERGY responder population. The primary endpoint of the study, overall response score, is an integrated measure of both the improvement and worsening of disability over time.","During the quarter, Lancet published new data investigating the correlation between PML risk for natalizumab and JC virus antibody index values through large observational studies. The estimates suggest that PML risk remains low at JC virus antibody index less than or equal to 0.9 and increases at index levels greater than 1.5.","Specifically, over six years of natalizumab treatment, the cumulative risk of PML was lowest in patients with index less than 0.9 at 0.2%, which increased to 2.8% for patients with an index value of greater than 1.5. Our hope is that these data can provide physicians and patients additional information when making individualized benefit\/risk assessments with TYSABRI. These data are currently largely reflected in the EU label, and we are currently discussing these data with the FDA.","We also had exciting new developments within Alzheimer's disease and dementia, which we believe we have one of the most robust AD portfolios in the industry. We recently conducted an additional interim analysis of the long-term extension of the ongoing Phase 1b study of aducanumab called PRIME, as Michel referred to. The updated analyses include data from the placebo-controlled period and long-term extension for patients treated with aducanumab up to 24 months in the titration cohort and up to 36 months in the fixed-dose cohorts.","In patients treated up to 24 months in the titration cohort, amyloid plaque reduction was consistent with the dose and time-dependent results observed in the fixed-dose cohorts. In patients treated up to 36 months, amyloid plaque continued to decrease in a dose and time-dependent manner, with amyloid plaque levels in the 10-milligram per kilogram fixed-dose cohort reaching and remaining at a level considered below the quantitative cut point that discriminates between a positive and negative scan.","At both 24 and 36 months, analyses of CDR sum-of-boxes and the MMSE [Mini Mental State Examination] suggest a continued benefit of the treatment of aducanumab on the rate of clinical decline during the treatment.","In the Phase 1b long-term extension, the most commonly reported adverse events were headache, fall, and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, or ARIA. We look forward to presenting these data in detail next week at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease Conference in Boston.","Our collaboration partner, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, recently initiated a Phase 1\/2a study with BIIB080 or IONIS-MAPTRx in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease, and dosed the first patient earlier this month. BIIB080 is an intrathecally administered anti-sense therapy designed to selectively reduce the production of the microtubule associated protein tau in the brain. Pathological accumulation of tau protein is a hallmark feature of Alzheimer's disease that correlates strongly with clinical status. Reducing levels of tau via an antisense oligonucleotide, or ASO, represents a unique and independent approach to tau lowering relatively to lowering monoclonal antibodies.","Within neuromuscular disorders, we presented significant data for SPINRAZA at the 22nd International Congress of the World Muscle Society in Saint-Malo, France. Key data highlights include a new analysis from the Phase 3 ENDEAR study as measured by the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination. Significant differences in motor milestone responders were observed in patients with disease duration at baseline less than or equal to 12 weeks, as 75% of infants treated with SPINRAZA responded compared to none of the untreated patients.","For those with disease duration greater than 12 weeks at baseline, 32% of the treated patients responded while none of the untreated infants responded in this cohort. There was also a statistically significant benefit in event-free survival in infants treated with SPINRAZA with disease duration less than or equal to 12 weeks.","Data from EMBRACE, a Phase 2 multi-center randomized double-blind sham-procedure-controlled 14-month study of SPINRAZA in infants and children not eligible to participate in ENDEAR, was also presented. The EMBRACE interim analysis showed a larger proportion of infants and children treated with SPINRAZA for Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination motor milestone responders compared to those who were untreated. In the ENDEAR and EMBRACE studies, SPINRAZA demonstrated a favorable benefit\/risk profile. And overall, the data presented contribute to a growing body of evidence that demonstrates SPINRAZA can make a meaningful difference in the lives of patients with SMA regardless of their age or stage of the disease.","Beyond SPINRAZA, we continue to be excited about the potential of our gene therapy program in SMA, and we expect to advance into the clinic in mid-2018.","Moving on to our progress in movement disorders, BIIB054, our anti alpha-synuclein antibody targeting the core pathology of Parkinson's disease with the goal of slowing disease progression, has completed enrollment in the Phase 1 trial, and we anticipate sharing data from the Parkinson's cohort of this study next year. We are also planning to initiate a Phase 2 study of this asset by the end of the year.","Moving on to other updates, we are committed to enhancing and advancing our pipeline in not just our core growth areas but also our emerging growth areas. Specifically, we see significant potential in acute neurology, pain, neuropsychiatry, and ophthalmology.","Within acute neurology, we are currently conducting a Phase 2b trial with natalizumab in acute ischemic stroke, with the aim of improving functional outcomes by limiting brain inflammation in the post-stroke period. The study is fully enrolled, and we expect data early next year. Natalizumab is targeting acute ischemic stroke patients with mild-to-moderate severity, with a therapeutic time window of up to 24 hours after stroke onset. This program complements BIIB093, our first-in-class IV glibenclamide therapeutic targeting brain edema in severe large hemispheric infarcts, with a planned Phase 3 start next year.","During the quarter, we also initiated OPUS, a Phase 2 study for natalizumab, which we believe has the potential to be a first-in-class antiinflammatory therapy for patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. With over 750,000 target patients in the U.S. and EU5 alone, we see significant opportunity.","Specifically, the study will be a 70-patient six-month randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of natalizumab as adjunctive therapy. Patients are expected to continue into a six-month open-label phase after completion of the double-blind phase. The primary efficacy objective of the study is to determine if adjunctive therapy of natalizumab reduces the frequency of seizures in adult participants.","Mechanistically, with multiple lines of preclinical and clinical research providing rationale for a potential benefit, we believe blocking alpha-4 integrin with natalizumab may help to reduce leukocyte vascular interactions and stabilize blood brain barrier integrity, which may ultimately help to reduce the frequency and severity of seizures.","Moving on to our emerging growth area of neuropathic pain, our Phase 2b study of BIIB074 in painful lumbosacral radiculopathy is currently enrolling, with data expected next year. Also next year, we anticipate initiating a Phase 3 program for trigeminal neuralgia as well as a Phase 2 study in small fiber neuropathy.","Outside of our core and emerging growth areas, we recently achieved proof of biology for BG00011 or STX-100 in a Phase 2a trial in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF. For assets like BG00011 that are not within our neuroscience focus, we intend to continue development as long as the science remains compelling and we see potential to add value.","The results from the 41-patient Phase 2a trial demonstrated substantial down-regulation of the TGF beta pathway in IPF patients treated with BG00011, as measured by up to 70% inhibition from baseline of phosphorylated SMAD and alveolar macrophages isolated by bronchial alveolar lavage from IPF subjects. Phosphorylated SMAD mediates the transcriptional activity of TGF beta, signaling that increased levels have been correlated with fibrosis in multiple preclinical models.","In addition, BG00011 was shown to impact multiple prespecified genes associated with TGF-beta signaling. Through this study, we have identified a dose with an appropriate safety profile and anticipated level of efficacy to support advancement into a Phase 2b study next year.","As a reminder, our key strategic priorities within R&D are to build out our translational machine in neuroscience, invest in assets and capabilities in our prioritized core and emerging growth areas, and to augment our pipeline.","We have made strong progress this year in increasing the probability of success for transitioning from the lab all the way to the market. In 2017, we have transitioned five programs from research to development within our core and emerging growth areas, putting us on track to nearly double historical productivity and highlighting our focus on bringing novel drug candidates into the clinic. We aim for a similar or greater level of R&D productivity next year. And a key component of our R&D strategy is to leverage antisense oligonucleotides, which offer a promising platform to get to and through the clinic faster than other modalities.","To that end, we recently opened an ASO manufacturing facility in North Carolina to support our growing ASO pipeline. We have also been building our R&D leadership team, which Michel discussed, to help maximize future R&D productivity.","While we continue to make important progress advancing our portfolio, we recognize that accelerating our long-term growth will require further enhancement. Internal productivity is already showing promise. But in addition, we are highly focused on expanding our neuroscience portfolio through external opportunities and look forward to highlighting the progress we make here in the coming months.","In summary, across our portfolio, we see: continued leadership in MS, including remyelination; a growing body of clinical data within SMA; an industry-leading Alzheimer's disease portfolio; a compelling program in neuropathic pain; a unique clinical portfolio in stroke; defining new mechanisms of biology in IPF; advancing assets in Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and ALS; and a growing number of high-quality drug candidates reaching the clinic.","I will now pass the call back to Michel.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","Thank you, Mike.","Now let me share with you how we are thinking about the rest of 2017. We expect that SPINRAZA continues on a strong trajectory in terms of patient uptake in the U.S. and internationally. However, due to the impact of the dosing scheduling, we anticipate SPINRAZA revenue growth in Q4 will be mostly driven by ex-U.S. markets. We expect OCREVUS will have a modest net negative impact on our MS portfolio, and we expect the typical seasonality for MS in Q4. And for expenses, we expect OpEx in Q4 to increase versus Q3, as we invest behind our strategic priorities.","In conclusion, I believe we have a clear direction. Our actions are aligned to our strategic imperatives, and everything we do is linked to maximizing shareholder value over the long term. Our market-leading MS business remains resilient. We continued an impressive SPINRAZA launch. We advanced assets in our neuroscience portfolio. We increased our biosimilars revenues in Europe. And very importantly, we enhanced our collaboration arrangements with Eisai and Neurimmune. We intend to continue this momentum, especially with a focus on completing more business development to further expand our neuroscience portfolio so that we can achieve our mission to be the leader in neuroscience.","Looking forward, within the next 12 to 18 months, we expect several meaningful readouts across our neuroscience pipeline, including: BAN2401 in Alzheimer's disease; natalizumab in stroke; BIIB067 for ALS; BIIB074 for painful lumbosacral radiculopathy; BIIB054 in Parkinson's; and our gene therapy program for XLRS.","Before we go into Q&A, I would like to thank our employees around the world who are dedicated to making a positive impact on patients' lives and all of the physicians, caregivers, and participants in our clinical development programs. The past and future achievements could not be realized without their passion and commitment.","With that, we will open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. I'll leave out SPINRAZA patient count stuff for the rest of the call but, Michel, I actually wanted to focus on aducanumab for a minute, and two parts to that. First, I just wanted to think through what the $150 million payment to Neurimmune on the royalty reduction implies for the valuation of aducanumab. And the reason why I ask is because the implied valuation for aducanumab based on this $150 million payment is very different than what the market implies. So I was just curious and just wanted to understand the context of this negotiation a bit better.","And then also on aducanumab, I was just curious. How much of your R&D spend is going towards aducanumab right now? And I ask because of the amount of payments Eisai is going to have to make starting 2019, whether that's appropriately reflected in Street expectations for your R&D spend in 2019 onwards or not. Thank you.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","So thank you for the good questions. We are very pleased with these new agreements. We believe in the potential opportunity with aducanumab, and therefore, we act in alignment with this belief. And this took a lot of work, and it's probably the most important alliance will be the agreement we reached in 2017 so far, so I think this is very important.","For the $150 million, we are working on our long-term \u2013 long-range operating plan, and we remain, with the right assumptions, very bullish on the opportunity that we have with this product. With Neurimmune, we have a long-term collaboration and there are many things in play, in the past, in the present, and in the future. And I will say it's logical that working together we achieved this agreement between the two companies. So I would not go much further in terms of the speculation of the potential link, but I think that it's very positive for the overall future profitability of aducanumab if we're able to succeed. So we are pleased with this outcome.","Concerning the clinical spend, the only thing I can tell you is that as for the time Eisai starts to contribute meaningfully to the clinical spend in 2019, a large portion of the overall spend will need to occur in 2019 and beyond. Does somebody want to add something, okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I want to get some context for SPINRAZA just for the U.S. Obviously, it's flattish in Q3 and you're also saying that, Michel, for Q4, are you guys seeing discontinuations or difficulties in getting reimbursement, or is this just wave two in the U.S. is more difficult than putting on wave one, which would be the worst patients, the most severe patients? Thank you.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","Thanks for the question. We are very pleased with the momentum in the U.S. And having 75% patient growth is not a simple achievement, so I compliment the team. As expected and also as difficult to model as it can be, based on the dosing regimen, the impact of the patients we got in Q1 and on the early access program was fully reflected in the Q3 because of the dosing regimen. Over time this will normalize, and that's why we are prudent the way we have been prudent since the beginning of the year, if you'll recall well, so we expect that the dynamic will normalize as the maintenance dose becomes the majority of the revenue, so this is basically the momentum we see.","We enlarged the reach. We see a larger proportion of the patients above the age of 15. Meeting with scientific leaders, they are getting more experience on complicated spine in order to dose the patients, and they are investigating potential routes of administration and procedure for patients more complicated, other one with the fusion, and those ones are the more complicated.","And it is anticipated, just to come back because I know that everybody has that in their mind, so yes, we said 60% of the patients have a complicated spine or mostly the patients with the Type 2 and Type 3, mostly the Type 2. But out of this proportion, it's actually between 10% and 20% of those patients who have fusion that are more complex. The others are easier. And apparently, according to scientific leaders, the proportion of fusion ex-U.S. is much lower, just to give some context. So we remain optimistic on the potential of SPINRAZA in the U.S. and ex-U.S., and our peak sales objective did not change.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question. I guess I'm just having the same problem with squaring the circle here on SPINRAZA. It sounds like you did very well with new patient adds, a 75% increase in number of patients on therapy from end of Q2 to end of Q3, and a variety \u2013 a large majority of those patients had to receive multiple doses. So I guess maybe not to ask the same question a different way, Michel, but how is it that you can't get growth with that many new patients being added here? There must be some change to gross-to-net or free drug or something of that sort.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","The free drug, unless I make a mistake, was 20%. This is correct, so there was a slight increase but not a major impact. Again, it's the 75% patient growth that was dosed, 75% of patient growth that were dosed with the initial dosing regimen and very little of patients with the maintenance dose. This is the dynamic that we see.","It is clear that for the later onset of disease and more complicated patients, it takes a bit more time to get those. That's why we have hundreds of start forms that are not yet for patients who are not yet dosed. So this is another dynamic that is not new. But again, as I said, the infrastructure and the system is adjusting.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Co. LLC","Do you expect growth in Q1?","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","I will not comment yet on Q1, and the last element that we saw was an inventory play between Q2 and Q3. Thanks, Eric.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe, Michel, you talked about the formulary access for MS products. Can you talk on a high level what your expectation is for 2018 net pricing for TECFIDERA and also the other products?","And then maybe another question is with Eisai just opting in for aducanumab, and we know that the BAN2401 program is coming to an end, did Eisai have any clarity on the analysis of the results from the 12-month follow-up before they opted in? Thank you.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","So I will get started on the market access for 2018, and that is now almost under contract. And as communicated, we are very pleased with the progress for the U.S. And the gross-to-net impact is similar to prior years and the typical contracting arrangements for which our leadership position is helping, as you can imagine. So we didn't see a dramatic erosion in order to maintain or enhance. We saw a very limited one actually. So we are pleased with the momentum, including open formularies and including the win with some major payers like Aetna. So this is an important achievement.","Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr., M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.","Ying, this is Al Sandrock. In terms of what Eisai saw, they saw all of the same things we've seen so far, which include data from the Phase 1b trial that Mike talked about that we'll be presenting next week, which is the 36-month follow-up in the fixed-dose cohorts and the 24-month follow-up in the titration cohorts.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, guys, and thank you for taking my question. I'll keep it to one. Are you surprised by the relative strength of SPINRAZA overseas? I guess is there anything noticeably different relative to the U.S. launch that you've seen over there in these early days? Thanks.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","Thanks for the question. We are very pleased. And as communicated previously, we did anticipate that, unlike MS, we see that for SPINRAZA, mostly driven by the prevalence of the disease. We see a higher proportion of opportunities in terms of top line revenue ex-U.S. and U.S. So we are pleased with the early launch countries, Germany, a couple of Nordics countries, Japan since a few weeks. But this was mostly driven by Germany and some named patient sales in the Middle East, in Turkey, and in Latin America. Germany is going very strong.","We got the journal official in Italy, and you'll recall that we had more than 100 \u2013 close to 120 patients on the early access program. And overall, maybe one element that is helping also the momentum in Europe, or ex-U.S., was the very large number of early access program patients that were already identified just waiting to gain reimbursement in order to be shifted to commercial goods.","So obviously now, the question is, are we anticipating the same trends that basically many of you have anticipated as opposed \u2013 not just linear growth on a country basis ex-U.S.? We believe that based on the sequence of access, reimbursement, and unlocking opportunities in different countries that is not at the same time that this trend will not be the same as in the U.S. I think that this will be a smoother trend in the right direction. And again, overall, it's very nice momentum, and we are trending above what we thought were our internal targets.","Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr., M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.","Cory, just to put some numbers on it, we had more than 500 patients in the early access program across 18 countries in Europe. That compares to about 60 patients we had in the U.S., probably due to timing a little between when we saw the data and when the drug was approved, so a lot more interest in the EAP in Europe.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Leerink. Please go ahead.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you very much, a quick clarification for Al, if I could, and then a question, Michel, for you. Al, on the intrathecal ASO for Alzheimer's, could you just talk about the dosing frequency and the access there in terms of being able to deliver the treatment?","And then, Michel, could you talk about your policy on pricing? Of course, pricing has been a significant driver to the MS category overall in prior years, and then the company changed the policy this year, and you've taken single-digit price increases on a one-time basis this year. Is that what we should be modeling going forward? Thanks. And I apologize for the double question.","Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.","Geoff, this is Mike. I'll take a stab at the first one. I think it was about intrathecal access for this. It turns out that we don't anticipate any more significant problems in terms of intrathecal delivery with this program than in the SPINRAZA program at all. And the initial studies are really that they're safety dose-ranging findings in Alzheimer's subjects. So we're trying to get an idea of exactly the right dose range. And then from a technical standpoint, we don't see or anticipate any more significant challenge than what we've seen with SPINRAZA.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","So concerning the second question, let me start by saying that we are very pleased with the resilience of our MS portfolio. That is so important in terms of cash flow generation, and we intend actually to continue this momentum. We organized a meeting in a few days with all the Biogen leaders, where we are going to recommit so that we can defend as much as we can.","The market share where we speak is holding at 38%. It was 38.3% before. I don't know when exactly. And as expected, an OCREVUS launch will erode the share. And if I look at the performance over the last two quarters, including OCREVUS, that was still a minimum contribution, it is the last best two quarters ever for Biogen, so it's not a cliff. And we'll continue to drive the activity to generate demand and volume, and we will not comment on the price policy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with UBS. Please go ahead.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, guys, congrats on your results and all the updates. Just to come back to aducanumab, on the updates with Eisai and Neurimmune, how should we think about these? Were these proactive moves on your end or more opportunistic moves after overtures from those companies?","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","So I will not intend to the details of the first move. These are contracts that were signed a few years back. We see data coming in the Phase 1\/1b, and we are relatively pleased with this data. We'll hear more at CTAD, and I thought it would be an opportunity to see how we could improve the operation or give the best chance for the operation and the core promotion the day we have potentially the product, and therefore playing out who's the best where.","And obviously, I have the agenda to increase the opportunity for Biogen, and I think that with the two deals, this is what we are achieving. But it's a win-win, and the partner at Eisai gets also the opportunity to co-promote the MS portfolio, which is important. So we are very pleased with these two upgraded, I would say, arenas.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I'd like to just go back to SPINRAZA one more time. I'm sorry for starting to beat this too much. Can you just help us because the numbers don't square? And I'm just trying to figure out what piece we may be missing. So if you back out the inventory from the second quarter, you had 32% sequential revenue growth, but you had 75% growth in new patients. And I thought at the beginning, you said that 10% of patients had a maintenance dose. So it seems like you almost doubled \u2013 I mean a little less, but you had substantial \u2013 hundreds of new patients add on and some patients taking maintenance dose. So it seems like the price per patient has come down by 40%. So is that right, or what else are we missing in those numbers?","Matthew Calistri - Biogen, Inc.","Hey, Matthew, this is Matt. Let me try to help clarify. So first, when we say 75% patient growth, what we're looking at is at the end of second quarter to the end of third quarter. If you look at the number of patients on therapy at the end of the second quarter versus at the end of the third quarter, we had 75% more patients. Now how many of those patients at the end of the third quarter received one, two, or three doses is unclear. We haven't revealed that. So that's probably part of the reason it's a little more difficult for you to square that math.","And the other thing we talked about was 10% of the revenues came from patients who had been on a loading dose in prior quarters, so there's a lot of dynamics here. And the nature of loading doses versus maintenance doses I know makes it a little bit complicated, but that's how the math plays out. So I don't think it's a function of gross-to-net impacting. As you saw, we believe it's 20% of patients are on free. It's more a function of just the timing of doses. And as we said, we expect this is something that normalizes over time.","I think the other thing you're all trying to solve for is the commentary we said about Q4. We said the majority of growth is expected to come outside of the U.S. I don't think the message is that there's no growth in the U.S. I think the message is that there would be growth in the U.S., but the majority of growth would come from outside of the U.S. So I don't think we're trying to send a message that you're not seeing growth in SPINRAZA in the U.S. We're just comparing it to the dynamics in the rest of the world. Does that help?","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, I think it does. And I think you've commented on ex-U.S. trajectory. But should we consider \u2013 I guess maybe you could just give us some guideposts on what's going to grow ex-U.S. trajectory. Is it new country launches or additional patients in existing countries?","Matthew Calistri - Biogen, Inc.","You can assume new country launches would make \u2013 we believe new country launches will be one of the drivers there that could be. As you just look at the comments we've made, Germany and Turkey made up a majority of the rest of the world sales. But as you look at the countries that have already approved and some of the traction we're making, you're going to see more diversity across other countries. That's our belief.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","But Germany still has a long way to go, so you can actually expect both. But in the first phase, obviously the new product launches in new countries like Italy, while we speak, will add momentum, should add momentum.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning thanks for taking the question, maybe one for Michel or Mike. You both referred to business development looking externally. Neuro focus, maybe just give us your latest thoughts on early stage, later stage, how you're thinking about business development and maybe the cadence of the deal or deals. Thanks.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","So I will get started, and Mike can add more color. So first, we have strong cash flow generation, and we expect that this cash flow will grow mostly after 2019, when we have less royalties to pay on TEC [TECFIDERA]. So we will make sure that the allocation of this capital will secure the maximization of the shareholder return. And we have communicated that, unlike in the past where we did the majority to the dollar back to shareholders in terms of share repurchase, we will also do the share and prioritize, as for now, the capital allocation efforts towards building the neuroscience pipeline. And in addition, we may continue to repurchase shares on an opportunistic manner based on the price of the share and other elements.","So we are looking at different opportunities. Eisai and Neurimmune took a lot of time. And there are opportunities, and the sweet spot of Biogen remains at the early stage. And we'll be very careful if we go beyond the early stage of the valuation of those assets or companies. Mike?","Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.","Yes, I'd add just a little bit to that. We're quite committed to a couple of things within the R&D portfolio. Number one was increasing productivity of our existing pipeline, and number two was to be able to add important new assets to the pipeline. So we're quite committed to portfolio growth.","Michel mentioned \u2013 our sweet spot, we believe, is in early-phase clinical assets because of our ability to really derisk those and advance those through proof-of-concept well. But of course, we look within that sweet spot and beyond. We've got a number of active discussions ongoing. We're augmenting our external innovation capabilities. We've been bringing online more search and evaluation, and we're really retuning a lot of the entire R&D organization and beyond to be more externally oriented. So I think that you will see over time both an increase in the productivity of the existing portfolio and a number of assets coming into the portfolio.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Aharon Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning and thanks for fitting me in, a question about the gene therapy platform. Good to hear that you think you'll be starting now your trials in mid-2018. I guess my question is on the manufacturing here. Is there an opportunity here to leapfrog in terms of your both capacity and cost? Folks would be talking about how difficult it is to get enough material to be able to treat an entire patient population as opposed to just the Type 1 SMA. Cost per therapy suggests in the hundreds of thousands of dollars per patient. Have you been able to move away from triple (57:20) transactions to something more stable? Will you be able to address the cost structure? If you could, just give us some landmarks around that.","Paul McKenzie - Biogen, Inc.","Sure, Ronny, this is Paul McKenzie. Thanks for the question and thanks for your great recent gene therapy seminar that you gave. A lot of people really benefited from that in the industry.","You bring up a great question around our ability and beliefs around our development and manufacturing capability. As I shared with you before that we have doubled down on our development capability. We believe that will allow us to drive to a gene therapy platform that's industry-leading. We also have invested in manufacturing partnerships and platforms that allow us to do these activities, both development and manufacturing excellence, in parallel. We're very excited around our progress around our clinical supplies for the second half of 2018 dosing. And we continue to make great strides on our PCL development for the future commercial process.","So more to come in the upcoming months, but we believe we're well positioned to continue to drive our agenda in gene therapy across the portfolio as a real platform play.","Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.","Ronny, this is Mike. Just following up on Paul's comments, manufacturing is certainly one area where we believe there's an opportunity for real competitive advantage in a platform approach that could be attractive for SMA and beyond.","Within SMA in particular, there are a number of things that we are quite focused on, which is the right patient subtypes. We certainly have gained a lot of experience with patient subtypes within SMA with our SPINRAZA experience. And I think along with that are going to be important things that we're looking at, which are delivery route timing of dosing administration, potential combinations with SPINRAZA. And of course, front and center in our mind is how all that ties in with clinical safety, and I think that a lot of this still has to play out. So between manufacturing, patient sub-type, delivery route, safety profile, those are key elements of our gene therapy strategy.","Operator","And your final question comes on the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","Hey, thanks for the question. Given the update on the Eisai opt-in, can you just remind us with the BAN2401 data coming, how to interpret that from the standpoint of a high hurdle given aducanumab's advancement in Phase 3 and so far ahead, how you would think about whether there would be two Phase 3 programs or just the fact that there's a high hurdle for this program given that they've now opted in? Thanks.","Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr., M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.","Mike, this is Al. First of all, it's prespecified in the agreement what the hurdles actually would be, and so there's that.","The way I look at that data is first I want to see. Is there plaque reduction with BAN2401? If there isn't, then I don't know how to interpret the rest of the data. If there is plaque reduction, then the next thing we want to see, is there at least a trend or a favorable effect on the composite measure, which includes things like CDR sum-of-boxes, which would allow us to compare the effect of aducanumab with BAN2401. And then finally, of course, we need to look at the safety, what are the rates of the key adverse events, such as ARIA. And then with that, we'll make a decision. But as I said, the contract prespecifies what the efficacy hurdles are.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","So thank you all and have a great day, bye for now.","Operator","Thank you to everyone for attending today.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please limit yourself to one question to allow other participants time for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Matt Calistri, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin, sir.","Matt Calistri","Thank you and welcome to Biogen's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the earnings release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflects how we manage the business internally. We\u2019ve also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call.","I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the Risk Factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail.","On today's call, I am joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Michel Vounatsos; Dr. Michael Ehlers, EVP of Research and Development; and our CFO, Jeff Capello. We will also be joined for the Q&A portion of the call by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Al Sandrock.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Michel.","Michel Vounatsos","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First let me start with some financial highlights. Biogen started 2019 with first quarter revenues of $3.5 billion, an increase of approximately 11% compared to the same period a year ago.","First quarter 2019 GAAP earnings were $7.15 per share, an increase of 29% versus the same period a year ago. First quarter 2019 non-GAAP earnings were $6.98 per share, a 15% increase versus the same period a year ago.","These results were driven by solid execution of our strategy to maximize the resilience in MS, progress in our dual launch of SPINRAZA, expand our anti-TNF biosimilar success in Europe, create a leaner and simpler operating model and prioritize our capital allocation efforts with the goal of maximizing shareholder returns.","Let me expand on capital allocation. We remain focused on investing in areas with the highest potential benefit for patients and return for our shareholders. In addition to investing in our organic pipeline collaborations and acquired programs, we have made strategic investments in our operations, our biosimilars joint venture, our next-generation manufacturing facility that we are building in Solothurn, Switzerland.","We have also taken measures to unlock capital that can be redeployed for higher return such as our agreement to sell our Hiller\u00f8d, Denmark manufacturing operations to FUJIFILM for up to $890 million. In addition, we have allocated capital with the proposed acquisition of Nightstar Therapeutics.","Following the discontinuation of aducanumab, we viewed repurchasing our own share as an area with high potential return and announce a $5 billion share repurchase program.","So far in 2019 Biogen has repurchased approximately 4.5 million shares for approximately $1.1 billion and our previously announced 2018 share repurchase program. We have $1 billion remaining under that program, plus $5 billion from our new repurchase program announced in March.","We are committed to maximizing the value of our investments and to allocating capital and resources towards the areas we believe to be of the highest potential return something that demands a thoughtful approach over both the short and the long-term.","Capital allocation includes the investment we have made in our pipeline. Over the past two years we have added 13 clinical programs and most recently announced our plan to acquire Nightstar Therapeutics. When we articulated our strategy almost two years ago, we identified four core and four emerging growth areas, as we widen our lens to diversify.","We have made meaningful progress towards this diversification and have entered into new therapeutic areas, while building depth in our core growth area of neuromuscular diseases and movement disorders and potentially accelerating our entry into ophthalmology.","In addition, we continue to advance other assets and pursue therapeutic adjacencies with scientific promise. Today we have 23 programs in clinical development, including BIIB098, which has been filed with the FDA. And we expect 10 mid to late-stage clinical readouts by the end of 2020. In addition two [ph] more mid to late stage clinical assets assuming completion of the Nightstar acquisition.","Let me now address three critically important topics. First, the discontinuation of aducanumab and its short-term implications TECFIDERA IP challenges and the outlook for SPINRAZA.","First I will address the discontinuation of aducanumab. We are in the business of discovering and developing breakthrough treatments to meet unmet medical needs. The unfortunate reality is that the pursuit of this objective is not always successful.","The results for aducanumab are a terrible disappointment for the patients and families desperately hoping for a scientific breakthrough. Our scientists, researchers, medical professionals and as humans we share this disappointment. We followed the science and the outcome was not as we hoped, but we followed the science.","I am incredibly proud of everyone at Biogen involved in this journey. We believe that the learning from the aducanumab trials will better position us to potentially attack this terrible disease successfully in the future.","Importantly, for our remaining programs focused on targeting beta-amyloid BAN2401 and Elenbecestat, we are analyzing the results from the Phase 3 studies of aducanumab and the Phase 2 study of BAN2401. The learnings from these data will inform our view of the development of BAN2401 and. Elenbecestat.","We plan to continue to advance our tau programs in Alzheimer's disease. BIIB092, BIIB076 and 080BIIB080. Beyond the disappointment of aducanumab this outcome takes nothing away from everything else we have accomplished. What we aim to deliver in terms of operational performance over the near term, what we believe we can accomplish in the future with the rest of our pipeline.","Biogen is the world's leading neuroscience focused biopharmaceutical company. We intend and expect to remain the leader in the discovery, development and treatment of neurological diseases, while we will also continue to progress our very interesting compounds in lupus and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or IPF. We will continue working towards our goal of a multi-franchise portfolio, by growing our pipeline and executing on our strategy.","In the short-term, we remain focused on solid quarter-over-quarter execution, financial discipline and our high return capital allocation priorities. And we will continue to pursue opportunities to improve business performance, explore indication expansions, look for ways to accelerate time-to-market for our clinical programs, optimize our clinical resources and manufacturing capacity.","Biogen has key competitive advantages. We have deep scientific and clinical development expertise in neuroscience, global commercial expertise including market access, as evidenced by a leading MS, SMA and European entity NS biosimilars commercial portfolio, world-class biologic manufacturing capabilities; and last but not least, a highly talented and energized team, fully committed to realizing the value of the investment we have made in our organic pipeline, collaborations and acquired R&D with the goal of delivering the highest return to our shareholders. As we have communicated in the past, our strategy is long-term-leadership in neuroscience. That is still our reality today.","Now, I will address TECFIDERA intellectual property. First, we appreciate that there are many questions regarding our U.S. intellectual property for TECFIDERA, which is being challenged in an inter partes review or IPR in the patent Office and a litigation in District Court.","Let me remind you that our 514 patent which covers TECFIDERA and expires in 2028 has been very carefully scrutinized by the U. S. Patent Office multiple times. There was already an IPR before the PTAB where we prevailed, and we were","also successful in an interference proceeding.","We continue to believe we have valid patents. Nonetheless, we are appropriately preparing for all possible outcomes. Importantly, ahead of the outcome of the IPR and District Court and the Litigations, we shall have the opportunity to launch","VUMERITY, a novel oral fumarate disease modifying treatment that has the potential to be another important choice for MS patients.","The FDA has accepted the NDA filing of VUMERITY and we expect a regulatory decision in the fourth quarter of this year. VUMERITY has a composition of matter patent with a base expiration date in 2033. It is a priority that we appropriately maximize the potential of VUMERITY.","Finally, I will address the outlook for SPINRAZA. Many of you are focused on the potential of upcoming competition for SPINRAZA. While we welcome the options for patients, we continue to believe that SPINRAZA will remain the standard of care in SMA for years to come.","There are approximately 7,500 patients on SPINRAZA worldwide, including the EAP and clinical trials with over 7,000 patients having real world experience in the post-marketing setting. We have clinical data following patients for up to six years.","The efficacy and safety profile of SPINRAZA in the post-marketing setting has been viewed very positively by patients and physicians. And we believe the NURTURE study of pre-symptomatic infants demonstrates the remarkable efficacy profile of SPINRAZA. Overall, we expect SPINRAZA to continue to grow, as we aim to reach a global patient population that we believe is larger than what we initially estimated.","The Biogen team is standing up proud, while taking the current situation very seriously. As always, we are committed to working for patients with unmet medical needs and maximizing shareholder value creation by investing in the areas that we believe have the highest potential return.","I will now turn the call over to Mike for a more detailed update on our recent progress in R& D.","Michael Ehlers","Thank you, Michel. And good morning, everyone. Diseases of the nervous system are the leading cause of disability and the second leading cause of death worldwide. The burden and unmet medical need in neurological diseases continues to grow.","We remain committed to developing effective, differentiated medicines for these devastating diseases and we believe that are our focus on and asymmetric capabilities in neuroscience position us to lead in this critical area of medicine.","Before I review recent progress within our pipeline in greater detail, let me first elaborate on Michel's comments and discuss the recent news on aducanumab. Last month we and Eisai announced our decision to discontinue ENGAGE and EMERGE, the Phase 3 studies designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aducanumab in patients with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease and mild Alzheimer's disease dementia.","The decision to stop these trials was based on a futility analysis conducted by an independent data monitoring committee. The pre-specified futility criteria were defined as less than 20% conditional power to meet the primary endpoints of both studies. The recommendation to stop these studies was not based on safety concerns.","Further analysis of these data has demonstrated that treatment with aducanumab resulted in a dose and time-dependent reduction in cerebral amyloid deposition, as assessed by amyloid PET imaging.","We are actively analyzing the complete data set to fully understand the behavior of aducanumab across doses and cohorts in these two trials. As part of the decision to discontinue ENGAGE and EMERGE, the EVOLVE Phase 2 safety study and the long-term extension of the PRIME Phase 1b study of aducanumab have also been discontinued.","We have also decided not to initiate a Phase 3 secondary prevention study to evaluate whether early use of aducanumab can prevent or delay the clinical onset of Alzheimer's disease at this time. We appreciate that these results raise questions about the precise role of aggregated forms of beta amyloid in this patient population.","We continue to analyze the data from ENGAGE and EMERGE to inform our view of ","BAN2401 and Elenbecestat, our programs being developed in collaboration with Eisai. While disappointing for patients, families and the Alzheimer's community, we believe that the data collected from ENGAGE and EMERGE are extensive and that a full analysis will inform future efforts.","Data from these studies will be presented at future medical meetings to advance the field's understanding of the neurobiology of Alzheimer's disease and help guide ongoing research.","As a leader in neuroscience, we remain committed to our goal of developing novel therapies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. We believe the Phase 3 results for aducanumab have limited read through to our portfolio of tau-directed therapeutics.","Accordingly, we are continuing to advance BIIB092 or gosuranemab, an anti-tau antibody in Phase 2. BIIB076, a distinct anti-tau antibody in Phase 1 and BIIB080, an antiantisense oligonucleotide targeting tau currently in Phase 1 being developed in collaboration with Ionis.","Importantly, two years ago together with Michel we articulated our goal of becoming the leader in neuroscience by building and diversifying our portfolio beyond Alzheimer's disease. Since then, we have made meaningful progress toward that goal by adding considerable depth across our core and emerging growth areas.","Specifically, we have added 13 clinical programs since the beginning of 2017, including two that have achieved proof-of-concept and three that have achieved proof-of-biology. These include programs in multiple sclerosis Alzheimer's disease,","progressive supranuclear, palsy, ALS, stroke, epilepsy, cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia and neuropathic pain.","And with our planned acquisition of Nightstar Therapeutics we have the potential to add two mid to late-stage assets for inherited retinal disease. Today and not including Nightstar, we have 23 programs in clinical development, including six programs in Phase 1, 13 programs in Phase 2 and three programs in Phase 3, as well as BIIB098 which has been filed with the FDA.","This represents a substantial expansion and diversification of our clinical portfolio with many important and promising drug candidates each with significant potential to address some of the most debilitating diseases of our time.","Turning to our proposed acquisition of Nightstar Therapeutics. We are extremely excited about the opportunity to join forces with this talented team of drug developers and together address serious genetic causes of blindness for which there have been no treatment options.","This acquisition would accelerate our entry into ophthalmology, with the potential to deliver first-in-class adeno-associated virus based gene therapies to patients suffering from severe retinal diseases.","Retinal degeneration shares many characteristics with the generative diseases of the central nervous system. And we therefore see positive synergy din pursuing treatments for inherited rental diseases that leverage our scientific and clinical capabilities.","Nightstar's lead drug candidate NSR REP1 targets choroideremia, a rare degenerative disease that inevitably leads to blindness for which there are no current therapies. In Phase 1\/2 trials treatment with NSR REP1 via targeted subretinal injection was associated with a higher rate of maintained vision, and in a subset of patients, a meaningful improvement in visual acuity, suggesting that NSR-REP1 has the potential to significantly alter the course of this disease.","Based on compelling proof-of-concept data in the Phase 1\/2 studies, Nightstar initiated the Phase 3 STAR trial. We expect enrollment in this trial to complete in the first half of this year with Phase 3 data expected in the second half of 2020.","Of note, NSR-REP1 has received regenerative medicine advanced therapy for RMAT designation from the FDA, which confers all the benefits of both fast track and breakthrough therapy designation.","Nightstar's second clinical stage asset is NSR RPGR for X-linked retinitis pigmentosa or XLRP. Like NSR REP1, NSR RPGR is an AAV based gene therapy delivered by targeted subretinal injection. Data from ea Phase 1\/2 dose escalation study showed promising signals of early efficacy, including increases in central retinal sensitivity as measured by microperimetry.","A Phase 2\/3 dose expansion study of NSR RPGR is currently enrolling and assuming the transaction closes we would plan to add a Phase 3 study to support registration. In addition, Nightstar is advancing preclinical programs that include gene therapies targeting Stargardt disease, the most common form of inherited juvenile macular dystrophy, Best vitelliform macular dystrophy and additional programs targeting other genetic forms of retinitis pigmentosa.","These diseases which inevitably lead to ability blindness and the associated severe disability are amongst the large group of inherited retinal diseases which have been estimated to afflict up to 200,000 patients in the U.S. alone, many of which may be amenable to similar gene therapy solutions.","Subject to final approvals, we look forward to coming together with the remarkable scientific and clinical team at Nightstar with he goal of bringing breakthrough therapies to patients to slow or halt blindness across a range of inherited retinal diseases.","Turning to our progress in neuromuscular disorders. Last month, we dosed the first patient in the Phase 3 VALOR study of BIIB067 or tofersen, an antisense oligonucleotide for ALS with mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 or SOD1.","BIIB067 selectively targets the mRNA for SOD1 to reduce the levels of toxic mutentmutant SOD1 protein that is thought to be the causative agent in this autosomal dominant genetic form of ALS.","VALOR is a continuation of the Phase 1\/2 single and multiple ascending dose study of BIIB067 for which we have previously communicated proof-of-biology and proof-of-concept. VALOR is enrolling to assess the efficacy and safety of BIIB067 versus placebo. And the primary endpoint of this study is an analysis based on the ALS functional rating scale revised score.","In parallel, we are in active discussions with regulators as we collaborate to further define the scope of the clinical data package required to support the registration of BIIB067.","Very limited treatment options for this devastating genetic form of ALS, we believe the data from the VALOR study have the potential to support a rapid path to patients. Moreover, given that BIIB067 engages RNase H mechanisms to degrade endogenous mRNAs and hence decrease levels of the target, we believe that these data have positive implications for additional antisense oligonucleotides that we are advancing in our pipeline together with Ionis, that similarly utilizes RNase H-dependent mRNA degradation. Including BIIB078 which targets C9orf72 for ALS, BIIB080, which targets tau for Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies and up to two new antisense oligonucleotides that could enter the clinic this year.","Further, we believe these data exemplify the depth we are building in neuromuscular disorders, including ALS and highlight the interconnectivity across our pipeline. We plan to present data from the single and multiple ascending dose portions of the Phase 1\/2 study of BIIB067 in the emerging science session at the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting next month. And you'll hear more specifically about our ALS pipeline at an R&D investor webcast on June 5th.","Moving to SMA. At the 2019 Muscular Dystrophy Association Clinical and Scientific Conference earlier this month, we presented an encore presentation of data from the NURTURE study of SPINRAZA in pre-symptomatic infants with SMA.","highlighting the unprecedented efficacy profile of SPINRAZA, these data show patients on average achieving motor milestones consistent or nearly consistent with normal development.","Specifically, as of May last year of the 25 infants treated with SPINRAZA in this study, 100% were alive, none required tracheostomy or permanent ventilation, 100% were able to sit without support and 88% were able to walk either with assistance or independently.","We believe that SPINRAZA's efficacy profile, including data on patients treated for up to six years combined with real world safety and efficacy experience in over 7,000 patients supports SPINRAZA as the standard of care in SMA. Even after the potential introduction of alternative modalities with significantly less data and outstanding questions regarding long-term safety and efficacy.","Within movement disorders, we are making strong progress advancing our assets for progressive supranuclear palsy or PSP and Parkinson's disease. We look forward to the final readout for the Phase 2 study of BIIB092 and PSP in the second half of this year. BIIB092 is a monoclonal antibody targeting extracellular tau, with the aim of reducing the spread of tau pathology in the brain. And we are making strong progress with recruitment in the Phase 2 study of BIIB054, a monoclonal antibody targeting extracellular synuclein for Parkinson's disease. We now expect to receive data on the primary outcome measure from the one-year placebo-controlled period of this study in the second half of 2020.","As Michel mentioned, we remain steadfast in our commitment to neuroscience, while we continue to explore therapeutic adjacencies where we have existing assets and\/or","expertise.","Importantly, we continue to progress our clinical programs in lupus and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Specifically, we are advancing BIIB059, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds BDCA2, a C-type lectin that inhibits type-1 interferon signaling in plasmacytoid dendritic cells.","We are currently evaluating BIIB059 in a Phase 2 study in cutaneous lupus erythematosus or CLE and systemic lupus erythematosus or SLE with data expected by the end of this year.","Moreover, we expect to work with our collaboration partner UCB to agree on the details of a potential global Phase 3 program for dapirolizumab pegol, an anti-CD40 ligand PEGylated FAB in SLE.","A previous Phase 2b study of dapirolizumab pegol in SLE demonstrated consistent and potentially meaningful improvements for the majority of clinical endpoints in patients treated with dapirolizumab pegol compared with placebo.","Although the primary endpoint of this Phase 2b study to demonstrate a dose response at 24 weeks on the British Isles lupus assessment group based composite lupus assessment was not met at p=0. 07. We believe the totality of the Phase 2b data supported proof-of-concept.","In addition, biomarker data demonstrated strong evidence of proof-of-biology.","Dapirolizumab pegol was well tolerated and demonstrated an acceptable safety profile. We believe that the Phase 2b data together with a post-hoc analysis that indicated a notable response in a refined population support a decision to advance to Phase 3. Together with UCB we intend to present these findings at a future scientific forum.","So what do we expect from Biogen R&D going forward? Four key priorities. Focus on clinical trial execution and optimizing our resources with up to 10 mid to late-stage readouts by the end of 2020, diversification, including potential indication expansions, continued progress advancing our pipeline including ways to accelerate time to market, and balancing the risk of our pipeline including a continued pursuit of late-stage opportunities.","On this last point, let me elaborate on how we think about balancing risk across our pipeline. Biogen is, always has been and will remain a science-driven company, dedicated to converting differentiated biology into breakthrough medicines. That is the promise of innovation spawned from creative ideas and risks at the forefront. It is the incubator of future SPINRAZAs and solutions for patients and families that change medicine.","As we advance our portfolio, we will continue to mitigate risk by seeking later-stage assets, taking advantage of our unique capabilities in developing antisense oligonucleotides and gene therapy to target causal genetic drivers of disease such as SOD1 and C9orf72 in familial ALS.","Leveraging our depth of expertise in MS and SMA to expand our footprint in neuroimmunology and neuromuscular disorders and deploying rigorous experimental medicine methods, including biomarkers of target engagement and disease activity to derisk early-stage clinical programs.","As we diversify and balance risk within our pipeline, we will also thoughtfully consider therapeutic adjacencies that synergize with our core and emerging growth areas and where we have existing assets or expertise.","Backed by a significantly expanded portfolio of clinical stage assets, we remain focused on our goal of developing transformative medicines for patients living with devastating neurological diseases.","I will now pass the call to Jeff.","Jeff Capello","Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. I'll now review our financial performance for the first quarter of 2019 starting with revenues. As Michel mentioned earlier, we had a strong Q1 2019 from a revenue perspective. Total revenues for the first quarter grew 11% year-over-year to approximately $3.5 billion.","Overall, our MS business delivered revenues of $2.1 billion in Q1 2019, including OCREVUS royalties of approximately $112 million. MS revenues in Q1 2019 decreased 2% versus the prior year without OCREVUS royalties and were stable including OCREVUS royalties.","U.S. MS revenues in Q1 2019 were impacted by a decrease in channel inventory of approximately $170 million compared to a decrease of approximately $140 million in Q1 2018 and an increase of approximately $105 million in Q4 2018.","Global first quarter TECFIDERA revenues increased 1% versus the prior year, driven by revenue growth outside the U.S. U.S. TECFIDERA revenues were impacted by a decrease in channel inventory of approximately $110 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to a decrease of approximately $80 million in Q1 2018 and an increase of approximately $60 million in Q4 2018.","We were pleased to see an increased share of both new and total prescriptions for TECFIDERA in the U.S. With our share of new prescriptions exceeding our share of total prescriptions for the first time in almost two years.","Outside the U.S., TECFIDERA performed very well in Q1 2019 with continued double-digit volume increases across most large European markets and Japan versus the prior year, somewhat offset by pricing pressure in several European countries.","Q1 interferon revenues including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY decreased 9% versus Q1 2018 due to the shift from the injectable platforms to oral or high efficacy therapies.","Within the U.S., AVONEX and PLEGRIDY were impacted by a decrease in channel inventory of approximately $45 million compared to a decrease of approximately $60 million in Q1 2018 and an increase of approximately $35 million in Q4 2018.","TYSABRI worldwide revenues were stable versus the first quarter of 2018. Within the U.S., TYSABRI revenues were impacted by a decrease in channel inventory of approximately $15 million compared to relatively stable inventory levels in Q1 2018 and an increase of approximately $10 million in Q4 2018.","TYSABRI's underlying performance improved in the U.S. with an increased share of both new and total prescriptions. Outside the U.S., TYSABRI revenues increased 1% versus the prior year.","Overall despite the headwinds from channel Dynamics, we were pleased with the continued resilience of our MS business in the first quarter and are focused on maintaining the resilience of this franchise in light of new competition entering the market.","Let me now move on to SPINRAZA. Global first quarter SPINRAZA revenues increased 42% versus the prior year and increased 10% versus the fourth quarter of 2018.","In the U. S. revenues increased 19% versus Q1 2018 driven by continued patient growth. Compared to the fourth quarter 2018, U.S. revenues decreased 5% which we believe was driven in part by seasonality.","Outside the U.S., revenues increased 26% versus Q4, driven by continued new country launches and increased penetration across all major geographies, as well as a positive pricing adjustment in France following the receipt of former reimbursement and timing of shipments across several international markets.","The number of patients on therapy in the U.S. increased 5% as compared to the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 and discontinuations remained relatively low. In the U.S., we continue to make strong progress with adults. In the first quarter approximately 50% of new starts were adults, increasing the total number of adult patients on SPINRAZA to over 1000, an increase of approximately 8% versus the fourth quarter of 2018.","We saw continued increase in the revenue contribution from maintenance doses this quarter. In the U.S. approximately 75% of SPINRAZA units in the first quarter were attributed to maintenance doses, as compared to approximately 65% in the fourth quarter.","In the first quarter approximately 10% of U. S. SPINRAZA units were dispensed through our free drug program, a decrease from approximately 15% in Q4. Outside the U.S., the number of commercial SPINRAZA patients increased approximately 24% versus the prior quarter. And there are approximately 210 patients active in the expanded access program.","We recorded revenues from over 40 international markets in the first quarter. During the past quarter, SPINRAZA was approved in Argentina, Colombia, Taiwan and China where SPINRAZA is now available for self-paying patients.","We also secured broad reimbursement in France and South Korea and our named patient sales program in Turkey where we estimate there are approximately 1500 estimated [ph] patients, was expanded to cover type 1, 2 and 3 patients.","As Michel mentioned, we believe the global opportunity for SPINRAZA is significant and even greater than we initially anticipated. We now estimate there are over 45,000 individuals with SMA in the markets where Biogen has a direct presence.","For example, we now estimate that there are approximately 10,000 SMA patients in Latin America, approximately 15 to 25,000 SMA patients in China and approximately 3,600 SMA patients in the rest of Asia Pacific.","These estimates were not factored into our original estimate of 20,000 SMA patients. SPINRAZA has now become our second-largest product, as we continue to execute well on growing our treated patient base.","Let me now move on to our biosimilars business. Revenues this quarter increased 37% versus the prior year and 12% versus the prior quarter. BENEPALI has been strengthening its leadership position in countries such as Germany, the UK, Denmark and Norway, shipping again more than 1 million doses in the quarter.","In the first quarter FLIXABI exceeded 100,000 doses for the first time in a quarter. For its first full quarter in the market, IMRALDI, which references HUMIRA exceeded 200,000 doses with sales in 18 different countries.","In general, the rate of HUMIRA biosimilar adoption has been steeper than for the previous two anti-TNFs. And our data indicate that IMRALDI is the market-leading HUMIRA biosimilar in Europe.","As an example, in Germany the largest anti-TNF market in Europe we estimate that HUMIRA biosimilars have already captured approximately 35% market share with IMRALDI capturing about 40% of that share.","Overall, our success outside the U. S. with MS, biosimilars and SPINRAZA has led to meaningful geographic expansion and diversification of revenues. Specifically the proportion of our product revenues coming from outside the U.S. increased from 39% a year ago to 44% in the first quarter of 2019.","Total anti-CD20 revenues in the first quarter increased 17% versus the prior year, primarily driven by OCREVUS royalties. Q1 was a particularly strong quarter for RITUXAN due in part to channel dynamics and pricing adjustments. As a reminder, our royalty rate on sales of OCREVUS resets at the beginning of every calendar year.","Total other revenues in the first quarter increased 78% versus the prior year, driven primarily by the sale of approximately $200 million of inventory associated with the Bioverativ spinoff, somewhat offset by a decline in our other corporate partner revenues. As noted in our Q4 2018 earnings call, this sale of inventory represents most of the remaining hemophilia inventory that we\u2019ve been hold to Bioverativ.","Let me now turn to gross margin performance. Q1 2019 gross margin was 83%, negatively impacted by the sale of Bioverativ inventory which carried a very low gross margin.","Q1 GAAP and non-GAAP R& D expense were both 16% of revenue. Q1 R&D expense includes approximately $39 million related to our agreement with Skyhawk and approximately $45 million in trial closeout costs for aducanumab.","Q1 GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A were both 16% of revenue. For the balance of the year we expect a reduction in operating expenses of approximately $125 million related to aducanumab with ea net savings of approximately $80 million for the full year 2019.","In Q1 we booked a GAAP loss of $116 million associated with our agreement with FUJIFILM related to the proposed sale of our manufacturing operations in Denmark. We expect to receive up to $890 million in cash related to this transaction subject to certain working capital adjustments and other contractual terms.","Q1 GAAP other income was $357 million, including $376 million in net gains on investments. This includes a $321 million increase in the fair value of our equity investment in Ionis that we made last year in conjunction with our expanded strategic collaboration. We continue to believe that this deal is a great example of how we aim to create long-term shareholder value through a strategic capital allocation.","In Q1 non-GAAP other expense was $19 million. In Q1 our GAAP tax rate was approximately 23%, negatively impacted by approximately 400 basis points due to the proposed sale of our manufacturing operations in Denmark.","In Q1 our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 18% which declined from approximately 21% in Q1 2018 due to the remaining benefit of the U.S. corporate tax reform.","We repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares in Q1 at an average price of $268 for a total value of approximately $656 million. And so far in April we repurchased an additional 2.1 million shares at an average price of $236 for a total value of approximately $492 million.","As Michel mentioned, in the first quarter of 2019 our Board authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase program. This is in addition to the approximately $1 billion remaining under the share repurchase program authorized in August 2018.","which now brings us to our diluted earnings per share. In the first quarter we booked GAAP EPS of $7.15, an increase of 29% versus the prior year and non-GAAP earnings per share of $6. 98 percent - excuse me $6.98 per share, a 15% increase versus the prior year.","We generated approximately $1.5 billion in net cash flows from operations in Q1. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.3 billion in cash and marketable securities and $5.9 billion in debt.","I'll now turn the call back over to Michel for his closing comments.","Michel Vounatsos","Thank you, Jeff. The Biogen team is taking the current situation very seriously and dedicating every effort to maximize shareholder value creation. I am inspired by the reaction of the team. And we now have the opportunity and the obligation to rebound.","We remain focused on growing our core business in MS, SMA and biosimilars, while addressing the short-term priorities already discussed, including the TECFIDERA IP challenge and preparing for the expected launch of VUMERITY by the end of the year. As always, we will invest in the areas we believe have the highest potential return for shareholders.","Between now and the end of 2020, we expect continued progress as we aim to build a multi-franchise portfolio, including data readouts in MS, PSP, lupus, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, ALS, pain, cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia and stroke. Potential regulatory approval in the U.S. for VUMERITY in MS and up to 10 new assets advancing into the clinic.","Finally I want to reiterate our commitment to maximizing returns to our shareholders and bringing innovative therapies to patients over the long term. This demands that we continue to allocate capital efficiently effectively and appropriately.","As we have demonstrated in the past, we will always strive to have an optimal capital structure, as well as aim for superior returns from the investments we make.","I will end by stating explicitly that everyone at Biogen is highly committed to making a positive impact on patients life by remaining at the forefront of discovering and developing breakthrough treatments, while always being dedicated to maximizing the long-term returns on behalf of our owners.","With that, we will open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ying Huang from Bank of America. Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ying Huang","Hi. Good morning. Thank you very much for taking my question. I want to ask one about your strategy on business development and M&A. In the wake of discontinuation of aducanumab Phase 3, does management team feel more urgency to acquire more assets that are either commercial or near commercial? And along those lines does the Board of directors also feel the same urgency to conduct more M&A and transactions? Thank you?","Michel Vounatsos","Thanks for the question. And as we communicated, we plan to deploy our capital to areas of highest returns for the shareholders. And we do believe that at the current stock price level buying back shares is very important.","We took aggressive steps to diversify our portfolio in the past. But in the context of our current cash flow generation and the profile of our balance sheet we can do both buying back and also conduct some BD, M&A activities.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Robyn Karnauskas","Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I think you acknowledging all the concerns that investors had including TECFIDERA and SMA. I guess my key question is while you acknowledge that aducanumab failures some of the reasons why we are so concerned. Let's start with SMA. What gives you the confidence that if the oral product maintains its efficacy in more studies that it won't erode SPINRAZA?","And maybe specifically, you -- could you clarify maybe what percentage of patients might be low-hanging fruit for that product? Maybe they are not as compliant as their older patients and not as fit that are currently on SPINRAZA? Thank you.","Michel Vounatsos","So, Robyn this is Michael. I'll start with that. I think it's still -- look, it's still pretty early days with the data that we know from RITUXAN has been relatively small numbers of patients in the 20s or 30s, but infants and later onset, they clearly generated some encouraging data on this in terms of efficacy.","I think some of the open things that the field is looking to understand about this is the overall benefit risk profile, the degree of efficacy, the extent to which that there is manageable therapeutic index on this. These are all parts of that program and data that are still to really emerge.","The way we kind of think about is that particularly through the NURTURE study, the data that we generated from SPINRAZA really sets the bar for the degree of efficacy that's really going to define standard-of-care.","So we think that's an important feature here. And we have such an extensive safety database on thousands of patients and patient years. So, again, I think that kind of sets the bar for what safety should look like.","Much of this is going to have to play out over time. Right now we are very, very confident in SPINRAZA's profile in terms of safety and efficacy and we'll have to see how the RITUXAN data set reads out at this time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Geoff Meacham","Hey guys. Thanks for the question and for all the perspective on aducanumab. Just had another one on SMA, in the US, can you add a little bit more detail for the new start trends? And you think there is a warehouse effect in 1Q ahead of an expected of excess launch?","And then related to that I mean obviously you guys have learned a lot from the SMA launch in the orphan space, do you view this as a strategic asset? And by that do I mean, do you look at the orphan space as a broader area for BD or is the emphasis still from a BD perspective neuroscience focused? Thank you.","Jeff Capello","Yes. Hi, Geoff. It's Jeff. Thanks for the question. So, as a reminder we grew 18% year-over-year in the U.S. in SMA, so pretty strong growth year-over-year. We did have a bit of a slowdown sequentially which I think you are asking about.","Couple of things to remember. Our estimated epidemiology in the U.S. is still 9,000 patients. We're only 30% penetrated to-date. And in the adult class, which is the largest class, 65% of the patients, we're only 18% penetrated.","So we continue to do a good job executing. We did a very good job this quarter continuing to grow that adult class. We also had a drop in the free drug percentage from 15% to 10% as more insurance coverage picks up the product which is just a testament to the strength of the product and we had very low discontinuations.","Having said that, we did see a slight decrease in the number of new patient starts. We actually saw the same dynamic happen when you look at the fourth quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 2018. And we think part of that is due to the fact of seasonality both with regard to new patient starts and maintenance doses.","In fact, if we look at our maintenance doses, we did see less compliance in the first quarter, which we attribute to weather and the cold and flu season. So this is not that the similar from what we saw in terms of the dynamics shifting from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 2018. So we think we continue to have lots of opportunity to grow this business in the U.S. And, of course, outside the U.S. we had a terrific quarter.","Michel Vounatsos","Concerning the second part of your question. Thank you for asking. Based -- following aducanumab setback, we gathered the team and we certainly worked hard to maintain the focus on the operations and the progress from all sites of the company. And again I'm impressed by the reaction of the team.","If we step back and we look at our - and reach portfolio that is materially improved compared with what it was 28 months ago. The core of our focus remains and we remain neuroscience.","Having said that, we also look very carefully at the progress we are making in lupus with the two compounds that Mike spoke about and also idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.","So this may point out adjacencies potentially in immuno, you speak about rare disease. It's too early for the organization to state that clearly. We need to regroup as a team and we got doing that while we speak share and line with the Board and then come back to you.","Jeff Capello","And Geoff I might add something to that too. I think you raised a very good point about. Our SPINRAZA experience, I think has been highly informative to us and in growing our capabilities in and around rare diseases broadly speaking. I think when you look at the ability to deploy innovative development plans when you look at the extent of regulator engagements and accelerated paths.","When you look at the collaborative relationship that we've exercised in patient efficacy and patient support groups that have supported that and then you look at opportunity space in disease like SMA, which ends up being much larger than I think anyone had anticipated at outset.","These points to the adjacencies Michel was just talking about, which were programs we have in our portfolio BIIB067, 078, 092 and the proposed Nightstar acquisitions, all will provide positive synergy and give us another lens to look at an additional external opportunities.","Michel Vounatsos","Just to conclude on this question and adding to what Mike is saying. It's all about adding value and highest return for the shareholders and finding synergies with the core capabilities of Biogen the way others will not be able to deliver.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Michael Yee","Hi, thanks. Good morning. I appreciate the comment as well, Michel. I guess, a question for Michel following on big picture strategy and the disappointment post Alzheimer's.","Maybe you could talk about whether there is any change or pivot on two fronts? One is the change in investment of capital in the Alzheimer's including BAN2401 or what or how we should think about spending in Alzheimer's?","And number two, whether or not there can be anything you can do about realizing immediate shareholder value post Alzheimer's given where the stock price is at and how to think about where you are now? Thanks so much.","Michel Vounatsos","Thanks for the great question, Michael. So if you sit back and you recall what we said repetitively. The plan A was always to prepare Biogen for growth even without aducanumab. So as I said, the focus will remain on neuroscience based on the portfolio we have, but also on the adjacencies of all the programs we are developing for now and we'll come back with more.","If you look at what we have done, we have materially improved our pipeline. We have materially diversified our pipeline. We are basically positioning the company for the future.","We have improved the operational performance and also the efficiency of our operations. And we believe we have the ability to go further. This is where the capital also had been.","We believe we invested the capital over the highest return opportunity. We have an IP challenge that we need to solve and we are working on that. And we do recognize our responsibility to shareholders to maximize the return over the long term, specifically on Alzheimer's disease.","It has to be science driven. We have tons of data points that we are still not yet finalizing to review and to digest. So we have to wait for the team and a team statistician and clinicians to look at the data, so that we can best indicate, educate the course forward for the beta-amyloid hypothesis and for BAN2401 and elenbecestat.","And as I said concerning the capital allocation and the share repurchase, I think, we've been pretty clear that at this level we believe that this is an area with very high return opportunity for shareholders. But again, in the context of the pristine balance sheet that we have, we can do more. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Cory Kasimov","Hey. Good morning, guys. And thank you for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on the business development front and ask about the companies buying capacity at this point. At the beginning of the year, I believe, you highlighted having roughly $42 billion in buying capacity through 2023.","I'm curious if that has shifted at all post the buyback and other transactions? And can you comment how much capacity you believe you have to do something now as compared to over a four to five-year timeframe? Thanks.","Jeff Capello","Hi, Cory, it's Jeff. Yeah. So we had mentioned back, I believe, it was at your conference that if you took, the metric was \u2013 if you took the cash flows of the company at the end of the third quarter of 2018 and you annualize those, you drop the CVRs and then you look at that over a five-year period that was a certain pool of cash.","And then, if you look at the cash on the balance sheet, plus leverage up to 2.5 times, less the leverage we have today, that gave you the $42 billion of potential capacity. Assuming all stayed constant in terms of the business, which obviously is not the plan. The plan is to grow the business and grow those cash flows. So that's where we got the $42 billion.","We once again had a very strong quarter cash flow wise. We did $1.5 billion in operating cash flow. And I would point out that this quarter was the final payment of the Fumapharm settlement of $300 million. So we're now beyond that settlement.","So if anything, we believe that our cash flow will continue and we'll be in a strong position to leverage those cash flows, as Michel had said, with regard to both buying back stock and being active from a business development perspective. So there will be no lack of capacity.","Michel Vounatsos","So we believe that deployment of capital at this level of price level should be on the share buyback. We believe this is a high return for everybody and we believe in the value of our company. At the same time, our team is working very hard on looking for other opportunities with high return.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore. Please go ahead.","Umer Raffat","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Michel maybe just in a different direction. In listening to you today, I get a sense that the Alkermes fumarate, VUMERITY is more and more important to your MS strategy perhaps than it has been in the past. Can you speak to that? Am I hearing it correct and also should we reasonably expect a meaningful switch ahead of IPR decision? Thank you.","Michel Vounatsos","So from day one and this is the reason why we did the -- we deployed capital and acquired this asset is that it was meaningful and strategically important for the company.","We have a $9.1 billion franchise in MS that is pretty resilient to date. And we continue to - we want to continue to invest in that space. We believe that this Alkermes compound can eventually be differentiated. We need to wait for some data readouts.","In the context of the IP challenge, certainly this is very important. It would be premature to state on any clear tactical plan or strategy for launch. But while we speak, we are working thoroughly on that. It's not that the organization is without any alternative, but we remain confident on our patents for TECFIDERA.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alethia Young from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.","Alethia Young","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question and thank you for all the color this morning. I just wanted to go and maybe discuss the pipeline a little bit. I know you have the one data, which will be in?","And I just wanted you to talk a little bit more about the C9ORF72 program and like what confidence you've received from the SOD1 that gives you confidence in knocking down that on HUMIRA as well? Thanks.","Michael Ehlers","So Alethia, it's Mike. So I think one thing we've learned from BIIB67 SOD1 program is a lot about how we can very reliably measure target engagement and a pharmacodynamic effect in terms of looking at the relevant cause of the agent species in CSF like SOD1 in that case.","We are deploying a very similar approach with C9ORF72 earlier program. So this is now just an essentially safety trials in this ALS patients. So we will be looking at similar types of things.","Target engagement lowering of the toxic species and as well as assessing some of the same types of clinical measures. We do think that the extensive experience we've gained in development over time in ALS has significantly enhanced our ability to conduct and execute these trials efficiently.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from Leerink. Please go ahead.","Geoffrey Porges","Thanks very much. I just wanted to clarify a little bit more on what you're saying about 2401 elenbecestat, and particularly in the context of your expenses going forward. It was a bit surprising that canceling of aducanumab was only about 5% saving to your R&D spend.","But if you discontinued 2401 elenbecestat, how much would totally you save from expected R&D? And secondly, could you just talk about the contractual flexibility you have to make that decision or can you only suspend funding for those programs with the agreement of your partner? Thanks.","Jeff Capello","So, Geoff I'll start with the -- I guess the back half of your question. And we disclosed this clearly in our filing. So, our share of the expenses relative to both BAN2401 elenbecestat was $74 million in 2017, that's just our share and $116 million in 2018. And the amount is not -- creeps up a little bit in 2019, but not dramatically. So that gives you a little bit of sense of kind of the run rate.","So, should we decide and our partners decide not to move forward those programs, obviously, that expense would come out. But I think as we mentioned in the prepared comments, as we're going through the aducanumab data and we're still having conversations and we'll make those decisions and deliberations as they play out.","Geoffrey Porges","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Gould from UBS. Please go ahead.","Carter Gould","Good morning guys and thanks for the color on strategy and capital allocation front. Maybe ask one on sort of near-term pipeline comment about BIIB092. I guess Michael can you give a little bit color on how you think about clinical meaningfulness on the PSPr scale, obviously, an indication for a lot of unmet need, but still some color on that front?","And then just how you're thinking potential about read-through to targeting tau across other tauopathies depending on the outcome of this study and PSP?","Michael Ehlers","Yes, great questions Carter. Thank you for that. So, the status of this is that we do anticipate getting days relatively large Phase 2 study data by the end of the year in PSP. The PSP rating scale is kind of the recognized standard across this field on areas of clinical meaningfulness.","We've been in active collaborative dialogue with regulators on exactly components of this scale and how to use that for a primary endpoint. But I think we're making really excellent progress on that. I do think that this study is powered in a way with the right endpoint to detect a clinically meaningful effect in these patients.","We have to keep in mind that to-date what we really know is that we've got a very target engagement in terms of measuring significant lowering of tau in the CSF. There's a lot of stuff that we still don't know and this is a Phase 2 study.","So, you have to keep in mind that this is still a relatively early program where this is largely untested hypothesis and thus it remains a risky program in that regard.","But I would say if we're able to show and find that there's a clinically meaningful effect in PSP, I do think that this will have significant positive ramifications or ability to intersect tau across many tauopathies.","I would also add and say that we have also very cautiously not just limited ourselves to tau monoclonal antibodies in this regard and that's why we're also enthusiastic about our BIIB080 program at tau antisense oligonucleotide which gives us a very different approach to targeting and lowering tau in tauopathies.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Phil Nadeau","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I did have a follow-up question on the broad strategy of targeting CNS diseases. Very clear that you want to maximize return to shareholders and it seems like based on the indications you're going after that means major unmet needs where these reasonably sized patients populations, but also really increasing the return to shareholders and also risk of success.","And as we look at slide 37 and the indications that are going to read out between here and the end of 2020, it kind of strikes me that not all those -- or actually most of those conditions don't have a determined mechanism of the disease or the pathogenic mechanisms not really well understood.","So, can you talk a bit more about how you assess the risk of success and failure when you're looking at potential indications to bringing to your portfolio? And whether that has changed at all post the failure of aducanumab?","Michel Vounatsos","So, I will get started. Since 41 years that this company is in operation, innovation, scientific excellence was at the forefront and is at the forefront of what we did and what we do and what we will do. And this is coming with some risk.","And we know historically that there have having some setbacks. But we also believe that nowadays we are able to mitigate some of them with genetically validated pathways and also biomarkers neuroimaging and other elements capabilities that we are building. Mike will give more color. ","Michael Ehlers","Yes, Phil. I think this is a very good question. It's a broad question. I think what we would say is, look, in this area what we see and detect is a significantly changing risk profile in the area. And we see this playing out in a number of dimensions and it's within things we're doing. And if you look broadly at the ecosystem, SMA being sort of the cardinal example of that, but it doesn't stand alone on this.","This risk profile in changing. Where you're successful, there's considerable high reward, as we've seen with SPINRAZA. We are very focused on mitigating the risk level of this in our overall portfolio. We do that in a number of ways Michel was talking about.","It's partly by seeking later-stage assets where we've got clinical data that points to the progress, and particularly objective clinical data where we can \u2013 lead to go after genetic origins of disease. And this has been a big focus of ours with the extended collaboration Ionis in leveraging the antisense oligonucleotide platform.","It's taking advantage of some of our other unique capabilities and depth of expertise in MS and SMA. And as we've been doing that and growing the portfolio, we would note that of these things we've added by bringing in or identifying, three of these deals were post proof-of-concept, two of these deals were post proof-of-biology. So that's an intentional strategy to really mitigate the risk across the portfolio.","And I think whether you look at what's going on in \u2013 with \u2013 in Biogen or in the field as a whole, you can look at disease after disease where these traditional views of the risk are breaking down.","SMA, migraine, muscular dystrophy, tardive dyskinesia, progressive MS, Huntington's, gene therapy, the inherited retinal diseases, ALS, treatment-resistant depression, Parkinson's, psychosis, postpartum depression, all these areas where before there have been very little prospect. In the very recent past, in the last year or two, including today, we're seeing a significant change in the risk profile in this area.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Ronny Gal","Good morning. And thank you squeezing me in. A couple of, if you don't mind. The first one is, I hear Michael, but there - kind of overall reducing risk and in neurological conditions. But you guys have been pretty positive on your amyloid beta program early on.","And I was wondering, if in light of the end results here, if you thought about structural changes about you view trial, how you conduct them, more focus on interim analysis or early futility analysis? Have you kind of thought about how you mitigate the risk that you think you've gone into pretty significantly risky area.","Are you looking for ways to kind of, like, ensure that you're not going down the wrong path for too long? And how do you think about in light of the aducanumab failure? And then, if I can throw one more in, should we read from the Nightstar acquisition, anything about your interest in biosimilar VEGF programs?","Michael Ehlers","Ronny these are getting great questions, which I guess has been lot of time to answer. Let me try to give a little bit of a flavor for it. So in terms of how it is that we design and think about trials.","Key for us is where we can get early signs with objective types of measurements that we know are connected to disease. So you will see more and more this is what we try to do across the board but you'll see more and more of that.","That means in some instances specific types of biomarkers target engagement, the powering of trials in a way where we're looking for big effects and looking for them early, where we can and we know there is a particular standard of care where we can do head-to-head type of comparisons, it's really leveraging existing data sets that are out there across these diseases to define and refine endpoints. These are the things that we're looking to do.","I'll tell you what we're not looking to do is to do large extensive trials where the only thing we're relying on subjective endpoints in that regard. So you will see less and less of that and more and more about refined patient populations objective measures that we think will be tied to a meaningful outcome for patients.","Michel Vounatsos","Concerning the biosimilars. We do believe in the value creation opportunity offered by the biosimilars also in the U.S. The savings opportunity are up to $250 billion in the next 10 years if we had an effective biosimilars market in the U.S. And we don't speak about that enough. But I believe what is being discussed in terms of rebates -- new rebates or the policy; we'll address this potential gap. We are very pleased with our portfolio. We are very pleased with our performance. We do not intend to stop here.","Operator","Your next question and your last question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Terence Flynn","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Maybe just two for, Jeff to follow-up on question Geoff Porges\u2019s question. Just can you be little bit clear, are you obligated to move forward with BAN2401? If Eisai would like to advance this program or if you don't agree, can you opt out and return rights there?","And then on biosimilars pricing dynamics in the EU. Can you give us a sense of what you're seeing right now and then maybe beyond Germany for HUMIRA? Any early read on some of the other countries? Thank you.","Jeff Capello","So, on the first question, Terry I\u2019m not going to be able to get into a lot of detail. That's a private arrangement between us and our partner. So as I said, we're looking at the data across all the programs and we'll certainly be able to give people an update when we have more clarity.","On your second question with regard to the pricing dynamics. I would just say that the pricing dynamics are more or less in line with what we expected with regard to the IMRALDI launch having two anti-TNS already in the market.","We're pretty well tuned to the pricing dynamics was very dramatically country-by-country. So we understand the dynamics and the different long-term contracts and how the different countries bid. And we're very encouraged by what's happening in Germany where we really have started out strong. So I would say the pricing is more or less in line with expectations than what we've seen historically.","Matt Calistri","Well, thank everybody. We're going to end the call now. I'm going to have Michel make some closing comments.","Michel Vounatsos","I would like just to reiterate our commitment to patients, all customers, and importantly to our shareholders. I believe Biogen is set to rebound and I fundamentally believe that we will be back.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.+"],"3464":["Biogen, Inc.

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Second Quarter 2017 Financial Results and Strategic Update. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Matt Calistri, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.","Matthew Calistri - Biogen, Inc.","Thanks, Dan. Thank you and welcome to Biogen's second quarter 2017 earnings and strategic update conference call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the press release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of a GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we'll discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in tables one and two. Table three includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We've also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call.","Given that we have a lot to cover today, we'll only be covering the key financial results for the quarter. For further detail, I encourage you to refer to the press release and slides. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail.","On today's call, I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer Michel Vounatsos and Dr. Michael Ehlers EVP of Research and Development, who'll also be joined for the Q&A portion of the call by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Al Sandrock; Dr. Paul McKenzie, EVP of Pharmaceutical Operations and Technology and Dr. Jean-Paul Kress, EVP, President of International and Head of Global Therapeutic Operations.","Now I will turn the call to Michel.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. I am very pleased to discuss our Q2 results and recent events and increase to our 2017 revenue guidance and as promised an update on our strategy for long-term growth.","At Biogen we are increasingly focused on execution, maximizing the potential of both our commercial business and our pipeline and building new growth drivers for the future. We had a great first half of the year and we are excited to build on this momentum for the rest of 2017 and beyond.","For the second quarter of 2017, Biogen generated record revenues of $3.1 billion. On an apples-to-apples basis excluding hemophilia, revenues grew an impressive 15% from the same period a year ago, our highest quarterly growth in over two years.","Revenues grew 6% when we include hemophilia revenues in the prior period. GAAP earnings per share were $4.07, and non-GAAP EPS was $5.04. Earnings this quarter were impacted by the charge related to our recent licensing deal with Bristol-Myers Squibb for their anti-tau asset, now BIIB092.","We believe this is a critically important investment as it gives us two new opportunities, one in progressive supranuclear palsy and one in Alzheimer's disease. This is a great example of the growth driving deals we are pursuing.","Let me now highlight how we think are the key takeaway for the quarter. First, financial performance. We saw continued growth in our MS franchise this quarter. MS revenues grew 5% year-over-year to $2.3 billion, a record quarter. We continue to add patients globally with a 4% increase versus the prior year and a 1% increase versus last quarter.","We are pleased with the progress we are making with the launch of SPINRAZA as we generated $203 million in revenue in the second quarter. We saw significant uptake in the U.S., and we are working with patients, physicians and payers to expand access to as many SMA patients as possible. And we are now building on this momentum outside the U.S. with recent approvals in Europe, Japan and Canada. We are preparing our launch efforts in these markets, and over time, we aim to make this therapy widely available across the globe.","Our biosimilar business delivered revenues of $91 million, and we recently received a positive CHMP opinion in Europe for our adalimumab biosimilar, IMRALDI. Assuming IMRALDI is approved, Biogen will become the first company to offer access to biosimilars of the three major anti-TNFs in Europe. As we will discuss later, we are actively reallocating resources to high-priority R&D BD and commercial growth opportunities.","For the second quarter, we recorded $430 million in SG&A expense along with $796 million in R&D expense. R&D expense included $360 million related to our licensing agreement with BMS. We also booked a $120 million GAAP charge related to our acquisition of BIIB093 from Remedy Pharmaceuticals.","Next, our nonfinancial achievement during the quarter. First, we expanded our efforts in acute neurology by acquiring Remedy Pharmaceuticals Phase-3 ready asset, BIIB093 for large hemispheric infarction, a severe form of stroke with no available therapy. We completed this deal shortly after entering into our licensing agreement with BMS for the anti-tau antibody, now BIIB092. We aim to do much more business development as we execute on our priority to bolster our pipeline.","Second, we announced two positive update on aducanumab for Alzheimer's disease, including an update on enrollment and a protocol change of the Phase 3 trials which Mike will cover in more details.","Third, we have made significant progress in building our new senior management team. Jean-Paul Kress has joined as EVP, President International and Head of Global Therapeutic Operations. Ginger Gregory has joined as our new head of HR. Alisha Alaimo will be joining us as Senior VP of U.S. Therapeutic Operation. And we are also making progress in our search for a new CFO.","Now more details on our commercial performance starting with MS. First, global TECFIDERA revenues were a record $1.1 billion this quarter, a 13% increase versus the prior year with approximately half of that growth driven by volume.","U.S. revenues increased 16% to $875 million versus the prior quarter. We were pleased to see revenue growth for TEC (7:41) in the U.S. as strong commercial execution and recovery from the Q1 seasonality led to significant increased volumes.","TECFIDERA also benefited from improved gross to net this quarter. As a reminder, Q1 was impacted by lower inventory levels in the channel, which remain relatively flat in Q2.","Outside the U.S., TECFIDERA continued on its trends of positive patient growth driven by recently launched market such as Italy, Poland and Japan. In Europe, the number of TECFIDERA patients grew 17% year-over-year. While in Japan, TECFIDERA has rapidly grown to nearly 8% market share in its first few months on the market. 250,000 people living with MS have now been treated with TECFIDERA. This is a remarkable achievement. As the market-leading oral (8:48), TECFIDERA has a wealth of real-world experience including almost 400,000 patient years of exposure.","Second, global TYSABRI revenues were stable versus the prior year. As anticipated, we did see some modest pressure on TYSABRI in the U.S. this quarter following the launch of OCREVUS. This quarter, TYSABRI was also negatively impacted by approximately $10 million due to a charge to discount and allowances related to prior periods. In Europe, TYSABRI continued to add patients as it benefited from the updated label providing improved clarity on risk stratification and patient management. As a reminder, last quarter ex-U.S. TYSABRI revenues benefited by approximately $45 million related to the AIFA settlement.","Third, we are delivering on our plan to demonstrate leadership in MS through value-based contracting with four agreements executed in July. We are piloting two separate approaches, the first aligning price to patient outcomes. And the second, adjusting price for patients initiating therapy who discontinue. We believe this pilot will provide valuable information that we can apply to future contracting approaches as we work to tie the pricing of our products to the clinical value and expand formulary access for patients.","Overall, we maintain our global market share in MS. You will hear more from us shortly in our strategic update on our plans and our commitment to maximize the resilience of this critical business.","Moving on to biosimilars, revenues grew 37% in the second quarter. BENEPALI is now available in 20 countries and is the market leader in the UK, Norway, Sweden and Denmark. In Germany, BENEPALI's share of the etanercept market now exceeds 30% as we are capturing almost two thirds of na\u00efve patients starting therapy. We estimate there are now 50,000 patients on BENEPALI across Europe and growing. FLIXABI is now available in eight markets, and we are working hard to drive adoption.","Now onto SPINRAZA. Global revenues were $203 million including $195 million in the U.S. and $8 million outside the U.S. U.S. revenues included approximately $30 million related to an inventory build reflecting the strong demand. Ex-U.S. included the initial launch in the Nordics and named-patient sales in the Middle East and Latin America. We continue to make solid progress in the U.S. in terms of infrastructure and insurance coverage.","With regards to infrastructure in the U.S., as of the middle of July, there were 145 sites that have administered SPINRAZA, a significant increase from 88 sites last quarter. And we now have a total of 233 sites that have submitted stat forms. We are pleased to communicate that the top 30 SMA centers are now all up and running and able to dose patients. From a coverage and reimbursement perspective, we have seen strong progress towards expanding access. Over 80% of commercially-insured lives across the U.S. now have a policy in place, with roughly two thirds having broad access. And for Medicaid, approximately two thirds of covered lives have a formal policy in place with 60% having broad access.","Very strong demand across patient types with roughly two third of patients treated to date having Type 2 or Type 3 SMA. However, we believe that up to 60% of the Type 2 SMA population has already undergone some type of spinal surgery, creating challenges in intrathecal administration. As leading physician are transitioned to some of these more challenging cases, we expect slower uptake in Type 2 patients through the balance of the year.","We are working closely with physicians to understand best practices to help these patients including alternate delivery options. As the new standard of care for SMA, SPINRAZA is fundamentally changing the treatment paradigm for patients requiring spinal surgery. The SMA standard of care guidelines are being updated to acknowledge the availability of an intrathecally administered therapy and will reinforce the need to use surgical techniques that can provide access for intrathecal delivery.","As a result of improved coverage, we have seen a decrease in utilization of our free drug program. In Q2, approximately 20% of units were dispensed as free drugs as compared to 25% in Q1. This reflects our broader efforts to make SPINRAZA available to as many patients as possible.","We continue to see important advancements in establishing newborn screening guidelines for SMA in the U.S. This is critical in our efforts to treat patients as early as possible. We are pleased to report that this quarter SMA was accepted into the review process for the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel. We intend to support this continued efforts with several pilots already established in Massachusetts, Georgia, Michigan and New York.","Missouri passed a bill earlier this month and became the first state to institute newborn screening for SMA and we hope this is just the start. Outside the U.S. following recent regulatory approvals, we are quickly ramping up launch efforts in Europe, Japan and Canada. We estimate there are approximately 12,000 SMA patients across the geographies. In Europe, we have now launched in Germany and the Nordics with more countries to come as we secure reimbursements.","During this transitional period, our Expanded Access Program will remain open for infantile patients where possible. We now have almost 600 patients across 24 countries of which over 460 are in Europe. So far this year, we filed in Brazil, Switzerland, Israel and South Korea, in addition to Australia, which was filed late 2016. We anticipate filing in a number of additional countries for the rest of 2017.","Biogen is implementing a successful launch strategy across multiple geographies working hard to maximize the number of patients who are able to benefit from SPINRAZA. While we are pleased with the progress we have made, our hope is that all patients with SMA will have access to this life-changing therapy. There is still much more work to be done.","In conclusion, it was an exciting quarter with strong execution. We saw continued leadership and growth in MS, a rapidly progressing launch of SPINRAZA, a growing biosimilar business and further progress in business development. Last but not least, Biogen's new leadership team is coming together. I will now turn the call over to Mike for an update on our recent progress in R&D.","Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.","Thank you, Michel, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by walking you through the significant progress we made this quarter advancing, reshaping and building out our pipeline as we further strengthen our leadership in neuroscience, starting with Alzheimer's disease.","Last week, we presented a new post hoc analysis of the Phase 1b PRIME study of aducanumab at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in London. This analysis looked at changes in cognitive and functional subscores of the clinical dementia rating scale, which is the primary endpoint of our Phase 3 trials. The data showed that aducanumab slowed the decline on both the cognitive and functional assessments compared to placebo, and the results of all subgroups studied were consistent with the overall study population.","We also received, recently submitted a protocol amendment for the Phase 3 aducanumab clinical studies ENGAGE and EMERGE that will titrate the high-dose ApoE4 carrier cohort up to 10 milligrams per kilogram. Previously, the cohort was dosed up to six milligrams per kilogram. This change was made based on the results from the titration arm of the placebo controlled portion of the Phase 1b PRIME study that showed patients who were treated with aducanumab using a titration regimen had a lower instance of ARIA at 12 months than those patients treated in the higher fixed-dose cohorts. Based on data from PRIME, higher dose titration of APoE4 carriers may increase the likelihood of demonstrating meaningful clinical efficacy.","Importantly, Phase 3 enrollment for aducanumab continues to progress well thanks to operational excellence from our team. Our strategy was to identify exceptional sites that we believe had high potential to enroll patients and to amplify the strength of our data by raising awareness. This plan appears to be working very well. We have sites telling us this is the first time they've had patients come in and request a specific Alzheimer's disease trial. Across ENGAGE and EMERGE, we added over 400 patients in the second quarter, enrollment continues to surpass our original expectations.","Further adding to our portfolio and as announced in our Q1 call, we entered into a licensing agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb for an advanced tau monoclonal antibody asset, BIIB092, as Michel alluded to. The deal closed in the second quarter and we have made important progress advancing the asset further into the clinic. In Q2, we dosed the first patient in the Phase 2 study for progressive supranuclear palsy, a devastating telepathy neurodegenerative disorder without treatment options. And we're on track to initiate a Phase 2 study in Alzheimer's disease early next year.","Our collaboration partner Eisai, is also progressing the Phase 2 study of BAN2401, a humanized anti-A-beta antibody which exhibits a strong binding preference for protofibrils. We expect data from this trial by the end of the year.","Moving on to our efforts in spinal muscular atrophy, last month at the 2017 Annual SMA Conference hosted by Cure SMA, by we provided a deeper understanding of the efficacy and safety of SPINRAZA across a broad set of SMA populations. New data presented from the ENDEAR study demonstrated motor function improvements in infants on permanent ventilation with 61% of SPINRAZA patients demonstrating an improvement of one or more motor milestones versus 27% for those in the sham-control. As measured using CHOP INTEND, 78% of SPINRAZA patients demonstrated an improvement of four or more points versus 9% of those in the sham-control.","New data from the NURTURE study in genetically-diagnosed infants with pre-symptomatic SMA continue to demonstrate that the greatest benefit with SPINRAZA occurs among infants who initiate treatment prior to symptom onset. At the time of the interim analysis, most infants achieved motor milestone and growth parameter gains generally consistent with normal development such as head control, independent sitting, standing and walking independently. These results are dramatically different from the known course of SMA infants with Type-1 SMA.","New data from the CHERISH study in children with later onset SMA demonstrated improvements in motor milestones among patients who received SPINRAZA compared to a loss among those on sham-control. Specifically, there was a significant and clinically-meaningful difference of 4.9 points in change from baseline to 15 months in mean Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded scores for children treated with SPINRAZA.","We also presented additional safety data for SPINRAZA including data demonstrating no increased risk of adverse events in children with scoliosis and overall the data presented reinforced the significant and clinically meaningful efficacy of SPINRAZA on the achievement of motor milestones and measures of motor function across a broad spectrum of SMA and on survival endpoints in infantile onset SMA as well as its favorable benefit risk profile.","We are continuing to expand on the clinical development program for SPINRAZA which has quickly become the largest body of data in SMA ever assembled for any interventional approach. Biogen has led the way with over twice the number of patients in our trials as compared to any other program with some patients now on SPINRAZA for over five years.","We are continuing to gather data through the SHINE study which we believe will be the longest observational cohort in SMA and we are planning additional studies as part of our long-term strategy in SMA which we will discuss momentarily. We believe this growing body of data solidifies SPINRAZA as the standard of care in SMA and highlights our commitment to SMA patients and families.","Moving on to other advances, we are committed to enhancing our pipeline through business development and once again I'm pleased to report substantial progress. As Michel discussed, we continue to see breakthrough potential in acute neurology including stroke. During the quarter, we acquired Remedy Pharmaceuticals' lead asset, a Phase-3 ready novel IV formulation of glibenclamide or BIIB093, being developed for large hemispheric infarction. Large hemispheric infarction is a severe form of ischemic stroke that impacts approximately 15% of the roughly 1.7 million ischemic strokes that occur across the U.S., Europe and Japan each year.","The data supporting the potential of BIIB093 are compelling. In preclinical studies, BIIB093 blocks SUR1-TRPM4 channels that mediate stroke-related brain swelling. In Phase 2 clinical studies, we believe there is strong evidence for positive effects on functional outcomes as measured by the modified Rankin Scale, mortality and imaging measures of brain swelling. If confirmed in Phase 3, these benefits would represent a significant advancement over the current standard of care which is largely palliative with no approved pharmacological therapies.","BIIB093 has been granted orphan drug designation and fast-track status in the U.S. which we believe should facilitate rapid development. We are currently working with regulators across the globe as we design a registrational program and we plan to initiate a Phase 3 study early next year.","We believe this transaction is a great example of matching mechanism with disease pathophysiology and the right patient population to address a significant unmet need. The BIIB093 transaction complements Biogen's broader efforts to build a portfolio of best-in-class treatments for stroke and acute neurology. We're also currently conducting a Phase 2b trial with natalizumab with the aim of improving functional outcomes by limiting brain inflammation in the post-stroke period. We expect data early next year. If successful, we anticipate that natalizumab and BIIB093 will provide new approaches to treating complementary populations of stroke patients.","Natalizumab is targeting acute ischemic stroke patients with mild to moderate severity with a therapeutic time window of up to 24 hours after stroke onset whereas BIIB093 is being evaluated for large hemispheric infarction up to 9 to 10 hours after stroke onset.","Moving on to other areas in our pipeline, we continue to see exciting potential for BIIB074 in neuropathic pain based on a differentiated mechanism of action and compelling proof-of-concept data. We believe that there is substantial medical and social need for new, effective, non-opioid pain therapeutics. Our Phase 2b study in painful lumbosacral radiculopathy is enrolling with data expected in 2018. And next year we anticipate initiating a Phase 3 program with trigeminal neuralgia, a devastating disease with limited treatment options.","Our early-stage pipeline includes novel approaches to tackling some of the most daunting important challenges in neuroscience beyond Alzheimer's disease. For example, in collaboration with Ionis Pharmaceuticals, we are advancing BIIB067, an antisense oligonucleotide therapy targeting a genetic form of ALS associated with mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 or SOD1 gene. This program leverages our unique expertise in intrathecal antisense oligonucleotide as a new transformative modality and highlights our approach of pursuing a genetically validated target in a disease with few treatment options today.","We're encouraged by the profile of BIIB054, our anti-alpha-synuclein antibody currently in Phase 1 targeting the core pathology of Parkinson's disease with a goal of slowing disease progression. And we look forward to advancing a set of novel drug candidates into the clinic. Across our pipeline, we now have 2 assets in Phase 3, 10 in Phase 2 and 3 in Phase 1 representing a set of exciting opportunities. We continue to make good progress advancing this portfolio but we recognize that accelerating our long-term growth will require further enhancement to our pipeline.","I will now pass the call back to Michel.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","Thank you, Mike. Now guidance. We are raising our full year 2017 revenue guidance to a range of $11.5 billion to $11.8 billion. We assume that SPINRAZA continues on a strong trajectory in terms of patients' uptake in the U.S. However, we expect revenue growth will flow as many patients move on from loading dose to maintenance therapy. Outside the U.S. we expect modest SPINRAZA revenues, particularly from Germany and Japan.","Our assumptions for MS for the balance of the year remain largely unchanged. We anticipate GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense between 18% and 19% of sales. This is an increase from prior guidance reflecting the recent in licensing of BIIB092 from BMS. This guidance does not include any impact from potential acquisitions or large-later stage business development transactions. These are hard to predict but obviously remain a priority.","GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 15% to 16% of revenue. We anticipate GAAP EPS results between $17.05 and $17.65. And non-GAAP EPS to be between $20.80 and $21.40. We believe 2017 is turning out to be a very strong and successful year for Biogen.","Now, I would like to turn for a strategic update and discuss how we aim to build on this impressive success going forward.","Our mission is clear. We aim to be the leader in neuroscience by developing transformational therapies to address what we believe are becoming the world's most significant unmet medical needs. In order to achieve this mission, we plan to maximize our near-term performance while investing for the future across four core growth areas.","One, MS and neuroimmunology. Two, Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Three, Parkinson's disease and related-movement disorders. And four, neuromuscular disease including SMA and ALS. Further, we see opportunities to invest in emerging growth areas such as pain, ophthalmology, neuropsychiatry and acute neurology.","Through the end of the decade, we expect cash flows to significantly grow driven by continued performance of our commercial assets and the anticipated expiration of the contingent payments related to TECFIDERA in the first half of 2019. This cash flow will enable us to invest in and build an industry-leading neuroscience pipeline that we believe will transform Biogen into the fastest growing large-cap biotech company.","This represents a shift in approach from emphasizing share repurchases to prioritizing business development and investing for growth always with a priority towards maximizing shareholder value.","We see an inflection point for Biogen in the early 2020s with multiple-high assets, potentially rolling out and launching. We are all looking to Aducanumab as a potentially transformative opportunity for Biogen. We too remain optimistic about what this therapy and our broader Alzheimer's franchise will present for us as a company and mostly for all the patients we serve.","Importantly, we aim to demonstrate that we can advance a broader world-class neuroscience pipeline beyond just Alzheimer's disease. In order to deliver positive results in the near term, while investing in the next stage of growth for Biogen, we will focus on the following five strategic priorities.","One, maximizing the resilience of our MS core business to drive strong cash flow generation. Two, accelerating our efforts in spinal muscular atrophy to shift towards significant new growth opportunities. Three, developing and expanding our neuroscience portfolio to create the future growth engines of Biogen, Mike will discuss. Four, reprioritizing our capital allocation efforts to drive investment for future growth. And five, creating a leaner and simpler operating model to streamline our operation as we aim to redirect up to $400 million towards high value creation R&D and commercial opportunities.","Let me start with our first strategic priority, MS. Biogen is the clear leader with over 340,000 patients benefiting from our therapies today. We are focused on areas where we can improve as we prepare for the marketplace to become increasingly competitive with new entrants and generic products. We are committed to maximizing the resilience of our MS core by evolving our operating model and continuing to invest in MS-focused R&D.","Specifically, we are transitioning to a portfolio centric customer first model to better meet the needs of patients, health care providers, payers and all the stakeholders in the value chain. We also aim to further differentiate our leadership in MS through services, solutions and business model innovations. We are committed to improving physician engagement and providing deeper patient support to help patients manage their disease. And we are proud of Biogen's leadership position in fostering value-based contracting.","We recognize that price and access to treatments are key consideration for patients, providers, payers and policymakers. We aim to improve quality of care and expand access to our products by shifting from transactional to value-based contracting. As the MS market leader, we are well positioned to benefit the most from progress in diagnosing and managing the disease, including early identification of patients requiring high efficacy.","We are working to advance the overall treatment paradigm by promoting the use of MRI, cognitive measures and innovative technology to better diagnose and monitor the disease. For example, we are collaborating with Siemens to develop new MRI tools and hope to expand the utilization of the MS Performance Test, an iPad-based app we developed in collaboration with Cleveland Clinic. We remain committed to investing in R&D for MS to address key unmet needs, including developing opicinumab as a remyelinating therapy, advancing, advancing new DMTs with superior profiles working to address progressive form of MS and researching new approaches for preventing, diagnosing and managing PML.","In summary, we are optimizing our commercial operating model investing in new customer solution, demonstrating leadership through innovative contracting approaches and continuing to drive new scientific advancements. We believe this strategy will support a healthy, resilient MS business for Biogen.","Next, let's speak about our second strategic priority. SPINRAZA is already off to a very promising start making a real difference to the lives of patients. It continues to exceed expectation in the U.S. and gains approvals in large geographies such as Europe, Japan and Canada. We believe we can accelerate our success to drive near-term growth and position Biogen for long-term leadership in SMA by increasing access to SPINRAZA globally with particular opportunities in Asia-Pacific and Latin America, strengthening SPINRAZA's profile with real-world data in additional subpopulations including teens and adults, accelerating diagnosis and newborn screening through disease awareness and education, reducing treatment burden such as optimizing the dose and exploring additional treatment option such as gene therapy and symptomatic therapies. Overall, we believe SPINRAZA will become one of our largest commercial assets shifting the center of gravity for Biogen beyond MS to generate new growth.","Mike will now discuss our R&D strategy for creating new growth engines by developing and expanding our neuroscience portfolio, and I will be back to close on capital and resource allocation.","Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.","Thanks, Michel. Our strategy is rooted in the fact that the unmet need in neuroscience is massive. With an aging population leading to a significant increase in the number of patients globally that are expected to suffer from nervous system disorders, many of which currently have limited or no treatment options. Biogen has a long history in neurology and has built up substantial core competencies in the area. It is our belief that no other area of medicine holds as much promise with as much need as neuroscience. The opportunity space is vast, and the time is right.","With an ongoing revolution in basic neurobiology, human genetics, biomarkers, patient stratification and neuroimaging, an increasing receptivity to new clinical endpoints and regulatory paths, we believe that all signs point to neuroscience as the next oncology. Yet, for most companies, it is either not an area of focus or represents an opportunistic play. Our view is that success in neuroscience requires intense focus and that opportunistic approaches will not maximize value.","There is a need for a leader in neuroscience. Our goal is to be that leader. To that end and recognizing that as a therapeutic area in the field of biomedicine, neuroscience is large with many intersecting disciplines. Our strategy is to concentrate on the four core growth areas Michel mentioned: MS and neuroimmunology, Alzheimer's disease and dementias, Parkinson's disease and related-movement disorders, and neuromuscular disease including SMA and ALS. We believe we can accomplish leadership by acting on the following strategic initiatives.","First, building a translational machine in neuroscience to increase the probability of success for transitioning from the lab all the way to the market. Second, investing in assets and capabilities in our prioritized growth areas. Third, substantially augmenting our pipeline to emphasize both innovation and risk balance.","To the first point, we believe that our translational capabilities are increasingly changing the probabilities of success across neuroscience. We are gaining a better understanding of genetics and mechanisms of action. Disease models are improving. We are developing insights from longitudinal studies of populations, and we continue to invest heavily in biomarkers for disease pathology and progression. For example, we are mining our clinical data in experimental electrophysiological endpoints in ALS, yielding clinical measures with the potential to enable trials that are half the size, twice the speed and a third the cost.","In Parkinson's disease, our advanced imaging biomarker investments are allowing patient selection and detection of disease progression that has not previously been possible. Fueling this translational machine, we've identified genetic modifiers and causal pathways that are providing proprietary insight to produce our next generation of drug candidates.","Meanwhile, we are already witnessing advances in technology with new modalities that can be unlocked such as antisense oligonucleotides, new delivery routes such as intrathecal and advanced imaging. Furthermore, we have established some of the best scientific base relationships with regulators and are seeing accelerated pathways to approval and openness to new endpoints.","For our second strategic initiative, to build the industry's leading neuroscience portfolio we are committed to reinvesting for growth. Our approach to develop and expand our pipeline builds on deep scientific and clinical knowledge. We will invest in the four core growth areas that Michel and I previously described. Within these areas, we see an opportunity to leverage Biogen's capabilities and rebalance pipeline risk by emphasizing rare neurological and neuromuscular disease, including genetic subtypes of more common diseases such as Parkinson's disease, ALS and telepathies (42:03).","We also see further opportunity in the emerging growth areas Michel mentioned: pain, ophthalmology, neuropsychiatry and acute neurology. Where we are able to leverage commonalities and synergies in biological mechanism, disease pathophysiology and clinical populations. We will use multiple treatment platforms in an agnostic manner; small molecules, biologics, antisense oligonucleotides, intrathecal administration and gene therapy, taking advantage whenever possible of our unique capabilities such as in biologics and intrathecal antisense oligonucleotides.","To the third point, we recognize that we have a highly innovative pipeline, and as a consequence it may seem risky and heavily-weighted towards just a few indications. Our strategy includes pursuing areas where real innovation is required and where success means pioneering new approaches and opening new areas of medicine, much like we have done with SPINRAZA in SMA.","At the same time, our strategy includes taking a thoughtful and conscious approach to rebalancing risk in our portfolio. This means, one, continuing our scientific leadership across our core franchises of MS and SMA. This includes development of DMTs with superior profiles, as well as pursuing next-generation therapeutics in remyelination, muscle enhancement and gene therapy that leverages our substantial strengths.","Two. Increasing our emphasis on rare and orphan diseases and particularly rare neurological and neuromuscular disease where the probability of success is higher and speed to approval is faster. Our pursuit of BIIB092, the anti-tau monoclonal antibody in progressive supranuclear palsy provides an initial example of this approach.","Three. Broadening our lens of opportunity in the pipeline across neuroscience, including the emerging growth areas of pain, ophthalmology, neuropsychiatry and acute neurology. Four, pursuing patient-centric franchises. Here what I mean is developing a portfolio that addresses multiple features of a given disease. So in addition to disease-modifying therapies, we will search for additional symptomatic solutions and therapeutic improvements in our core areas.","And five, acquiring late-stage assets where possible. Although our emphasis and asymmetric capability to extract value rests in identifying early-stage clinical assets, we intend to stay vigilant and proactive in evaluating later-stage opportunities.","As we develop and expand the Biogen portfolio, we're also working to increase overall productivity at every stage, and we will implement a more robust external pipeline strategy that includes asset acquisitions, development partnerships for resource flexibility and early innovation partnerships.","It is important to note that we believe the future growth we can generate from our neuroscience portfolio is not solely contingent on aducanumab but rather complemented by it. As we rebalance the portfolio, we plan to expand and enhance our opportunity set to diversify beyond aducanumab as the predominant value driver for the future of Biogen. While we continue to see tremendous opportunity for our Alzheimer's disease franchise, we believe we can achieve our aspiration of becoming the fastest-growing large cap biotech even without aducanumab.","In order to create new growth drivers for Biogen, we aim to bring in and advance several assets through development over the next few years. Our aspiration is to grow our late-stage pipeline from two assets in Phase 3 today to substantially more in Phase 3 or filing-ready by the end of 2021.","In summary, we remain focused on neuroscience but are widening our lens of potential opportunities. Our strategy takes a multipronged approach to both expand and derisk our pipeline including an increased emphasis on business development and diversification across both disease area and therapeutic approach. And to achieve all of this, we are working to enhance our internal R&D capabilities to increase both productivity and the probability of success.","With a clear strategy in place, we are laser-focused on execution and delivering the portfolio. I'll now turn the call back to Michel.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","Thank you, Mike. Turning to capital allocation, as we move forward our new priority for capital deployment is to invest in building our pipeline across our core growth areas and emerging growth areas. We will explore deals of all sizes, and we remain disciplined in our approach. We look to deploy capital to generate returns meaningfully above our cost of capital. We view investment in growth as our top priority, but we also recognize the value of opportunistically returning excess capital to shareholders through share repurchases.","Our final strategic priority is to implement a plan for a lean and simple operating model which we believe can unlock resources that can be reallocated to help fund our prioritized investment for growth. We expect that by 2019 up to $400 million annually will be available to redirect towards prioritize R&D and commercial value creation opportunities.","Before I conclude, let me discuss our biosimilars business. We are excited about the potential value of both our commercial assets in Europe and our option to increase our investment in our JV, Samsung Bioepis. Biosimilars are an important contributor to our growth while not being at the core of our neuroscience focus. Our plan is to use any positive cash flow from our commercial operation and the JV to reinvest in our core growth strategy.","Now let me summarize our strategy to deliver in the short term while investing for medium- and long-term value creation. We are focused and committed to maximizing the resilience of our MS core business. We expect SMA to generate significant growth, accelerated by geographic diversification.","We believe our core business is capable of generating significantly increased cash flow to invest for growth. We aim to expand and develop our neuroscience portfolio across our core growth areas and emerging growth areas. We believe we can build our pipeline while at the same time rebalancing the risk profile of our portfolio. Our capital allocation is focused on enhancing our pipeline for future growth, and we aim to free up to $400 million a year in resources that we can reinvest.","Lastly, there is an overarching theme that I believe will be key to implementing our strategy. We are building a new management team with diverse global expertise and execution mind-set and our actions will continue to speak for themselves. So far this year, we've continued to grow our MS business. We delivered a strong start to our SPINRAZA launch. We added two high-value assets to our pipeline. We passed 50% enrollment for aducanumab. We executed four value-based MS contracts here in the U.S. and we increased our biosimilars revenue in Europe. We intend to continue this momentum.","In closing, I would like to thank our employees around the world who are dedicated to making a positive impact on patients' lives and all of the physicians, caregivers and participants in our clinical development programs, the past and future achievements could not be realized without their passion and commitment. I am excited about our path forward on this promising journey. With our team and all of you, there is a need for a leader in neuroscience. Our goal is to be that leader.","With that, we'll open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham, Barclays. Please go ahead.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question and all the strategic detail. And I'll keep it just to one question. So you touched on this but, Michel and Michael, I wanted to ask you about the clinical risk here when you look at the biz dev. I think most investors acknowledge the high-impact nature of the pipeline but the risk profile and probability of success in Alzheimer's and stroke in particular I think is the main uncertainty. So when you think about external biz dev, how much of an emphasis is there on clinical risk over things like diversification and impact? And when you look to say the orphan space, do you think more broadly SPINRAZA will provide a template for a bigger franchise in the rare disease space? Thanks a lot.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","So before I give the floor to Mike, this is Michel. So we want to have a strategy that is a bit more hedged. There are different combination of factors in the different vertical that you heard in neuroscience that were communicated by Mike, including clinical development risks, time line, P&L risk, capital allocation, regulatory or payer. But now coming back precisely to your question, Mike will give you more details.","Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.","Yes. Geoff, I think this is a great question and the nature of it highlights exactly what we're trying to do. We are looking very closely at clinical risk. We're looking to diversify that a bit. We think that SPINRAZA does provide an excellent template of what we can do in rare and orphan disease. When we look at this as development, we're going to look at very closely at this area in rare and orphan. We also want to make some of this risk a little bit less codependent which is areas that may not \u2013 where the risk isn't the same across different clinical populations so we're looking at that.","And then I mentioned a little bit about trying to pursue patient-centered franchises which is kind of addressing things across patient areas where we've got known expertise. Whether that's symptomatics and Alzheimer's disease, whether it's muscle enhancement and SMA, those are the kind of things we're going to look to diversify and mitigate clinical risk in the portfolio.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Congrats on a great start to the year. I was hoping, Michel, could just talk a little bit more about capital allocation. It sounds like the shift from share repurchases to one of biz dev priorities is emphasizing maybe more growth over value. Can you talk about why you perhaps no longer view your stock as a good investment? Or also whether the dividend or any discussion of a dividend is off the table for the foreseeable future? Thank you.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","Thanks for the good question, Eric. So as alluded, the third strategic priority is to develop and expand our neuroscience portfolio. We believe that this is a future growth engines for the company. But you know, we will obviously do that with the objective to maximize shareholder returns. We will absolutely deploy this capital where the internal rate of return will exceed our weighted average cost of capital and we will look all the time at R&D, commercial acquisitions as well as returning capital to shareholders, okay? So we don't exclude returning capital to shareholders. We will evaluate that while we see the opportunities.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Michel, so on the call today you mentioned a possible potential inflection point in the early 2020s. And you also talked about resilience in the MS base business and the growth in SPINRAZA. So my question is this, do you think you can grow top-line through that possible inflection early 2020s even if you excluded the contribution from biosimilars?","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","So you know, the facts and the way we did outline the strategy fully speaks for itself in terms of ability for Biogen to implement well on the opportunities we have to continue to drive MS and to accelerate the efforts in SMA. And we believe there are significant opportunities as explained. And if we continue implementing well, MS is a growing market. There are half of the patients being treated than actual prevalence in the U.S. So we decided not to give long-term forward guidance on these measures that you ask, but we are confident in our ability to continue to implement well and deliver on the expected performance.","And, yes, it is true that at the same time there is an articulation whereby we have the readouts of very important studies. But we'll not wait for that. As we said all along, we will continue to develop and expand our portfolio, and therefore there will be some capital allocation prioritization efforts, including potentially some BD. So this is what we are working towards.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Porges with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much. Mike, a lot of people have been asking about the interim look on the aducanumab trials. You amended the protocol, as you described, for the APoE4 carriers. Could you talk about the advisability and likelihood of an interim look? And whether that's something that would be disclosed to you or to us at the time? Thanks.","Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.","Yes, Geoff. Thanks for the question and interest. We just don't comment about interim analysis, so I really have no more to say on that one.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the quarter. Michel, you mentioned that the global MS patients increased 4% versus last year. So do you think that's a long-term market trend? And also what do you think OCREVUS would do? Because if I do my math, it seems that the drop in TYSABRI revenue in the U.S. this quarter is way less than what we saw from the increase in the OCREVUS launch. So does that mean actually OCREVUS would at least in the near term expand the MS market? I was wondering if you can talk about that. Thank you.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","Yes. This is what I anticipate. Your competitor is your best friend, mostly when you get 24% royalties in the largest market. So we have seen in the U.S. a contraction in 2016 of the market. And we assume that the market will resume back to low-single-digit growth in the U.S. and high-single-digit growth in Europe geographies. So I anticipate that with the PPMS label and all the patients from the sidelines, there is logically an opportunity to see the market regain some momentum.","And concerning TYSABRI, you know it's 10 years of post-marketing experience with a very well documented beneficiaries proposition for the providers and for the patients that had the time to experience the efficacy of this product. I was in USC last week, and I was reminded by all the physicians on the perceived unsurpassed efficacy on this product. So it speaks for itself, and I believe that TYSABRI will continue to do well, but we have seen some erosion and so be it for high titer JCV that will switch to OCREVUS.","But let's keep in mind that when they switch from TYSABRI to OCREVUS, it's not an easy switch. What I hear and as anticipated is that some of the patients see a rebound in the disease symptomatology, and they do communicate that to the providers. So this is clearly an element that we see. So I hope I did answer with a few measures \u2013 the dynamic, your question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Aharon Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. I would like to turn to SPINRAZA for a second. Now that you kind of know a little bit more about the market dynamics in the United States, patients with spinal fusion and so forth, can you give us a feel for the applicable market size for SPINRAZA as you see it today? And as long we're following that, you've not really mentioned time lines for bringing your own gene therapy to the marketplace. Can you describe that time line? And how you would compete with potential gene therapy between the current state and when you have your own program coming to market?","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","Yes. So I will take the first part, and then I will let Mike on the gene therapy comment. So, when I travel in the different geographies and I get to meet scientific leaders and I talk to advocacy groups, it appears that the epidemiology and the prevalence might be slightly higher than what we anticipated. This is what I hear from different geographies.","So we are very pleased with the launch progress, and we see infrastructure and patient access improving. The patients pools and demand is certainly a very good support to this momentum, and importantly, we are making some good progress with the late onset. And keep in mind that the later onset represents 80% of the prevalence.","So we are now with regulatory approval beyond the U.S. unlocking new patient pools broadly, and the testimony from the patient is critical. And this is a community that basically communicates extremely well. Patients and family are very well informed, motivated and they demand treatment. So what we've said in the call is that we believe that SPINRAZA will become one of our most important commercial assets.","Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.","So, Ronny, I'll try to answer the question about gene therapy. So, first, we're very excited about our Penn collaboration. Obviously we stay closely aware of clinical results as they're being presented in the field by AveXis, an example.","We think we're making good progress. We believe that we will be able to get to the clinic next year. We see a path forward. We're making a considerable investment in our development capabilities, our regulatory strategy, all the analytics and manufacturing technologies that go around this, and we're quite committed to solutions including gene therapy solutions for all SMA patients.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","So just an additional comment, but I would like to give the floor first to Paul McKenzie, our Head of Manufacturing, will say a few words.","Paul McKenzie - Biogen, Inc.","Right. Thanks for the question. Great to hear your voice. Looking forward to the challenges of gene therapy. As we know, across the industry many companies are wrestling, like us, with gene therapy, its scalability, it's analytical challenges and our regulatory path forward.","We've been investing specifically in growing our development engine in collaboration with our early partners like Penn where we're co-locating resources between the two companies, learning from each other actively. We believe that we can build a development engine that will drive success across our portfolio of gene therapy entities. And as we've announced at the end of last year, we went into a strategic agreement with Brammer Bio for manufacturing capabilities so we could co-develop and leverage a manufacturing platform across our entire portfolio. So we're excited about our possibilities in gene therapy.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","Thank you, Paul. Al Sandrock would like to make a comment.","Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr., M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.","Hi, Ronny. On the question about prevalence, the most common type of SMA based on incidence is Type 1, and we know we affect survival in Type 1 patients. So the prevalence has to go up overall for SMA, if that's true.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a great quarter. So, just a follow-up, Al, with that comment. So the point about the percentage of people who can't get treated, is that a new data point? Did you know that a certain percentage of patients could not get the intrathecal injection? And did you say it's about only 40% that might be eligible? So is the number, the original number as a prevalence that you put out there, would that go down because a lot of those patients can't be treated? And just a quick question on the EAP patients. Are those patients that would be paying patients going forward, or have they gotten their drug already? Would they be getting drug in the future? Thanks.","Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr., M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.","Yes. The plan on EAP is to eventually \u2013 it was meant to bridge between getting the results, the positive results, and getting approval and reimbursement in those countries. So it's meant to be that bridge, and eventually we anticipate the EAP patients will be on the drug in the commercial setting. And in terms of people who can't get the drug, the types of people who can't get the drug were people who had spinal surgery, for example, spinal fusions, are having trouble medically to get the drug. And a lot of those are Type 2 patients, childhood onset patients. And so we're working through how to \u2013 we're working with orthopedic and neurosurgeons on trying to figure out how to get drug to those patients who deserve to be treated because they're childhood onset, and we have data that shows that childhood onset SMA responds well to SPINRAZA.","And in terms of others who can't get it, I think you might be referring to those who get reimbursed. And we're working through that. We don't have a lot of data in adult onset patients so consequently, there are some questions from payers. But we're going to be addressing those questions. And remember, we have a broad label in the U.S. Many of those patients are getting treated, and we'll see if we can see efficacy in those patients as they get treated per the U.S. label.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","So, this is Michel. The uptake so far was strong, and we just want to send a word of caution here because, yes, effectively 80% or 60% of the Type 2 population basically had or has spinal surgery and eventually, just let's put ourselves in the shoes of Type 2 patients, either patients who had the fusion surgery and is aware now of the ability of a product like SPINRAZA and how motivated and also frustrated. And therefore, together with the medical community, they try to find solutions.","Let me give you an example of one center close to where we stand here, the Boston Children's Hospitals. They have an strategy plan in place. They have an internal team that is well assigned to SMA. They have processes in place to manage through all the logistics. They are battling with the payers in order to secure access and reimbursement. And they are working now on the solutions so that they can appropriately dose the more complicated patients. It starts with the right leadership, the right commitment, and providers here are our allies in order to find solutions for those patients. But, again, we just want to say, we won't be able to penetrate as strong as one would wish in this population because of this challenge.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So, Michel, you clearly outlined a lot of flexibility in what you could do from both the pipeline and the revenue side, and I think you struck a tone of confidence here on the business, but you also decided not to give any kind of long-term metrics. Can you just comment on why you didn't give any long-term metrics at this point? And if there is a time, or what needs to change for you to feel comfortable to give some long-term metrics? Thanks.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","So, listen. I think that the process that together with the executive team, we worked on during the past six months has been a very rich and fascinating journey to try to define what will be the next step for Biogen. I am in charge since six months, and I think that already what we communicate here is pretty solid, and should give you an indication on how we see Biogen evolve. And we decided that for the time being this is good. Obviously, we have our plans, we have our commitments and we're going to execute on those. But here you have a clear view on the strategy, meaning what we consciously decide to do and not to do and this is what we communicated today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alethia Young with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on starting off the biotech tape with a good quarter. I guess just going to SMA again, kind of in the point of the center for people who were early adopters, do you see people going back to use the drug? And also like what's been the general feedback as far as educating and getting people comfortable with intrathecal injections? Thanks.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","So what we see is a learning curve. Remember, those centers did not perform in intrathecally \u2013 intrathecal injections and mostly injections and very often for infants. And what we see is capability being built around this pool of patients pressed by the patients, tremendously pressed by the patients and the advocacy group. And what we see is a learning curve and when they dedicate personnel infrastructure, we expect depth to increase over time in those key centers.","Remember at the outset, what we always said with a lot of caution since day one, and we continue to be very cautious about the ramp up is that there are approximately 30 key SMA centers and 150 neuromuscular centers. And you see that where we stand today, we have 145 centers dosing the product. We've made substantial progress, and now it's a matter of having those centers performing more and more so that the patients can benefit.","Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr., M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.","Pediatric neurologists generally \u2013 I mean they're comfortable putting a needle in the intrathecal space, but usually to withdraw fluid for diagnostic purposes. So I think early on many centers were asking anesthesiologists and interventional radiologists who are more used (01:11:23) but I suspect that as time goes on, as Michel was saying, with the learning curve, that people will start to get comfortable injecting because usually the hard part is to find the intrathecal space (01:11:35) drawing versus adding fluid, there's not that much of a technical difference.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","Thank you, Al.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Michel, when you referred to a leaner and simpler operating model, I'm just wondering if that just assumes a redirection of some SG&A spend to R&D or does that also contemplate any potential SG&A cuts that could impact your margins positively? Thanks.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","Thank you for the question. Listen, the world and technology are evolving very fast and the question is pharma companies evolving at the same pace or faster pace, and how is Biogen in that space? Where do we stand versus pharma benchmarks and beyond pharma benchmarks? And, yes, we have done a lot of cost measure in the past, but when you peel the onion and look at the reality of the key processes, the ability for cost moves to the key geographies and patients, the key processes on manufacturing, R&D, using channels and benefiting from technology or procurement, there are plenty of opportunities to be leaner and more simple and to be the biotech that we stand for. The one that everybody wants to copy.","This is why looking at the opportunity here across all divisions and functions we stated this opportunity of $400 million run rate as per 2019 that we are going in order to be logical with our strategy that we are going to reinvest in value creation opportunities that will benefit the shareholders. But I would like Paul to say a few words as head of manufacturing, how he sees the lean and simple.","Paul McKenzie - Biogen, Inc.","Great, thanks, Michel. Thanks, Terence for the question. Now, to Michel's point, we really believe that if we can take \u2013 stand back, we have a great track record of developing and delivering high-quality products to the market. But when we look at our fundamental processes there's always opportunity to improve. There's areas like end-to-end planning in terms of how much time we take from start, raw material to patient. How can we improve our overall cycle times? How can we reduce variability to be successful?","Reliability is a key focus of our manufacturing teams. How can we ensure that we're reliable day in and day out and really manage to make reliability a key strategic deliverable moving forward. We believe in resource allocation and the use of resources to drive higher use of technology, whether it's algorithmic planning for inventory, or whether it's process control.","And the last one I want to highlight is really our zest to deliver industry platforms for all of our technology areas. Just want to highlight our next-generation manufacturing platform that creates an ecosystem from our interface to R&D out to our day-to-day distribution. But next-generation manufacturing we hope and we believe we can deliver consistently titers in monoclonal antibody space, be it above 10 grams per liter, which we will be the first in the industry we believe to deliver that level of titer.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","Thank you, Paul. So basically it's all about fitness for the organization, and how can we enhance the level of speed and decision-making, proximity, agility. In the P&L, you can expect to see neutral impact on the contribution in bottom-line, but a potential shift from SG&A to R&D.","And last but not least, I would like to say that based on this fitness, we want to stimulate growth momentum, but the cost discipline at Biogen actually will enhance, because we want to be very, very rigorous on how the money is being spent. It's not about focusing the efforts on head count reduction. It's all about fitness and processes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Thanks. Good morning. A question for Al and Michael. You talked about the timing for gene therapy next year for SMA. Can you talk a little bit more about some of your confidence in terms of differentiating? Is that going right into the Type 2 patients? Is the improved capsage (01:16:20)? Does it improved manufacturing, given the COGS for these types of patients? Maybe talk a little bit about the challenges and where you see differentiation capabilities? Thanks.","Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.","Michael, this is Mike. I'll kind of start. Look, at one level we haven't really disclosed our overall strategy in this area. So I can't go into some of this. But, as I mentioned Paul elaborated on, we have put a considerable investment into our development capabilities, our analytical and manufacturing capabilities. And we do see this across the gene therapy space as being a critical point of differentiation.","I mentioned that we're committed to solutions for all SMA patients, and I think that's also going to be an important component of potential differentiation in our development strategy. And I would also highlight that because SPINRAZA has become the standard of care and is approved quite broadly in SMA, we need to think very carefully about how different therapies will be used in combination and in sequence across different SMA populations. So that in a nutshell is sort of highlighting the broad categories of things where we think that we can differentiate.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions. So, when you talk about building through business development, I'm just curious how much financial flexibility or buying power you believe you have with your current balance sheet, assuming you're taking \u2013 you're not doing as much in terms of share buybacks and stuff and focusing on BD? Thanks.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","So, we have an EBITDA that is in approximation of $6 billion, if you take 2016. And we anticipate that the maximum yield would likely be in the approximation of $10 billion to $12 billion, which is two times the EBITDA on a net debt basis. This is where we stand basically. But again, the driver will be value for the shareholders, and we'll be very disciplined in the way we spend our money, the shareholders' money actually.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Birchenough with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jim Birchenough - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for the detail on the call. Congrats on the results. Just on SPINRAZA, trying to get a better sense of the trajectory coming out of the second quarter. And there's some moving parts here. So I'm wondering if you can help us on what's the distribution right now between Type 1, 2 and 3 in patients treated. And when you think about the prevalence that's out there, when you eliminate the 60% who have spinal fusions, how many Type 2 patients are left to treat? Thanks.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","Thanks for the question. This is Michel. So basically the current status is approximately two-third of the patients treated in the U.S. geography represents Type 2 and Type 3 populations. And this is also the highest prevalent population today, okay? As Al said, over time the early onset will grow based on expected improved survival. So 60% we did not anticipate that a few months ago. So it shows that those patients are highly motivated and now we face the challenge of the more complicated patients for which the entire system is trying to overcome to secure that they can also improve on their disability. So it's actually very difficult for me where I stand to state what will be the expected penetration of the late onset patients at this stage.","Basically, the next few months will be very rich because they will inform us on the ability for the system to overcome those challenges. The Biogen team is, as you can tell, fully committed and engaged. They have done a spectacular work. They have not a sense of the strategy. They have the sense of the purpose and this is stronger than anything I have seen so far in my professional life. So to answer clearly your question, a few months and we'll be a bit more educated. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Salim Syed with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.","Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Hey. Congrats, guys, and thanks for all the color. Michel, I had a question on biosimilar since you've brought it up a couple times. It seems like you guys are excited about the business. So what are the pushes and pulls that are going into you actually exercising the option because I believe that expires next year if I'm not mistaken?","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","I think exercising the option makes sense. This is my position, okay. And this will give us a lot of optionality on what we do with this stake in a successful JV. As you can see, there is the launch of infliximab in the U.S. being announced today. So there are lot of good prospects for this JV that is engaged in also building a strong pipeline. And we're looking at that very closely so that we can see how we can eventually enrich our commercial footprint. We are very pleased with the success of this team, very focused, very nimble without basically losing the focus on MS as a priority and adding tremendous momentum to the top line but also profitable since Q3 last year.","So these are all positives and I will just cap it by saying that from a value proposition vis-\u00e0-vis the public payers in Europe, this is a tremendous add when we engage with payers because we come with new product launches and innovation and at the same time with significant savings opportunity mostly when you consider then the relevant market for the anti-TNF is approximately \u20ac9 billion in Europe. So we currently intend to opt in for the JV option and as you know, the option expires in 2018. But we don't lose our focus strategically and I will bring you back to what we said earlier in the call, the vision is to be the leader in neuroscience.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Peters with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Andrew Peters - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions and let me add my congrats as well. Just wanted to understand the $400 million comment a bit more. It seems like you're shifting SG&A to R&D and specifically to external opportunities. So just wanted to get your sense on how you think about taking on additional clinical risk when it could be less likely that any external programs that you may pursue likely haven't done the same degree of translational work that you outlined earlier on the call. So how do you think about kind of your biomarker-type driven approach to risk as it relates to external opportunities? Thanks.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","Thank you for a great question. So where do we stand? We did initiate the lean and simple a few months back when I took up the job. We are still looking at the opportunities. We have a long list of opportunities so this is to be more fit than what we are today. And we will need now, together with the executive team to prioritize what we do first. And as I communicated earlier, we believe we aspire to have a $400 million run rate in 2018. Well, we are mid-2017 so we still have some time in order to put that in place. Not much.","We are starting implementing this year, but I don't have granularity today on the respective impact on each line of the P&L, but certainly we will see key geographies commercially and R&D benefit in order to add to the momentum in the short midterm and the long term, and Mike will add some comments.","Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.","Yeah. Andrew, so just to address the question on clinical risk and biomarkers that you raised. Look, this is why our primary focus is on things with an early clinical development, the early clinical space. Not exclusively, but that's really the primary, so we're focusing on that. And look, I think that in the areas where we work, we often see opportunities where others might not. We often can develop capabilities and development that others don't have in that space. And that's why we think we do just have asymmetric ability, the more we are in the early clinical space.","Of course we're going to look beyond that, though, which there might be later programs, there might be earlier programs. A key element of this reinvestment though for that is the time element, so we're very conscious of the fact that to get to the growth that we're looking in the portfolio where our core skill set is in early clinical development means we need to be acting now to really be able to identify those opportunities and bring them in. I'll turn it to Al for some comments.","Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr., M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.","On the question about risk in neurology investment. I think the strategy that was outlined by Michel and Mike makes a lot of sense and it leverages not only our capabilities in terms of understanding of disease, but also platforms like the intrathecal ASO. So just as an example, we just take the movement disorder bucket, there are a lot of rare and orphan diseases. For example, the spinal cerebellar ataxias that are amenable we think to intrathecal ASO. They are genetically well-defined and the pathway could be very similar to the SPINRAZA pathway.","In the neuromuscular disorders, there's a ton of diseases that are rare and orphan diseases. Again, and many of those are due to spinal cord pathology which we know now is amenable to intrathecal ASO. So I think within those key strategic core areas that Mike talked about, there's a lot of opportunity and even for large diseases such as ALS or Parkinson's, you can divide them into genetically well-defined subsets and take the very same approach.","And I think using the ASO technology, we know that the antisense gets to large parts of the central nervous system, not just the spinal cord. We have data from nonhuman primates and from other places where we know that the ASOs can get all the way up into the brain into the cerebral cortex, so that opens up a whole array of opportunities. So yes, there's risk in neurology and I think it's important to think about that risk and to manage it, but I think there's also great opportunity, particularly when leveraging something like intrathecal ASOs.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","Thank you, Al. Mike.","Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.","Yeah, I'll just pick up on that a little bit more, Andrew, because I think you've sparked a lot of interest in commentary there. One thing that I've been very impressed by being here at Biogen is the fact, if you look at Biogen's historical probability of success from FIH to proof of concept in this space, it's roughly four times higher than that of industry benchmarks. So we have a demonstrated ability to actually change the probability of success equation in that space. And Al cited beautiful examples on this. We've seen this before. It was the PRIME study with aducanumab actually imaging patients and stratifying accordingly.","It's in the design capabilities, the smart type of design to have titration as part of the PRIME study to be able to inform how we conduct our Phase 3 trials and then responding and executing appropriately. Endpoint development, whether it was in the SPINRAZA program, it made a lot of difference. Or even as we've been envisioning the plans for the opicinumab program. These are the development of novel endpoints that are based on the fact that we have got differentiated expertise in the area.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","Thank you, Mike. Before we take the last question, I would like to refer to a press release issued yesterday. We have announced Alisha Alaimo that will be joining Biogen at some point of time soon. And we are very excited about this new hire, superb talent with great leadership. We did not yet finalize a date \u2013 the starting date, but we are working on that. And here in the room we have Jean-Paul Kress, who is leading the international market and I would like just to extend a welcome. Maybe, do you want to say a few words, Jean-Paul?","Jean-Paul Kress - Biogen, Inc.","Yes. Thanks, Michel, and good morning, everyone. First, I'd like to say how much I'm excited to join Biogen. I come from another company very much involved in MS as well. But I have to say that I've always been very impressed by Biogen's great rack record and leadership in MS and neurosciences. So it's a great pleasure and a great privilege to join the company at this time of renewed ambition.","Obviously too early for me to comment and we're still in early days and started like five weeks ago, currently assessing the business, getting a hand on our global commercial organization with a strong focus on strengthening our execution capabilities and reinforcing our MS leadership and launching SPINRAZA globally. So, very much looking forward to interacting with you in the future and provide you with an update on our commercial project.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","Thank you, Jean-Paul. We are relying on execution. So we have a last question.","Operator","Our final question comes from Brian Skorney with Robert Baird. Please go ahead.","Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys, and thanks for squeezing me in. I guess I was just wondering if you could give us some more details on the value-based contracts that you mentioned in MS, particularly, how much of the market these contracts currently represent and some idea of how the value winds up determining the price that you're getting revenue off of? Thanks.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for the question. We're extremely pleased that the team was able to foster value-based contract. I said earlier and I was challenged actually by saying but tell me how and it was not easy. The U.S. team has done a spectacular work. We spent time brainstorming on how we could bring the value of an entire portfolio to the customers and to the patient benefit and be in a position to shift the position that where the industry is perceived as being part of a transaction on a cost per product versus satisfaction, versus outcome, versus value, versus being part of the solution.","And the team has worked very hard and I did believe into that. I did put that in the scorecard of the organization because I believe that this is what the society deserves and this goes beyond financial measures. It's a matter of providing the value that what we stand for since the outset of the discovery and the clinical development and translating that into the way we operate.","So we were able to foster four of them and two types, one that basically gives the company responsibility for some of the discontinuation but the provider and the customer opens immediately to another dynamic in terms of engaging with a partner. And the other one on \u2013 the other one is on \u2013 I forgot, can you remind me the word?","Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.","The regional payers and so we've got payer and also Medicaid system.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","Yeah. One is on discontinuation and one is on relapse of MS. So I apologize, so relapse of MS and therefore for the entire portfolio at the end of the period we see the relapse of MS and then there is basically a higher discounts being provided in case. So these are regional customers. These are pilots. It's for us to try to learn and to measure the impact, bring real world evidence and measure how we move forward from there. It's not a financial objective at the outset, it is just changing the paradigm and being the leader and being more responsible. This is what the industry deserves.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you to everyone for attending today.

My name is Courtney and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Idec Fourth Quarter and Year End 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Carlo Tanzi, Director or Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Carlo Tanzi","Thank you, and welcome to Biogen Idec\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogenidec.com to find the press release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures that we\u2019ll discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in tables one and two. Table three includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call.","I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult our SEC filings for additional detail.","On today\u2019s call, I\u2019m joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. George Scangos; Dr. Doug Williams EVP of Research and Development Tony Kingsley, EVP of Global Commercial Operations; and our CFO, Paul Clancy.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to George.","George Scangos","Thanks Carlo. Good afternoon everyone thank you for joining us today. Sorry we had to move the call at the last minute, but as you can imagine things were little chaotic yesterday morning in Boston. I think we have optimally positioned it between the blizzard and the [indiscernible] discussions that will start [indiscernible]. So you guys have something to fill your, the void.","2014, I think, was a very successful year for Biogen Idec, we brought several new therapies to the market, we had encouraging data from some of the compounds in our pipeline and importantly we delivered 40% revenue growth and 54% non-GAAP EPS growth compared to 2013.","In 2014 we launched four new products in two distinct therapeutic areas, which I think is a real accomplishment for a company of our size.","TECFIDERA is in its second year on the market in the U.S. In 2014 we successfully launched TECFIDERA in the EU and are continuing to expand preference across the globe. TECFIDERA is now the most prescribed MS therapy in Germany and the most prescribed oral therapy in U.S. with more than a 135,000 people having been treated worldwide.","As you all know from the IMS data, TECFIDERA did experience moderating growth in Q4, which we believe is due to a variety of factors that Tony will discuss in more detail. However, we believe that TECFIDERA will continue to grow in the U.S. and it will grow substantially in international markets, so that we anticipate that 2015 will be another year of meaningful growth for TECFIDERA and for our portfolio of MS products in general.","PLEGRIDY was approved for the treatment of relapsing MS and launched in both the U.S. and EU in the second half of 2014. Although we are early in the launch, PLEGRIDY appears to be gaining rapid adoption. PLEGRIDY is an important part of our strategy to maintain our leadership position in the interferon segment of the MS market.","We also obtained approval and subsequently launched our hemophilia products in the U.S. in 2014. ALPROLIX for hemophilia B and ELOCTATE for hemophilia A. ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE represent the first meaningful innovations in the treatment of hemophilia in many years, and reflect our mission to help bring new therapies to patients who are underserved.","In our pipeline, we advanced several potential therapeutic options across a broad set of disease areas, along with our collaboration partner AbbVie, we reported positive results from the Phase 3 trial of ZINBRYTA for relapsing forms of MS, and expect to file for marketing authorization in the first half of the year. We believe ZINBRYTA has the potential to become another important treatment option to serve the diverse needs of MS patients.","Our collaboration partner ISIS advanced the spinal muscular atrophy program SMNrx to Phase 3 in both infant and childhood forms of the disease. In December, we announced positive top line results from our Phase 1b trail of BIIB037 in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, this data are early but we believe they\u2019re compelling and we are aggressively working to advance this program into Phase 3.","Earlier this month we announced Phase 2 results for our anti-LINGO antibody in acute optic neuritis. We believe that the data strongly suggest that our anti-LINGO antibody induced remyelination, and we\u2019re now focused on the data from the MS trial which we expect to have in early 2016.","Throughout 2014 we also continued to build our research and development capabilities, by hiring a number of highly accomplished researchers from both academia and industry, and I believe that we now have truly world-class capabilities across the breadth of R&D. That has been a goal for a number of years and is rewarding to have made such a significant progress this year. ","In 2000 - excuse me in 2014, we increased the number of promising assets in our pipeline through strategic acquisitions and collaborations with a number of partners including Sangamo, Eisai and most recently Convergence and San Raffaele Hospital. We also made significant progress and advancing our internally developed candidates into the clinic, including the BIIB061 and oral compound in Phase 1 development with the objective of enhancing remyelination.","Additionally, Phase 1 studies are ongoing for several novel formulations of dimethyl fumarate, the active ingredient of TECFIDERA, with the goal of achieving once-a-day dosing and potentially reducing side effects. We\u2019ve not yet analyzed the data from these trials, but our hope is to move one or more of these formulations forward towards approval. Our bio-similar joint venture Samsung Bioepis continues to make important progress toward our objective of becoming a leader in the development of bio-similar pharmaceuticals.","The EMEA recently accepted our application for approval of a bio-similar version of etanercept and we believe that we\u2019re making excellent progress on other bio-similar molecules as well. Through this JV, we intend to develop high quality bio-similar pharmaceutical, by utilizing our world-class protein engineering and biologics manufacturing capability. It\u2019s our belief that bio-similars will become increasingly important in the role of healthcare. And we believe that we\u2019re well positioned to contribute to this evolution. So all in all, it was a very busy and a very good year.","And with that, I\u2019ll now pass the call along to Doug.","Doug Williams","Thanks, George. Biogen Idec has a strong and increasingly diverse pipeline. I\u2019d like to discuss several of our ongoing programs and the progress we are anticipating during the upcoming year. Our Phase 3 study of TYSABRI and secondary progress of MS known as ASCEND, is fully enrolled. There\u2019s no effective therapies available today for this progressive and debilitating form of MS. ASCEND is a two-year placebo-controlled study in 890 patients that will determine whether or not TYSABRI has an impact on disability progression as measured by a novel composite end point.","The study is being conducted under a special protocol assessment with the FDA and we expect the data from ASCEND in the second half of 2015. We\u2019re also conducting ACTION, which is a Phase 2 study evaluating TYSABRI in acute ischemic stroke. In this study, we are examining if blocking the lymphocytic infiltration, known to occur in the brain following stroke, can reduce the extent of injury. ACTION is a placebo-controlled study in a 160 patients where brain imaging is used to measure the change in infarct volume compared to Baseline. ACTION is fully enrolled and we expect data later this year.","We previously discussed our positive top-line interim Phase 1b results for BIIB037 in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Additional BIIB037 study data will be presented at the upcoming ADPD meeting in March, the Phase 1b, BIIB037 study remains ongoing and our current plan is to initiate our Phase 3 program later this year. We also recently announced Phase 2 data from the anti-LINGO RENEW study in acute optic neuritis.","We hope to present full data for menu at the upcoming American Academy of Neurology Meeting in April. The second ongoing Phase 2 study evaluating Anti-LINGO in MS patients is fully enrolled and we anticipate obtaining results in 2016 as previously disclosed.","We continue to develop Neublastin as a novel biologic therapy for neuropathic pain. Our Phase 2 study in patients with painful lumbar radiculopathy will evaluate whether or not Neublastin has an impact on pain intensity scores. The study is now fully enrolled and results are anticipated in the second half of this year.","Enrollment on our STX-100 Phase 2a study in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis continues, and the study is currently enrolling the fourth and potentially final patient cohort. Through our collaboration with Eisai, we\u2019ve obtained co-development and co-commercialization rights to two Alzheimer\u2019s disease candidates, BAN2401, an anti-amyloid BETA monoclonal antibody and E2609 a small molecule BACE inhibitor. BAN2401 is enrolling patients in Phase 2 and Eisai has initiated a Phase 2 study with E2609 in patients with Prodromal AD and mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. We\u2019ve also made progress in strengthening our pipeline through business development. And earlier this month we announced our agreement to acquire Convergence, a leader in the development of therapeutics for neuropathic pain.","Convergence\u2019s lead program CNV1014802 is a small molecule inhibitor of the Nav 1.7 sodium channel, that\u2019s being developed for trigeminal neuralgia. Following completion of the acquisition, we expect to work expeditiously to advance CNV1014802 into registrational clinical programs. This morning, we announce the collaboration with San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, Italy, to develop gene therapy for both hemophilia A and hemophilia B. Our collaborators at San Raffaele are leaders in the use of Lentiviral Based gene therapy approaches. While this technology remains in early research, we believe gene therapy has the potential to provide lifelong benefits to patients with hemophilia.","We look forward to continuing to drive R&D progress during the year. I\u2019ll now pass the call to Tony.","Tony Kingsley","Thanks Doug. We launched four new products in 2014, and I\u2019m proud of the execution of the commercial organization. In 2014, we continue to grow our global MS market share, fueled by the continued rollout of TECFIDERA worldwide, improving performance from TYSABRI and continued strength for our interferon business, including the recent launch of PLEGRIDY.","Over the past six months, our data suggested our portfolio has consistently captured roughly half of all newly diagnosis patients and switch patients in the U.S. TECFIDERA continue to demonstrate strong performance, which we believe is a testament towards attractive product profile combining strong efficacy, favorable safety, and tolerability and the convenience of overall administration.","We believe TECFIDERA is on track to become the most prescribed therapy for MS worldwide. In the U.S. we saw continued growth through the fourth quarter with its market share near 20%. As you may have seen through IMS, we observed moderating new starts for TECFIDERA in the fourth quarter.","We believe several factors have impacted the recent performance of TECFIDERA including a decline in the overall market switch rate. The U.S. label update in December and the recent launch of PLEGRIDY, which is capturing some interferon switches that otherwise, may have gone to TECFIDERA. Importantly, we have not noticed a meaningful change in TECFIDERA discontinuation rates.","We are actively engaging physicians to ensure proper education on the label update and we believe in the continued growth potential of the product in the U.S. Out side of the U.S. we\u2019re continuing to see strong uptick in multiple launch markets matching or exceeding the pace that we\u2019ve seen in the U.S.","In November, we launched TECFIDERA with full reimbursement in the UK and as of January, we secured reimbursement in both Italy and Spain. We continue to expect to achieve full reimbursement across the other major European markets by the end of the year.","We believe that PLEGRIDY may become the interferon of choice based on its combination of efficacy of favorable safety profile and every two-week dosing with a convenient sub-Q autoinjector. To-date roughly half of PLEGRIDY prescriptions have come from AVONEX switches. The other half have come from other therapies and from newly diagnosed patients, which we believe is a positive message about the therapy\u2019s broad appeal. The rollout of PLEGRIDY is expected to continue across Europe in 2015 with launches in most of the major markets anticipated by the end of the year. TYSABRI continues to perform well as the therapy enjoyed its third consecutive quarter of positive net new patient adds, even as the oral therapies have continued to gain share. We believe that this performance is due to the high level of efficacy that TYSABRI provides to patients.","Turning to our hemophilia products, we continue to believe that reduced infusion frequency is the largest unmet need for the hemophilia community and that ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE meaningfully address this burden. We are encouraged by the strong up tick of ALPROLIX in the U.S. We believe its value proposition to patients has been relatively straightforward, as the majority of patients starting on ALPROLIX have been choosing the once weekly prophylactic dosing schedule.","ALPROLIX ended the year with its market share in the low teens with over 60% of hemophilia treatment centers prescribing the products. The U.S. launch of ELOCTATE has been preceding the plan ending the year with share in the mid-single digits with over 60% of hemophilia treatment centers prescribing after two quarters on the market. As we expected the hemophilia A market, has been more competitive than hemophilia B. Acquiring additional patients will require sustained educational and promotional efforts, but we believe we have the ability to execute on this strategy.","I will now pass the call to Paul.","Paul Clancy","Thanks, Tony. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.74 in the fourth quarter and $12.37 for the full year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $4.09 and $13.83 for the full year. Total revenue for the fourth quarter grew 34% to approximately $2.6 billion and grew 40% for the full year to $9.7 billion. Global fourth quarter TECFIDERA revenue was $916 million. We recorded revenues of $743 million in the U.S. and $173 million outside the U.S. TECFIDERA U.S. sales included 14 shipping weeks in the fourth quarter, this added approximately $50 million to U.S. sales.","Foreign exchange offset by hedging weakened TECFIDERA revenue by approximately $7 million for the quarter, versus the prior quarter. Our estimate is that we ended the quarter with approximately 2.5 weeks of inventory in the U.S. wholesale channel, a similar level to last quarter. For the full year world wide TECFIDERA revenues were $2.9 billion consisting of $2.4 billion in the U.S. and $483 million in sales outside the U.S.","Interferon revenues including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY were $777 million during the fourth quarter, which includes $528 million in the U.S. and $249 million in sales outside the U.S.","For the full year worldwide interferon revenue grew 2% to $3.1 billion consisting of $2 billion in the U.S. and $1.1 billion in sales outside the U.S. AVONEX U.S. sales included 14 shipping weeks in the fourth quarter, which added approximately $35 million of the U.S. sales. Foreign exchange offset by hedging weakened Q4 interferon revenue by approximately $9 million versus prior quarter.","TYSABRI worldwide revenue was $484 million in the fourth quarter these results were comprised of $266 million in the U.S. and $218 million internationally. TYSABRI U.S. sales included 13 shipping weeks in the fourth quarter versus 14 shipping weeks in Q3. Foreign exchange offset by hedging weakened TYSABRI revenue by approximately $9 million for Q4 versus Q3. For the full year, worldwide TYSABRI revenue was approximately $2 billion of which U.S. revenue was $1 billion and $934 million internationally.","Moving to hemophilia, ALPROLIX revenue in Q4 was $40 million and $76 million since being launched in May. ELOCTATE revenue in Q4 was $37 million and $58 million since being launched in July.","Turning to our anti-CD20 unconsolidated joint business, which includes RITUXAN and GAZYVA U.S. profit share, as well as the profit share on royalties on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. We recorded $305 million for Q4 and $1.2 billion for the full year. Royalties were $31 million for Q4, compared to $67 million in the prior quarter. Our royalty revenues from Angiomax ended on December 15 with the patent expiration. For the full year royalty revenues were $177 million.","Now, turning to the expense lines on non-GAAP P&L. Q4 non-GAAP cost of goods sold were $297 million or 11% of revenue. For the full year non-GAAP COGS were $1.2 billion or 12% of revenues. Q4 non-GAAP R&D expense was $409 million or 19% of revenue, which includes approximately $50 million in milestones and other payments related primarily to our JV with Samsung Bioepis and our recent collaboration with Google [x] Life Sciences.","For the full year non-GAAP R&D expense was $1.9 billion or 19% of revenue, an increase of 31% over 2013. Q4 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $573 million or 22% of revenue and the full year non-GAAP SG&A expense was $2.2 billion or 23% of revenue, an increase of 30% over 2013.","Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 24% for the fourth quarter, as we benefited form the reinstated R&D tax credit. Our full year tax rate was approximately 25%. During the quarter, we made a $200 million CVR payment to the former shareholders of Fumapharm. And in Q4 as part of our ongoing share stabilization plan, we repurchased 1.7 million shares for total of approximately $527 million.","Our weighted average diluted shares at the end of the year were $237 million and we ended the year with approximately $3.3 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately fifty-fifty between the U.S. and ex-U.S. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which again were $4.09 for the fourth quarter and $13.83 for the full year, representing a 54% year-over-year increase.","Let me turn to our full year 2015 guidance. In 2015, we plan to provide annual guidance and one update per year during our second quarter earnings. This modest change is intended to synchronize with our internal planning processes and ensure continued focus on the long-term.","Now starting with revenues, we expect revenue growth between 14% and 16%. Before I provide color on the products I\u2019d like to highlight three factors. First, our plan assumes exchange rates at the recent spot rate. Second, as a reminder, we expect a year-over-year decrease in royalty revenue of approximately $130 million as the royalties on ANGIOMAX sales have expired. And third, our plan assumes our one year free [ph] pricing in Germany for TECFIDERA will end this March and move to a lower price.","Now, let me characterize how we\u2019re thinking about each of our products. Our plan assumes TECFIDERA will represent the largest contributor to our overall revenue growth. In Europe, our plan assumes TECFIDERA will have full reimbursement in the majority of the EU market. For TYSABRI we believe the therapy will continue on a positive patient growth trajectory. We continue to be in discussions with IEPA to resolve the outstanding periods yet a settlement is not included in our 2015 guidance. We believe we\u2019re well positioned with PLEGRIDY within the interferon and combined with AVONEX our plan assumes, we\u2019ll continue to gain share within this declining segment.","For our MS therapies our plan assumes a constant number of shipping weeks of 13 for each of the four quarters in 2015. We believe ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE will continue to grow at a strong pace, as we continue to focus on expanding the depth and breadth of the therapies. Our 2015 plan assumes revenues related to RITUXAN and GAZYVA will grow modestly.","R&D expense is expected to be between 19% and 20% of sales, which includes approximately $250 million year mark for business development activity at similar level of spend when compared to 2014. SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 20% to 21% of revenue, as we are now through the commercial ramp of both TECFIDERA and hemophilia therapies we anticipate over 200 basis point improvement in SG&A year-over-year. We anticipate non-GAAP EPS results between $16.60 and $17 and GAAP EPS to be between $15.45 and $15.85.","From a cash perspective, we expect to pay over $1 billion in CVR payments to Fumapharm related to the sales of TECFIDERA. And we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $400 million to $450 million, an increase over 2014 as we invest in our manufacturing capabilities and IT infrastructure.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to George for his closing comments.","George Scangos","Thank you, Paul. Okay in closing, we had a very productive year. We gained regulatory data protection for TECFIDERA in the EU and subsequently launched in Europe. We launched PLEGRIDY in the U.S. and Europe and ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX in the U.S., as well as some other countries. We had a good year commercially and financially and we received positive results in some of the important compounds in our pipeline. We started out 2015 with the agreement to acquire Convergence and the collaboration with San Raffaele Hospital. And we expect to complete additional business development transactions during the year. We also expect to see pipeline readouts for several compounds.","In addition to the presentations of the data for BIIB037 Anti-LINGO antibody expected in March and April and the completion of the TYSABRI SPMS trial. We expect to see mid stage data for Neublastin in neuropathic pain and TYSABRI in stroke. So this will be another busy year with meaningful milestones, with aggressive goals and all aspects of the business and we\u2019ll continue to do our best to achieve them.","So in closing and as always I\u2019d like to thank our employees for a dedicated to making positive impact on patient lives, and the patients and physicians who are involved in our clinical development programs. The achievements we\u2019ve made together could not have been realized without their passion and commitment. I thank you all for joining us this afternoon. And operator, we\u2019ll now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen. Your line is open.","Eric Schmidt","Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great 2014. Maybe for Paul on the ex-U.S. TECFIDERA trajectory, it sounds like the drug is now number one in Germany and that you\u2019re quite optimistic for a lot of growth ex-U.S. in 2015, yet we think the numbers came in a little bit below consensus, you flagged this $7 million FX hit. But was there anything else on TECFIDERA that credit maybe a little bit of a weaker ex-U.S. sales number?","Paul Clancy","No, nothing meaningful ex-U.S., I mean we\u2019re actually very happy with how things are moving along ex-U.S. as you had noted. Our challenge to our organization is that every country that we get reimbursement and we do better than the [prior] [ph] we actually were able to better in terms of launch curve at time equal to zero in Germany than the United States, and we hope to do it as we kind of go to every other country, that\u2019s obviously an aspiration more than anything else, so nothing too meaningful in terms of the trends to point out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Porges","Thanks very much and congratulations on the results. I appreciate the detailed guidance. I just want to ask about BIIB037 still getting questions about that, and you provided some useful color, first out of the year, but could you just talk a little bit about specifically where you\u2019re going with the dose and I am thinking about the Phase 3 trials and discussions that you\u2019re having, when might you have those discussions with the FDA and when might be have a physician to sort of talk about what the trials look like, the scope and that sort of thing?","Doug Williams","Hi, Geoff, this is Doug. Thanks for the question. There is not a lot of additional color that I can provide to you vis-\u00e0-vis the final study design going into Phase 3. As you can imagine, we\u2019re in the process of having discussions with regulators. In fact, we\u2019ve been having them for some time as we\u2019ve been seeing the data emerge from the study. I think it\u2019s safe to say that our intent going forward will be to try to design a study that most faithfully reproduces the type of patient that we treated in the Phase 1b study, as well as looking at similar endpoints, as you know from a cognition perspective we achieve statistical significance on the CDR sum of boxes, which is a registrational endpoint. The base inhibitor for AstraZeneca and Lilly is actually using that as a Phase 3 endpoint in prodromal and mild patients.","So I think you can anticipate a Phase 3 program that will have similar patients entering the study, screened in a similar fashion upfront and the final study design we will talk about at the time we start enrolling patients, that\u2019s our usual practice. I don\u2019t see any reason to break profile for this particular molecule. ","With respect to the choice of dose, as you know the study is still underway, we still have a couple of cohorts that remain blinded and until we see that data, we won\u2019t be able finalize the exact dosing regimen except reiterating, what Al said at J.P. Morgan, which is we believe we have a dosing window that we can work with from both a safety perspective, but more importantly from what looks like a treatment effect perspective, as well.","So a lot more information at the ADPD meeting about the results that we\u2019ve been able to look at, but the study design issues are very much in process right now. And we\u2019ll let you know what those studies are going to look like at the time we enroll the fist patient.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Mark Schoenebaum","Hi, thank you very much. Just a follow-up on the Alzheimer\u2019s question, if I may, why did you guys choose not to use ADAS-Cog as a cognitive endpoint. And then the two cognitive endpoints that you did, look at mini mental, or the two endpoints, if you look at mini mental I believe sum of the boxes. Doug, there\u2019s been this debate on WallStreet regarding Lilly as to clinical significance versus statistical significance, I\u2019d love to get your view of what would constitute a clinically significant benefit in the mini-mental and the sum of the boxes. Thanks a lot.","Doug Williams","Okay. So we choose not to use ADAS-Cog because I think it\u2019s now the view of the field that that\u2019s probably a better tool to use for patients who are further down the disease spectrum. That CDR is I think now becoming much more accepted as a preferred primary end point for studies that focus on patients with Prodromal and mild disease. That seems to be the pattern that\u2019s emerging. If you look at what the primary end points for studies in those cohorts of patients, actually are using with the Lilly study being just an example of that. The issue of what constitutes clinical significance is one that obviously is something that we\u2019ll be discussing with regulators. Our view based on our decision to go right from Phase 1B to Phase 3 is that we believe we\u2019ve seen a treatment effect that is significant enough and our advisors believe this to be the case to meet the criteria in most people\u2019s minds for clinical significance and not just statistical significance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Terence Flynn","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Two part one for me. Just in terms of your guidance on the Interferon franchise, Paul, just wondering you mentioned you expect to take share in a declining market, which we\u2019ve heard similar commentary from you guys in the past, but do you actually think that can be a growth franchise for you this year. And then the second part of that is just implications of the entry of Daclizumab and longer-term Ocrelizumab and impact on your injectable franchise? Thank you.","Paul Clancy","Yes, I think we\u2019ll probably end up tag teaming this one a little bit Terence. I think it\u2019s being growth is probably a little bit of a stretch. So I mean I think the reason we\u2019ve been a little bit cautious on kind of phrasing it up that way is this - obviously an interplay of how fast orals move along which effects Interferon, which so and if orals don\u2019t move along as fast I think the Interferon franchise will hang in there. It\u2019s not unheard of. It\u2019s just - I think it\u2019s early days right now, but over \u2013 look, conceptually we do believe there\u2019s something special about PLEGRIDY and that once every two weeks subcu is so much more favorable than any of the other Interferons and potentially COPAXONE as well. So we\u2019ll have to see whether or not that turns into the combination of AVONEX and PLEGRIDY growing. But we\u2019re hoping at a minimum it hangs in there.","Tony Kingsley","Terence, it\u2019s Tony. Let me hit dac first, look we think dac is a very good compound and it certainly as a place in the market. I'm not sure I would think of it - look we don\u2019t have the label yet, so there is some things that we don\u2019t know. It wouldn\u2019t necessarily think of it as an injectable in the sense of the platform therapy as we think of them today in that it has - it appears to have a different efficacy profile, so it may play in some broader segments than the existing platform therapies do.","In terms of ocrelizumab again we have to wait and see, there is - we hear interest in the market as I am sure you do from physicians that it looks like it could be an interesting, very much in the high efficacy segment, but we\u2019ll have to wait and see how that product plays out and where it fits versus TYSABRI and some of the other alternatives.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Ravi Mehrotra","Hi, thanks for taking my question and I apologize up front where we\u2019re going to ask you to do our job one level. On TECFIDERA looking at long-term consensus numbers, I know these numbers are no easy, looks like the average 20-20 estimates around $9 billion implying a global market share of around 40% interested in your view on whether you\u2019re seeing the streak may have got ahead of itself here or if you think that TECFIDERA is likely to get to those levels of market share?","Doug Williams","Gosh, Ravi, I mean, we don\u2019t give long-term guidance out there and so I think we\u2019re going to kind of stay at that as it is, and let people come to their same conclusions. We think there\u2019s still a very meaningful growth with TECFIDERA that\u2019s embedded in the guidance for this year, but I wouldn\u2019t want to kind of really comments on the bunch of models over a long period of time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Cory Kasimov","Hi, good afternoon thanks for taking my question. In your prepared remarks, you alluded to the ongoing Phase 1 studies for several novel forms of MMF and, I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s anything you can say about how these molecules differ from TECFIDERA and when you maybe in a position to provide some data on that? Thanks.","Doug Williams","Let me be clear. We\u2019re not testing formulations of MMF we\u2019re testing formulations of DMF, which is the active ingredient of TECFIDERA. And DMF is DMF, but the formulations are different and look the intent is to get through once-a-day formulation, potentially reduce the GI side effects. So we\u2019ll - we have several formulations in Phase 1 now we have others behind those and we\u2019re hopeful to be able to bring forward one of them to the market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi. Your line is open.","Yaron Werber","Great, thanks for taking my question. So I have a question of, Tony if you don\u2019t mind sort of two of them. One is we\u2019ve been doing a lot of work on biosimilars and we\u2019re trying to figure out your view of what happens to the ABCR class, when Copaxone goes generic, so what would happen let\u2019s say to the interferon class? And then secondly, you mentioned, there is three different reasons TECFIDERA was weaker, it was - or weaker or slowing down in terms of new patient adds, there was a decline in switching U.S. label change and a PLEGRIDY launch. Of the three, which one was the most important? Thank you.","George Scangos","Good, good, two part of question your own. So let me\u2026","Tony Kingsley","You move into the fact of...","George Scangos","Look, Copaxone, I think we\u2019ve been consistent on that. We think U.S. private payer market, the impact of a generic Copaxone is largely unbranded Copaxone. It\u2019s difficult for payers to see or certainly to convince physicians if there is therapeutic substitutability between [indiscernible] and the interferon. So I think that\u2019s where we are on that. And that\u2019s pretty consistent with what we said in the past. On TECFIDERA, look actually you hardened the piece apart, probably the Paul said, we expect the product to grow, but we would see some moderation in growth next year. I think we what is said that in any case for the first reason, which is the switch rate in the market in the U.S. has come down over the last three or four quarters. We\u2019ve talked about that I think again pretty consistently. When TECFIDERA launched in the U.S., and we\u2019re seeing this repeat outside the U.S. It doubled or tripled the switch rate for proto time and that\u2019s been working its way down over time.","Yaron Werber","One other thing I\u2019d add to it. We\u2019ve always said in the past that over time, we think IMS the data that you all see is pretty accurate. It\u2019s actually been accurate on a short-term basis as well. So I think you can kind of look at the trends of the IMS scripts kind of in the Q3 and Q4 and you can kind of interpret things, PLEGRIDY launched effectively in the first week of November and you can kind of discern a little bit. I think at the end of the day, you look at and say a lot of these things all happen at the same time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Your line is open.","Geoff Meacham","Good afternoon guys, thanks for taking the question. I just had one on LINGO. I know you guys, obviously, just got the data this month, but when you look beyond AN, will there be much more data internally or over four year publicly released MS data. I guess I am just trying to get us feel for what you\u2019re ultimately be looking for in Phase III effect size wise. And what you can in fact address this year with regulators before you start a formal pivotal in MS. Thanks.","Doug Williams","Hi, Jeff, this is Doug. I think there is not a lot of additional data from the acute optic neuritis study that we\u2019re going to see I think you\u2019ll see the majority of the data as much as we can cram into 115 minute platform presentation or at least I hope it\u2019s a platform presentation at AAN. It\u2019s likely that there will be some additional data cuts that we will sort of trickle out at subsequent medical meetings, but I think you get a clear sense of what we\u2019ve seen in that data where the acute optic neuritis at AAN. The MS study as we talked about in a previous earnings call that study is ongoing, it is fully enrolled now. Our intent is to actually have a small group of us internally, see some of that data at the 12-month time point later this year, which we will use as a basis to begin to have some of those discussions with regulators.","So I think that what we\u2019re able to see in that data will teach us a lot about which of the various end points where measuring in that study, actually show the best correlation with remyelination. As you know, this is the first of its kind study where we are assessing the impact of remyelination on patients with MS. And so we\u2019re looking at a variety of end points everything from EDSS to cognition to certainly ambulatory parameters. We have a number of imaging end points built into the study. And from that analysis, we hope to be able to piece out what the most sensitive clinical measures of remyelination are, so that we can go to regulators and start discussing what a Phase 3 end point might actually look like.","So as we said in the previous call, there will be a small group of us that will see that data and that will allow us to determine how to have a conversation with regulators. We plan to keep the study blinded through to the full 18-month time point, which means that full data disclosure won't come until sometime in 2016 for the full data set. So that that\u2019s what you can anticipate playing out over the course of the next 12 to 18 months.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Brian Abrahams","Thanks for taking my question. A question for Tony, you mentioned one of the causes for the TECFIDERA slowdown recently, has been the label change, but interestingly you\u2019re not seeing any increase in discontinuations, which I guess you\u2019d presumably get with more aggressive lymphocyte monitoring. So I'm curious what are you seeing in terms of physician reactions to the PML case that might be slowing uptake? And what sorts of educational initiatives do you think will be needed to help physicians work around this?","Tony Kingsley","Thanks, good question. I think the educational initiatives are underway, which is we have our sales forces out, talking new broad set of physicians, our medical team is providing support where there are request. So I think we are executing it and educating people to the label and what the label says and answering those questions. A part of the impact when you\u2019ve something like this is the time that takes to get, you can get to a small set of physicians quickly, and you tend to get to the KOLs quickly, it\u2019s the time to get to the broader community base. So we think we have the right education in place. We have to keep executing and making sure that that continuously happen.","Look the lack of meaningful change that we see or we believe we\u2019re seeing in the discount rate is encouraging because it doesn\u2019t suggest there is such a change in the profile that people are anxious to pull patients off on the country. Look I think naturally in a case like this is people are processing the new label. You\u2019ll see softness in the switch rate for a period of time and that is probably what accounts for.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Matthew Harrison","Great, thanks for taking the question. Just on BIIB037, so first can you just clarify, earlier you mentioned, only mentioned CDR Sum of boxes is - significant cognition end point. Was it just that or it was that an MMSc? And then should we expect to see or what should we expect to see in the abstract, will there be any significant data there, or is it mostly a placeholder? Thanks.","George Scangos","Well, with respect to the statistical significance, we did achieve that with both the CDR Sum of boxes and with the MMSc. So I believe we did clarify that at the JPMorgan meetings in January. And with respect to what\u2019s in the abstract, I haven\u2019t actually seen it myself. So I can\u2019t answer the question. I think there won\u2019t be enough to satisfy you in the abstract anyways. So I think the real answer to the question is going to come out of the presentation itself because there will be a lot more information there than there will be in the abstract.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Ying Huang","Thanks for taking my question as well. So maybe a housekeeping question for Paul. You mentioned that IMS data in the short term was pretty accurate, but it seems you guys did a better job in several drug in the U.S. for TECFIDERA. So I was wondering can you quantify where it was I guess short. And then can you quantify also the exact inventory level, I know its 2.5 weeks from Q3 to Q4. And then just curious your view also on the outcome is, I guess [indiscernible]. It seems that you guys don\u2019t feel very strong about the MS product. Thanks.","Paul Clancy","Thanks Huang. Yes, I am not sure what question is on the clarification for MS, I think you\u2019re referring to something outside the U.S. and we\u2019ve really don\u2019t have a clear picture outside the United States. So IMS what I was referring is within the United States and just on a more of a week-to-week basis. We kind of see it as pretty accurate vis-\u00e0-vis our data that we have from SPTs going to patients.","Ying Huang","Okay.","Doug Williams","And I think with respect to the MMF prodrug situation, I think there are certainly two programs that are in the clinic at the moment that we\u2019re aware of that are moving along, still very early. I think George pointed out the distinction between DMF and MMF and we think that\u2019s an important distinction because it\u2019s quite clear from a number of studies that we\u2019ve carried out that the biologic response at least in pre-clinical settings to MMF is distinct from DMF. And so, it remains to be proven that the ability to replicate the safety and efficacy profile that we see with TECFIDERA, which is DMF can in fact be replicated with these MMF prodrugs. So I think that\u2019s - what the hurdle is for those programs moving forward and it\u2019s still far too early I think to access how successful those are going to be.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Michael Yee","Thanks. A follow-up question on BIIB037, there has been recent phase to readouts, I guess most recently with Lilly, and we\u2019ve all seen a 34% improvement and cognition there. It has carvedilol [ph] MMSE. So can you help us to frame that data with why you\u2019re suggest up with your data, but I guess also when we see your presentation, how much information will we get, I know there is more information than - a more follow up beyond just the interim, so help us to understand what we\u2019re seeing there.","Doug Williams","Well, I think, with respect to our data, which is what I\u2019ll focus the answer to the question on. I think what you\u2019ll see I think is the actual numbers behind the statements that we made. There is a clear dose and time dependent reduction in beta-amyloid levels that we\u2019ve seen in these patients. There is a dose dependent and statistically significant impact on cognition as measured by two parameters, both CDR sum of boxes as well as the MMSE endpoint. And what you\u2019ll also see I believe is data to support the notion that we put forward that we believe we have a safety window to work with vis-\u00e0-vis the area that we have seen with our molecule. That\u2019s also been seen with some of the other anti-beta amyloid antibody.","So I think that the data that we\u2019ve seen, the data we\u2019ve talked about at least in verbal form is compelling enough and consistent enough for us to want to move the program as rapidly as we can from Phase 1B into Phase 3. And I think that you\u2019ll hopefully get a clear sense of the treatment effect that we\u2019ve seen and the consistency of the results across the various parameters we measure. It was enough to convince us to make the lead from 1B right into Phase 3.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Robyn Karnauskas","Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I guess I\u2019ll ask a hemophilia question, one really hasn\u2019t come up. So you just talked a little bit about its being competitive in the factory base. Help us to think about like what you\u2019re doing to maybe increase switching and should we just expect even in the steady growth of that product or could there be an acceleration in the back of the year after maybe you change some of the marketing or anything like that? Thanks.","George Scangos","Good. Robyn as Tony said if I look back to before we launched both the products, I think we both said, we couldn\u2019t predict the launch curve that well, but we go with even and steady might be was ALPROLIX got off to a faster start because it\u2019s a very straightforward proposition for physicians. For patients you have a pretty friendly group of patients in the fampridine market and there\u2019s zero competitor responsible. We\u2019ve said that we think the ELOCTATE in fact really is going two plan as we\u2019ve expected to which is you have to take captures and early adaptors, you have to have - those patients have good experience, so that they can - it\u2019s a big market they can activate other people.","So we\u2019re continuing to execute on patient education, but a lot of it is calling on the hemophilia treatment centers explaining - the label explaining the data talking to both nurses and physicians. So I think it\u2019s pretty consistent with the way we\u2019ve talked about it historically. It takes a lot of good hard execution, but we like the product profile. We think over time you build that virtue a cycle of - patients have good experience, physicians have good experience and you get increased adoption over time. So I think we\u2019re on a steady march - try to convert that market and I think we have a good product and good ability to do that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Roden with UBS. Your line is open.","Matthew Roden","Great, thanks very much for taking the question. I hope you guys are all dug out from all the snow.","George Scangos","A little soon...","Matthew Roden","Yes. So Doug, you mentioned in Alzheimer\u2019s staying faithful to the patient population as you move forward, so that prompted me the wonder whether or not they start seeing improvement in cognition style [ph] was in the Prodromal patients or the early AD patients are both, and also whether or not the statistic was on a intent-to-treat basis. Thank you.","Doug Williams","Yes, with respect to the study itself again I keep pointing you in the direction of the presentation. I don\u2019t want to disclose any additional information about the study itself beyond what we\u2019ve talked about so far. And again with respect to the design of Phase 3, we\u2019ll be trying to faithfully replicate the population of patients that we treated in the Phase 1b study and the Phase 3. So it will be a Prodromal and mild population of patients. I think you can anticipate that we will do a similar of type of entry screening to what we did in Phase 1b to confirm that the patients actually have the target for the drug as a pre requisite to enrolling them into the study, and beyond that I\u2019ll just stay silent until we present the actual dataset in March.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Wei with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Thomas Wei","Thanks, just a follow-up on BIIB037. Just from whatever work you\u2019ve done or when you look at the overall literature, do you think you believe that the BETA amyloid pieces could lead to improvements in cognition or are really just looking for slowing or stabilization of cognitive decline?","Alfred Sandrock","It\u2019s a really good question. I think we don\u2019t actually know the answer to that question. It\u2019s testable, if in fact you have an agent that both removes amyloid and does in fact, show improvements in cognition, at least the rate of the decline versus the control population. And my bias and my guests is that what we\u2019re looking at is something a kin to disease modification with DMT\u2019s and MS, which is a hopefully a major slowing in the decline of these patients overtime. Whether in fact we can treat them and reverse some of the damage that\u2019s been done. I think is an unknown at this point, but obliviously the long-term follow-up studies would be designed to try to answer those sorts of questions over a longer duration of treatment than what we\u2019re likely to do in the Phase 3 program. So I think the hope is there, but at the moment, I think it\u2019s a hope.","George Scangos","Tom, this is George. It\u2019s a question that we also I think is a very important. Look we\u2019ve one year data on patients and it\u2019s a long-term disease. And so we just on have enough data yet to answer that question. I think when you see the data that we present in March we can have a more, let\u2019s say intelligent discussion about that topic. But it\u2019s hard to see anything meaningful in the absence of the data.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Josh Schimmer","Thanks for taking the question I'm going to ask the Gene Therapy Consortium, is the hemophilia program going to be first experience of an in vivo, use of antivirus and what gives you confidence in the safety and efficacy of this approach? Thanks.","Doug Williams","The question is with respect to the gene therapy. Josh can you just repeat the question, you were breaking up.","George Scangos","Yes, you\u2019re breaking up there.","Josh Schimmer","I\u2019m sorry, so I was just wondering is this the first experience with in vivo introducing antivirus to support purpose of gene therapy and what gives you the confidence that the in vivo approach will be both safe and efficacious.","Doug Williams","Yes, Josh, this is Doug. I think the deal we announced today is in fact using lentiviral in a systemic delivery mode. It\u2019s still a very early program, but one that we have looked at and one for which we\u2019re excited to be working with Luigi Naldini, who is one of the leaders in this area. It\u2019s an early program he\u2019s got intriguing data at the moment using a vector system that they have designed, there\u2019s still a number of technical hurdles to overcome with this. But it does direct expression into the liver and one of the advantages with lentiviral vectors is that, number one, you obviate some of the issues that you have with AAV vectors, which involved pre-existing immunity to the vector system itself. And it\u2019s also a very long-term expression that you\u2019re capable of getting with that vector system. So Luigi is one of the pioneers in this area, we think that if we can make this a successful approach that it really is a transformational approach from a gene therapy perspective given how broadly you could treat patients with both factor VIII and factor IX deficiency. So still pre-clinical, but I think very much with transformational type of therapy if we can bring it forward and make it work.","Carlo Tanzi","Operator, we\u2019ll take one more question.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Joseph Schwartz with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.","Joseph Schwartz","Thanks very much for fitting me in. You\u2019ve been using some innovative patient screening methodologies in the Phase 1b for BIIB037 such as automating PET amyloid quantification and focusing on certain regions of the brand. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about these tools in terms of how they could influence who will be eligible for receiving the drug. If it comes to market, are you planning to develop a companion diagnostic to can it be commercialized along side BIIB037?","Tony Kingsley","Well, at the moment what we are using is an agent that is in fact already licensed and available in the market. It\u2019s AV-45 as a screening tool for patients coming into the study. We thought that that was an important way of screening patients upfront to confirm that in particular patients with mild cognitive impairment. There are many reasons why that could happen, amyloid-beta deposition being just one of them. So confirming that the patients actually have the target for our drug upfront, we believe it was an important way of enriching the population of potential responders.","And as we carried out the study, I think that was confirmed because our screen failure rate was probably on the order of 30% to 40%, meaning that even though these patients had cognitive impairment, it didn\u2019t actually have BETA amyloid deposition at a level that was detectable with the screening reagents. So they were eliminated from the study, they could arguably never have responded to our drug anyways. So we needed to actually get them out of the study upfront. How this plays out with respect to the eventual labeling of the drug? My guess is that it will become standard practice to actually screen patients with early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s with either AV-45, which is available or something a kin to that and a kin to that, I mean there are CSF levels of a beta that can be looked at as well.","Someway of screening patients upfront to confirm that their disease, their cognitive impairment is caused by BETA amyloid deposition, I think, will become part of the treatment paradigm. So whether it\u2019s a bio assay based on CSF or whether it\u2019s an imaging approach like we\u2019ve used, I do believe that that will be an essential part of the treatment paradigm going forward, to confirm that these drugs are being used in the right patients.","George Scangos","Okay. So with that I think we\u2019ll bring the call to an end. So thank you all for your flexibility and being with us this afternoon. And thanks for all your interest and we can all get back to work.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."],"3643":["Biogen Inc.

My name is Carmen, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Financial Results and Business Update. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Joe Mara, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.","Joe Mara","Good morning, and welcome to Biogen's fourth quarter 2019 earnings call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of the biogen.com to find the earnings release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2, and Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted our slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call.","I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail.","On today's call, I am joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Michel Vounatsos; Dr. Al Sandrock, EVP, Research and Development; and our CFO, Jeff Capello. Now, I will turn the call over to Michel.","Michel Vounatsos","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, let me start with some financial highlights. Biogen closed 2019 with quarterly revenues of $3.7 billion, an increase of 4% compared to the same period a year ago. For the full year 2019, Biogen generated $14.4 billion in revenues, representing growth of 7% year-over-year.","Full year 2019 GAAP earnings were $31.42 a share, a 46% increase versus full year 2018. Full year 2019 non-GAAP earnings were $33.57 a share, a 28% increase versus full year 2018. We are pleased with the strong year-over-year growth, as we continue to execute on our strategy for long-term leadership in neuroscience.","Now, let me review the year. First, full year MS revenue, including OCREVUS royalties, were $9.2 billion, an increase of 2% versus the prior year. The number of patients on our MS products globally increased 3% versus the prior year, driven by strong patients growth in emerging markets, as well as all of the large mature European markets, and our business demonstrated resilience in the US. Our team has executed well, demonstrating our ability to compete in an increasingly crowded market. We launched VUMERITY in the US as an important new oral treatment option. It remains early in the launch, but so far, we are pleased with the level of interest from patients and physicians.","Second, SPINRAZA generated full year global revenues of $2.1 billion, a 22% increase versus the prior year. This blockbuster performance was driven by strong year-over-year revenue growth in the US and even greater revenue growth outside the US. Including the expanded access program and clinical trials, over 10,000 patients are now being treated with SPINRAZA.","Third, full year biosimilars revenue was $738 million, which represents 35% growth year-over-year, driven primarily by IMRALDI. We estimate that our biosimilars generated approximately EUR1.8 billion of savings to the European healthcare systems in 2019, which we expect will continue to increase in 2020. This is critical as we work to create financial headroom for innovation and contribute to the long-term sustainability of the healthcare system.","We also bolstered our biosimilars business this quarter with a new transaction with Samsung Bioepis. This provides us access to two new potential biosimilars in ophthalmology with a significant market opportunity in major markets worldwide, including, for the first time, in the US, as well as commercialization rights to our anti-TNFs biosimilars in China.","Fourth, this was an historic year for R&D organization. We are inspired by what the positive implications of the aducanumab data may mean for patients, physicians and the broader scientific community, who have been waiting decades for a therapy that can reduce the clinical decline of Alzheimer's disease. We are actively engaging with the FDA as well as regulators in Europe and Japan, and we look forward to completing a regulatory filing in the US as soon as possible. In addition, there has been important progress related to the re-dosing study, as we have successfully submitted the protocol to the FDA, and we are currently working with the sites and ethics committees towards study initiation.","Fifth, beyond aducanumab, we continue to expand and progress our pipeline with approval for VUMERITY in the US, a positive data readout for BIIB059 in lupus, and adding seven new clinical program in MS, ALS, Parkinson's disease, ophthalmology and brain contusion. 2019 was one of our most productive years in R&D, and we believe we have multiple opportunities for near-term value creation, as we prepare for multiple potential launches in the early 2020.","Sixth, our cash flow generation remains strong and continue to provide us with significant optionality and flexibility to allocate capital. In 2019, we generated approximately $7.1 billion in cash flow from operations, an increase of approximately 14% versus the prior year. Throughout the year, we repurchased approximately 24 million shares for a total value of approximately $5.9 billion. As we have stated previously, we view share repurchase as an important element of thoughtful and value-creating capital allocation. At the same time, we have the financial flexibility and capacity to continue to evaluate potential external business development and M&A opportunities. Over the past three [ph] years, we have executed 15 business development transactions, which have contributed to the significant expansion of our pipeline. We executed four deals over the past three months alone, including our proposed transaction with Pfizer for a potential symptomatic therapy with potential application in both Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.","As we have demonstrated in the past, we are committed to maximizing returns to our shareholders, while continuing to bring innovative therapies to patients, something that demands a thoughtful approach towards all our investment over both the short and the long term.","In summary, 2019 was a very productive and successful year for Biogen as we executed on our strategy and continued to deliver noticeable progress. Our core MS business continued to demonstrate resilience with growth in both patients and revenues, and we are excited to be launching VUMERITY. SPINRAZA continued to grow in the US and even more so outside of the US, as we continue to expand into new geographies. With over 10,000 patients on therapy and the largest body of clinical data in SMA, SPINRAZA remains a foundation of care in SMA.","We grew our biosimilars business, and we expanded our portfolio and geographic presence. We are preparing to lead in the fight against Alzheimer's disease as we plan for a US filing for aducanumab. Beyond aducanumab, we expanded and progressed our pipeline with seven new clinical programs and a positive data readout in lupus. And we generated ample cash flow as we focus on strategically allocating capital to maximize shareholder return over the long term.","I will now turn the call over to Al for a more detailed update on our recent progress in R&D.","Alfred Sandrock, Jr.","Thank you, Michel, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I would like to welcome back Dr. Maha Radhakrishnan as the new Chief Medical Officer at Biogen. Maha brings more than 16 years of experience across multiple geographies in a broad range of therapeutic areas. She previously worked with us here at Biogen as Vice President, Europe and Canada Medical, and Vice President, US Medical, and subsequently held senior positions in medical affairs at Bioverativ and Sanofi. Maha's extensive background will be crucial as we prepare for future pipeline launches, including the potential launch of aducanumab.","As Michel discussed, 2019 was a historic year for Biogen. In addition to announcing positive results on aducanumab, we made significant progress on building a multi-franchise portfolio by receiving approval for VUMERITY, adding seven clinical programs and advancing two programs to Phase III. Reflecting our modality-agnostic approach, our neuroscience pipeline now includes small molecules, antibodies, other advanced biologics, antisense oligonucleotides and gene therapy.","Let me now turn to the advances we made in the fourth quarter, starting with Alzheimer's disease and dementia. At the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease, or CTAD, annual meeting held last month in San Diego, we presented top line results from the Phase III studies of aducanumab in early Alzheimer's disease. Final analysis of these data showed that EMERGE was a positive study with a high dose regimen of aducanumab achieving statistical significance on both the pre-specified primary endpoint of CDR Sum of Boxes, as well as on all three pre-specified secondary endpoints.","On the other hand, data from the ENGAGE study did not meet the primary endpoint, although we do believe that data from patients who achieved sufficient exposure to high dose aducanumab in ENGAGE support the findings of EMERGE. Please note that we do not expect to present additional data on aducanumab prior to a regulatory decision by the FDA.","As Michel said, with the support of the FDA, we are working to initiate the open-label Aducanumab re-dosing study as soon as possible. We have successfully submitted the protocol to the FDA, and we are currently working with the sites and ethics committees towards study initiation. In this study, eligible patients previously enrolled in our clinical studies, including patients previously treated with either aducanumab or placebo, will be titrated to 10 milligrams per kilogram aducanumab infusions every four weeks.","In addition to aducanumab, we continue to advance a broad Alzheimer's disease portfolio, including the Phase III study of BAN2401; BIIB080, a tau-targeted antisense oligonucleotide in Phase I; BIIB076, an anti-tau antibody in Phase I; and gosuranemab, a distinct anti-tau antibody in Phase II for which we expect data next year.","As we continue to develop our Alzheimer's portfolio, we aim to expand into even earlier patient populations to potentially prevent the clinical onset of the disease. To that end, our collaboration partner Eisai, along with the Alzheimer's Clinical Trials Consortium, plans to initiate the AHEAD 345 [ph]. AHEAD 345 is comprised of two studies termed A3 and A45. The A3 study will evaluate low-dose BAN2401 versus placebo in cognitively normal individuals who are currently below the threshold for amyloid positivity but are at high risk for further amyloid accumulation. The A45 study will evaluate high-dose BAN2401 versus placebo in individuals who are amyloid positive but show little to no cognitive impairment. Together, these studies will evaluate whether administration of BAN2401 can slow amyloid accumulation or cognitive decline in the very early stages of Alzheimer's disease.","Turning to MS and neuroimmunology, this quarter, we were pleased to announce that VUMERITY, a novel oral fumarate, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS. Detailed results from the Phase II EVOLVE-MS-2 study, which directly compared patient-reported GI tolerability of VUMERITY and TECFIDERA, were presented at the annual meeting of the European Charcot Foundation in November and published in the journal, CNS Drugs, earlier this month.","Specifically, on the primary endpoint, these data showed that patients treated with VUMERITY self-reported 46% fewer days with intensity scores of at least 2 on the Individual","Gastrointestinal Symptom and Impact Scale compared to TECFIDERA. This result was highly statistically significant with a p-value of 0.0003. Consistent with these data, the proportionate patients who discontinued the study due to GI adverse events was 0.8% for VUMERITY and 4.8% for TECFIDERA. Together, these data indicate that VUMERITY offers a clinically meaningful improvement in GI tolerability compared with TECFIDERA.","Across our MS portfolio, we continue to advance BIIB091, an oral BTK inhibitor in Phase I; BIIB061, an oral remyelinating agent in Phase I; and opicinumab, a Phase II anti-LINGO antibody for which we expect data in the middle of this year.","Moving to our progress in immunology, there remains a tremendous unmet medical need for people living with lupus, including both cutaneous and systemic forms. Treatment options for lupus are limited, and new medicines are needed to manage this difficult-to-treat and chronic disease. Our work in lupus builds on a long history that Biogen has in immunology, including both home-grown assets and collaborations.","We were very excited to report positive data this quarter from the Phase II LILAC study of BIIB059, a potential first-in-class anti-BDCA2 antibody discovered and developed by Biogen, in two forms of lupus that affect a total of approximately 800,000 individuals in the G7. This two-part study evaluated BIIB059 versus placebo in individuals with active cutaneous lupus","Erythematosus, or CLE, with or without systemic manifestations, and in individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus, or SLE, with active joint and skin manifestations. With a p-value of less than 0.001, the CLE part of the study met its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant response of BIIB059 on the percentage change from baseline in the CLASI-A score at week 16. The SLE part of the study also met its primary endpoint of reducing disease activity as measured by change from baseline in the total number of tender or swollen joints at week 24.","In this study, patients treated with 450 milligrams of BIIB059 experienced a statistically significant reduction of 3.4 total active joint counts compared to placebo. In addition, improvements in skin disease and overall disease activity were consistently observed across multiple secondary endpoints. The safety and tolerability of BIIB059 support its continued development, and we are planning to move forward to Phase III.","We believe that the BIIB059 program exemplifies important elements of our broader approach to R&D at Biogen. For example, by implementing biomarkers of target engagement and a measure of clinical efficacy early in clinical development, we were able to generate compelling proof of biology data and preliminary proof of concept data in Phase I, which were subsequently confirmed in a well-controlled Phase II study. We believe that such de-risking strategies may serve to increase the probability of success of other programs across our portfolio.","In neuromuscular disorders, last month, at the International Symposium on ALS\/Motor Neuron Disease, Biogen, Ionis Pharmaceuticals and our collaborators were awarded the Healey Center International Prize for Innovation in ALS. Presented by the ALS Center at Massachusetts General Hospital, this award recognized our contributions to the discovery and development of tofersen, our antisense oligonucleotide for SOD1 ALS. At this meeting, we were pleased to present the final data from the Phase I\/II study of tofersen, which demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in CSF SOD1 protein levels and trends towards slowing of clinical decline as assessed by three independent measures compared to placebo.","Furthermore, treatment with tofersen reduced levels of neurofilament in both plasma and CSF. We are encouraged by the concordance across data sets generated in the study, including target engagement, clinical and neurofilament data, and the broad potential of antisense oligonucleotides to target genetic drivers of neurodegenerative disease. We expect data from the Phase III VALOR study of tofersen next year.","In addition, we continue to advance the Phase I studies of BIIB078, an ASO for C9orf72-mediated ALS, and BIIB100, a small molecule inhibitor of XPO1 for sporadic ALS.","Turning to ophthalmology, this quarter, we completed enrollment in the Phase III STAR study of BIIB111 in choroideremia, a rare X-linked inherited retinal disorder that inevitably leads to blindness and currently has no approved treatments. Choroideremia affects approximately 15,000 individuals in the G7 and is caused by loss of function mutations in the gene encoding Rab escort protein 1, or REP1. BIIB111 is a gene therapy aimed to address the underlying cause of this disease by expressing an AAV2-packaged REP1 transgene.","In Phase I\/II studies, patients treated with BIIB111 demonstrated a higher rate of maintained vision compared to natural history. In addition, a subset of patients treated with BIIB111 in Phase I\/II studies demonstrated a meaningful improvement in visual activity, as defined -- sorry, in visual acuity, as defined by a gain of at least 15 letters corresponding to three lines on the eye chart. Specifically, 21% of patients treated with BIIB111 demonstrated an improvement of at least 15 letters at one year, as compared to only 1% observed in the natural history study.","The Phase I\/II studies also demonstrated that BIIB111 was generally well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile. We are encouraged by these early signs of efficacy and safety and look forward to data from the Phase III study of BIIB111 toward the end of this year. We are also advancing the Phase II\/III study of BIIB112 in XLRP with data expected in the middle of next year.","In stroke, we continue to advance the Phase III study of BIIB093, or IV glibenclamide, for cerebral edema caused by large hemispheric infarction, or LHI. In a Phase II study, treatment with BIIB093 was associated with a 46% reduction in midline shift, an imaging measure of cerebral edema, and reduced mortality by over 50%. We look forward to data from the Phase III study of BIIB093 in LHI by the end of next year.","In addition, the Phase II study of TMS-007 continues to progress. TMS-007 is a small molecule modulator of plasminogen that has the potential to become a best-in-class thrombolytic drug candidate for patients following an acute ischemic stroke. Data from this study are expected by the end of this year.","Within movement disorders, we continue to advance cinpanemab, or BIIB054, an anti-alpha-synuclein antibody for Parkinson's disease, with Phase II data expected in the second half of this year, as well as the Phase I study for BIIB094, an antisense oligonucleotide targeting LRRK2.","Last month, we reported top line results from the Phase II PASSPORT study of gosuranemab for PSP. The primary endpoint was not met, and we therefore discontinued the development of gosuranemab for PSP and other primary tauopathies. While we were disappointed in this result, we chose to continue the Phase II study of gosuranemab in early Alzheimer's disease, given the potentially significant differences in disease pathophysiology.","And in neurocognitive disorders, we continue to advance a Phase II study of BIIB104, an AMPA receptor potentiator for cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia. We now expect data from this study in the second half of this year -- of next year.","Finally, we had a productive quarter on the business development front. Building further depth in ophthalmology, last month, we entered into an agreement with Catalyst Biosciences to develop and commercialize pegylated CB 2782 for the potential treatment of geographic atrophy, or GA. GA is an advanced form of dry age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, that leads to blindness, has no approved therapies and affects approximately 1 million individuals in the US alone. This molecule is a novel protease that selectively cleaves C3, a genetically validated target in AMD. And we are encouraged by preclinical data demonstrating that a single intravitreal injection of this protease eliminated over 99% of C3 from the vitreous humor for at least 28 days.","In addition, this quarter, we initiated a collaboration with CAMP4 Therapeutics to leverage their Gene Circuitry Platform to potentially identify a suite of druggable targets in microglial signaling pathways already known to play a causal role in neurological disease.","And most recently, we announced an agreement to acquire a novel CNS-penetrant small molecule inhibitor of casein kinase 1, or CK1, from Pfizer. CK1 is a key regulator of circadian rhythms, which can become dysregulated and contribute to irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder, or ISWRD, in Parkinson's disease, as well as sundowning in Alzheimer's disease. ISWRD is a non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease, characterized by fragmented sleep, severe fatigue and difficulties with activities of daily living. Sundowning affects approximately 20% of AD patients and causes patients to become confused, anxious and agitated later in the day. In a Phase I study -- Phase Ia study, this molecule demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and proof of mechanism. Specifically, there was a statistically significant and dose-related increase in salivary melatonin concentration, a marker of circadian phase modulation. We believe this may represent an innovative symptomatic treatment for both AD and PD, and we expect to initiate a Phase Ib study by the end of this year. This transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, and we expect it to close in the first quarter of 2020.","Overall, Biogen R&D delivered significant progress in 2019. We believe we are in a strong position today with 27 clinical programs, including six programs in Phase III, 12 in Phase II and nine in Phase I, with a deep preclinical pipeline across multiple modalities. With our plan to file aducanumab in the US and multiple additional near-term opportunities ahead of us, we believe that no other company is as well positioned to develop potentially breakthrough medicines for patients living with devastating neurological diseases.","I'll now pass the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Capello","Thanks Al. Good morning, everyone. Let me now provide more detail on our financial performance for 2019 and share with you our guidance for 2020. Let's start with revenues.","As Michel mentioned earlier, we had a very strong performance in Q4 2019 across all of our core business areas. Total revenues for the fourth quarter grew 4% year-over-year to approximately $3.7 billion and grew 7% for the full year to $14.4 billion.","Overall, our MS business delivered revenues of $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019, including OCREVUS royalties of approximately $205 million. MS revenues in Q4 2019 decreased 1% versus prior year without OCREVUS royalties and increased 2% including OCREVUS royalties. US MS revenues in the fourth quarter of 2019 benefited from an increase in channel inventory of approximately $135 million compared to an increase of approximately $105 million in Q4 2018. Based on historical results, we typically see a decrease in channel inventory in the first quarter, following year-end build of inventory.","Full year MS revenues were $9.2 billion, including OCREVUS royalties of approximately $688 million. Full year MS revenues decreased 1% versus the prior year without OCREVUS royalties and increased 2% versus the prior year including OCREVUS royalties.","Global fourth quarter TECFIDERA revenues were $1.2 billion, a 5% increase versus the prior year. This included revenues of $877 million in the US, an increase of 2% versus Q4 2018, and $284 million outside the US, an increase of 12% versus the fourth quarter of 2018. TECFIDERA benefited from an increase in channel inventory in the US of approximately $100 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to an increase of approximately $60 million in Q4 2018. Throughout 2019, we were pleased to see four consecutive quarters of relative stability in our share of total prescriptions for TECFIDERA in the US.","In addition to strong performance from TECFIDERA, we launched VUMERITY in late Q4 in the US and recorded $5 million of revenue, all of which we attribute to channel loading. Outside the US, TECFIDERA again performed very well in the fourth quarter with strong patient growth in all major European markets and approximately 50% patient growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America versus the prior year.","For the full year, worldwide TECFIDERA revenues were $4.4 billion, an increase of 4% versus the prior year. This included $3.3 billion in the US and $1.1 billion in sales outside the US.","Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, were $516 million during the fourth quarter, a decrease of 14% versus Q4 2018 due to a continued shift from the injectable platforms to oral or high-efficacy therapies. This included $359 million in the US and $157 million in sales outside the US. Interferon revenues outside the US were negatively impacted by channel dynamics and timing of shipments. Within the US, AVONEX and PLEGRIDY benefited from an increase in channel inventory of approximately $30 million compared to an increase of approximately $35 million in Q4 2018.","For the full year, worldwide interferon revenues decreased 11% to $2.1 billion, consisting of $1.4 billion in the US and $675 million in sales outside the US.","TYSABRI worldwide revenues were $473 million this quarter, an increase of 2% versus the fourth quarter of 2018. This included $270 million in US and $203 million outside the US. In the US, revenues increased 5% versus the prior year, representing the fourth consecutive quarter of improved performance on a year-over-year basis. Within the US, inventory levels for TYSABRI were relatively stable compared to an increase of approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2018.","Throughout 2019, we were pleased to see relative stability in TYSABRI's share of both new and total prescriptions in the US. Outside the US, TYSABRI revenues decreased 2% versus the prior year as revenues were negatively impacted by channel dynamics and timing of shipments. For the full year, worldwide TYSABRI revenues were approximately $1.9 billion, an increase of 2% versus prior year. We recorded US revenues of $1 billion and $850 million internationally.","Overall, we were very pleased with the performance of our MS business in 2019 and are focused on maintaining the resilience of this franchise in light of new competition entering the market.","Let me now move on to SPINRAZA. Global fourth quarter SPINRAZA revenues were $543 million, a 16% increase versus the prior year and relatively flat versus the third quarter. In the US, SPINRAZA revenues for the fourth quarter of 2019 were $243 million, an increase of 3% versus both Q4 2018 and Q3 2019.","The number of patients on therapy in US increased 2% as compared to the end of the third quarter of 2019, with growth coming from both the pediatric and adult patient segments. We continue to make strong progress with adults, as more than 50% of the new starts in Q4 were adults. And growth in adults exceeded our overall patient growth. As a reminder, the adult population is the largest segment of the market. We have continued to see an impact from gene therapy within the infant population, which represents approximately 5% of the total SMA market.","Outside the US, SPINRAZA revenues in the fourth quarter of 2019 were $300 million, an increase of 28% versus the prior year and a decrease of 3% versus the prior quarter. Outside the US, we saw strong growth in patients across all regions, with broad growth from both existing and newly launched countries. The number of commercial SPINRAZA patients increased approximately 10% versus the third quarter of 2019. Despite strong overall patient growth, fourth quarter ex-US SPINRAZA revenues decreased slightly versus the third quarter of this year due to a combination of loading dose dynamics, country mix, the timing of shipments in certain markets and pricing dynamics.","Overall, we were very pleased with SPINRAZA's performance again this quarter, as we saw continued patient growth across the large mature markets and strong uptake in the emerging markets. Additionally, more than 50% of our revenue came from outside the US, and there remains significant opportunity to reach additional patients, particularly outside the US.","For the full year, worldwide SPINRAZA revenues increased 22% to $2.1 billion, driven by 9% growth in the US to $933 million and 30% growth outside the US to $1.2 billion.","Let me now move on to our biosimilars business, which generated revenues of $196 million this quarter, growing 25% versus the prior year. We estimate that we have more than 200,000 patients receiving treatments with our three anti-TNF biosimilars, which is a significant increase of approximately 70% versus the prior year.","BENEPALI is the leading ENBREL biosimilar in Germany, the UK and Italy. FLIXABI is the most prescribed Remicade biosimilar in Italy. And IMRALDI is the leading HUMIRA biosimilar in major markets such as Germany and the UK. For the full year, biosimilars revenues grew 35% to $738 million.","Turning to our anti-CD20 revenues, we recorded $601 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 12% versus the prior year, primarily driven by OCREVUS royalties. Full year anti-CD20 revenues were $2.3 billion, a 16% increase versus 2018. In the fourth quarter, we saw the first entry of a RITUXAN biosimilar. We expect additional biosimilar entrants in 2020, which we expect will put further pressure on RITUXAN revenues. Also as a reminder, our royalty rate on US sales of OCREVUS resets every calendar year.","Total other revenues were $146 million in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 12% versus the prior year due to the timing of shipments. Other revenues were $708 million for the full year, an increase of 21% versus 2018. As a reminder, other revenues in the first quarter of 2019 benefited from a large one-time shipment to Bioverativ. In addition, note that other revenues are variable and difficult to predict.","Let me now turn to gross margin performance. Q4 2019 gross margin was 88% of revenues versus approximately 86% in the fourth quarter of 2018. The improvement in gross margin was due to slightly lower royalties, as well as lower cost related to our other revenues. Gross margins for the full year 2019 were approximately 86%, relatively flat compared to full year 2018.","Q4 GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense was 19% of revenue or $692 million. Q4 R&D expense includes $63 million related to the transaction with Samsung Bioepis, the $45 million opt-in payment we made to Ionis related to BIIB080, and $30 million related to our collaboration agreements with CAMP4 Therapeutics and Catalyst Biosciences. Full year GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense was 16% of revenue or $2.3 billion.","Q4 GAAP SG&A expense was 18% of revenue or $665 million. Q4 non-GAAP SG&A expense was 18% of revenue or $662 million. Both GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A increased versus the prior quarter, primarily due to increased commercial and medical investments, as well as the timing of spend on G&A. Full year GAAP SG&A was 17% of sales or $2.4 billion. Full year non-GAAP SG&A was 16% of sales or $2.3 billion.","GAAP other expense, which includes interest, was $49 million in the fourth quarter, and income was $83 million for the full year. Non- expense was $50 million in the fourth quarter and $110 million for the full year. The difference between these GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven primarily by gains on strategic investments, which we classify as GAAP only.","In the fourth quarter and the full year, our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 16%. Compared to the prior year, GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for both the full year and the fourth quarter of 2019 benefited from a non-recurring change in the Company's tax profile in 2019 and the sale of the remaining portion of higher-tax inventory in 2018 due to inter-Company effects. Furthermore, the GAAP rate also benefited from the unfavorable prior-year effect of US tax reform in 2018.","Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 178 million for the fourth quarter and 187 million for the full year. Throughout 2019, we repurchased approximately 24 million shares at an average price of approximately $249 for a total value of approximately $5.9 billion, including approximately 7.7 million shares in the fourth quarter for a total value of approximately $2.1 billion. As of the end of the year, we had a total of approximately $6.3 billion in share repurchase authorization outstanding, including the new $5 billion plan approved by the Board in December 2019, which now brings us to our diluted earnings per share.","In the fourth quarter, we booked GAAP EPS of $8.08, an increase of 71% versus the fourth quarter of 2018, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $8.34, a 19% increase versus the prior year. For the full year, GAAP EPS was $31.42, a 46% increase versus 2018, and non-GAAP EPS was $33.57, a 28% increase versus 2018.","We generated approximately $2 billion in net cash flows from operations in Q4 and approximately $7.1 billion for the full year, marking the final year where cash flows are impacted by payments to Fumapharm. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.9 billion in cash and marketable securities and $6 billion in debt.","Let me now turn to our full year guidance for 2020. We expect revenues of approximately $14 billion to $14.3 billion. We anticipate GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense to be between 15% and 16% of revenues. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A expense to be approximately 19.5% to 20.5% of revenues. We anticipate our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for 2020 to be between 18% to 19%. And we anticipate full year 2020 GAAP diluted earnings per share results of $29.50 to $31.50 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $31.50 to $33.50.","It's important to note that this guidance does not include any impact from potential acquisitions or large business development transactions, as both are hard to predict. This guidance does assume our proposed transaction with Pfizer closes. Our guidance also assumes a stable share count off the fourth quarter of 2019 and no change to foreign exchange rates. Importantly, our guidance also assumes no generic competition in the US for TECFIDERA in 2020 and assumes additional commercial and R&D expenses related to aducanumab. This guidance reflects our best assumptions as of now. And as a reminder, we will provide an update mid-year on our second quarter earnings call.","I'll now turn the call back over to Michel for his closing comments.","Michel Vounatsos","Thank you, Jeff. We delivered strong performance in 2019 with growth across all of our core business areas, double-digit earnings growth versus a year ago and strong execution across each pillar of our strategy. For 2020, we aim to continue our momentum by executing well on our strategic priorities across MS, SMA, biosimilars and our pipeline, with a priority on aducanumab.","We are actively preparing for the potential launch of aducanumab with an initial focus on the US. This includes implementing a thorough go-to-market model, hiring the sales force, building out our medical teams and preparing for market access. In addition, we are actively engaging with regulators outside of the US, including Europe and Japan.","Beyond aducanumab, our pipeline is maturing. We now have six programs in Phase III and 27 clinical programs overall, an increase from 17 just three years ago. We have multiple near-term opportunities for value creation, including in Alzheimer's disease, ALS, stroke, lupus, ophthalmology and biosimilars, as we aim to build a multi-franchise portfolio. Between now and the end of 2021, we expect 11 mid-to-late stage data readouts, including Phase III readouts for tofersen in ALS, BIIB111 in choroideremia and BIIB093 in large hemispheric infarction, and eight Phase II readouts across MS, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, ophthalmology, schizophrenia, acute neurology and neuropathic pain.","As the leader in neuroscience, with asymmetric [ph] core capabilities, we believe that no other company is better positioned to continue to deliver breakthrough therapies for diseases of the nervous system to address a significant and growing unmet medical need. We'll continue to execute on our core strategy to build a multi-franchise portfolio across our core and emerging growth areas. I want to reiterate our commitment to maximizing returns to our shareholders and bringing innovative therapies to patients over the long term. This demands that we continue to look at capital efficiently, effectively and appropriately. As we have demonstrated in the past, we will always strive to have an optimal capital structure, as well as aim for superior returns from the investment we make.","I'd like to take a moment to discuss how we brought the purpose as an organization as we aim to pioneer science for the betterment of humanity. This includes doing the right thing for patients, our employees, the environment and the community, all of which we believe contributes to a long-term sustainable shareholder value. I am proud of what Biogen stands for, and I believe this approach positions us well to be a sustainable organization over the long term, as we remain focused on being the leader in neuroscience to address the tremendous societal needs in this space.","Finally, I would like to thank our employees around the world, who are dedicated to making a positive impact on patients' lives, and all of the physician, caregivers and participants in our clinical development programs. Our past and future achievements could not be realized without their passion and commitment.","We will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Geoff Porges with SVB Leerink. Please go ahead.","Geoff Porges","Thank you very much, and congratulations on the quarter and the results and all the progress. Just a couple of questions, Jeff, on the guidance. Could you talk about what assumptions are built into your guidance about the effect of the risdiplam imminent launch on SPINRAZA? And also just have you incorporated the full launch costs for aducanumab? Your sales force and everything you mentioned that, but is it fully budgeted in that guidance? Thanks.","Jeffrey Capello","So thanks for the questions, Geoff. So with regard to risdiplam, we are assuming that that product does launch. And so we're anticipating, as everyone else is, to kind of see the data and kind of what it means. We'd just remind people that we have 10,000 people on therapy today doing very, very well with a very low discontinuation rate. So we'll see kind of what happens on the data and how that product is received. But certainly, there's a lot of growth opportunity for us ahead.","With regard to aducanumab, we're not going to give specific perspective on numbers in terms of the launch, but I would just point you back to looking at the SG&A guidance, which is up quite a bit from a percentage perspective, and you get a sense of the amount we're spending year-over-year relative to that that we spent last year. And that is I think the prudent thing to do, given the significant opportunity ahead of us, which we're quite excited about.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn","Great, thanks for taking the question. Maybe just two for me. Just wondering if you can give us any more detail on what's gating to the aducanumab filing. And then, are you expecting a priority review? And then the outlook in terms of the ex-US regulatory filings there, do you have a similar level of confidence in filing in both Europe in Japan as you do in the US? Thank you.","Alfred Sandrock, Jr.","Hi, Terence, this is Al. It's basically a matter of putting together documentation, the electronic Common Technical Document. It's an electronic document with hyperlinks, etc. It's a matter of assembling all that and submitting that to the FDA.","And in terms of the engagement, we've been engaged with them since last -- the first Type C meeting last June, and it's been very constructive. I've never -- this is a unique situation to me. It's pretty unusual, I think, across the industry. But I'll say that it's been -- there has been a high level of constructive engagement ever since last June.","And with respect to the other regions, we have started our engagement with them, but it's still early days. But we do anticipate that we will be filing at some point in those other regions as well at some point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Ronny Gal","Good morning. Congratulations on the results, and thank you for taking the questions. You mentioned you're beginning to -- the redosing trial. I wonder if you can just tell us a little bit about what you're trying to achieve with that trial. Essentially, now that you've got the protocol, what are the endpoints and when -- what is the data that we should see from that?","And then second on VUMERITY, can you describe a little bit the launch plans here? I guess it didn't really make commercial step yet. Can you talk a little bit about whether you intend to give it the same kind of parity business model to TECFIDERA? Or would there be some things you do with VUMERITY that -- in terms of access, support and so forth, that will be better or worse than TECFIDERA?","Alfred Sandrock, Jr.","Hi Ronny, it's Al. The main reason for the redosing study were humanitarian reasons. We had all these patients who had volunteered to be in our clinical studies. They helped us develop aducanumab. We felt we owed something to them. Many of them had expressed a desire to the investigators that they wanted the drug. So that's the primary reason. As I said in my notes that -- in my script that it's a single-arm study. Basically, every patient gets titrated up to 10 milligrams per kilogram aducanumab, and all patients who were in prior studies, including placebo patients, are eligible. In a single-arm study, the main thing you can really look at is safety and tolerability. And we had always envisioned doing a long-term extension study. In fact, we had one in place to evaluate long-term safety and tolerability. And so that's the primary endpoint of the study.","In addition, of course, we'll answer -- we'll take a look at efficacy as best you can in a single-arm study because we would be interested in continued -- if there's durable effect, obviously, we'll be looking at amyloid and other biomarkers, and we'll also see whether or not a treatment gap had any effect on these kinds of markers.","Michel Vounatsos","So, Ronny, concerning the second part of your question, with a superior to take [indiscernible] we have the opportunity with VUMERITY to strengthen the overall fumarate portfolio. But TECFIDERA remains front and center in our promotion. You see the performance. We continue to support. And again, a key metric will be to increase the share of fumarate down the road. We are pleased with the access to date that is superior to what we have seen from competition a few months after launch, and for some competitors, 12 months after launch. So we are pleased with the access. We monitor very closely the Start Forms and the grads [ph]. We are pleased to see so far that there is more Start Forms being issued ex tech than tech. So this is a -- but it's still the beginning. It's a bit too early. We'll come back with more color when we have more data.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Phil Nadeau","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. It's actually on TECFIDERA and the IP. I believe, we are going to get a decision on the IPR next week. Can you remind us in the case where the IP were to fall, what would be the next steps, what is the appeal process there? And then secondarily, what is the status of the court case? Can you give us an update on the timelines there, should the IPR actually go your way next week? Thanks.","Jeffrey Capello","Yeah, so it's Jeff. So there is a -- expect a decision, from the IPR perspective, no later than the end of the first week of February. So that will be the first of the three decisions. Depending on how that goes -- if it goes in our favor, that's great. If it doesn't, we plan to appeal, and the appeal process typically takes 12 to 18 months.","Two other cases, West Virginia and Delaware, are expected to read out some point mid-year, plus or minus a month or two. Depending on how those go those go -- if those go our way, that's great. If not, we plan to appeal those, and the appeal period, again, tends to take 12 to 18 months. So we obviously await kind of the results of that. We do believe we have valid patents. Nonetheless, these outcomes are difficult to predict. There's a number of considerations need to be weighed. There's obviously multiple decisions that we just talked about. There's the appeal periods and then there's handicapping whether or not people -- if we're unsuccessful, we'll launch at risk. So it's difficult to predict in the short term. So we'll keep people apprised of kind of the developments as we move our way through the year.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Umer Raffat","Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. Al, I just wanted to focus on Alzheimer's for a minute, if I may. And it's very clear that FDA has a long history of approving CNS drugs, which have failed and\/or negative trials in the past. However, every time FDA goes down that direction, I find that they pool results across every single thing. So my question is, if you pool results across ENGAGE, EMERGE and Phase Ib, what does that look like? That will be very helpful to understand. And also, how many post-hoc analysis were done before you guys arrived at the Protocol Version 4 population? I mostly ask because I'm trying to understand how we should think about what should be the p-value, given all the splits that theoretically should be thought about before we arrived at the PV4.","Alfred Sandrock, Jr.","So Umer, this is Al Sandrock. We haven't disclosed the results of any other kinds of analyses, including pooling or subsets. So we're not going to do that this morning. But I would say that I would not assume that -- I mean, when you look back in the history of approved drugs, I wouldn't say it's always the case that pooling is done. I think that there is -- there are exceptions to that. And so I would not assume that here, and let's see.","Your question -- the other question was how many post-hoc analyses? We did say it was post-hoc, but I don't remember how many there were.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Geoff Meacham","Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I just have a few. On SMA, in clinical development, patients on ZOLGENSMA switched back to SPINRAZA. Just curious if you guys have seen evidence that this is occurring in the real world.","And then Al, bigger picture question on Alzheimer's. So if I assume that A-beta antibody is an anchor therapy, when we look down the road at combination approaches, is there sort of a fast path to derisk? In other words, do you feel like FDA -- you can look at surrogate markers such as a PET imaging initially, and then down the road, look at cognition. Just wanted to get a sense for looking at post-aducanumab. Thanks.","Alfred Sandrock, Jr.","Yeah. So we -- your first question was about SMA and ZOLGENSMA. I don't really consider that as switch-back, if you will, because if they've had ZOLGENSMA, arguably that -- they're still on it, if you will. They're getting the effect of the gene therapy. So in some ways, it's like a combination of adding SPINRAZA. We have heard about that. It does happen in the real world. And you might want to -- you might wonder why people are doing that. I think it's because parents and the physicians feel like there might be more room to improve, and so that's what I hear from -- in the real world. And in terms of data from that, we are starting to collect that data. But we have -- we don't have any conclusions at this point. But we are -- because it's happening in the real world. And since we're very interested in real world evidence, we are starting to collect that data.","In terms of Alzheimer's and combination, one of the reasons why we built the pipeline the way we did was that we had always envisioned combination therapy. And the first obvious thing to combine aducanumab or BAN2401 with would be an anti-tau or a tau ASO, something that affects tau. We were actually pleasantly surprised that aducanumab already affects tau, though. So we'll have to keep that in mind. But nevertheless, I think the most obvious thing to do would be to combine with tau as the next step, and then maybe that there are certain stages of the disease that need the combination more than other stages.","And in terms of a fast track, yeah, we will employ biomarkers, not only of the toxic proteins that we're trying to reduce, A-beta and tau, but also potentially other kinds of biomarkers that look at additive effects in a more expedient way. But ultimately, I anticipate we will need to show some effect of the combination on reducing clinical decline further. I think that will still be important. Unless you can do it, in other words, if you're in an early stage of Alzheimer's where there is no cognitive impairment, you may not be able to do it where biomarkers alone may be the only approach.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Michael Yee","Thanks for the question. You had made some comments around preparation for aducanumab, including SG&A. Could you just put a little more color around, I guess, the work being done in terms of timing of when you actually expect the sales force to be on? And maybe some comments around what you're hearing from payers and what they would -- how they are putting in perspective this type of drug and what type of actions that type of drug would get.","And then just a quick one also for Al, there is a DIAN-TU study reading out. I'm sure people will try to make read-throughs into what this means for the beta amyloid about -- this is maybe just a comment on anything to know or your perspective on that study. I appreciate it.","Michel Vounatsos","So Michael, if I can get started with the launch readiness, actually, the work started more than two years ago with an understanding of the patient journey from origination to diagnosis, the referral dynamics that change from market to market, and even within the US, which is different, understand the different types of markets within the US, it's -- the different segments. We have finalized the go-to-market for the US. This has been approved, and this is funded in our budget, as discussed. And hiring has started, first with the medical affairs, obviously. Engagement with scientific leaders also at the community level is important. And also the biomanufacturing needs to be stepped up and be ready for eventually a large demand with the functional support, okay, to support the increased engagement and team.","In terms of price, it's still early, even if we are making progress. We engage with stakeholders, because as you can imagine, there is almost no drug cost today. So we engage with patient association, pharmacoeconomics, through leaders and all the customers, mostly in the US and beyond the US. Beyond the price, it's all about the access condition and the affordability. We know that the more we wait, the more transition -- that people will transition to full-blown assistance and loss of dependence, which costs so much to the society. So basically, we start engaging, and hopefully, we'll have all the incentives in that field in order to further invest in R&D. This is our belief. So good progress, step by step, but we engage broadly and we ask for advice and we listen.","Alfred Sandrock, Jr.","Hi Michael, it's Al. DIAN-TU -- so DIAN is the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network. So obviously, in these patients, amyloid is likely to be causal because most of the dominantly inherited mutations that lead to ultimately [ph] Alzheimer's disease are patients either in APP, the amyloid precursor protein, or enzymes that process it. And so I think that these are very interesting studies. My understanding is that solanizumab and gantenerumab are being tested. If the results are positive, I think that that would lend further support to the amyloid hypothesis. If the results are negative, I'd want to see that there is evidence of target engagement and biological changes in the brain before I make any conclusions.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Cory Kasimov","Great. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask on capital allocation, and given the Company's current portfolio and pipeline, considering prevailing market dynamics, how do you look at the relative attractiveness between continued share repurchases, considering the 6 plus billion in dry powder you have there, and business development opportunities? I guess, do you have enough bandwidth to do both in a meaningful way? And do you -- and how much of an appetite do you have on the acquisition front at this time? Thanks.","Jeffrey Capello","So Cory, it's Jeff. Thanks for the question. So we're in a good position from that perspective. We have no net debt as of the end of the year. In 2019, we generated $7 billion of cash flow and we expect that we'll have a strong cash flow year again in 2020. So we've got the financial flexibility to do both, and we have been doing both. Over the last three years, we've done 15 M&A BD type transactions, spending $3.5 billion. And in the last year alone, we bought back 24 million shares for almost $6 billion.","So our interest is strong in terms of building the pipeline. We've taken the pipeline from 17 clinical assets to 27, significant increase. And then, of those 27, there's 11 that have important readouts in the next two years, five of which could have a meaningful impact on the Company. So we feel good about that. We'd like to continue to add to those assets and build the pipeline. But at the same point, we have $6.3 billion of authorized share repurchase capability as well. So we'll continue to make good decisions that are in the best interest long term of the shareholders and we'll have the capacity to do both.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Matthew Harrison","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I had one for Al on two pipeline program. Al, can you just comment why a LRRK2 ASO could be differentiated from the kinase inhibitors that we see in development? And then maybe just share your views on anti-LINGO in MS. Has that changed since you initiated that study or any updated views there? Thanks.","Alfred Sandrock, Jr.","So LRRK2 is a wonderful target, we believe, for Parkinson's disease, not only for the patients with familial PD due to LRRK2 mutations, but also potentially even for sporadic Parkinson's disease. And the ASO, it's another approach to -- instead of inhibiting the enzyme with a small molecule, you reduce the levels of LRRK2, and it remains to be seen. One thing I'll say about the ASO is that it's CNS. Because we give it intrathecally, it's only going to affect LRRK2 in the central nervous system, whereas a small molecule may have affects on the enzyme in other places. But I would say other than that, it's kind of early days for whether or not these drugs will be effective.","And in terms of anti-LINGO, the Phase II study that we're doing now is different from the first Phase II study in the sense that we selected patients based on advanced imaging to be sure that they actually had demyelination based on MTR and actually had intact exons based on DTI. We also chose the dose that looked the most promising, based on the first Phase II study. And we're combining it with multiple different kinds of immunomodulators. In the first trial, we only combined it with interferon, but now we're combining it with TECFIDERA, TYSABRI as well as interferon to see whether or not the level of inflammatory disease in the brain affects remyelination. And perhaps when you have less inflammation, the oligodendrocyte precursor cells may be able to remyelinate better. So that's the difference. And we'll find out soon whether or not the second trial is positive.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jay Olson with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Jay Olson","Hi, congrats on a successful 2019, and thanks for taking the question. Could you elaborate on the rationale for studying BAN2401 in patients whose amyloid levels fall below the threshold of positivity? And is the goal here to create a complementary positioning for BAN2401 in patient segments that would be distinct from aducanumab?","Alfred Sandrock, Jr.","Well, we do view this -- we do view the two drugs as part of a multi-drug franchise, and we will use the drugs where they naturally fit the best, and we'll need data for that. Just because they're not positive based on a visual read, that doesn't mean there's no amyloid accumulation. So I think that's the distinction. And in some ways, A345 study looks at -- between the two studies, looks at both Stage 1 and Stage 2, both of the -- both stages as defined by the FDA guidance document that came out last year on the various stages of Alzheimer's disease. So I would say that those two studies evaluate both Stage 1 and Stage 2, and both are important to study, I believe.","Joe Mara","There's probably time for two more questions.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Evan Seigerman with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Evan Seigerman","Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter. I'm just looking towards next week with the potential results from the IPR. If they were to not go your way, would you consider re-prioritizing your business development priorities versus share repurchases? Or would you have to wait until you kind of see the results of the court cases mid-year?","Michel Vounatsos","So thanks for the good question. And we see business development M&A opportunities as being independent from what happens next week or what happened six months ago, in March. We continue to remain -- we are very engaged on BD opportunities, and the team continue to look at the opportunities to create value for the shareholders, and this will be independent from any event.","Jeffrey Capello","Yeah, and just as a reminder, we ended the year with no net debt. And in 2019, we generated $7 billion in operating cash flow. So we've got the capacity to do both.","Operator","The final question will come from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with SunTrust. Please go ahead with your question.","Robyn Karnauskas","Hi, thanks for the question. Just to give us some comfort, as the investors and we think about Alzheimer's, should it be approved, given that you've [ph] a huge amount of antibody, can you give us any comfort around cost of goods and margins that it wouldn't be too harmful? I know you guys have very good manufacturing capacity, but that's still a lot of antibodies. So when would we learn this? And can you give us any comfort that the dollar amount to make this drug isn't extremely high that it would overburden the system? Thanks.","Jeffrey Capello","Yeah. So thanks for the question. So it's obviously something we've been looking at for a while. And I'll say -- I don't want to get into too much specifics with regard to that at this point in time, but we're comfortable that given the nature of the substance that we'll produce, it will be a fair margin and that it will do well economically.","Joe Mara","So I'm going to turn it back over to Michel for his closing comments.","Michel Vounatsos","So thank you all for being on the call. We turned the page of a very strong 2019, and now, the team at Biogen is ready for a very material 2020 and, obviously, with a priority for a potential aducanumab.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Matt Calistri, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.","Matt Calistri","Thank, Dan. Thank you. And welcome to Biogen's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call.","Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the earnings release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call.","I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the Risk Factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail.","On today's call, I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Michel Vounatsos; Dr. Michael Ehlers, EVP of Research and Development; and our CFO, Jeff Capello. We will also be joined for the Q&A portion of the call by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Al Sandrock.","Before I conclude, I would also like to remind everyone, that we now post releases related to earnings call and Investor Events on the Investors section of Biogen's website, www.biogen.com. And issue statement on Twitter when they become available. We do this instead of publishing earnings releases and any releases related to Investor Events and earnings calls via Newswire services. Our Twitter handle is @biogen.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Michel.","Michel Vounatsos","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.","First, let me begin with some financial highlights. Compared to the same period a year ago, Biogen's third quarter revenues grew 12% to $3.4 billion, third quarter GAAP earnings per share grew 24% to $7.15 and non-GAAP EPS grew 17% to $7.40. We are pleased with this year-over-year double-digit topline and bottom line growth, as we continue to execute on our strategy to solidify our long-term leadership position in neuroscience.","Now let me review the accomplishments we delivered in the third quarter. First, our MS core business including OCREVUS royalties remained stable versus prior year and delivered revenues of $2.3 billion. The number of patients on our MS products globally also remained relatively stable versus the prior year.","In the U.S. we saw increasing trends for both TECFIDERA and TYSABRI on a year-over-year basis. Outside the U.S., we continued to add patients across multiple geographies.","Second, SPINRAZA global revenues grew to $468 million, driven by quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year revenue growth in the U.S. and even greater revenue growth outside the U.S. The number of commercial patients on SPINRAZA increased by approximately 20% from last quarter and we now have close to 6,000 patients on SPINRAZA, including the expanded access program and clinical trials.","In the U.S., we continued making progress with adults. In the third quarter more then 50% of new starts were adults, increasing the number of adult populated patients on SPINRAZA by more then 20% compared to last quarter.","Outside the U.S., the pace of reimbursement for SPINRAZA across multiple geographies lead to meaningful revenue growth with significant revenue contribution not just from Europe, but also from Asia-Pac and Latin America. We have received regulatory approval in five more countries and we have made two more regulatory filings. We also secured formal reimbursement in four additional countries, including Canada and now have formal reimbursement in 28 markets.","We were very proud to announce new data from the NURTURE study of SPINRAZA of the 25 presymptomatic infants with genetically diagnosed SMA that was treated with SPINRAZA, many were achieving milestones consistent with normal development. All the patients were alive without ventilation and able to sit without support. 22 patients or 88% were able to walk either with assistance or independently and 88% was normal bullbar function.","We believe the long-term data we are generating across a broad patient populations underscore the compelling efficacy profile of SPINRAZA. This is the kind of innovation and progress that inspires us to tackle some of the most difficult and challenging disease areas within neuroscience.","Third, we continue to develop our neuroscience pipeline as we look to prioritize our investments towards areas with highest probability of success, while building depth in core areas of expertise.","Within MS and neuroimmunology we are working to expand our long-term leadership position, and this quarter we completed enrolment of the Phase 2 trial of Opicinumab, a potential remyelination therapy.","Along with Eisai we are presenting data this week for our industry leading Alzheimer's disease portfolio at the CTAD meeting in Barcelona. We are building for the depth in neuromuscular diseases with initiation of a Phase 1 trial of BIIB078, an ASO targeting C9ORF72 the most common genetic cause of ALS and we continue to be optimistic about the potential for BIIB067 targeting SOD-1 for ALS.","We are making notable progress in movement disorders having completed enrolment in the Phase 2 first of BIIB092, an anti-tau antibody, in progressive supranuclear palsy or PSP. BIIB092 has been granted fast-track designation from the FDA. We also continue to advance BIIB054 in Phase 2 for Parkinson's disease.","Within our emerging growth area of acute neurology we dosed the first patient in our Phase 3 trial of BIIB093, a first-in-class IV glibenclamide for large hemispheric infarction. And beyond our neuroscience pipeline we initiated a Phase 2b trial of BG11 in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Mike, will provide more details on the development across our entire pipeline.","Our biosimilar business grew revenues to $135 million, which represents 33% growth year-over-year. We believe that there are now more than 100,000 patients treated with our biosimilars in Europe.","Last week we launched IMRALDI, our adalimumab biosimilar referencing HUMIRA. With an originator market of approximately $4 billion per year in Europe. IMRALDI is now available in several European markets, with IMRALDI we are now able to offer biosimilars of the three main anti-TNFs, providing physicians with more options to meet the needs of patients.","We believe the significant savings from biosimilars in European markets can create headroom for innovative therapies. As a reminder, we exercised our option to own approximately 49.9% of the Samsung Biopis joint venture and we expect this transaction to close by the end of the year.","Importantly, our cash generation remains very strong and continue to provide us with significant optionality and flexibility to allocate capital. Since the beginning of the year, we have completed five business development deals and repurchased 10.5 million shares.","During the third quarter, we generated $1.7 billion in cash flow from operations. We continue to diligently evaluating opportunities for potential business development and M&A and our board has authorized a $3.5 billion share repurchase program.","As we have demonstrated in the past, we are committed to maximizing returns for shareholders, while continuing to bring innovative therapies to patients, something that demands a thoughtful approach towards all our investment over both the short and the long-term.","In summary, Biogen executed on strategy and continued to deliver noticeable progress. Our core MS business demonstrated resilience. SPINRAZA continued to grow in the U.S. and even more so outside of the U.S. and we remain committed to our goal of being the long-term standard of care in SMA.","We initiated a new study in ALS and completed enrolment of studies in MS and PSP, as we aim to develop our neuroscience portfolio and build depths in our most promising core and emerging growth areas.","We grew our biosimilars business and have launched IMRALDI in Europe. We are actively implementing a leaner and simpler operating model and we generated ample cash as we focus on strategically allocating capital to develop and build depths in our neuroscience portfolio, again with a goal of maximizing shareholder returns and bringing innovative therapies to patients.","I will now turn the call over to Mike for a more detailed update on our recent progress in R&D.","Michael Ehlers","Thank you, Michel and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter we made important progress across our differentiated neuroscience pipeline, including our industry leading Alzheimer's disease portfolio.","So I'm delighted today to review advances we made across our core and emerging growth areas, as we prioritize our activities and build depth in our most promising programs in disease areas.","Starting with Alzheimer's disease and dementia. This week we are presenting data at the Clinical Trials and Alzheimer's Disease meeting or CTAD on the safety and efficacy of aducanumab, our monoclonal antibody of the binds soluble and insoluble aggregated forms of beta amyloid, including oligomers, protofibrils and fibrils.","These presentations will include a 36 month analysis of the aducanumab titration dosing regimen and a 48 month analysis of the fixed dose cohort both from the long-term extension of the Phase 1b PRIME study of patients with early Alzheimer's disease.","The results are generally consistent with the previous interim analyses and there were no changes to the risk benefit profile of aducanumab. Live webcasts of our oral presentations, as well as an investor Q&A call will be available on the Investor section of our website.","Also at CTAD, our collaborator Eisai will present a clinical and biomarker updates from the Phase 2 study of BAN2401. These results will be presented in an oral session at CTAD and a live webcast of the presentation will be available on Eisai\u2019s website.","Additionally, Eisai will present safety and efficacy data from the Phase 2 study of elenbecestat, a small molecule base inhibitor being evaluated in two Phase 3 studies in patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.","In parallel to advancing Phase 3 clinical development aducanumab, we are also planning to initiate EVOLVE, a Phase 2 study designed to assess the clinical relevance of asymptomatic amyloid related imaging abnormality or ARIA. Aducanumab has been generally well tolerated in patients with Alzheimer's disease with ARIA being the primary safety and tolerability finding.","The goal of EVOLVE is to test the hypothesis in a prospectively design study that continuation of dosing with aducanumab in the absence of symptoms does not have clinically impactful safety outcomes. We expect this study to begin by the end of the year.","Beyond beta amyloid, we are advancing a number of assets targeting tau, which we believe plays an important and complementary role in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Specifically, we continue to advance BIIB076 and BIIB092 both anti-tau antibodies, as well BIIB080, an antisense oligonucleotide targeting tau production. We expect full data from the Phase 1 study of BIIB076 in early 2020.","Turning to MS and neuroimmunology. This quarter we completed enrolment of FFINITY, a 72 week Phase 2b study of opicinumab as an add-on therapy to disease modifying therapies for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.","Opicinumab is a first-in-class human monoclonal antibody directed against LINGO-1 and is being evaluated to determine its potential for improving pre-existing disability in relapsing MS patients through remyelination. Enrolment of FFINITY was completed approximately seven months ahead of schedule and we expect data in mid 2020.","We continue to advance diroximel fumarate or BIIB098 in collaboration with Alkermes, as a new oral option that may provide benefit to many MS patients. We are currently enrolling patients in Part B of the head-to-head tolerability study versus TECFIDERA with data expected in mid 2019.","This study is employing an adaptive trial design in which results from Part A are used to inform Part B and we have used this approach to update the endpoints and increase the sample size by 80 patients to 500. In parallel, Alkermes expects to submit the NDA for BIIB098 to the FDA by the end of this year, potentially positioning us for U.S. approval by early 2020.","We are committed to expanding our leadership position in multiple sclerosis and we believe the next generation fumarate is an important part of our strategy. Earlier this month, Biogen presented data in over 70 oral and poster presentations at the 34th Congress of the European Committee for treatment and research in MS or ECTRIMS in Berlin. Key updates included results from the ENDORSE study, which demonstrate that the clinical benefits of TECFIDERA in newly diagnosed patients were maintained throughout nine years of continuous treatment.","Additionally, an analysis from the TYSABRI observational programs reinforced the long-term safety and consistent effectiveness of TYSABRI over 10 years. We also presented data on serum neurofilament light or NfL, as a biomarker of disease activity in MS.","Data indicated that serum NfL levels above a certain threshold were associated with gadolinium lesion count and new T2 lesion development. The number of patients with serum NfL levels above this threshold was significantly decreased following treatment with disease modifying therapies, particularly TYSABRI.","Turning to our progress in movement disorders. This quarter we completed enrolment of a Phase 2 study of our anti-tau antibody BIIB092 for the treatment of progressive Supranuclear Palsy, a rare and devastating neurodegenerative disease in which tau pathology is believed to be the primary driver of neurodegeneration. BIIB092 has been granted fast track designation by the FDA and results from this 52 week study are expected in the second half of next year.","Combined with our potentially best-in-class anti-alpha-synuclein antibody BIIB054 which is actively enrolling in a Phase 2 study for Parkinson's disease, we are leveraging our core neuroscience expertise to build depth in movement disorders.","We also see strong R&D momentum within neuromuscular disorders. We continue to build on the growing body of clinical evidence for SPINRAZA as the standard-of-care and spinal muscular atrophy.","Earlier this month at the Annual Congress of the World Muscle Society, we presented new interim results from NURTURE, an ongoing open label single arm efficacy and safety study of SPINRAZA in pre symptomatic infants with genetically diagnosed SMA.","As of May, all patients in the study were alive and none required tracheostomy or permanent ventilation. 22 of 25 participants were able to walk either with assistance or independently according to the motor milestones standard of the World Health Organization and all were able to sit without support.","Additionally, assessment of bullbar function revealed that 22 of 25 patients achieved a maximal score on the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination Section 1 evaluation of the ability to suck and swallow.","Participants were also evaluated for motor function using the CHOP INTEND scale, out of a maximum of 64 points, mean CHOP INTEND scores were 62.6 per study participants with three copies of the SMN2 gene and 61.0 for those with two copies of the gene.","We believe these data underscore the unprecedented efficacy profile of SPINRAZA as the standard-of-care in SMA with many patients achieving milestones consistent with normal development. We estimate that the majority of the treatable infant population is already being treated with SPINRAZA across multiple geographies.","In our efforts to support the broad use of SPINRAZA, we are working with the SMA community to enable intrathecal dosing for patients with scoliosis or spinal fusions. We have seen meaningful progress in the field, including a recent publication out of Phoenix Children's Hospital outlining a potential treatment paradigm to those patients with complex spines.","This site noted the successful administration of 104 doses amongst 26 children with 100% technical success, utilizing techniques such as imaging directed injection or catheter placement for patients with complex spines.","We are highly encouraged by the strong response to the SMA a clinical community and excellent outcomes that have been achieved to make intrathecal delivery a routine procedure for SMA patients.","Today, we estimate there have been over 30,000 injections of SPINRAZA performed globally and we believe intrathecal injections may become widely used for severe neurological diseases beyond SMA.","As previously communicated, the IND for our SMA gene therapy program is currently on clinical hold in the US. Through additional interactions with the FDA, we have learned that the agency has questions regarding our preclinical data package. We are disappointed with these developments and we are currently assessing options to determine the extent to the viable [ph] path forward.","Beyond SMA, we continue to progress our Phase 1 study of BIIB067 in ALS patients who harbor mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 or SOD1. The genetic cause of familial ALS. BIIB067 is an antisense oligonucleotide designed to directly target and reduce SOD1 expression.","In addition to BIIB067, we have expanded clinical development within genetically defined subpopulations of ALS patients as we build depth in this indication. In collaboration with Ionis, this quarter we dosed the first patient in the Phase 1 trial of BIIB078, an antisense oligonucleotide designed to selectively target hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 gene or C9ORF72, the most common genetic cause of ALS.","BIIB078 selectively target C9ORF72 transcripts that contain hexanucleotide repeat expansions for degradation and may thereby mitigate C9ORF72 mediated pathology. These programs highlight our continued commitment to targeting the genetic origins of severe neurological diseases, including ALS.","Moving to acute neurology. We continue to advance BIIB093, our first-in-class IV glibenclamide therapeutic for the prevention and treatment of cerebral edema associated with large hemisphere infarction.","In the third quarter we dosed the first patient in CHARM, the Phase 3 trial of BIIB093 and we look forward to progressing this novel therapeutic approach in the severe stroke population.","Along with our Phase 2 TMS-007 program, we are encouraged by the potential to advance innovation in this area of significant unmet medical needs. Within neuropathic pain, we recently received the results from the Phase 2b study of vixotrigine or BIIB74 in painful lumbosacral radiculophathy or PLSR.","While the safety data were consistent with the safety profile reported in previous studies, the study did not meet its primary or secondary efficacy endpoints and we will be discontinuing development in this challenging indication. We expect to report more detailed results of this study at a future scientific forum.","We continue to roll a Phase 2 study in small fiber neuropathy. In parallel, we have continued our FDA interactions regarding the design of the potential Phase 3 studies in trigeminal neuralgia. We will delay phase 3 initiation as we await the outcome of these ongoing regulatory interactions, a more detailed review of the PLSR data and insights from the ongoing small fiber neuropathy study.","Outside of our core neuroscience focus, we have continued to advance a small number of legacy programs where the science remains compelling and we believe we can continue to add value.","Earlier today, we announced topline results from a Phase 2b study evaluating the safety and efficacy of dapirolizumab pegol, an anti-CD40 ligand pegylated Fab, in adults with moderately-to-severely active systemic lupus erythematosus despite receiving standard-of-care treatment such as corticosteroids, anti-malarials and non-biological immunosuppressants.","The primary endpoint of the study to demonstrate a dose response at 24 weeks on the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group based Composite Lupus Assessment was not met with a p value of 0.06.","The study did demonstrate consistent and potentially meaningful improvements for the majority of clinical endpoints in patients treated with dapirolizumab pegol compared with placebo.","In addition, biomarker data demonstrated evidence of proof of biology. Dapirolizumab pegol was well tolerated and demonstrated an acceptable safety profile. We continue to further evaluate these data, while assessing potential next steps.","In addition, this quarter we dosed the first patient in the Phase 2b study of BG11 otherwise known as STX-100, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the alpha v beta 6 integrin in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or IPF.","The primary endpoint of this 52 week study is the yearly rate of change and Forced expiratory Vital Capacity and established measure of pulmonary function in IPF.","BG11 previously demonstrated compelling proof of biology via substantial down regulation of the TGF beta pathway in IPF patients, as measured by inhibition of phosphorylated SMAD and alveolar macrophages isolated by bronchoalveolar lavage.","Overall this quarter, the first patient in a Phase 3 stroke study put [ph] a compelling data supporting SPINRAZA is the standard-of-care in SMA, initiated two new clinical trials completed enrolment in two [ph] Phase 2 studies and continue to make rigorous data driven decisions on clinical development across our portfolio.","Our aim is to continue building a portfolio momentum to realize our vision of being the neuroscience leader and transforming the lives of millions of patients living with neurological diseases.","I will now pass the call to Jeff.","Jeff Capello","Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. I'll now review our financial performance for the third quarter of 2013 starting with revenues. Total revenues for the third quarter were $3.4 billion, growing 12% year-over-year.","Starting with our MS franchise revenues. Overall our MS business delivered revenues of $2.3 billion in the third quarter of 2018, including OCREVUS royalties for approximate $137 million. MS revenues in the third quarter of 2018 were down 3% versus the per year with OCREVUS royalties and were relatively stable including OCREVUS royalties.","In the U.S., channel inventory levels were relatively stable for TECFIDERA, AVONEX and PLEGRIDY combined. Versus prior year foreign exchange rates and hedging had a minimal impact on ex U.S. MS product revenues for the third quarter.","Global third quarter TECFIDERA revenues were $1.1 billion, a 2% increase versus the prior year. This included revenues of $842 million in the U.S., an increase of 1% versus the third quarter of 2017 and $248 million outside the U.S., an increase of 6% versus the third quarter of 2017.","On a year-over-year basis, TECFIDERA revenues were relatively stable in the U.S. versus the decline we saw in the first and second quarters. In addition, we were very pleased with TECFIDERA\u2019s performance outside the U.S., driven by year-over-year patient growth across each large European market, solid emerging market growth and particularly strong performance in Japan where TECFIDERA has now reached over 25% market share.","Even though trends outside the U.S. were strong, it's important to note that Q3 x U.S. TECFIDERA revenues were negatively impacted by ongoing price decreases in certain European countries.","TYSABRI world wide revenues were $470 million this quarter, relatively stable versus the third quarter 2017. This included $253 million in U.S. and $217 million outside the U.S. In the U.S. revenues declined 5% versus the prior year, primarily due to the launch of OCREVUS.","TYSABRI\u2019s relative performance continues to improve on a year-over-year basis after declining 8% in the second quarter 2018 and 18% in the first quarter of 2018 versus prior year. Outside the U.S., TYSABRI revenues increased 7% versus the prior year.","TYSABRI patients increased in all major European markets versus prior year except for Germany where we have seen a moderate impact from the launch of OCREVUS. TYSABRI also benefited from strong double-digit patient growth in emerging markets.","Interferon revenues including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY were $590 million from the third quarter, a decrease of 11% versus the third quarter of 2017. This decline was primarily driven by lower volumes, as the market continues to move towards orals and high efficacy therapy's.","Interferon revenues included $421 million in the U.S. and $169 million in sales outside the U.S. Overall, MS revenues, including our royalties on sales of OCREVUS were stable versus prior year.","Moving forward, we expect continued stability through the balance of the year, as we expect the OCREVUS impact to be less significant on a year-over-year basis and we anticipate a moderate inventory channel build in the fourth quarter in the U.S.","Let me now move to SPINRAZA. Global third quarter SPINRAZA revenues were $468 million. This included revenues of $220 formerly in the U.S., representing 9% growth as compared to the second quarter and $244 million outside the U.S., representing 12% growth compared to the second quarter.","The number of patients on therapy in the U.S. increased by over 10%, as compared to the end of the second quarter. Discontinuations remained relatively low and continue to be driven primarily by mortality. We continue to believe there is significant opportunity in adults in the U.S. and are very encouraged by the progress we're making. The number of adults on therapy in the U.S. grew by over 20% versus [ph] the second quarter and in the third quarter are - over half the new patient starts in the U.S. were adults.","In the U.S., we estimate we now have reached approximately 50% of all infants and pediatric patients. And we estimate we've reached approximately 15% of adults, an increase from approximately 10% in the second quarter. We estimate that about a third of our U.S. patients on therapy are now adults.","As a reminder, our data indicate that approximately 5% of the prevalent SMA population are infants, 35% are pediatric patients and 60% are adults, highlighting the large number of untreated adult patients that we believe could benefit from SPINRAZA.","We saw a continued increase in the revenue contribution from maintenance doses this quarter. In U.S. approximately 60% of SPINRAZA units in the third quarter were attributed to maintenance doses, as compared to 55% in the second quarter. In the third quarter the average doses per patient was approximately 1.1, roughly the same as the second quarter.","In the third quarter approximately 15% of U.S. SPINRAZA units were dispensed through our pre-drug program, similar to the second quarter and a decrease from approximately 20% a year ago. We continue to see improved insurance coverage in U.S., as policies broaden their coverage criteria.","We believe the inventory levels for SPINRAZA were relatively flat in the third quarter. We saw an increase in discounts and allowances for approximately 100 basis points versus the second quarter, due primarily to increased treatment through 340B hospitals. If a similar pre-drug percentage is maintained and with continued progress in treating adults, we expect to show stability in U.S. SPINRAZA revenues in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, recognizing there may be some seasonal dynamics impacting quarterly revenue trends.","Outside the U.S., the number of commercial SPINRAZA patients increased approximately 29% versus the prior quarter and there are approximately 290 patients active in the expanded access program. We recorded revenues from over 30 international markets with approximately 75% of ex-U.S. SPINRAZA revenue in the third quarter coming from Germany, Italy, Japan, Brazil, Spain, France and Australia.","We continue to believe that the international opportunity for SPINRAZA is even greater than in U.S., as we continued the momentum of the new country launches and we believe there is significant ex-U.S. opportunity not just in Europe, but also in Asia-Pacific and Latin American markets. We expect to see continued revenue growth ex-U.S. for SPINRAZA in Q4, as patient growth continues, although at a more modest rate in more mature markets.","Let me now move onto our biosimilars business, which generated $135 million in revenue this quarter, a 33% increase versus the prior year. We believe that there are now more than 100,000 patients treated with our biosimilars in Europe.","BENEPALI continues to be the market leader in countries such as the U.K., Denmark and Norway and exceeds 40% volume share in Germany, Italy and Sweden. FLIXABI volumes grew by 19% versus the second quarter, mostly in Italy.","Last week we launched IMRALDI, a biosimilar referencing HUMIRA which is now available to several European markets. Overall we expect relatively stable biosimilars revenue in fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.","Turning to our anti-CD20 revenues. We recorded $512 million in third quarter, an increase of 26% versus the prior year, primarily driven by OCREVUS royalties. This includes our estimated OCREVUS royalties of $137 million for the third quarter. It's important to note that typically the fourth quarter with an inventory drawdown for RITUXAN. In addition, we continue to monitor [ph] potential new biosimilar entrants which could begin impacting RITUXAN revenues in 2019.","Total other revenues were $147 million in the third quarter more than three times what we recorded in the third quarter 2017, as we continue to benefit from greater contract manufacturing.","As a reminder, we believe that the fourth quarter of 2017 revenues were abnormally high due the timing of contract manufacturing, creating a difficult comparison for the fourth quarter this year.","Q3 GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin were 87%, a slight decrease from the second quarter due to higher contract manufacturing. Q3 GAAP non-GAAP R&D expense were both 15% of revenue or $580 million [ph] Q3 GAAP SG&A was $498 million and Q3 non-GAAP SG&A was 495 million, both 14% of revenue.","We expect both R&D and SG&A expense to increase in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter due to the timing of clinical trial expense and market expansion investments, as well seasonality.","GAAP amortization was $282 million, which includes a $189 million impairment related to updates and the development status of [indiscernible] which Mike discussed. The effects of this impairment were partially offset by a $90 billion reduction in our contingent consideration liability.","GAAP other net income was $115 million in the third quarter versus a net expense of $44 million in Q3 of last year. This includes a GAAP only gain of approximately $141 million, related to changes in the fair value of certain equity investments, including shares of Ionis Pharmaceuticals, as of September 30th, 2018.","Non-GAAP other net expense was $26 million in the third quarter versus $44 million in the third quarter of last year. In Q3 our GAAP tax rate was approximately 20% and our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 21%.","Our weighted average diluted share count in the third quarter was approximately 202 million shares. During the quarter, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock. However, our board has authorized a new $3.5 billion share repurchase program.","This now brings us to our diluted earnings per share. In the third quarter we booked GAAP earnings per share with $7.15, an increase of 24% versus last year and non-GAAP earnings per share of $7.40, an increase of 17% versus last year.","We generated approximately $1.7 billion of net cash flows from operations in the third quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.7 billion in cash and marketable securities and $5.9 billion in debt.","We believe we have and will continue to have ample capacity to rescue meaningful future business development and M&A activity, as well as return capital to shareholders. We will continue to be disciplined in our approach and focused on value creation.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Michel for his closing comments.","Michel Vounatsos","Thank you, Jeff. We closed the third quarter with double-digit revenue and earnings growth versus a year ago, an exciting progress across our pipeline. And last week we launched a new biosimilar. Looking forward within the next 12 to 18 months, we expect further progress across our neuroscience pipeline, including Eisai's presentation of the BAN241 data this week at CTAD and assessing next steps.","Data readouts across Alzheimer's, including the final Phase 3 data for aducanumab, as well as MS, PSP, ophthalmology and ALS and filing for regulatory approval in the U.S. for BIIB098 in MS. And using the updated NURTURE data as the most recent example, we continue to see compelling evidence across the neuroscience landscape that leads us to believe we are at the beginning of a period of transformative breakthroughs in the treatment of neurological diseases. We believe we are uniquely positioned to benefit from these potential breakthroughs and Biogen score is to be the long-term leader in neuroscience.","To deliver [ph] on our aspiration we remain focused on executing well on strategic priorities to fortify our in MS and SMA and allocate capital to expand and progress our neuroscience pipeline, while opportunistically returning capital to shareholders.","Finally, I want to reiterate our commitment to maximizing returns to our shareholders and bringing innovative therapies to patients over the long-term. These demands [ph] as we continue to allocate capital efficiently, effectively and appropriately. As we have demonstrated in the past, we will always strive to have an optimal capital structure, as well as aim for super returns from the investment we are making.","Once again, I would like to thank our employees around the world, who are dedicated to making a positive impact on patient\u2019s lives. And all of the physician [indiscernible] and participants in our clinical development programs [ph], our past and future achievements could not be realized without their passion and commitment.","With that, we\u2019ll open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Umer Raffat","Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Michel, I think we've all asked Biogen's R&D leaders on this in the past and I'm curious to get your view on this, which is, do you think BAN2401s previously reported results at higher doses were entirely driven by a baseline imbalance on care status?. And based on everything we've seen to date, is Biogen willing to pay for Phase 2 and BAN or is there a way to opt out?","Michel Vounatsos","Thanks for the question, Umer. We have seen the data obviously, but we have two days to wait for the 25th in Barcelona. So we have to be patient and Eisai\u2019s presentation we give a slide on the next steps. Please understand. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Geoff Meacham","Hey, guys. Good morning and thanks for the question. On aducanumab looking at the 3Q slides versus prior periods, this is the first time you guys have noticed that the Phase 3 data for ENGAGE and EMERGE is \u201cfinal\u201d. Am I reading too much into that? I am just thinking about the willingness to take an interim look? And related on the EVOLVE study, what was the driver for initiating the Phase 2, was it regulatory ongoing analysis or just - a Phase 3 or is it pre-planned? Thank you.","Al Sandrock","Hi Geoff, its Al Sandrock. Well, I wouldn't read too much into that statement about final analysis. We're not commenting on whether or not we're going to do an interim analysis and help you understand the main reason for that is that we want to maintain clinical trial integrity.","On the drivers for EVOLVE, it really wasn't driven by a regulatory request. It was our desire to see whether or not MRI monitoring was necessary. So in this study you know, what we're looking - what we're doing is, all symptomatic ARIA is being addressed the way it is now in the current clinical trials.","It's really how you deal with the asymptomatic ARIA, which is what the study is looking at and whether or not the MRI monitoring that's being done is actually necessary. And so that's the main purpose.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Leerink. Please go ahead.","Geoffrey Porges","Thank you very much for taking my quick question, Just a couple of data ones. Could you clarify the contribution of net price to your U.S. market and product performance? And then secondly, could you give us some commentary on SPINRAZA treatment persistence by Type 1, Type 2 and Type 3 patients so far? Thanks.","Jeff Capello","Hi, Geoff. Its Jeff. So from a pricing perspective in U.S. and MS, we had a slight benefit from a pricing perspective in the U.S. that benefited our products within the quarter based on pricing increases earlier in the year.","Al Sandrock","And Geof, just commenting on the question on SPINRAZA treatment persistence across SMA types. In our experience, essentially there's been a very durable and persistent treatment effect of SPINRAZA across all types.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Matthew Harrison","Great, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, I was hoping for a little bit more clarity on what was going on with the SMA gene therapy product and maybe specifically if you could also address that do you think the preclinical observations are centered specifically on this program or do they impact your broader gene therapy pipeline? Thanks.","Al Sandrock","Hi, Matthew. I'll take that question. I mean, we're not really going to comment on ongoing FDA interactions. I would say of course those interactions are program specific, but we won't really discuss details about those interactions at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ying Huang","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. To an extent you can comment - can you confirm whether you will interact with FDA about BAN2401 for Phase 3 strategy or even filing for that based on Phase 2b or not. If you cannot answer that, I would like to ask a question about SMA. We have seen data from both Roche and Norvartis on their oral programs, given the setback of you gene therapy program, does that change your strategy about future development in SMA, trying to maintain a leadership here? Thanks.","Al Sandrock","Hi. This is Al. I\u2019ll take the first part. We're not commenting on regulatory interactions, that we\u2019re basically in the middle of right now, so I can't answer your first question, sorry.","Michael Ehlers","And I'll take the question on the Roche oral and SMA commitment, I mean just to be completely clear we remain highly committed to SMA. We follow other programs and experimental therapeutics and development. We are aware of the data that Roche and PTC have presented around their oral compound.","We know that the field is very interested in the long-term safety and tolerability of that compound as are we. I would say that our - the most recent NURTURE data that I mentioned really highlights the compelling efficacy profile of SPINRAZA and you know, when we look across just the clinical experience to date, I would remind that while we were very interested in - I think it's roughly 21 Type 1, 35 Type 2, Type 3 patients in the Roche PTC study, it had nearly 6000 patients for close to up to six years in some instances of patients on SPINRAZA. So we have the largest body of clinical evidence for any SMA therapy.","Michel Vounatsos","If I may, this is Michel. I just wanted to add that we are adding momentum in the U.S. in penetrating the idle h population. And this was unsure at the beginning of the year, uncertain at the beginning of the year and ex-U.S. we have staggering launches in different geographies and if in some, we may see some of the effect we are seeing in the U.S., following the first year of dosing. There are plenty of countries that are being here where we are launching.","We just filed in China, for example, we are unlocking patient population also in Latin America. We are doing extremely well in Japan and continue to well in core Europe. So the momentum is good, but again, the biggest satisfaction is the implementation capability in the U.S. in the 65% of the market that has adult [ph] population.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Cory Kasimov","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you can comment on the 2019 pricing outlook for your MS franchise based on your formulary negotiations? Thanks.","Michel Vounatsos","Unfortunately we will not be able to comment on price. We see the magnitude and the frequency of price being taken in the marketplace in the past, but we cannot comment on the future. Thanks for understanding.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Michael Yee","Great. Thanks for the question. Question on biosimilars. You made a comment that obviously you are launching the HUMIRA biosimilar, but that fourth quarter I guess, biosimilars would be stable. Can you just comment on A, your outlook on a HUMIRA biosimilar versus the type of business you're doing Enbrel business?","And then more importantly, where do you think this $500 million business can go over the next few years, given you've obviously made some bullish comments on that? Thanks.","Michael Ehlers","So Michael, we\u2019re pretty excited about the launch, the team has already hit the ground. I think they're very well-prepared and we'll see some contribution, we believe in the in the fourth quarter. You know, a lot of those contracts, big contracts in Europe are tenders that take a little bit while to kind of ramp up. That's why you won't see as much of an impact in the fourth or quarter.","There's also some pricing pressure across some of the other two lines that we\u2019re - there on. So it kind of negates the benefit we'll get - expect to get from a morality perspective. But we think this business has the opportunity to potentially double over the next couple of years based on morality and we'd like as we said before based on a relationship with Bioepis to add more compounds. So we believe that this is a good growth opportunity for us and we're quite excited about the future.","Michel Vounatsos","So this is not the first entity in there that is being launched in Europe, this is the third one. And I would say the purchase pattern and the journey is well set for those countries in terms of two big categories. The one that \u2013 from tenders and the one for which decision is left more the physician levels. So we anticipate that to be adalimumab biosimilar we\u2019ll penetrate [ph] at least as strong as the previous one, even stronger.","And I would like to remind you that we are the only company having the three anti-TNFs in the marketplace. So the team is already motivated, supply is ready and while we speak prescriptions are going up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Phil Nadeau","Morning. Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask another one on SPINRAZA competition. It sounds like your expectations for growth for SPINRAZA, especially in the U.S. are largely from the adult population, it does seem like Roche and PTC with an oral compound could have a key differentiating feature for that population. So how do you see competition coming in \u2013 in the adult population and how could you differentiate SPINRAZA for those patients? Thanks.","Michael Ehlers","So Phil, maybe I'll start another may have a comment here too. I mean, in essence we \u2013 we\u2019re very confident in what we see with the clinical data on SPINRAZA. We're encouraged by the - the ongoing studies in teens and adults that we see in the access, including in complex spine patients, SPINRAZA. But we're very aware of the other competitive programs out there. It's early days and in lot of those.","And like I mentioned we know the field is very interested in the long-term safety and tolerability of the orals. We know that there are questions around the dose selection that will ultimately be used there. And to date it's a relatively small number of patients, but we are certainly staying aware of it.","Michel Vounatsos","So we were able somehow together with the physicians to deliver 30,000 dosing of SPINRAZA during the past month is because in real world there is an efficacy perception at the patient level. So its an efficacy play for those patients who are just the right [indiscernible] and the convenience comes after, this is what is being was backed by the customers.","So with 3000 patients being dosed and more than 300 patients in clinical trial, we had a body of evidence that is still difficult to match for the time being.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with UBS. Please go ahead.","Carter Gould","Morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess for Jeff or Michel, just on the BASR versus committing for BD [ph], obviously, you\u2019ve been pretty active so far this year on the BD front. So maybe just kind of how you see that balance and I guess looking out the next sort of 12 to 18 months, how you see that may be evolving? Thank you.","Jeff Capello","Yes. So thanks for the question. So you know, I think the nice position we're in is given our cash flows, we generate $1.7 billion of cash flow for the quarter again which is strong cash flow and given our net debt position. We have the luxury of being able to do both, both to invest in the business from a pipeline perspective and return capital to shareholders.","So we've now done eight acquisitions and licensing type deals\/acquisitions since Michel is been CEO, so we\u2019re very encouraged by that and we expect to do more. A lot of that been done kind of in the - in the early to mid stage. We'd love to get something later stage done.","But we also have ample cash capacity to return capital to shareholders. We bought back $10 billion of stock over the last couple of years and I would just remind investors that we have a new $3.5 billion share repurchase program that the board has recently authorized.","So we have ample capacity to do both. Certainly we would be a preference to get more done in the pipeline and get more done that\u2019s later stage. So certainly that would be kind of the focus or the preference, but we have the capacity to do both.","Michel Vounatsos","So if you look at the momentum that Biogen is able to deliver, year-to-date, if I am not mistaken is 12% on the topline and with leverage P&L. This was not anticipated two years ago because of OCREVUS launch, because of limited potential of SPINRAZA, because of neglected biosimilars and the rest.","And here we are. So we're not on a burning platform and the level of rigor and alignment to the strategy, to the scientific validity, to the IP and to financials criteria remained very rigorous within the organization and even more importantly, we have some very important readouts in the coming months. So in the meantime we deliver, we tightened the belt and we're evaluating opportunities, but in a very best manner.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Salim Syed with Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Salim Syed","Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. This one's for probably Mike or Al, just on the XLRS gene therapy program. Can you confirm that we're still getting topline data in the fourth quarter of this year? And what are you looking for in terms of deeming the trial a success? Thank you.","Al Sandrock","Yes. So thanks for the question on this. So you know, right now on the XLRS program, we recall that this is a collaborative program with AGTC. The kind Phase1\/2 trial is ongoing. This is an adult subsequent [ph] XLRS and at the moment we are anticipating that we could get a data readout projected in the first part of next year or so.","But of course, these are always dependent on timing and enrolment of the right subjects. We're also very interested in no differences for example in the adult versus pediatric population this disease or some heterogeneity. As you may know in kind of the path of - pathology in XLRS because it has to do with exact location of the retina, specific visual endpoints you need and so forth. But to date the program is on track.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Citi. Please go ahead.","Robyn Karnauskas","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So from your from your presentation it's \u2013 there is a lot on your pipeline, that it feels like you're focused on \u2013 and just trying to understand a little bit, as we see all these reads that are going to come out over the next 12 to 18 months, excluding Alzheimer's programs, which do you think have been the greatest ability to have a read to Phase 3. In other words, like - will give you the most confidence that there is a real proof of concepts or proof of potential success for those indications, as historically we know if something works for Biogen with your leverage the stock's ability to go up a lot. So help us understand which are those you think are the least risky and have the greatest read to the next stage of development?","Michael Ehlers","Okay. So this is Michael. I'll try to take some of that. Thank you by the way for the question. I mean, as we show - I mentioned and so we do have a number of upcoming data readouts at different stages across the pipeline that have, I\u2019d say different ramifications. A few things that we noted there is that we will start getting data on our BIIB67, SOD1 ALS program either towards the end of the year or early next year.","This we think will be important primarily as a second leasing ASO program, in this case an adult indication with a different mechanism of action in the RNase H mediated knockdown of a pathological gene target. So we're very interested to see the biomarker and potential clinical efficacy data from that.","That likewise has the potential to influence our thinking on other genetic targeted ASO programs like BIIB078, like I mentioned C9ORF72 positive ALS, as well as our tau ASO program which is currently in Phase 1 study in Alzheimer's disease.","But I see there are more. We are - we have been very successful in advancing our BIIB092 program in progressive super nuclear policy. This is obviously a rare severe orphan disease. So I think this could give us an accelerator opportunity.","And beyond that we're \u2013 we\u2019ve initiated our Phase 3 study in BIIB093, so that will be ongoing. And although it's really first of its kind you know, we're very encouraged by the responsive side. And of course, you know, we announced that earlier this year that we completed enrolment in ENGAGE and EMERGE - aducanumab which is an 18 month dosing period study. That among others I think constitute an array of upcoming data readouts and have the potential to create significant excitement.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Ronny Gal","Good morning, everybody and thank you for hitting me in. Two questions for Mike on the pipeline. Mike, first the BIIB104 AMPA regulator. AMPA is been particularly difficult target to drug. Can you discuss a little bit how you convinced yourself you can avoid the toxicity that has been seen with this target before?","And second about 093 [ph] glyburide program. Essentially, is this one of those programs that has the potential of reading out early? Is there interim analysis here? You kind of think about stroke or something you can accumulate there pretty quickly, how you're thinking about a potential of this program to actually readout head of time?","Michael Ehlers","Okay, thanks, Ronny for the questions and I\u2019ll try to take these briefly. On BIIB104 what we were encouraged by there was - was really a quite differentiated and tight pharmacokinetic profile and safety profile that have been reserved both pre-clinically and clinically. It was really quite different from previous or earlier generation AMPA PAMs. So to date the clinical and preclinical data that have been seen have supported a favorable tolerability profile, as well as showing indications of efficacy in a few different clinical studies and of different designs in the domain of working memory and cognition.","So we think there are differentiating features that have to do with some of the very specific pharmacology of this compound versus others previously in the class. So we think is differentiated.","On BIIB093, we won't talk about an interim analysis on that, but I would say is that we have had a very strong response on site engagement, site activation and investigator interests because obviously there has been really no alternative for patients having a large hemispheric infarc.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terence Finn with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Terence Finn","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just first on the financials, I was wondering if you can help us think about your tax rate heading into \u201919, you guys - it looks like you\u2019ve continue to bring that lower throughout the course of the year. And then any guidance on the operating margins for the biosimilars franchise that you can offer at this point?","And then just one on the pipeline for 8700, you mentioned some new endpoints in that study. Can you just review what changed there? Thanks.","Jeff Capello","Thanks. So with regard to the tax rate, we're currently running at low 20% tax rate, as I mentioned in the script. We did mention when tax reform first got implemented that we expected the tax rate to come down again in 2019, as a result of some accounting factors that are more unique to kind of how our tax works around the world. We still expect that to be the case and we'll be able to provide you a more specific expectation on that when we release guidance in January for 2019.","In terms of operating expenses, as I mentioned you know, we expect the fourth quarter to tick up a little bit as we continue to invest in the pipeline and drives some of the growth that we're seeing from a commercial perspective in SMA. We're still in the middle of kind of going through our planning process for next year.","What I can share with you is based on the strength of our lean and simple cost savings initiative, we expect to take money out of kind of the G&A area and invest that back into the pipeline, grow our spend and our and our projects with regard to R&D. So we are very committed to that continuing to increase the innovation in neurology of the company.","Michael Ehlers","So I think it was a question on 8700, I am going to interpret that as BIIB098.","Michel Vounatsos","Yes.","Michael Ehlers","If that's not asking, but I\u2019ll just say that on BIIB098 we have used data from the Part A of the study to inform Part B where we've expanded the patient - patient number in the head to head study against TECFIDERA, where again we anticipate that we'll be able to file on this data this year looking an approval potentially in the first half of next year or mid next year.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Chris Raymond","Thanks for squeezing me in. Yes, just another question on BIIB098. Just on the strategy here, I do think this launch could be kind of unique. So you filing under 505 B2 pathway, but you will have a head to head versus TECFIDERA on tolerability, which you talked about. Some of our work indicates that you know that's kind of you know one of the bigger reasons for discontinuation of TECFIDERA tolerability issue.","So if BIIB098 sort of repeat the clinical data we've seen so far that should address you know, essentially a big issue of TECFIDERA. So how do you approach the marketing and positioning of this drug and how should we think about these two drugs coexisting over time?","And then also just on that point, I think in your slide you guys talk about a 2020 approval, but I think I just heard you guys mentioned that or maybe second half 2019 approval, can you sort of talk about that timing? Thanks.","Michel Vounatsos","Thanks for the great question. And the first I would like to say that we are pleased with the momentum behind TEC . I think this is important. So TEC will remain always front end center. We are doing well. We grow the volume even if we price, we face some crushing pressure in part of the world like in Europe and we have increasing competition.","So BIIB098 will offer the opportunity eventually to have a an upgrade in terms of safety profile and GI safety and this will be eventually the low hanging fruit that we aim to move further. And the team is working towards the longer term lifecycle management opportunities that these product offers beyond the fumarate. So is what we're working on.","But we are very excited about this opportunity and to expand our leading share of orals, but beyond the fumarate market. So looking forward to this filing and potentially launch towards the end of \u201819 or early 2020.","Michel Vounatsos","So at this stage, I would like to close the call by saying a very exciting times that Biogen we are looking forward to the data readouts and I thank you all for attending our call today. Have a good day.","Matt Calistri","Thank you for joining today's call. Before we conclude, I would like to remind everyone that we plan to host three webcast from CTAD later this week, on Thursday October 25th at 730 a.m. Eastern Time.

My name is Tiffany, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Idec Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Claudine Prowse, you may begin your conference.","Claudine Prowse","Thank you. Thank you, Tiffany, and welcome to Biogen Idec's Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogenidec.com to find the press release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures that we'll discuss today.","Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results, which we believe better represents the ongoing economics of our business and reflects how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call.","I would like to point out that we'll be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from our expectations. I encourage everyone to consult our SEC filings for additional detail.","On today's call, I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. George Scangos; Tony Kingsley, EVP of Global Commercial Operations; Dr. Doug Williams, EVP of Research and Development; and our CFO, Paul Clancy.","I'll now turn the call over to George.","George A. Scangos","Okay, thanks, Claudine. Look, this is a very strong quarter for Biogen Idec, and I believe it represents the beginning of a new era that includes increased economic participation in TYSABRI, the launch of TECFIDERA and the anticipated launch of 3 additional products next year.","So revenues for the quarter were $1.7 billion, up 21%, and non-GAAP earnings were $2.30 per share, up 26% compared to the second quarter of 2012. These great results stem from the revenues from our entire portfolio of MS products, including AVONEX, TYSABRI and now TECFIDERA.","AVONEX continues to be a very strong part of the business. We're still early in the launch of TECFIDERA, but AVONEX appears to be holding up well in this new competitive environment. And we believe that the interferon franchise will be strengthened even more next year with the anticipated launch of PLEGRIDY.","Although TYSABRI had a somewhat challenging quarter, in part, due to the introduction of TECFIDERA and also, the financial dynamics that Paul will discuss later in the call, we believe that the efficacy of TYSABRI will result in increasing usage in the future. We believe the recognition of the importance of treating MS aggressively and early, the increasing in understanding of risk stratification, the high level of efficacy and the potential of TYSABRI in other indications all bode well for its long-term growth, and we're optimistic about the future of TYSABRI.","The launch of TECFIDERA in the U.S. has gone very well, which we believe reflects a broad recognition among physicians and patients that this is a unique product. According to IMS, TECFIDERA outperformed all other MS drugs in the first 3 months after launch.","We believe that the excitement about TECFIDERA stems from a combination of factors, including its product profile as an oral therapy with strong efficacy and solid safety; our reputation in, and understanding of, the MS market; and very strong execution on the part of our U.S. commercial organization. We overcame some early logistical challenges that resulted from the unexpectedly high early demand, and we now believe that we're on a very solid trajectory and are excited about the future of the drug.","So in the U.S., we're off to a great start, and recent approvals in Canada and Australia just add to the momentum. TECFIDERA is an exciting product that, we believe, has the potential to shift the paradigm of treatment for MS patients.","So now let me comment briefly on the E.U. situation. As you know, on May 30, we announced that our plans to launch TECFIDERA in Europe had been delayed to allow us to make TECFIDERA's entitlement to regulatory data protection clearer at the time of launch. At the time, we said that we believe that we were entitled to regulatory data protection, and we continue to believe so. Our process to clarify regulatory data protection is moving along, but it's taking a little longer than we thought it would when we made the announcement on May 30, and it's difficult to handicap the precise timing or the potential outcome of our efforts.","So we recognize that any delay of a valuable therapy like TECFIDERA is frustrating for patients, for physicians, our shareholders. We'd like to be more transparent about the process. We believe that would not be in all of our collective interest and could impact our ultimate success, and so we're not going to give any more details at this time.","We do have patents covering TECFIDERA in E.U., and we believe that they're strong. However, in Europe, it's more difficult than it is in the U.S. to obtain injunctive relief that would prevent others from free-riding on our investments while we enforce our IP. Consequently, we believe that it is important to launch with both intellectual property and regulatory data protection, and we're working to achieve that outcome.","So let me now move on to our other products. In the second quarter, we also made excellent progress toward the potential launch of 3 additional therapies over the next year. Our PLEGRIDY marketing applications were recently accepted by both the FDA and EMA. If approved, we believe PLEGRIDY could provide patients an efficacious treatment option with less frequent dosing and an innovative autoinjector, which may position it as a preferred interferon treatment option.","We believe that the first-line injectable products, including the interferon and Copaxone, will increasingly compete on convenience, as has been exemplified by the success of the AVONEX PEN. PLEGRIDY may have the potential to become the leading drug in this class. We expect PLEGRIDY to launch in the middle of next year in the U.S.","We've also been focused on the registration of our long-lasting recombinant hemophilia product candidates, ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE, for the treatment of hemophilia B and hemophilia A, respectively. We believe that our innovative biologics have the potential to transform hemophilia care by addressing the biggest unmet need for these patients, which is a reduction in the frequency of IV injections. We believe that each of these products offers a substantial value proposition for patients and has the potential to provide improved and a reduced treatment burden. Both are under review by the FDA, and we anticipate product launches in the first half of next year.","Although hemophilia is a new therapeutic area for Biogen, we believe that we are well positioned. We expect to be the first to market with highly differentiated long-lasting products. We bring great expertise in biologics manufacturing, process sciences and specialty markets commercialization. And we've built a hemophilia organization comprised of many individuals with years of experience in the treatment of hemophilia. So although the company is new to the field, our employees are not. They know the field, and the field knows them. With the anticipated approval of these products next year, we believe that we're prepared to bring important new therapies to the many patients who need them.","So I'll now turn the call over to Tony Kingsley to discuss in detail the commercial results this quarter.","Tony Kingsley","Thanks, George. Our commercial performance during the second quarter was strong. In Q2, we were successful in driving our longer-term goal of growing total MS patient share across our entire franchise. Q2 was the first quarter of TECFIDERA commercialization in the U.S., and we've been very pleased with the launch to date.","The U.S. commercial organization planned and executed very well. As expected, there was significant physician and patient excitement about the TECFIDERA product profile. In addition, we believe the 3 months launch delay caused by the PDUFA extension and extensive media coverage led to heightened market awareness, which further increased demand for the product at launch. This pent-up demand accounted for a meaningful portion of the uptake observed during the quarter.","In the upcoming quarters, we expect TECFIDERA new prescription volume to remain healthy but will moderate to more closely reflect the underlying patient start and switch dynamics of the MS market. Over 3,500 physicians have prescribed TECFIDERA today. Approximately 1\/4 of TECFIDERA patients were not on prior therapy, while approximately 3\/4 switched from other disease-modifying MS therapies. The source of switches appears roughly in line with the market shares of MS therapies.","Early in the U.S. launch, a high number of JCV antibody-positive TYSABRI patients switched to TECFIDERA. But more recently, switching from TYSABRI has been more in line with market share. We believe that physician and patient reports of their experience with TECFIDERA have generally been favorable. While as expected, flushing and GI-related tolerability issues have been reported. From our discussions with prescribing physicians, we believe these issues are largely viewed as manageable. And we believe that very few patients, so far, have discontinued therapy because of tolerability.","So after a very strong start, we continue to believe maximizing TECFIDERA performance over the longer term will require a strong and sustained commercial effort in what remains a very competitive market. And our focus has been on 2 areas: physician awareness and streamlining patient access. Our physician awareness efforts have been robust as our sales forces achieved its early goals of driving significant reach and frequency in physician calls to communicate TECFIDERA's product profile. And the early breadth of physician prescribing speaks to that.","We also continue to work to improve patient access to TECFIDERA. As we expected, many plans have been aggressive with placing usage restrictions on TECFIDERA, including prior authorizations and step-edits, which creates delays in getting patients started on drug and short-term frustrations for both patients and physicians offices. Our advantage market teams are in active discussions with payers to continue to improve formulary access.","On the government payer side, TECFIDERA was successfully added to the federal health care programs and is available through Medicare Part D, Medicaid and the DA. However, each Part D plan and state has its own process for updating its formulary.","Turning to AVONEX. We were pleased with AVONEX Q2 performance. For the quarter, global AVONEX revenues increased 2% versus the prior year. Globally, AVONEX gained market share year-to-date within the injectable class, driven by strong commercial execution, as well as continued interest in the AVONEX PEN, as convenience continues to be a key differentiator in the injectable segment.","Moving to TYSABRI. Second quarter global in-market sales decreased by 2% versus the prior year. As I mentioned, in the U.S., a significant number of higher-risk TYSABRI patients transitioned to TECFIDERA, which slowed TYSABRI growth despite the fact that we believe we are continuing to generate solid demand.","During the quarter, approximately 2\/3 of the patients who discontinued TYSABRI stayed within our franchise and started TECFIDERA. This creates another issue that we are well aware of and prepared for. Given that well over 1,000 higher-risk patients have transitioned from TYSABRI to TECFIDERA, we expect to see a number of cases of PML in these patients, just as has been observed in TYSABRI patients who have switched to other therapies. We believe that our competition will try to make an issue out of this, but we believe the physician community expects it. Our Medical Affairs team is having discussions with physicians, and we believe we are ready.","In the E.U., we observed some softness in TYSABRI growth due to oral competition. Continued strong commercial focus on TYSABRI's high efficacy and differentiated product profile, coupled with risk stratification, remain very important to the success of this product. Overall, I'm very pleased with the execution of our commercial team and believe our MS franchise is well positioned for continued success.","We have said we believe TECFIDERA will become the leading oral treatment, and we've now seen TECFIDERA's trajectory exceed all previous MS launches. As a result, we believe our MS franchise now has the leading market share, both in the U.S. and globally. We know future success is not assured, so we're focused on continuing our strong commercial execution and preparation for our upcoming launches.","I'll now turn the call over to Doug to discuss our recent R&D activities.","Douglas Edward Williams","Thanks, Tony. This has been another productive and eventful quarter for our R&D organization. We presented data at a number of medical meetings on our diverse, late-stage and Commercial portfolio while advancing our early- to mid-stage pipeline. We believe our pipeline is maturing nicely and with 3 potential new product launches in 2014 and multiple pivotal and proof-of-concept readouts expected behind those, our underlying drivers of growth continue to look solid.","Our 2 product candidates for hemophilia: ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE, are hopefully our next products to reach the market. We, along with our partner, Sobi, presented over 30 abstracts and gave 10 oral presentations on these products at the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis Meeting, reinforcing the value proposition that we believe each of these products may potentially bring to patients. New data highlighted efficacy and safety findings, including the control of bleeding during and after surgery and the treatment of acute bleeding episodes.","Data were also presented on the ability to assay ALPROLIX levels in patients, potentially enabling customized patient dosing regimens. We anticipate data from our ongoing ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX pediatric studies in 2014. We believe positive data from these pediatric studies should enable product submissions with the EMA, and the opportunity to seek expanded labeling for pediatric populations with the FDA.","During the quarter, we also presented additional new data on TECFIDERA at the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers meeting, confirming that the majority of flushing and GI symptoms were mild to moderate in nature, and demonstrating that aspirin has the potential to be effective in diminishing flushing-related adverse events.","In addition, a recently published Journal of Neurology manuscript examining subgroups from the Phase III DEFINE study, demonstrated that TECFIDERA was consistently effective across a broad set of patients with different demographic and disease characteristics.","It's also been a busy quarter for TYSABRI, as we continue to focus on TYSABRI's powerful efficacy as its key differentiating factor, and the JCV assay as an effective patient management tool. At the European Neurology Society meeting, we presented preliminary TYSABRI-related data, showing that JCV antibody index levels correlate with PML risk in certain patients with no prior immunosuppressant use. The index is a reflection of antibody titer, and certain patients with higher titers appear to have increased PML risk. This research may allow further refinement of the PML risk stratification tools already in broad clinical use and may allow better management of TYSABRI patients.","We also submitted an application for marketing authorization for TYSABRI in Japan, and we anticipate approval in the first half of 2014. Enrollment of the Phase III ASCEND trial, evaluating TYSABRI and SPMS, was also completed in the second quarter.","We continue to make progress with our mid-stage pipeline and expect 3 pivotal readouts over the next 3 years: daclizumab in 2014, TYSABRI and SPMS in 2015 and potentially, SMNRx in 2016. During that time frame, we also expect to have meaningful data readouts from our early-stage programs, including: neublastin for neuropathic pain, STX-100 for IPF, BIIB037 for Alzheimer's disease, anti-CD40 ligand in SLE, anti-TWEAK in lupus nephritis and Anti-LINGO in acute optic neuritis and relapsing MS. So we believe we're on track to continue to bring new important medicines to patients in areas of high unmet need and further ensure that we have major value drivers going forward.","I'll now pass the call to Paul to discuss our financial results.","Paul J. Clancy","Thanks, Doug. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.06 in the second quarter. The differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results are outlined in the earnings presentation. The primary differences include $79 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles, $5 million in fair value adjustments for contingent consideration, and $2 million related to stock compensation expense. This was partially offset by the tax impact on these items.","Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the second quarter were $2.30. As has been the case over the last couple of quarters, we experienced a couple of puts and takes within the P&L. Of note was the benefit of approximately $82 million of revenue related to TECFIDERA inventory, which added approximately $0.20 to our diluted EPS. And we made progress towards settling our TYSABRI pricing dispute with the Italian National Medicines Agency or AIFA. I'll talk in more detail about these as I walk down the P&L.","Total revenue for the second quarter grew 21% to $1.7 billion. Q2 AVONEX worldwide revenue grew 2% to $774 million, as unit volume was flat versus prior year. In the U.S., AVONEX revenue grew 3% in Q2 to $479 million. U.S. unit volumes decreased 5% versus prior year, partially attributable to patients transitioning to TECFIDERA. And U.S. inventory at wholesalers for AVONEX ended at approximately 2 weeks this quarter.","Internationally, Q2 AVONEX revenue was $295 million, a decrease of 1% compared to prior year. International AVONEX unit volume increased 3% versus prior year. Foreign exchange and hedging impact had a minimal impact this quarter, although compared to a gain of $10 million in the second quarter of 2012.","TYSABRI worldwide in-market sales were $387 million in the second quarter, down 2%. I'll point out 2 items of note: first, the U.S. was unfavorably impacted by channel swings; and second, the international TYSABRI revenue situation was unfavorably impacted by the additional expense related to AIFA.","Second quarter in-market U.S. TYSABRI revenue was $218 million, an increase of 3%. Q2 U.S. unit volume decreased 5% versus prior year. Recall, during the first quarter of 2013, we increased inventory levels in anticipation of the asset transfer from Elan to Biogen Idec. This equated to in-market revenues of approximately $26 million, increasing Q1 and depressing Q2. Q2 international TYSABRI revenue was $169 million.","Earlier this month, we agreed, in principle, with the pricing committee of AIFA to settle all claims related to the ongoing pricing dispute. This settlement is subject to approval by the Italian national authorities and the AIFA board, which we expect later this year. The result, from an accounting perspective, is that we have a charge in Q2 to revenue, and anticipate a benefit later this year.","Specifically, TYSABRI product revenues were negatively impacted this quarter as we recorded a liability of approximately $20 million for a portion of this settlement. We recorded this adjustment as the likelihood of making a payment to settle AIFA's claims was now probable and the amount could be estimated.","Given the standards for revenue recognition, the remaining portion of the settlement will be recorded upon approval as a net benefit to revenue. We anticipate recording this revenue benefit of at least $80 million in the fourth quarter.","Now moving to TECFIDERA. Second quarter TECFIDERA, its first quarter on the market, was strong as we reported $192 million of revenue. While we don't plan to provide TECFIDERA patient numbers, I do want to note that the IMS data, to date, has been a good representation of unit demand this quarter.","In the quarter, TECFIDERA results include an inventory build, as approximately $82 million of revenue remained in the distribution channel at the end of the quarter. Wholesalers and specialty pharmacies built inventories in anticipation of patient demand to ensure patients experienced limited disruptions in drug supply. Absent this inventory build, it was still a very strong quarter for TECFIDERA as we estimate revenue generated from underlying patient demand was approximately $110 million.","FAMPYRA revenue was $17 million while FUMADERM revenues were $16 million. U.S. RITUXAN sales were $811 million in the second quarter. Our profit share and expense reimbursement from the U.S. business was $271 million for the second quarter. And royalties and profit-sharing sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. were $18 million. This resulted in $289 million of revenue from unconsolidated joint business in the second quarter. Royalties were $38 million, and we recorded $11 million of corporate partner revenue in Q2.","Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q2 non-GAAP cost of goods sold were $231 million or 13% of revenues. This increase relates to the TYSABRI contingent payments, as well as 100% of the third-party TYSABRI royalties, which are now booked through cost of goods sold.","Q2 non-GAAP R&D expense was $327 million or 19% of revenues. Q2 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $430 million or 25% of revenues, an increase of 43% over last year, driven by increased costs associated with the TECFIDERA launch. Other income and expense was an expense of $10 million. Our second quarter non-GAAP tax rate was 24%. And in the second quarter, our weighted average diluted shares were 239 million, and we ended the quarter with $775 million in cash and marketable securities, bringing us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $2.30 for the second quarter.","Now turning to our full year 2013 guidance. We're increasing our guidance, largely the result of the strengths seen early in the TECFIDERA launch, modestly offset by the impact on our other MS therapies. We now expect total revenue growth of approximately 22% to 23%. As George mentioned, given the prolongation and uncertainty of the E.U. process, we do not expect TECFIDERA E.U. revenue to be meaningful in 2013. For TYSABRI, our prior guidance had assumed an AIFA settlement in 2013. We're pleased by the recent decision and expect to record a revenue benefit of at least $80 million in the fourth quarter of this year.","Moving to the expense lines of the P&L. We anticipate cost of goods sold to be between 13% and 14% of sales. R&D expense is expected to be between 21% and 23% of sales. Our balance of year R&D forecast continues to include up to $75 million earmarked for potential new business development opportunities, and up to $35 million in anticipated upfront and milestone payments in the second half. SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 24% to 26% of total revenue.","We continue to see 2013 as an investment year in SG&A, building out the commercial efforts for TECFIDERA and prelaunch efforts for hemophilia in the U.S. And we continue to expect SG&A leverage post-2013. Our effective tax rate in 2013 is expected to be between 22% and 24% of pretax income. For the balance of year, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 25% and 26%, driven by a larger percentage of our revenues being generated in the U.S. As a result, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share results between $8.25 and $8.50 and GAAP earnings per share to be between $7.28 and $7.53.","I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments.","George A. Scangos","Okay. Thanks, Paul. This was an excellent quarter for Biogen Idec. TECFIDERA's launch has gone very well, and we believe that TECFIDERA is on its way to becoming the major drug that provides solid efficacy and a good safety profile to large numbers of MS patients. We continue to believe in the future of TYSABRI, and are working to make sure that patients and physicians understand the value that the product brings to patients in need of high efficacy treatment.","AVONEX continues to do well, and we believe our interferon franchise should be strengthened even further next year with the anticipated launch of PLEGRIDY. So as we've said many times, we believe that we're well positioned in MS with leading drugs in the oral category, the high efficacy category and the injectable category.","Beyond MS, ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX are now under active review, also with anticipated U.S. launches next year. We believe that these products have the potential to transform hemophilia care, and we're excited about their potential. Our pipeline continues to move forward, and we expect to have meaningful readouts of pivotal and proof-of-concept trials in each of the next several years. So we're at the beginning of a new era for Biogen Idec. We're a global leader in MS, and our goal is to strengthen our position even further, at the same time as we expand into new indications.","It's an exciting time to be here. We've accomplished a lot, but we fully recognize that we have a lot of work ahead of us. We know that if we execute well, our future is likely to be bright. We're working hard, staying focused and making sure that we achieve our ambitious goals. Achievement of our goals, to date, is the result of a lot of effort and dedication on the part of all the employees of Biogen Idec, and I want to take this opportunity to publicly thank all of them.","And with that, we'll open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","A limit to 1 is going to be very difficult for me, but I will do my best. Maybe for Paul, can you tell us how many weeks of TECFIDERA were in the channel and whether or not you expect there to be any kind of a drawdown in 3Q and -- or if you think that these are the right levels? And then, just a related question on the tax rate, I thought TECFIDERA was domiciled the IP was domiciled overseas. So profits generated on that, no matter where you sold it, would be a little bit lower. Can you just clarify that situation?","Paul J. Clancy","Excellent. Thanks for the 2 questions, Mark.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","That was 1.","Paul J. Clancy","1.5. Yes, so look, we certainly wanted to go out of our way to point that the breakout between TECFIDERA channel inventory and in-market patient demand. I think people got that pretty clearly, it appears to me. By definition, the weeks in the channel at the end is like 1 divided -- whatever divided by the 13 weeks, right? So I think what I'd point you to is a couple of things as it relates to that. One is that we take the weeks in the channel very seriously, obviously, with AVONEX, with TYSABRI. And in this quarter, we specifically didn't want to really manage that hard because of the launch dynamics. We wanted to make sure there were no patient supply disruptions of any sort related to that. And particularly in the launch, you don't actually know which what SPPs are going to be the ones taking off versus the others. So that was the dynamic that -- it was probably a little bit more than we thought in terms of the inventory, but it was all to try to support the launch of the product, which was quite successful. As we go forward, what I would guide you to -- and we'll try to point out these dynamics as we go forward, but my expectations is that, for Q3 and for Q4, that our reported TECFIDERA numbers in the United States will largely line up with the in-market patient demand. Said another way, what's in the channel now, which is plus or minus 80, is probably what -- in the magnitude of what we could expect at the end of Q3, and what to expect at the end of Q4. So hopefully, that helps. The tax question is obviously much more complex. But in a given year, your effective tax rate has to mirror the cash flow, the projected cash flow. And given the strength of TEC in the United States, that puts a little bit of short-term upward pressure on the tax rate, greater than what we actually expected. So a good problem to have given that -- the U.S. launch, I think it's temporary as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to clarify 1 or maybe 1.5 things that Tony said on the TECFIDERA launch. First, with regard to his comments about there being some pent-up demand, us expecting or looking to expect maybe a decline in new patient starts. Is that something that you're already observing? Or is that just your assessment of how this launch might play out? And then, I guess secondly, with the TYSABRI transitions to TECFIDERA, what rate of PML might we expect based on your experience with other TYSABRI drug transitions?","Tony Kingsley","Thanks, Eric. Maybe I'll take the first, and have Doug answer the second. So I would think about it this way, if you take the U.S. market, patient flows at sort of a steady-state, all in. The new starts, which is returning quitters, quitters going out, it runs at a rate of about 1,000 to 1,200 patients per week. You can do your patient numbers however you want, but I mean, just looking at the IMS data, it's pretty clear that TECFIDERA alone was running at something like twice that rate in the second quarter. So look, we clearly think that's going to come down and moderate over time. But we remain very optimistic about what the product profile is and the acceptance. So that's the way I think about that.","Douglas Edward Williams","And Eric, this is Doug. The answer to your question with respect to the rate of PML, I think it's very difficult to come up with a number or to make any predictions about that. I think that what Tony was highlighting was the fact that we had a large number of patients who rolled off of TYSABRI and on to TECFIDERA. Many of them are probably out at or beyond 2 years, and are JC-positive. And just like we've seen with Gilenya and Copaxone and other disease-modifying drugs that patients have been rolled on to, we would anticipate seeing some cases of PML. And we'd expect to see that relatively soon, just given what we've seen with the other DMTs and the kinetics of that event. You'll recall that the TYSABRI label says to monitor patients for 6 months after they come off the drug for the emergence of PML, and so that's the sort of expected window in which these cases would emerge, but I can't give you a specific rate or number.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Porges with Bernstein.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","It doesn't sound like you guys saw it coming much better than we did initially. My question related to regulatory data protection. You've received approval in Canada and Australia, but highlighted on this call the need for regulatory data protection in Europe. Could you tell us about what the regulatory data protection you have is in Canada and Australia, and what's distinct about the exposure you view yourselves as having to generic entry there compared to Europe?","George A. Scangos","We are all kind of looking around the room here. Well, I think the issue with the regulatory data protection is unique to Europe and doesn't exist in other geographies around the world, and so it's not an issue in Australia or Canada or the U.S.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra with Credit Suisse.","Ravi Mehrotra - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Probably for George. George, we've had a number of TECFIDERA side effect scares over the last year. January, there were malignancy issues. April, the New England Journal, PML, fumaric acid. Issues last week, pneumonia. They've all turned out to be storms in a teacup. What other scares might you anticipate, and how would you help us prepare for them? And this really isn't a second question, and I don't want to guide your answer, but can you just remind us about your post-launch monitoring systems, particularly with Tony's comments about PML? How quickly can you report back to us when those cases pop up?","George A. Scangos","Yes, thanks, Ravi. Look, there's no reason, at this point, to expect other issues. I'm sure that will crop up, as you said, we had the case this week that turned out to be erroneous and -- was erroneously reported and turns out to be unlikely have anything to do with TECFIDERA. There will probably be other ones of those as we go forward. Look, with respect to PML, I can just reiterate what Doug said. Patients coming off of TYSABRI are at risk for development of PML for a number of months after they discontinue therapy. But I think, in total, about 12% of our PML cases come from patients who have discontinued. Some of them are on other therapies, some of them are not, and we're likely to see the same phenomenon here. And so we are aware of that. We count those cases in our monthly reports when we issue our TYSABRI PML case reports regardless of what drugs patients have switched on to, and TECFIDERA will be treated just like we treat any other drug.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rachel McMinn with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I know you're not commenting on E.U. TECFIDERA, but can we infer from your comments, Paul, when you said that revenues were not expected be meaningful in 2013, that you still hope to launch TECFIDERA, believe that it's possible that you could launch TECFIDERA in the back half of the year? And then, just, I was hoping that you could give us a little bit more color on PLEGRIDY, given the success of TECFIDERA so far, you mentioned that you believe this drug could be a leader of interferon. But how do we think about the class given the strength of oral adoption to date?","Paul J. Clancy","I'll take the first part, and Tony will take the second part, Rachel. Thanks for the question. Look, it's really -- the revenue guidance -- we obviously, as everyone knows, don't break out product guidance. I think people would love that, but we actually just don't do that. And the revenue guidance, as it relates to the TECFIDERA E.U. number, is just not meaningful. So that really just doesn't say anything specific on the timing. The timing's hard to handicap, as George had mentioned. The outcome's obviously hard to handicap. So we're going to -- we're working constructively. The process is moving along, and that's really all we can say, kind of, at this point. Tony, do you want to grab the [indiscernible].","Tony Kingsley","Yes. So thank you. Look, I'll just repeat, our theory of the market, which we've talked about a lot of times is we think injectables will compress as a class, orals will grow and high efficacy will grow. Orals, with the launch of TECFIDERA off to a fast start, which obviously, we're excited about. The mid- to long-term trajectory of that, we still think injectables are going to be a meaningful portion of the market. We still think convenience is going to be the differentiator. We still think that the PLEGRIDY profile is potentially attractive there, and again, a less frequent injection with a good safety profile mechanism, which is interferon, is going to be appropriate for patients and may be an attractive alternative relative to the oral offerings as well. I don't think our fundamental belief set on that has changed yet. We'll have to see how the market evolves overall.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So just a quick -- I'm going to kind of try to sneak them together. TYSABRI, just help us understand, if you can, what percentage of patients are sort of JCV-positive? I'm trying to get kind of an understanding how do we think about the switch rate, sort of, over time? And then second, again, and if you just can clarify, when you guys say, with respect to RDP, you're trying to help explain the status to all parties involved. I don't know if you can explain to us what that means.","Paul J. Clancy","Maybe I'll quickly take the first part of that question. I think the last time we talked about this, the best insight we have is obviously United States on TYSABRI. But we think that outside the United States, the numbers I'll kind of share is indicative as well. But if you think of, literally, like, 90 days ago, we had shared that we thought about 2\/3 of the patients on TYSABRI were JCV-negative, and we actually think that's accelerating. So it's probably north of that now, and that's fine. That's actually quite good, right? This is a remarkable product for those type of patients, and we think it'll continue to chug along, never getting to 100%, the majority of the patients being on JCV negative.","George A. Scangos","Look, the second part of your question, Yaron, is -- I don't think we said we were trying to explain the status. I think we said we want to make our entitlement to regulatory data protection clear to all parties. And we are, as Paul said, we're in an active process, and it's a constructive process, and we're working to achieve that goal.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was just looking at your guidance, and I know you said, Paul, you don't give specific product guidance, but I think you did make mention in the past that -- seeing AVONEX being relatively flat this year versus last year. I just was wondering if you can update us on that, given what you're seeing 1 quarter into TECFIDERA. And then, on RDP, I know you don't want to give any insight there. But anything you can comment with respect to how Sanofi's decision on Aubagio recently impacted how you're thinking about TECFIDERA?","Paul J. Clancy","Nothing different, Terry, thanks for the question. Nothing different, really, on the AVONEX kind of thinking. So it's plus or minus. I mean, as you know, plus or minus on what is close to a $3 billion number is a big deal, and I appreciate that and I understand that. But I think it's -- the trends on AVONEX are largely as we expected, and I think that what you're seeing in our guidance on the top line and in the bottom line is just kind of really pulling through what is fundamentally a stronger U.S. TECFIDERA launch than we had expected. So great news on that.","Douglas Edward Williams","George, on the RDP?","Claudine Prowse","Aubagio.","George A. Scangos","Yes. Look, Aubagio, I think, and TECFIDERA are different products, different situations, and one has very little bearing on the other.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Roden with UBS.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Tony, I was hoping you could quantify how large do you think the pool of returning quitters is in the U.S. and Europe, and whether or not you think of it is as a bolus or a longer-term source of patient demand? And then, related -- not sure if you can give us this but actually, what percent discontinued on TECFIDERA in the quarter and whether or not that rate is changing as we get into 3Q?","Tony Kingsley","Thanks. So I think we've said in the past we think the quitter pool, the long-term sort of quitter pool is north of 100,000. I think I've always talked about that as an area of opportunity but been cautious because those patients go off for a complex set of reasons, and often aren't looking for therapy, and it's relatively difficult to activate them. We've said about 1\/4 of the patients who started on TECFIDERA in the quarter were not on prior therapy. Our sense is, returning quitters are a piece of that, but it's relatively small. But we think, over time, there is some potential there but we remain cautious about that. We haven't given out the percentage discontinuations. I think I would just repeat what I said in the script, which is that it's very small to date.","Paul J. Clancy","Yes, and just I think, discontinuations, compliance rate, all important factors, Matt. As you know, for the balance of year and years beyond, it's just early days. I mean, literally, even for us looking at the data, nothing really to report but it literally is just early days on that. And we've got programs in place to try to optimize that, but it's early days, really, in terms of the revenue curve.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I got a question for you on the TECFIDERA switches from TYSABRI. So Tony, did you say that the majority of switches had been on TYSABRI for 2 or more years and JCV-positive? And then, a related question. You guys haven't talked a lot about oral pressure on o U.S. TYSABRI previously. Just wondering if there's a new pricing reimbursement dynamic, et cetera?","Tony Kingsley","Yes. So look, a significant portion of the patients that switched to -- off TYSABRI to TECFIDERA were JCV-positive. There's a mix in terms of the length of -- as was always the case, in terms of the length of treatment on TYSABRI -- suppression. But the point was there's 2 things. One, not surprisingly with a new alternative in the market, a number of patients switch relatively quickly, and we think that leveled out closer to market share over time. And second, there's a meaningful pool of this higher-risk group of patients that Doug talked about that are in there. In terms of oral pressure outside the United States, to be explicit, Gilenya is competing very hard in Europe against TYSABRI, and we have some work to do to continue to push TYSABRI's efficacy profile and risk stratification. That's really what the indication there is.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So you mentioned switching in line with the market of MS therapies on the TECFIDERA, but is switching coming evenly across the interferons, given that I think you mentioned that you're marketing toward doctors that may not prescribe as much AVONEX? And I thought I'd throw this one in, on Slide 18, you have a lot of pipeline products that read out in the second half of the year of next year, and looking into the next TECFIDERA, which one of those proof-of-concept trials do you think would have the greatest -- will provide the greatest insight into the product's success?","Tony Kingsley","Thanks. It's Tony. So look, plus\/minus on the switching relative to market share, we track it week-by-week. It's early days. We believe that AVONEX should outperform on a relative basis among the interferons. It's just very early days in terms of numbers, and we're not surprised that it's roughly at market share. So I think it'll take a little while to develop some more noticeable trends on where the switches are and whether there is differentiation across the therapies, which we believe will happen, but it's early days.","Douglas Edward Williams","And this is Doug. I'll take the question about the pipeline readouts. I think that in terms of insights into which of these will go to Phase III, which I think is the nature of your question, I think certainly, the ISIS data early in 2014 is going to be very important in terms of creating, hopefully, some additional excitement around that program and a desire to move that forward into registrational studies. And it's a repeat dose data that will be available to us early next year that, hopefully, will confirm that there's efficacy of that product in that disease, and that would lead us right into a very accelerated Phase III program. I'd say all of the Phase IIs are likely to be important in the context of generating enthusiasm for the registrational studies. STX-100 will basically give us the dose to move into a Phase IIb proper proof-of-concept study. LINGO will see the optic neuritis data. I'd see that as proof of biology and not necessarily as the data that would really get us excited about the product, which will come from the relapsing-remitting study in 2015. And then, the anti-TWEAK data will come later. But all of those are really critical studies. They are large enough. They are designed with endpoints that we think are going to be meaningful in terms of deciding where we go with those programs. And hopefully, those will all move to Phase III.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marko Kozul with Leerink Swann.","Marko K. Kozul - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","I also have a question and a half related to TECFIDERA. Can you give us your view on the current status and landscape for TECFIDERA reimbursement, and possibly, where you anticipate being towards the end of this year and beyond? The second part of the question is related to anecdotal comments we've received from the MS community suggesting some physicians that want to prescribe TECFIDERA are currently holding back from doing so until reimbursement is streamlined, and their patients are ensured continuity in the drug once they initiate treatment. So the second part of the question is really whether you have any color on the proportion of patients or physicians that are still on the sidelines until reimbursement and the landscape is mature.","Tony Kingsley","Good question. Maybe I'll take them in reverse order. So 3,500 physicians have written already. So you can take some comment about who's on the sidelines -- there was not that kind of -- depending on how deep you go in the deck, 6,000, 7,000, 8,000 are kind of a key where you get 80-20 in MS prescription in this market. So we're comfortable that the signal about a broad acceptance of the product profile, and we're also comfortable that there are a lot of physicians writing the product. Certainly, there are cases, I'm sure, where physicians have had frustration with getting patients started on therapy and payer dynamics. That's geographically different -- can be locally very different depending on the payer mix. Our patient services and manage market teams are working with offices in trying to work through those things on a case-by-case basis. We think we've cleared what were some of the early hurdles that were just, frankly, part a function of very, very high demand at the outset. So we know there's some frustration out there, we are engaging with the physician offices constantly. And we feel like we've largely worked through some of the early operational issues. In terms of reimbursement, we're comfortable where we are. Again, we anticipated that we would have payers placing restrictions. We anticipated and communicated that step at its prior outset [ph], et cetera. We're working through that. We, I think, anticipated that kind of 6- to 9-month process, typically, to work through with payers. In process, we feel like it's moving in the right direction, and we're comfortable with where we are.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Somewhat related, you had a QuickStart Program that was sort of helping out with that reimbursement process. Maybe you could help us with how many patients or what percent of what was going on in the quarter was from QuickStart and did they all switch onto commercial pain drug and how does that dynamic play into, say, Q3 and on ongoing quarters?","Tony Kingsley","Good question. So QuickStart is our program to help bridge patients when the reimbursement is being adjudicated. Less than 10% in QuickStart. The conversion rate, we are converting people out of QuickStart over time. There's different pace for the people who are in there, depending on how hard it is to work through the individual payer issues. But we think we're working through that backlog, and under 10% in QuickStart.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Newman with JMP Securities.","John L. Newman - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","I wondered if I might ask about a comment that was made earlier regarding SG&A leverage going forward beyond this year. I'm just curious if we should take that to mean that your SG&A leverage is going to increase just based on the additional products or is there a way that you can increase SG&A leverage by reallocating the promotional effort within your MS franchise? And when would you start to consider that?","Paul J. Clancy","Yes. Great question, John. I think I was referring more to the former than the latter. So I -- obviously, it leverages both the numerator and the denominator. So we are hopeful that we're going to have some continued top line growth. But I think -- and you combine that with our expectations that over the last 18, 24 months, over the next kind of 6 months, we have been making big investments in SG&A to support prelaunch commercial efforts, very much the obvious. We didn't want to be penny wise and pound foolish with the TECFIDERA launch. That's proven, so far, to be a very good judgment. But a lot of that build will -- we've moved towards containing that build and in particular in the U.S., we'll have some of that build ahead of us in multiple sclerosis for E.U., assuming the process moves forward. And we have some of that build for hemophilia ahead of us. But then, we're kind of left with leveraging that. The question of, is there MS -- within MS leverage, within kind of how we manage that. Tony and I have talked openly about that on these calls, and I think we've purposefully left it a question that we'll continue to reconsider and think about over the more multiyear time period.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.","Charles Anthony Butler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","If I could stay with the same theme, Paul, again on SG&A leverage for '14. But in your guidance, which we appreciate, the SG&A numbers as a percent of revenue, as you know, actually stayed flat. So by definition, the absolute number increases. And can you provide any information about what those dollars will actually be earmarked towards? And within the same context if, in fact, there is share shifts in the ABCR category or away from injectable, certainly, in the U.S., Tony, I'd be interested in your thoughts as to whether there is that share shift away from, at least promotional spend, on the AVONEX front regardless of PLEGRIDY next year.","Paul J. Clancy","Okay. No, good question. I think, Tony, it's in the range, right? I mean, a little bit of a range. So I don't expect SG&A to be going up dollar-for-dollar with the amount that revenue is going up on the guidance numbers. So there's some modest variable spending in SG&A that comes associated with extra revenue. We're trying to make sure that any of the operational issues on TECFIDERA from a supply perspective, from a reimbursement perspective that we're well funding this. So that's really what it's intended to kind of imply.","Tony Kingsley","Tony, in terms of the share shift, good question. We're constantly looking at that. I think it's a little early in the evolution of the market to make a call on that. But we are obviously, constantly, think -- we continue to think we're happy with the success of TECFIDERA and where we think it's headed. We continue to think the injectables will be a meaningful portion of the market for some time to come. We want to outcompete in that area, and we'll get the appropriate level of resource against that, but it's something we're constantly looking at a balance across the franchise. And I'll remind you, we have a franchise with a goal in patients across the franchise. And as you think about SG&A leverage in the next couple of years, you have new competitors coming in, the market is getting more crowded, not less crowded. So there are going to be a lot of people to compete with. So we're very mindful of that as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo Securities.","Brian Corey Abrahams - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if you could give us any more information on that patient who died of pneumonia after stopping TECFIDERA, details like lymphocyte counts before or during and after treatment, if any particular culprit has been found for their lung infection. Maybe just help talk us through attributes of that case that give you the confidence that it's not that related to the drug.","Douglas Edward Williams","Sure. This is Doug. I'll be happy to take that question. I think with respect to lymphocyte counts, we don't have the specific information on this patient at this moment. We're still investigating the case. But what I can say is that if you look back at the Phase III experience with the product that the kinetics of lymphocyte drop in patients that had it, tends to occur much later than what we've seen and in terms of -- this is a patient that was on drug for 5.5 weeks and then, came off for 2.5 weeks before they passed away. So I think there's a disconnect in the kinetics of any sort of lymphocyte issues here. But we don't have the lymphocyte counts on this particular patient. Again, I would point you back to the Phase III experience where there was no signal in terms of increased infection risk in patients who received TECFIDERA. So I think that our conclusion, based on the information we have available to us, is sort of twofold: number one, the cause of death was not GI complications as reported in the media; number two, it's pretty clear that this was bilateral pneumonia in this patient. But there's no suspected effect of TECFIDERA on increasing the risk of infection based on experience we have to date. So I think we feel pretty confident that this was an unfortunate set of circumstances in this individual patient that doesn't implicate TECFIDERA.","Operator","I'll now turn the conference back over to our presenters.","George A.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Joe Mara, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.","Joe Mara","Good morning, everyone and welcome to Biogen\u2019s third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. On today\u2019s call, we will be discussing our Q3 results as well as an update on our Alzheimer\u2019s program aducanumab including our plan to file in the U.S.","Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the earnings release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2 and Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussion related to this call.","I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the Risk Factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail.","On today\u2019s call, I am joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Michel Vounatsos; Dr. Al Sandrock, EVP, Research and Development and our Chief Medical Officer; Dr. Samantha Budd Haeberlein, Vice President, Late Stage Clinical Development and our CFO, Jeff Capello.","Now I will turn the call over to Michel.","Michel Vounatsos","Thank you, Joe and good morning everyone. I will start by giving you an outline of this call since we are announcing both Q3 results and news on aducanumab. First, I will review the recent news on aducanumab. Next, I will provide the key highlights of a strong quarter. Al and Samantha will then provide additional details on aducanumab and progress across the rest of our pipeline. Jeff will discuss our financial performance for Q3 and I will close before we open the call for questions.","This is an important day as we are announcing that based on discussion with the FDA, we plan to submit a regulatory filing in the U.S. for aducanumab. If approved, aducanumab will become the first therapy to reduce clinical decline in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and the first therapy to show that removing amyloid beta can lead to better clinical outcomes. This is an important milestone providing hope for patients, physicians, caregivers and families around the world. It is also important to highlight that the path taken in the pursuit of discovering and developing breakthrough treatments is not always direct and straightforward. As you know in March, we announced our decision to discontinue the Phase 3 EMERGE and ENGAGE studies for aducanumab in Alzheimer\u2019s disease based on a pre-specified futility analysis. In retrospect the result of our futility analysis was incorrect. Based on what we know now it is clear that the pre-specified futility criteria did not adequately anticipate the effect of all the variables in these trials.","So, what happened? First, the decision to stop these trials relied on an earlier and smaller dataset comprised only of patients who had the opportunity to complete 18 months of treatment as of December 26, 2018. At that time, the futility analysis predicted that the trials were unlikely to meet the primary endpoint upon completion. Futility analysis are common in large studies and they use statistical modeling to attempt to predict the outcome of the studies based on a number of pre-specified assumptions and criteria. There are multiple methodologies that can be used for futility analysis and the methodology we use was a well accepted approach. However, based on what we have learned, we know now that the futility analysis did not adequately account for the effect that the earlier enrollment in ENGAGE had on patients overall exposure to high dose aducanumab.","Second, in the months following the discontinuation of the studies, our team has continued to analyze the vast set of clinical imaging and biomarker data that the studies have generated. In addition to further analysis of the dataset which informed the futility analysis we also gain access to an analyzed additional data, including data on patients who completed treatment after the cutoff date for the futility analysis as well as data for patients who did not complete the full duration of the study. Once we became aware of the potential implication of this larger dataset, we consulted with external advisors followed by the FDA with a Type C Meeting in June as we began conducting further analysis. Third, the new analysis of the larger dataset, which was conducted in consultation with the FDA, showed that aducanumab had a dose-dependent effect on the underlying pathology as measured by amyloid-PET imaging and reduced clinical decline in patients with early Alzheimer\u2019s disease as measured by the pre-specified primary and secondary endpoints. Based on the second type C meeting held with the FDA just yesterday, we believe this data support regulatory filing.","Beyond aducanumab, we are hopeful about the implication of these results for similar approaches targeting amyloid beta, including BAN2401. Looking forward, we plan to submit a regulatory filing in the U.S. in early 2020 and we will continue dialog with regulatory authorities in international markets, including in Europe and Japan. Most importantly, we have a deep commitment to the patients\u2019 community starting with those who participated in our clinical trials. With the support of the FDA, we aim to offer access to aducanumab as soon as possible to eligible patients previously enrolled in the Phase 3 studies, the long-term extension of the Phase 1 PRIME b-study and the Phase 2 EVOLVE study. We will work towards this goal with the regulatory authorities, principal investigators and the institutional review boards with a sense of urgency. I know this development is unexpected for all our stakeholders, including the many patients involved in our clinical studies and their families, our investigators, our investors and our employees. And I am sure you have a lot of questions. We were also surprised when we initially learned about the potential implication of these additional data, but our surprise quickly turned to the hope that we maybe in the position to offer Alzheimer\u2019s patients the first step to reduce clinical decline in this devastating disease. We are humbled and honored by this opportunity and we are committed to following the science and doing the right thing for patients.","Now, let me review some financial highlights from the third quarter. Compared to the same period a year ago, Biogen delivered solid top line and bottom line growth. Third quarter revenues grew 5% to $3.6 billion. Third quarter GAAP earnings per share grew 17% to $8.39 and non-GAAP EPS grew 24% to $9.17. Now, let me briefly review our progress against our strategic business priorities. First, we continue to demonstrate resilience in MS and we remain focused on addressing the IP challenge with TECFIDERA, while also preparing for the expected launch of VUMERITY. Second, SPINRAZA revenues grew double-digits both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Third, our biosimilars business continued to grow led by the recent launch of IMRALDI. Fourth, we continue to progress our pipeline with a positive readout on VUMERITY and the addition of two new clinical programs. And fifth, Biogen has continued to be disciplined and focused on capital allocation. As we have demonstrated, we are committed to maximizing returns for our shareholders while continuing to bring innovative therapies to patients, something that demands a thoughtful approach toward all our investment over both the short-term and the long-term.","Before turning the call over to Al, I would like to congratulate him on his new role as the Head of R&D at Biogen. I know, I speak for the broader Biogen family in expressing my confidence in Al as a scientist, as a clinician, and as a leader. Al is taking the helm at the time when I believe Biogen R&D has never been stronger. And I believe he is well equipped to continue driving Biogen R&D forward.","Al Sandrock","Thank you, Michel. Before diving in, let me first take a moment to say how excited I am, about the opportunity to lead the R&D organization here at Biogen. I\u2019m extremely proud of the team for all the hard work that brought us to today\u2019s announcement on aducanumab, and I believe now more than ever, that Biogen is uniquely positioned to bring breakthroughs in neuroscience and transform the lives of patients with neurological disease. As Michel said, we were all surprised when we learned of the potential implications of the new analysis of a larger dataset from the Phase 3 studies of aducanumab. Following discussions with external advisors and the FDA, we have now come to better understand what happened, and even more importantly with the positive implications of the larger dataset may mean for patients, physicians and the broader scientific community.","To start, I will briefly summarize our current understanding of the Phase 3 data, before I turn the call over to Samantha, who will describe in more detail, the series of events and analysis that have led us to the current conclusions and status today. First, it is important to understand what the results \u2013 that the results you will hear about today, which we have analyzed in consultation with the FDA, are based on a new analysis of a larger dataset, than that which was used for the futility analysis.","Our primary learning from these data is that sufficient exposure to high dose aducanumab reduced clinical decline across multiple clinical endpoints. This reduction and clinical decline was statistically significant in EMERGE, and we believe that patients \u2013 that the data from patients who achieve sufficient exposure to high dose aducanumab in ENGAGE support the findings of EMERGE. After consultation with the FDA, we believe that the totality of these data support a regulatory filing. Importantly patients included in the futility analysis, were those who had enrolled early in the trials and those early enrolling patients had a lower average exposure to aducanumab in large part due to two protocol amendments that occurred sometime after the start of the trials. These two protocol amendments were put in place precisely to enable more patients to reach high dose aducanumab, and for a longer duration. As a consequence, the larger dataset available after trial cessation included more patients with sufficient exposure to high dose aducanumab.","Moreover, differences between EMERGE and ENGAGE can mostly be accounted for by a greater level of exposure to high dose aducanumab in EMERGE due to multiple factors including the fact that ENGAGE started earlier and enrolled earlier then EMERGE, meaning that fewer patients in ENGAGE had sufficient exposure to high dose aducanumab, as well as other factors including differences in the degree of dose suspension due to ARIA. Taken together, we believe that these data and the associated extensive analysis provide compelling evidence that aducanumab reduces the otherwise devastating and inexorable clinical decline of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.","To expand further, I will now hand the call over to Samantha.","Samantha Budd Haeberlein","Thank you, Al. Let me now describe in more detail how we got here. It\u2019s important to first understand the design of the studies and how that evolved over time. EMERGE and ENGAGE were Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group studies, designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aducanumab in early Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The studies were identical in design. A full enrollment EMERGE included 1,638 patients and ENGAGE included 1,647 patients. Based on the data from the Phase 1b PRIME study of aducanumab, we believed that higher doses of aducanumab may be associated with improved clinical outcomes. However, as the incidents of amyloid related imaging abnormality or ARIA for short, the most common adverse event associated with aducanumab, also increased with aducanumab dose and occurred more often in ApoE4 carriers than non-carriers.","The Phase 3 study had a number of design elements, such as titration, dose levels and management with MRI to mitigate and manage the risk of ARIA. In addition, dosing of aducanumab was stratified by ApoE4 carrier status. The low dose was defined as 3 milligram per kilogram for ApoE4 carriers and 6 milligram per kilogram for non-carriers, whereas the high dose was initially defined as 6 milligram per kilogram for ApoE4 carriers and 10 milligram per kilogram for non-carriers. Results from the PRIME study for ApoE4 carriers titrated to 10 milligram per kilogram became available in August 2016. This data showed that the incidence of ARIA as well as discontinuations from treatment due to ARIA in ApoE4 carriers receiving aducanumab titrated to 10 milligram per kilogram appeared to be reduced as compared to the fixed dose cohort. Following this analysis, the protocols for the ongoing Phase 3 studies were amended such that the high dose in ApoE4 carriers would then be increased from 6 to 10 milligram per kilogram. Of note, in each study approximately two-thirds of enrolled patients were ApoE4 carriers, and the number of carriers was well balanced across each of the arms of both studies. Each dose arm had a titration period such that the maximum number of monthly 10 milligram per kilogram doses that any patient in the high dose group could receive in the 18 months study was 14. Moreover, the original protocol recommended that some patients with ARIA suspend their dosing and then restart and remain at a lower dose.","ENGAGE enrolled its first patient in August 2015 and EMERGE began enrolling approximately one month later in September, 2015. Two key amendments were made to the protocols during the conduct of the study. In July of 2016, we amended the protocol to allow patients with ARIA who suspended dosing to resume aducanumab treatment at the originally assigned dose. And then in March of 2017 as I mentioned, the protocol was amended to increase the high dose for ApoE4 carriers from 6 to 10 milligram per kilogram after titration. Taken together, these protocol amendments had the effect of allowing more patients to receive their target dose. Since enrollment in ENGAGE had begun and remained ahead of EMERGE, overall more patients in EMERGE were impacted by the protocol amendments and received the 10 milligram per kilogram dosing of aducanumab.","On March 21, 2019, we announced the termination of EMERGE and ENGAGE following the outcome of a pre-specified futility analysis. The futility analysis was based on efficacy data on all patients in the two trials who had enrolled early enough to have had the opportunity to have completed the 18 month study period by December 26, 2018. Futility criteria which were pre-specified in the statistical analysis plan would be met if both arms of both trials were predicted to have had less than 20% probability of being positive on the primary endpoint at the end of the study. This probability used pool data from the two trials to predict the future behavior of the remaining patients. This is a well accepted statistical methodology for two trials that are identical in design, such as EMERGE and ENGAGE. However this pooling methodology assumes no large heterogeneity between the studies.","At the time of the futility analysis, EMERGE was trending positive, while ENGAGE was not. We did not understand the drivers of these different results. While we did know that the protocol amendments could have had differential effects on the two studies, due to the relative timing of enrollment. We did not anticipate the magnitude of the effect this would have on the data. Following the discontinuation of EMERGE and ENGAGE, additional data from these studies became available, namely the 2,066 patients who had the opportunity to complete the full 18 month study period by March 20th as well as all 3,285 patients who had enrolled in the trials in what\u2019s known as the intent to treat or ITT population. Importantly, once we had applied the pre-specified statistical analysis to the larger dataset, we were excited to see that EMERGE met its primary endpoint on CDR Sum of Boxes or CDR-SB. CDR-SB scores are obtained through clinician interviews of patients and caregivers and assess three domains each of cognition and function, namely memory, orientation judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies and personal care.","Specifically in the intent to treat population, patients from the high dose aducanumab group showed a 23% reduction in clinical decline from baseline in CDR-SB scores at 78 weeks with a p-value of 0.01. The corresponding results in the opportunity to complete or OTC dataset was also 23% with a nominal p-value of 0.03. The low dose group also had less decline on the CDR-SB than placebo. However, the differences were smaller than in the high dose group and did not attain statistical significance. In EMERGE, patients on high dose aducanumab also showed a reduction in clinical decline as measured by the pre-specified secondary endpoints. Specifically, we saw a 15% reduction in clinical decline as measured by MMSE with a p-value of 0.06, a 27% reduction in clinical decline as measured by ADAS-COG13 with a p-value of 0.01 and a 40% reduction in clinical decline as measured by ADCS-ADL-MCI with a p-value of 0.001. A small numeric advantage for low dose over placebo was observed on all endpoints except for MMSE, MMSE and ADAS-COG measures of cognitive performance in domains relevant to Alzheimer\u2019s disease such as memory, orientation and language. ADCS-ADL-MCI on the other hand is a caregiver rated assessment of activities of daily living, including conducting personal finances, performing household chores such as cleaning, shopping and doing laundry and independently traveling out of the home.","In ENGAGE, the primary endpoint was not met though the low dose showed results similar to the low dose of EMERGE. Results of the ITT and OTC analysis of the secondary endpoints in ENGAGE showed no statistically significant differences in decline on MMSE ADAS-COG13 or ADCS-ADL-MCI compared with placebo. However, small numeric advantages for the low dose of a placebo were observed on these endpoints. In addition to the clinical data, we observe supporting data from multiple biomarkers, imaging of amyloid plaque deposition in both studies demonstrated that treatment with aducanumab resulted in a dose and time dependent reduction in amyloid plaque burden compared to placebo with p-values less than 0.001. The magnitude of reduction in the high doses is similar to that seen in the Phase 1b study. aducanumab also demonstrated an impact on CSF biomarkers of tau pathology. A statistically significant reduction on CSF phospho-Tau levels was observed in EMERGE and ENGAGE with a dose proportional response in EMERGE. aducanumab produced a numeric reduction in CSF total-Tau levels in EMERGE and ENGAGE with a dose proportional response in EMERGE. Although the primary and secondary endpoints were not met in ENGAGE in post analysis, the subset of patients who received sufficient exposure to 10 milligram per kilogram aducanumab in this case, at least 10 doses of 10 milligram per kilogram showed similar results to the comparable population from EMERGE, in terms of both amyloid plaque reduction and reduced clinical decline on CDR-SB.","The safety and tolerability profile of aducanumab in EMERGE and ENGAGE was consistent with previous studies of aducanumab, with the most commonly reported adverse event being ARIA-E and headache. Although the underlying cause of ARIA-E is not well understood, it is likely that the MRI signal of ARIA-E is due to increased extra cellular fluid. The majority of patients with ARIA-E did not experience symptoms during the ARIA-E episode and ARIA-E episodes generally resolved within 4 to 16 weeks, typically without long-term clinical sequelae. We plan to present further details on the new analysis of the larger dataset from aducanumab at the C Type Meeting in December, which we plan to webcast.","So to summarize, first, across multiple clinical endpoints, the larger aducanumab dataset demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of clinical decline in early Alzheimer\u2019s disease patients in EMERGE, and we believe that data from a subset of ENGAGE support these findings.Second, exposure to high dose aducanumab was important for efficacy and differences and exposure to high dose aducanumab largely explain the different result of futility analysis and the new analysis of this larger dataset as well as the different results between the two studies. Finally, following consultation with the FDA, we believe it is reasonable to submit a regulatory filing for aducanumab based on these data.","As Michel and Al mentioned, the past that brought us to today was long and complex. We will be working with our investigators to redose eligible patients who had previously participated in the aducanumab clinical trial, and we look forward to working with the FDA as well as regulators around the world to find a path to make the drug available to patients. Most importantly, we envisage a future where physicians may finally have an option to offer patients to help reduce clinical decline in Alzheimer\u2019s disease.","I\u2019ll now turn it back over to Al.","Al Sandrock","Thank you, Samantha. We believe that these positive results for aducanumab represent a turning point for patients, caregivers, physicians and scientists in the fight against Alzheimer\u2019s disease. More broadly, we believe these results represent an inflection point in neuroscience drug development and validate our core strategy, by demonstrating the removal of aggregated forms of amyloid beta can result in improved clinical outcomes, we believe these results have positive implications for BAN2401, a distinct antibody that also targets aggregated amyloid beta that we are currently evaluating in a Phase 3 study in early Alzheimer\u2019s disease in collaboration with Eisai.","More generally, we believe these data may have positive implications for additional assets in our portfolio that target the casual pathobiology of neurodegenerative disease, particularly those validated by human genetics. These include our Tau directed assets for Alzheimer\u2019s disease and primary tauopathies, our alpha-synuclein antibody for Parkinson\u2019s disease and our SOD1 and C9ORF targeting antisense oligonucleotides for ALS. Given our depth of expertise, our deep and interconnected neuroscience pipeline including nine additional readouts expected by the end of next year, we believe that Biogen is uniquely positioned to capture the opportunity in neuroscience, and potentially deliver a suite of breakthrough therapies for diseases of the nervous system.","With that in mind, let me now review the highlights across the rest of our pipeline in the third quarter. Starting with MS, this quarter we announced positive top line results from EVOLVE-MS-2, a Phase 3 study of VUMERITY or diroximel fumarate, a novel oral fumarate for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis compared to TECFIDERA. The remedy was statistically superior to TECFIDERA on the studies pre-specified primary endpoint, the individual gastrointestinal symptom an impact scale with a p-value of 0.0003. The proportion of patients who discontinued due to GI adverse events during the five-week treatment period was 0.8% for VUMERITY and 4.8% for TECFIDERA. Of note, discontinuation rate for TECFIDERA is similar to that observed in the Phase 3 studies of TECFIDERA in which 4% of patients discontinued due to GI events. Earlier this month, Alkermes received a tentative approval from the FDA for VUMARITY. We are working with our Alkermes and the agency to secure final approval as quickly as possible.","Moving to TYSABRI, previous analysis of real world data from the US TOUCH registry demonstrated that extended interval dosing of TYSABRI reduced the risk of PML by between 78% and 99% in this population. However, whether extended interval dosing preserves the efficacy profile of TYSABRI remains an open question. To this end, at last month\u2019s ECTRIMS meeting, we presented data on the efficacy of extended interval dosing with TYSABRI using data from the TYSABRI Observational Program. After propensity score matching, the results indicated that there was no significant difference in annualized relapse rate or risk of relapse between the two groups. And we recently completed enrollment for the Phase 3b NOVA study of TYSABRI, a two year randomized prospective trial that will directly compare the effectiveness of every six-week dosing versus the approved every four-week dosing regimen after at least one year of standard dosing. Also this quarter the EMA updated the labels of AVONEX and PLEGRIDY to remove pregnancy contra-indications, and where clinically needed to allow use during pregnancy and breast feeding in women with relapsing MS. With these updates interferon-beta therapies are the only MS Therapies in Europe that can be considered for use in MS patients throughout the full course of pregnancy. This is important, given that women are diagnosed with MS at least 2 to 3 times more frequently than men and women are often affected during their childbearing years.","Turning to our progress in neuromuscular disorders, at last month\u2019s Congress of the European Pediatric Neurological Society, we presented new interim data from the open label shine extension study of SPINRAZA in children with later onset SMA. Now, including data on patients up to 15 years of age followed for up to six years, this analysis demonstrated that in star contrast to the natural history of SMA patients with Type 2 SMA treated with SPINRAZA demonstrated improvements in motor function as assessed by the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded and patients with Type 3 SMA treated with SPINRAZA demonstrated stable Hammersmith scores and improvement in distance walked. No participants discontinued treatment due to adverse events. And no new safety concerns were identified. Taken \u2013 Taken together, these data again underscore the robust durable efficacy and well-established longer term safety profile of SPINRAZA across a broad range of SMA patients. Also this quarter we published data from the nurture study of SPINRAZA in pre-symptomatic infants in the journal neuromuscular disorders. Data from the nurture study showed that all patients treated with SPINRAZA were alive and achieved the ability to sit without support, non required permanent ventilation, 92% achieved walking with assistance and 88% achieved walking independently.","Given SPINRAZA is well-characterized safety profile, we recently announced a Phase 2\/3 DEVOTE study to evaluate whether a higher doses of SPINRAZA can provide even greater efficacy than the currently approved dose. Our review of PK\/PD data suggested individuals with higher CSF concentrations of SPINRAZA achieved greater improvements in CHOP INTEND and motor milestones. As with any therapy that is developed to address high end men need, companies who lead need to continue to continually explore ways to optimize their treatment. Building on the success of SPINRAZA, we aim to build a broader neuromuscular franchise including ALS. At the meeting of the Northeast ALS Consortium held earlier this month, we presented new data on neurofilament levels assessed in the Phase 1\/2 multiple ascending dose study to a person, our antisense oligonucleotide targeting SOD1 in patients with SOD1 ALS.","As a reminder, previous data from this study showed that treatment with 100 milligrams of tofersen was associated with a statistically significant reduction in CSF SOD1 protein levels and trends toward slowing of clinical decline as assessed by three independent measures relative to placebo. This new analysis of the same population showed the baseline neurofilament levels in both the plasma and CSF were correlated with baseline disease activity. And treatment with 100 milligrams of tofersen reduced levels of neurofilament in both plasma and CSF. These data further highlight the concordance across datasets generated in this study, including target engagement, clinical and neurofilament data and thus illustrate the potential for an antisense oligonucleotides to target genetic drivers of neurodegenerative disease. In movement disorders, we continue to advance to Phase 2 study of BIIB092 or gosuranemab, an antibody targeting extracellular tau in PSP with data expected by the end of the year. In this Phase 2 \u2013 if this Phase 2 study is positive, we believe we would be in a position to file for regulatory approval. In Parkinson\u2019s disease, we continue to progress the Phase 2 study of BIIB054, an antibody targeting extracellular alpha-synuclein. We expect data from the one year placebo controlled period of this study including data on safety, as well as neuro imaging based assessment of striatal dopaminergic transporter density in the second half of next year.","Also this quarter, as we work to build further depth and movement disorders, we dosed the first patient in the Phase 1 study of BIIB094 an antisense oligonucleotide targeting leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 or LRRK2 in Parkinson\u2019s disease. Toxic gain of function mutations in LRRK2 constitutes the most common genetic cause of Parkinson\u2019s disease representing approximately 5% of all Parkinson\u2019s disease cases. In addition to LRRK2s role in familiar Parkinson\u2019s disease, data from the literature suggests that LRRK2 gain of function may also contribute to the pathogenesis of sporadic Parkinson\u2019s disease. As a result, this Phase 1 study will include Parkinson\u2019s disease patients with or without verified mutations in LRRK 2. Importantly BIIB094 leverages the same RNase H media degradation mechanism utilized by tofersen.","With the addition of BIIB094 to our pipeline, we are now advancing ASOs targeting the most common genetic cause of Parkinson\u2019s disease, two genetic causes of ALS and taupathology, which underpin several primary and secondary tauopathies including Alzheimer\u2019s disease. And we aim to build further depth across our ASO pipeline, as we continue to emphasize our focus on genetically validated targets and defined patient populations. In acute neurology, we continue to advance the Phase 3 study of BIIB093 or IV glibenclamide, for cerebral edema caused by large \u2013 large hemispheric infarction or LHI. As a reminder BIIB093 blocks SUR1-TRPM4 channels that are hypothesize to mediate brain edema following LHI. Given that these channels are also hypothesized to mediate expansion of Hematoma and Perihematoma edema associated with brain contusion, this month we dosed the first patient in a Phase 2 study of BIIB093 for brain contusion. Approximately 280,000 patients are hospitalized due to head trauma annually in the United States. And we estimate the contusions occur in approximately 25% to 35% of these patients. There are no pharmaceutical agents approved to mitigate contusion expansion, which is associated with worsened clinical outcomes. The primary objective of this new study of BIIB093 will evaluate the proportion of patients with brain contusion, who exhibited an expansion in contusion volume over the course of a 96 hour infusion of BIIB093 versus placebo. Importantly, we believe that the shared pathophysiologic features of LHI and brain contusion exemplify the interconnectivity of neuroscience that we are leveraging as we continue to increase the depth and breadth of our pipeline. This also highlights our strategy to produce \u2013 to pursue multiple indications for a given asset, particularly once we believe safety has been adequately established.","And finally, in our Alzheimer\u2019s disease portfolio, this quarter, we completed enrollment in the Phase 2 study of gosuranemab in early Alzheimer\u2019s disease. And we continue to advance the Phase 1 studies of BIIB076, a distinct anti-tau antibody and BIIB080 an ASO aimed at reducing the expression of tau in the central nervous system. Taken together with the positive results of aducanumab, we believe that no other company is better positioned to deliver breakthrough therapies for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Overall, this was a historic quarter for Biogen and for the patients, caregivers, physicians and scientists around the world, who have been waiting decades for a therapy that can reduce the clinical decline of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.","With that I will turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Capello","Thanks, Al. Good morning, everyone. I will now review our financial performance for the third quarter of 2019. As Michel mentioned earlier, we had a strong financial performance in Q3 2019. Total revenues for the third quarter grew 5% year-over-year to approximately $3.6 billion, while GAAP earnings per share increased 17% and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 24%, both compared to the prior year.","Overall, our MS business delivered revenues were approximately $2.3 billion in the third quarter of this year, including OCREVUS royalties for approximately $188 million, growing 2% versus the prior year. Global MS revenues in Q3, 2019 were stable versus the prior year with OCREVUS royalties and the total number of patients on our MS products globally continued to grow in the low single-digits versus the prior year. U.S. MS revenues in Q3, 2019 were impacted by a decrease in channel inventory of approximately $30 million compared to a decrease of approximately $5 million in Q3, 2018 and a decrease of approximately $30 million in Q2 2019. Global third quarter TECFIDERA revenues increased 3% versus prior year, as TECFIDERA delivered strong global patient growth of approximately 8% year-over-year. In the U.S., TECFIDERA revenues were flat year-over-year as TECFIDERA share of total prescriptions remained relatively stable compared to the last couple of quarters. Outside the U.S. TECFIDERA performed very well again in Q3 2019 with continued volume increases across all large European markets and Japan versus the prior year, somewhat offset by pricing pressure in several European countries.","Q3 global Interferon revenues including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY decreased 10% versus Q3 2018, due to the continued shift from the injectable platforms to oral or high efficacy therapies. TYSABRI worldwide revenues increased 3% versus the third quarter of 2018. We were pleased with this growth into TYSABRI revenues as it continued to perform well in the high efficacy segment. In the US, we grew TYSABRI revenues 4% year-over-year, as we continue to maintain stable TYSABRI share of total prescriptions compared to the last couple of quarters. Outside the US, we grew TYSABRI 2% driven by volume growth in several markets and favorable timing of shipments somewhat offset by pricing pressures. Overall, we were pleased with the execution of our MS franchise and the continued strong performance of our MS business in the third quarter. We remain focused on maintaining resilience and MS market leadership.","Let me now move on to SPINRAZA. Global third quarter SPINRAZA revenues increased 17% versus prior year, and 12% versus the prior quarter to $547 million. In the third quarter SPINRAZA achieved year-over-year and quarter-over-revenue growth both in the US and outside the US, driven by continued patient growth across both mature and new markets. And we now have approximately 9,300 patients on SPINRAZA, including the expanded access program in clinical trials. In the U.S. revenues increased 6% versus Q3 2018 and 3% versus Q2 2019. The number of patients on therapy in the U.S. increased 3% as compared to the end of the second quarter of 2019. And importantly, we continue to make strong progress with adults. The largest patient segment with the number of adults on SPINRAZA growing 8% compared to the prior quarter, which is a third quarter in a row with upper single-digit growth. As a reminder, Zolgensma is competing in a limited portion of the market, specifically the approximately 5% of SMA patients were under 2 years old. Within that segment, we have begun to see some impact on SPINRAZA performance.","Outside the U.S., revenues increased 27% versus Q3 2018 and 21% versus last quarter, driven by strong performance in established markets such as EU and Japan as well as key markets in both Latin America and Asia Pacific. We were pleased to see double-digit patient growth versus prior quarter outside the U.S. and we are now approved in over 50 countries. Additionally, we recently dosed the first SPINRAZA patients in China. Overall, we were pleased to see continued patient growth across the larger mature markets and continued rapid uptake from our recently launched markets.","Given our expected continued patient growth and execution across many global markets, our established product profile and the significant market opportunity, we remain optimistic about our SMA business. In our biosimilars business, we generated $184 million this quarter, growing 36% versus prior year driven by IMRALDI. We estimate that we now have approximately 180,000 patients of biosimilars in Europe. Total anti-CD20 revenues in the third quarter increased 16% versus the prior year, primarily driven by OCREVUS royalties. Q3 OCREVUS royalties benefited by approximately $10 million due to adjustment related to prior periods. We continue to expect RITUXAN revenues to be impacted by the entry of biosimilars in the U.S. beginning next month.","Total other revenues in the third quarter decreased 26% versus the prior year driven by the decline in our manufacturing services revenues due to our divestiture of the Hillerod plant. Importantly we continue to see geographic diversification of our revenue base, driven by growth in MS revenues outside the U.S., the continued market expansion of SPINRAZA and our growing biosimilars business. In the third quarter approximately 41% of our product revenues came from outside the U.S. versus approximately 37% in Q3 2018 and 32% in Q3, 2017. We aim to continue capitalizing on global growth opportunities, both our current commercial portfolio and our pipeline of products.","Let me now turn to the expense lines on the P&L. Q3 2019 gross margin was 88%, an improvement versus both prior year and prior quarter, which were both 87% due to favorable cost of goods sold, product mix and higher margin contract manufacturing. Q3 GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense were both 15% of revenue. R&D expense included approximately $58 million in trial closeout costs for both elenbecestat and BG00011. Q3 GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A expense were both 15% of revenue. Q3 GAAP other expense was $27 million and non-GAAP other expense was $23 million. In the third quarter, our GAAP tax rate was approximately 12% and our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 16%. Compared to Q3 2018, our Q3 2019 GAAP tax rate benefited from the remaining amount realized from U.S. corporate tax reform, the change in our tax profile in Q2 2019 and recently enacted tax reform in Switzerland.","In the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 3.1 million shares at an average price of $233 for total value of approximately $718 million. As of September 30, 2019, we had approximately $3.4 billion remaining on our 2019 share repurchase authorization, which now brings us to our diluted earnings per share. In the third quarter, we booked GAAP EPS of $8.39, an increase of 17% versus the prior year and non-GAAP earnings per share of $9.17, a 24% increase versus the prior year. We generated approximately $1.7 billion in net cash flows from operations in Q3. We ended the quarter with approximately $6.3 billion in cash and marketable securities and $6 billion in debt.","I will now turn the call back over to Michel for his closing comments.","Michel Vounatsos","Thank you, Jeff. To summarize, first, the positive clinical results for aducanumab position Biogen to potentially lead the fight against Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Second, these data validates Biogen strategy to focus on an interconnected neuroscience pipeline and productization of target supported by human genetics. Third, our base business continued to deliver solid performance in Q3 2019, driven by strong execution against our strategic priorities. Between now and the end of 2020, we expect continued progress as we aim to build a multi-franchise portfolio including nine additional mid to late stage data readouts, the expected launch of VUMERITY in the U.S. and submitting the regulatory filing for aducanumab in the U.S. while continuing dialog with regulatory authorities in international markets, including in Europe and in Japan. I am proud of the Biogen team for not being deterred by history of disappointment in the pursuit of Alzheimer\u2019s therapies and more so for continuing their work of analyzing the clinical trial data with unprecedented focus and intensity even in light of an apparent futility results. This work reflects Biogen\u2019s steadfast determination to follow the science, tackle the biggest challenges and do always the right thing for the patients. Finally, what is most important today is that in consultation with the FDA, we are excited to be moving ahead and preparing for regulatory filing for aducanumab on the ground of positive clinical results. And we will be redosing eligible patients from our Alzheimer\u2019s trials as quickly as possible.","This is a major step in the fight against Alzheimer\u2019s disease and an important inflection point for Biogen\u2019s neuroscience mission. We believe now more than ever that our core focus on neuroscience will enable us to maximize the value for all our stakeholders. First and foremost, for the patients as well as for our shareholders as the leader in neuroscience, we believe that no other company is better positioned to continue to deliver breakthrough therapies for diseases of the nervous system. We will continue to execute on our cost strategy to build a multi franchise portfolio across our core and emerging growth areas. We are inspired by the progress we have made in tackling Alzheimer\u2019s disease and the broader scientific implications of the positive clinical results for aducanumab.","I would like to thank all the Biogen employees in particular, those who have been working tirelessly on the aducanumab program and the many more who will contribute to this critical priority over time. I am incredibly grateful for all the patients, physicians and caregivers who have dedicated so much time and efforts to our Alzheimer\u2019s clinical studies and advancing our understanding of this very complex disease. I would like to thank the FDA for their guidance, and independent scientific expertise throughout this process.","We will now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Umer Raffat","Hello. If I may, I only have a question on aducanumab but it\u2019s got three parts, and given the significance of the news today, I would really appreciate if you could bear with us on it. So my three parts are as follows: first, I\u2019m not attempting to correlate the two but Michael Ehlers departure ahead of this data announcement, just wanted to hear are those two things are related in anyway or not. Second, the implication in the data is that the high with insufficient exposure at the high dose, the second trial worked as well. But when we look at CDR Sum of the Boxes low dose actually looks more consistent than the high dose and also for patients that did not make it to the large opportunity to complete dataset, those patients actually especially in MMSE more consistent than the patients that did have a sufficient exposure. So I guess I\u2019m just trying to understand how spot on is that finding on patients that had a sufficient exposure and those are the ones that drove efficacy. Thank you so much.","Michel Vounatsos","Thank you, Umer. This is Michel. Mike decided to leave the company on his own and I can cannot thank him enough for his many contributions over the past three and half years to Biogen. So, thanks, Mike. And at the same time I\u2019m extremely confident in Al\u2019s leadership as a clinician too, as a scientist to take the helm at the time where the R&D portfolio never been as stronger, the team also and the capabilities.","Al Sandrock","Umar, this is Al Sandrock, and I will turn it over to Samantha later for follow-up. But look, your point is well taken, the low dose is consistent across ENGAGE and EMERGE, and that\u2019s because the particularly the second protocol amendment, really affected the high dose arm of \u2013 in the carriers. So in the low dose arm or in the protocol amendments had less of an effect and I think that\u2019s one of the main reasons for the consistency in the results across the two studies. I\u2019ll turn it over to Samantha for a follow-up.","Samantha Budd Haeberlein","Yes, that\u2019s correct. Umar you\u2019ll also see that in the high dose for ENGAGE that we do have a partial response on ADAS-Cog13, and the ADCS-ADL-MCI. And so the potential read that you have there on CDR-Sum of Boxes and MMSC is that these are potentially less sensitive as endpoints. So what Al said is that in the high-dose group we know that we have less doses than we \u2013 at the high dose than we had in EMERGE, and we also know that the studies were to some degree impacted by dose suspensions due to ARIA, so dosing is a complex combination of duration, magnitude and no interruptions.","Umer Raffat","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Phil Nadeau","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. It\u2019s also, as you might imagine on aducanumab. I guess in two parts. First, if you pull the data from ENGAGE and EMERGE, would the pooled results still be positive on the primary endpoint and kind of related to that, could you give us some sense of what the differences between ENGAGE and EMERGE were in exposures at those high doses. It seems like the trials didn\u2019t start far apart, there\u2019s just a month, so kind of in response to the last question, you mentioned exposures rely on dose suspensions and whatnot. Can you give us some sense quantitatively of how different the patient populations at that high dose were in ENGAGE and EMERGE in terms of their exposure? Thank you.","Samantha Budd Haeberlein","Certainly. So the first part that if we pulled the outcomes on ENGAGE and EMERGE at the high dose essentially you\u2019ll get an intermediate effect, not much more complicated than that. But we are looking at these stand-alone studies as two independently identically designed studies. The second part of the question, which I had forgotten actually,","Phil Nadeau","Differences in ENGAGE and EMERGE,","Samantha Budd Haeberlein","Yes, so they started one month difference between the two studies, as I mentioned and they remained different throughout the entirety of the studies and that initial one month at certain periods of the studies in particularly through the protocol amendments was greater in the middle of the studies and more details around this will come at the presentation in CTAD.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Terence Flynn","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Maybe two parts for me as well. Just wondering if you can share any additional commentary on the second Type C Meeting, did FDA agree that a single positive trial could be sufficient for approval or is that likely a review question? And then can you give us the rates of ARIA in the high dose arms of the two trials? Thanks.","Al Sandrock","Yes, hi, this is Al. It\u2019s generally our policy not to comment too much on the content of regulatory interactions. I will say though that they thought it was reasonable for us to submit an application to \u2013 for approval. So that\u2019s the main, that was the upside of the meeting.","Samantha Budd Haeberlein","And the second part of the question was on ARIA and high dose and that was consistent in incidence for the studies that we have previously reported, and we\u2019ll give more details on that at CTAD.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Porges from Leerink. Please go ahead.","Geoff Porges","Thank you very much and thanks for having Samantha on the call. It\u2019s very helpful. First, could you answer whether the analysis that you presented and presented to the agency has been independently verified. What confirmation of both the statistics and the results do you have? Secondly, do you have any intention or plans for a confirmatory pivotal trial to supplement these two trials? And then I hate to sort of push on the issue of the type, the FDA meeting but did the FDIC, the full analysis or did the FDA just here the company summary of the analysis? Thanks.","Al Sandrock","Let me with the last question and I\u2019ll let Samantha answer the first couple. First of all, the FDA did see the full analysis of both studies and I would also say that the only study we have planned right now is the redosing study and any further study, we\u2019ll update you as soon as we plan one.","Samantha Budd Haeberlein","Thanks, Al. Going to your first question, Geoff. Have we had independent review. As we mentioned, one of the first steps that we undertook was to engage external advisors to help us review this data and that did include independent statistical experts, but the data that we did take to the FDA as Al says was a full dataset, which was an analysis of the blinded data conducted using the same statistical analysis plan as we had originally planned for the end of the study. And the validity of the dataset was the first thing that we analyzed together with the FDA. To your second question on whether we are conducting another study. As we\u2019ve mentioned, our next steps are twofold, one is the FDA indicated to us that it is reasonable for us to file these two studies, and for us to go ahead and put together a re-dosing study for the patients who were in previously enrolled studies of aducanumab.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Michael Yee","Thanks. Thanks for the question. Appreciate it. Al or Samantha, I guess, just wanted to understand, ENGAGE a little bit more specifically in the high dose you appropriately say that there was a slightly negative trend overall in the high dose. But in the subgroup of exposure patients, which as you think about a third of it, they had a nice benefit. I guess the question is how do you think about the patients you did not have enough exposure, did they drive a strong negative trend? Are those patients at harm? How do you think about that since that\u2019s a huge majority of the patients and how is that explainable given the difference in EMERGE? Thanks.","Al Sandrock","Thanks, Michael. I\u2019ll start. Look, I don\u2019t think \u2013 first of all there is a slight negative. I would say that that was just basically no effect. And then those who did not have the high dose, I would not say that they had a negative effect, in fact, in many ways, there was either neutral or positive effect. But I would point out this, you remember the 6 milligram per kilogram dose arm in PRIME, that everybody was wondering about. You always ask me questions about it. I remember, Michael, and we thought that was an outlier. Well, maybe that wasn\u2019t the outlier. Maybe that was true in that the 3 milligram per kilogram that looked like it was trending was the outlier. So in other words, what I\u2019m saying is that there is a very sort of sharp dose response, if you will, you have to get to high dose of aducanumab and intermediate dosing at least in an 18-month trial is not enough.","Michael Yee","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Cory Kasimov","Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess first just to ask Phil\u2019s question more directly, can you tell us yet how many patients got the 14 doses of 10 mg per kg in each study in the full dataset? And then as a follow-up, did you see any difference in ApoE4 carriers versus non-carriers, especially in the patients who completed after the futility cohort and would have had more exposure to the higher dose? Thanks.","Samantha Budd Haeberlein","Yes. So the first thing I want to mention is, in terms of the numbers of subjects who had the particular dataset that you\u2019re referring to more dose, more than 10 doses of 10 milligram per kilogram, there\u2019s more than a 10% difference between the two studies, but that\u2019s not the only parameter of difference that is important for dose. As I\u2019ve mentioned, you need to achieve high dose for long enough, but also have no interruptions, and so that\u2019s a more complex calculation between the two studies.","Michel Vounatsos","ApoE4 versus non.","Samantha Budd Haeberlein","So your question regarding ApoE4 carriers versus non-carriers, the analysis that we\u2019ve conducted to date has been on the entire studies. And as we\u2019ve mentioned for EMERGE, we have a positive but we met the primary endpoint for the entire patient population and details of subgroups is something that will come to later. And we\u2019ll have details at CTAD.","Cory Kasimov","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Geoff Meacham","Hey, guys. Thanks for the question and all the detail on aducanumab. Al, I just have a couple of regulatory type of questions all related. If half of the EMERGE achieved significance at the high dose and none of ENGAGE achieved it, is it you guys expectations that the PRIME study could count as one of the two pivotals? Second one is, does a conditional approval, pending another successful Phase 3 did that come up in the FDA discussion? And then third, have you had any discussions with the European regulators on the data? Thank you.","Al Sandrock","Let me start with the last question first. So we have just started to contact the European regulators that we haven\u2019t had any substantive discussions as of yet. In terms of the EMERGE and ENGAGE, I \u2013 we looked at \u2013 we look at ENGAGE in totality as a positive study that stands on its own. And remember, as Samantha said we use pre-specified primary and secondary outcomes, we didn\u2019t look at a subset. We looked at all the patients and based on that, we believe the study met its primary endpoint and the secondary endpoints as well. I think that whether or not a single trial can be approved, there are circumstances where an FDA can approve a drug based on a single study, it\u2019s up to them to determine what those circumstances are, and so I\u2019ll just leave it at that and then I would say that ENGAGE, we believe, we showed the data for example in those who achieve sufficient exposure to 10 milligrams per kilogram. We do see evidence of efficacy. So I would say that EMERGE stands on its own, ENGAGE has supportive evidence, and I would also say that PRIME is supportive, it\u2019s a well controlled Phase 1b, some may call it Phase 2 trial, and we\u2019ll submit all the data.","Samantha Budd Haeberlein","Just to add there, Al, EMERGE is the study that met its primary endpoints. I think you said ENGAGE.","Al Sandrock","Did I say anything wrong?","Samantha Budd Haeberlein","Yes.","Al Sandrock","Yes. I get confused in times.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Brian Abrahams","Hi there. Thanks for taking my questions. So a question, just a little more clarity on the ENGAGE study, for the subgroups of patients I guess for both ENGAGE and EMERGE with 10 interrupted \u2013 receiving 10 uninterrupted high doses. Can you talk about the baseline characteristics for the aducanumab verse placebo arms across both studies and how well balanced those were? And then, can you maybe help us understand how feasible was it for patients? I guess, once the protocol \u2013 was protocols, were amended to remain on 10 uninterrupted doses or is the lesson here that if you do need to temporarily discontinue for ARIA or whatever reason you\u2019re probably best off not restarting the drug? Thanks.","Samantha Budd Haeberlein","So, thanks. Thank you for the question. I want to point out that the analysis that we conducted in close consultation with the FDA around determining who in ENGAGE did have a response were exploratory analysis. And any time that you look at a subset of patients who you have very important questions in regards to whether they are balance for the baseline characteristics. The studies overall, were very well balanced for all baseline characteristics and as I mentioned, ApoE4 status. But those subgroups are exploratory in nature and they help us understand that dosing is important for efficacy. And in the context of an 18-month trial, one does tend to see that you need a certain number of doses for clinical benefit of aducanumab. However, that\u2019s not the same as one would anticipate in a real world situation where an individual is taking aducanumab for an extended period of time, for a dose interruption would likely be of less significance.","Al Sandrock","Yes, I agree with Samantha. I think that dose suspension in the context of an 18-month study was \u2013 it could be problematic, because they didn\u2019t achieve enough of the high dose. But in clinical practice, we don\u2019t do 18 month treatment periods. We\u2019re going to treat patients for longer periods of time. And in that situation I think dose suspension may be acceptable in some patients.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Matthew Harrison","Great, thanks for taking the question. I guess a follow-up and sort of second question from me. So first one is, you\u2019ve been talking about exposure and dose a lot. Could you just broadly comment on how many of these patients actually achieved all the factors that you were looking for and how easily you think that will be the case in clinical practice. And I guess, the related question to that is, dose exposure curve that you\u2019re sort of talking about Al. I mean, what were their characteristics that were different were the kinetics of the amyloid plaque reduction different in these subgroup of patients with the achievement of tau or amyloid reductions were they significantly different. I\u2019m wondering what you think is sort of biologically happen to account for this steep dose exposure curve [indiscernible]?","Al Sandrock","These were good questions Matthew and we\u2019re still learning as we look at the data, but I would say this, the \u2013 even in MCI patient, if you look at the amount of amyloid in the brain, it\u2019s tremendous. It took 20 years to build that much up and in the context of an 18 month trial, you have to remove a large amount of amyloid. I think that\u2019s what distinguishes as you aducanumab and BAN2401, is that we can \u2013 it\u2019s safe enough to achieve the doses that allow us to remove a large amount of amyloid. And if you don\u2019t remove a large amount, you\u2019re not going to get an effect. Also there is a lag. You remove amyloid, and then there is a little bit of a lag for the clinical effect. We saw that in PRIME for example, where we did have some amyloid lowering of six months, but we saw no difference in the clinical outcomes at six months. It was \u2013 it took the 12-month time period to see \u2013 to start to see an effect on clinical outcomes. So in addition to a large amount of amyloid removal, I think you need to have a little bit of time for that, for that biological activity to have an effect on clinical outcomes That\u2019s what we see and I would say that if you look at the amyloid-PET results that was on one of the slides and those who had more than 10 doses of 10 milligrams, you can see that the SUVR score is very similar in ENGAGE in that subgroup of patients in ENGAGE to the EMERGE total dataset. So \u2013 and so again, what it says is that if you give it enough of the high dose, you can achieve a certain amount of amyloid removal and that certain amount is what\u2019s required to see the reduction in clinical decline in an 18 month study.","Samantha Budd Haeberlein","Yes, Al just add to that, on the question of numbers. On the graph that you\u2019ve just referred to, you got the end numbers. So they were 147 for EMERGE and 116 for ENGAGE in that CDR-Sum of Boxes analysis. But the question you ask of how many patients have the precise criteria? Well there aren\u2019t precise criteria. Dose response is not binary. And so, given the levels of dose you have a different response and it\u2019s a bit of a sliding scale. So we have that exploratory analysis that we disclosed to explain what it is we learned around the importance of dose, but there is no perfect number of doses that are required, it\u2019s not binary.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Ronny Gal","Hi everybody. And thank you for taking the question. And I\u2019m going to stay with aducanumab here. I\u2019m just kind of struggling with the movement from the Interim Futility Analysis to efficacy with relatively small number of patients. Just looking at the number of completed that you have here in EMERGE, you move from 803 patients in the futility analysis to 980 patients in the treatment. So it\u2019s about 180 more patients. If we assume a third of those were on the high dose, 60 more in your total number of folks that you have amyloid beta that you calls got sufficient exposure is at the end of the trial, 127 I kind of wonder if there is just a very small number of patients that drove the entire movement. If you can discuss a little bit that issue of how many patients actually contribute to the difference between stopping the trial for futility and showing efficacy would be appreciated. And then I\u2019m going to \u2013 if you don\u2019t mind going to throw my second one in and it will be different, not to kind of just for the variability. And do you have any way to protecting the highest dose TYSABRI from biosimilars through the first-generation products. If you can discuss that at all, I would appreciate it. Thanks.","Al Sandrock","Ronny, this is Al. My head is swimming even just with the first question. But, so I think first of all you should remember that in EMERGE even at the time of this utility analysis, that study was trending positive as Samantha said. And then we add those additional patients and it didn\u2019t take that many now to then in the April dataset to see that \u2013 they had met its primary endpoint. And then I would also say that we also looked at the patients who had not completed 18 months, all the rest of the patients, which is roughly half the patients because we only looked at the first half, the first half of the enrollees for futility. So it\u2019s a large number of patients that we ended up looking at and I remind you that result that you saw in that slide was all the patients in EMERGE, who had been randomized, the ITT population and it was using the prespecified primary and secondary endpoints. And then I now forgot the second question.","Ronny Gal","Before you jump into that if you look at the slide that you had Slide 22, the number of patient aducanumab that you have there is the number of patients received enough dose. The questions from some of my peers, was how many patients got exposed and both the numbers that we\u2019re seeing on aducanumab on Slide 22 are the numbers we should be thinking about?","Samantha Budd Haeberlein","So I just want to recap that Slide 22 was a piece of exploratory analysis, it is not the subset, to be release are supported, it\u2019s just a particular analysis to emphasize the point that there are subjects in ENGAGE, whom if they do have sufficient dosing, do support the outcome of EMERGE.","Al Sandrock","I would also say Ronny that the, PET was done in a subset of patients to \u2013 so the numbers that you see on the left side, which is the amyloid-PET are from \u2013 the only the subset who got the PET imaging.","Ronny Gal","And the numbers on the right, that\u2019s still not the complete set, this is just a \u2013 some sort of a subset.","Samantha Budd Haeberlein","That\u2019s correct.","Ronny Gal","And the second question was around, high dose TYSABRI?","Michel Vounatsos","IP protection for TYSABRI.","Jeff Capello","So what we would say that Ronny it\u2019s Jeff, is obviously what we can see kind of what happens with regard to the Phase 3 trials that are going on with regards to biosimilars and we\u2019re supportive of biosimilars coming into the market. We obviously have biosimilars business. We just have to see how their products do and we\u2019ll deal with it when it comes.","Joe Mara","And probably we have time for about two more questions.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jay Olson from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Jay Olson","Well, hi. First off, I want to congratulate you for hanging in there and delivering these aducanumab results today. This is very promising news for Alzheimer\u2019s patients and their families. And second of all, I want to thank you for taking my questions. Can you comment on the clinical meaningfulness of aducanumab\u2019s efficacy profile and how does it line up with your target product profile in terms of improvements in cognition and function. Are there any gaps in the profile as you know it now, and how do you know if you optimize the efficacy at the 10 mg per kick dose or would it make sense to test higher doses? Thank you.","Michel Vounatsos","Jay, I\u2019ll start and then Samantha will follow up. We believe it is clinically meaningful, we heard that anything above 20% is clinically meaningful as a neurologist being the first drug of its \u2013 of its kind we have no drugs right now that affect the clinical decline in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This would be the very first. So anything North of 20%, we believe is clinically meaningful and I would also add that \u2013 in clinical practice. I think that MCI patients, will be \u2013 if approved though enjoy the benefit of living an more independent life for longer periods of time. If you look at that AD, the activities of daily living, It\u2019s a 40% effect and that\u2019s a caregiver assessment of whether or not that the patients can live independently, can do their household chores, etcetera so. That\u2019s all very clinically meaningful results.","Jay Olson","There\u2019s a question around the dose to 10 mgs?","Samantha Budd Haeberlein","Yes. So the question of whether we had achieved the correct dose. I think what we have learned clearly is that dose is very important, but that if individuals do receive 10 milligram per kilogram then they do have an efficacious response. I think the trials unfortunately were hampered by a number of operational and other implications that meant \u2013 that not enough patients got 10 milligram per kilogram, so we do believe that would be the correct dose.","Jay Olson","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Paul Matteis from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Paul Matteis","Great, thanks for fitting me in. Really appreciate it. Within the high dose arm in the ENGAGE study, can you talk about the magnitude of plaque reductions you observed in patients who titrated all the way up to the highest dose versus patient who ever stopped at 6 mg per kg and I guess, does a differential magnitude of plaque reduction in those patients that I\u2019ll tell the same narrative you\u2019re seeing on the difference in clinical outcomes? And then can you just tell us anything else about other measures of function in the engage subset of patients, who titrated all the way up to 10 mgs per kg? Thanks so much.","Samantha Budd Haeberlein","Thank you. So, to your first question in amyloid plaque reduction, we do believe that PET measurement of amyloid plaque reduction is a very sensitive tool of dose and you\u2019ve correctly identified that ENGAGE at the high dose is showing a lower reduction than in EMERGE and we do believe that, that is a clear reflection of the lower doses that were achieved in that high dosing group in ENGAGE. And the second question was.","Paul Matteis","Other measures that function...","Samantha Budd Haeberlein","Other measures that function. Yes, so the exploratory analysis that we have demonstrated for you, we focused on the primary endpoint, and we do not have the same analysis for the functional endpoints, but you do have those results for the overall study where even in ENGAGE, we do have some response on the functional scores, albeit not statistically significant.","Joe Mara","Okay, thank you. And I\u2019ll turn it back to Michel for some closing comments.","Michel Vounatsos","So thank you all for attending our Q3 call characterized by the go-to file decision for aducanumab with the US FDA, but also with a solid performance for the quarter. Today is about hope and opportunity for the patients first but also for the shareholders. Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call.

And issue a statement on Twitter when they become available. We do this instead of publishing earnings releases and any releases related to Investor Events and earnings calls via Newswire services. Our Twitter handle is @biogen.","Now, I will turn the call over to Michel.","Michel Vounatsos","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First let me start with some financial highlights. Biogen closed 2018 with an all-time high in quarterly revenues of $3.5 billion, an increase of approximately 7% compared to the same period a year ago.","For the full year 2018, Biogen generated another all-time high of $13.5 billion in revenues, representing growth of 10% year-over-year. Full year 2018 GAAP earnings were $21.58 a share, an 81% increase versus full year 2017. Full year 2018 non-GAAP earnings were $26.20 a share, a 20% increase versus full year 2017. We are pleased with this strong year-over-year growth as we continue to execute on our strategy to solidify our long-term leadership position in neuroscience.","Now, let me review the year. First, full year MS revenues including OCREVUS royalties were $9.1 billion demonstrating resilience. The number of patients on our MS products globally remained relatively stable versus the prior year. Importantly, we continued to see improving trends for our MS business in the U.S. on a year-over-year basis.","Second, SPINRAZA, which we pioneered in collaboration with Ionis as the first treatment for SMA, generated full year global revenues of $1.7 billion, and nearly double the revenues we delivered in 2017. This blockbuster performance was driven by strong year-over-year revenue growth in the U.S. and even greater revenue growth outside of the U.S.","Over the past year, including the expanded access programs and clinical trials, we have more than doubled the number of patients on SPINRAZA to over 6,600 patients. SPINRAZA is the standard of care in SMA with approval in over 40 countries and formal reimbursement in 30 countries.","Third, we continue to expand and progress our neuroscience pipeline with strong momentum, building depth in our core growth areas. We are leveraging the interconnectivity within neuroscience as we aim to create multiple franchises beyond MS, SMA, and Alzheimer's disease.","2018 was one of the most productive years we have had in research and development as we aim to further de-risk our pipeline and prepare for multiple potential launches in the early 2020s.","Starting with our core growth areas, we made significant progress in our MS pipeline including an NDA submission to the FDA, initiating new life cycle management initiatives, and increasing investment in our R&D portfolio to develop potentially transformative new treatments, which Mike will discuss in more details. In Alzheimer's and dementia, we completed Phase 3 enrollment of aducanumab. We initiated a Phase 2 study of BIIB092 in Alzheimer's disease, and we announced topline results of BAN2401 with our partner Eisai.","In neuromuscular disorders, we made impressive progress building depth. We acquired BIIB110, a muscle enhancement program from AliveGen. We initiated a Phase 1 study of BIIB078 targeting C9orf in ALS, and we announced positive Phase 1 interim results for BIIBO67 in SOD1 ALS. In movement disorders, we created strong momentum. We initiated a Phase 2 study of BIIB054 in Parkinson's disease, and we completed enrollment of our Phase 2 study of BIIB092 in PSP.","In our emerging growth areas of acute neurology, neurocognitive disorders, and pain, we did initiate four new studies. We expanded our pipeline with the addition of BIIB104 for cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia and our option for TMS-007 for acute ischemic stroke. We are also advancing the program -- the Phase 3 program for BIIB093 in large hemispheric infarction with a potential to generate peak revenues of over $1 billion with initial launches as early as 2022.","Moving on to our biosimilars business. Full year biosimilars revenues were $545 million, which represents 44% growth year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, we launched IMRALDI, our adalimumab biosimilar referencing Humira in several European markets. IMRALDI has generated $17 million in revenues since its launch in mid-October, making it our most successful first quarter launch of a biosimilar.","Importantly, our cash generation remained very strong and continued to provide us with significant optionality and flexibility to allocate capital. In 2018, we spent a total of approximately $1.8 billion through six business [ph] development deals and the increase in our share of the Samsung Bioepis joint venture.","We continue to diligently evaluate new opportunities for more potential business development and M&A. We also repurchased approximately 14.8 million shares for $4.4 billion, and we have about $2 billion remaining in our share repurchase program.","In addition, we began 2019 with a new collaboration with Skyhawk Therapeutics with the aim of developing oral splicing modulator for multiple diseases, including MS and SMA. We continue to be financially disciplined, and we are focused on implementing a lean and simple operating model with the goal of continuous operational improvements.","As we have demonstrated in the past, we are committed to maximizing returns for our shareholders while continuing to bring innovative therapies to patients, something that demands a thoughtful approach towards all our investments over both the short term and long term.","In summary, 2018 was clearly a very productive and successful year for Biogen, as we executed on our strategy and continued to deliver noticeable progress. Our core MS business demonstrated resilience, SPINRAZA continued to grow in the U.S. and even more outside of the U.S., and we remain committed to our goal of being the long-term standard of care in SMA. ","We expanded and progressed our pipeline by adding six new clinical programs and completing enrollment of three late-stage studies. We grew our biosimilar business and launched IMRALDI in Europe. We are actively implementing a leaner and simpler operating model, and we are generating ample cash as we focus on strategically allocating capital to develop and build depth in our neuroscience portfolio, again with a goal of maximizing shareholder returns and bringing innovative therapies to patients.","Overall, we continue to make progress towards our goal of building a multi-franchise neuroscience portfolio, and we are very excited about our upcoming data readouts.","I would now turn the call over to Mike for a more detailed update on our recent progress in R&D.","Michael Ehlers","Thank you, Michel, and good morning, everyone. Neuroscience is experiencing a revolution in science and medicine. There is no a large area of unmet needs and disease in the nervous system, and we believe that our focus on neuroscience offers a key strategic advantage.","Before I discuss our pipeline in more detail, let me comment on our recent progress on building a multi-franchise neuroscience portfolio, supported by a broad range of therapeutic modalities.","Complementing our expanded collaboration with Ionis delivers their antisense oligonucleotide platforms. Earlier this month, we announced a strategic set of collaborations with C4 Therapeutics and Skyhawk Therapeutics to discover and develop novels, small molecule approaches for neurological diseases.","Our collaboration with C4 Therapeutics, we utilize C4's platform to discover small molecules and engage the endogenous ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system to selectively tag disease-causing potential for degradation.","And through our collaboration with Skyhawk, we aim to discover small molecules capable of modulating RNA splicing at selective pre-messenger RNAs, including SMN2.","With these collaborations, we have further expanded the breadth of modalities we are pursuing, which now includes biologics, antisense oligonucleotide, oral protein degraders and splicing modulators and gene therapy.","As Michel discussed, looking over 2018, we added six clinical programs to our pipeline and transitioned five pipeline candidates from research to development. The same number as the previous year, which nearly doubled Biogen's historical productivity. Thus, once again, 2018 represented a substantial enhancement of our differentiated clinical portfolio of potential breakthrough medicines.","Turning to advances in the fourth quarter. Let me start with the depth, we are building in neuromuscular disorders. Last month, we, along with our partner Ionis, received data from an interim analysis of the Phase 1 study of BIIB067 in the form of familial ALS.","BIIB067 is antigens oligonucleotide, targeting superoxide dismutase 1 or SOD1, mutations in which confer a toxic gain of function and cause a familial form of ALS that constitutes approximately 2% of all ALS cases. This interim analysis demonstrated both proof-of-biology and proof-of-concept with the concordance across multiple clinical and biomarker endpoints.","Specifically, at the highest dose tested, we saw a statistically significant lowering of SOD1 protein in the CSF with the p-value of 0.002 and a trend towards lowering of CSF neurofilament, a biomarker of axonal injury.","And we observed a numerical trend across three dimensions of clinical efficacy, consistent with the potentially meaningful clinical benefit as compared to placebo. Specifically, we observed swelling of clinical decline as measured using the ALS Functional Rating Scale, slowing of decline in respiratory function as measured by slow vital capacity and slowing of decline in muscle strength as measured by handheld dynamometry.","Based on these positive data, we plan to add an additional cohort to the study to further evaluate the highest dose. With very limited treatment options for this devastating genetic form of ALS, we believe this additional cohort could provide important new data to support the rapid path to registration.","More broadly, we believe that these data have positive implications for additional antisense oligonucleotides in our pipeline, including BIIB078, which targets C9ORF72, BIIB080, which targets tau and up to two antisense oligonucleotides -- in clinic this year.","Additionally, we believe that these data exemplify the depth we are building in neuromuscular disorders, including ALS and highlight the interconnectivity across our pipeline.","Turning to SMA, as a leader in the space, we welcome additional therapeutic options for patients, including the potential launch of Novartis gene therapy, AVXS-101, which we believe will be initially indicated for infants.","A number of questions remain for this experimental approach as data on the safety, efficacy and durability of AVXS-101 remain limited with the results reported to date for only 15 patients followed for up to 2.5 years, seven of whom are reported to have subsequently initiated treatment with SPINRAZA.","This is, in contrast, to the SPINRAZA clinical trial program, which has included more than 300 patients followed for up to six years. It is important to note that there are significant differences in the age and severity of the patient population between the Sham Control ENDEAR study of SPINRAZA and the Phase 1 open-label study of AVXS-101.","We believe that earlier treatment initiation positively impacts the clinical efficacy of agents designed to boost full length SMN protein production. Patients in the ENDEAR study were older with the mean age at first dose of 5.3 months, whereas participants in the Phase 1 open-label study of AVXS-101 initiated treatment earlier with a mean age of first dose of 3.4 months. Thus direct comparisons between these data sets are not scientifically valid.","In addition to ENDEAR, we are very encouraged by the data from the NURTURE study of SPINRAZA in presymptomatic infants which shows patients on average achieving motor milestones consistent or nearly consistent with normal development. We believe these data, combined with the real world reports of significant efficacy across all patient types and ages, supports SPINRAZA remaining the standard-of-care in SMA even after the introduction of alternative modalities.","Turning to MS and neuroimmunology. Biogen strategy to extend our leadership position in MS has focused on three strategic imperatives. First is the pursuit of next-generation therapies for relapsing form of MS while also advancing life cycle management for our current portfolio. Second, we aim to advance the care of progressive forms of MS by leveraging emerging insights and new drug targets. Third, we aim to slow or reverse disability progression and restore function through remyelination and excellent repair or protection.","As Michel discussed, we've made significant progress this quarter across these imperatives, including submitting the NDA for diroximel fumarate, or VUMERITY, in the U.S. with head-to-head data versus TECFIDERA expected mid-year; reinitiating development of BIIBO61, a small molecule remyelination agent; dosing the first patient in the NOVA study; examining the efficacy of extended interval dosing of TYSABRI; and dosing the first patient in a bioequivalent study of intramuscular formulation of PLEGRIDY. For more details on each of these programs I encourage you to review our MS Investor Webcast held on December 12 of last year, which is available on our website.","We also had exciting new developments with our industry-leading Alzheimer's disease and dementia portfolio. At the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease Meeting, or CTAD, we presented updated analysis of the long-term extension of the Phase 1b PRIME study of aducanumab which were generally consistent with previous analysis. In addition, there were no changes to the risk-benefit profile of aducanumab.","We also showed data from the PRIME study suggesting that following treatment with aducanumab, the reduction in brain amyloid correlates with slowing of clinical decline. We expect final data from ENGAGE in EMERGE, the Phase 3 studies of aducanumab in early 2020.","Also at CTAD, our collaboration partner Eisai presented additional analysis of the Phase 2 study of BAN2401. Data from pre-specified subgroup analysis showed that treatment with BAN2401 was associated with the reduction in brain amyloid as well as clinical benefit across subgroups of APOE genotype, clinical stage and concomitant use of AD medications.","Importantly, while the study was not powered to show statistical significance in subgroup analysis, we believe there was evidence of clinical benefit in both APOE for carriers and non-carriers with small sample sizes potentially explaining the numerical differences in clinical efficacy between these subgroups.","Overall, we continue to believe that the data from BAN2401 increases the probability of success for both this asset as well as aducanumab. BAN2401 and aducanumab share important features, distinguishing them from other anti-beta amyloid anybodies including specificity for binding aggregated forms of beta amyloid, full effector function, which we believe is important for inducing amyloid clearance by microglia, data demonstrating robust removal of amyloid plaque in humans and signals a potentially clinically meaningful slowing of cognitive decline across multiple measures. To our knowledge, amongst clinical a-beta antibodies only aducanumab and BAN2401 share these features.","Together with Eisai, we are pursuing a large Phase 3 studies to confirm these findings including the planned initiation of a Phase 3 study of BAN2401 following the conclusion of ongoing regulatory dialogues. Eisai also presented safety and efficacy data from the Phase 2 study of elenbecestat, a small molecule base inhibitor being evaluated in two Phase 3 studies and in response to external data presented at CTAD suggesting that treatment with other base inhibitors has been associated with trends toward cognitive worsening, a cognitive safety monitoring plan has been implemented in the ongoing elenbecestat studies to ensure that patient safety is paramount.","The independent Data Monitoring Committee has reviewed data from the Phase 3 studies and recommended that the studies proceed and we will continue to monitor safety, including cognitive safety, as the study progresses. Finally, given the evidence that the beta-amyloid pathology begins to accumulate in the brain decades prior to the clinical onset of Alzheimer's disease, I am pleased to announce that we along with our partner Eisai are planning to initiate a Phase 3 study to evaluate whether early use of aducanumab can prevent or delay the clinical onset of Alzheimer's disease.","The study will include patients with evidence of amyloid pathology in the brain with or without subjective cognitive complaints. This represents an earlier phase of the disease, demonstrating studies in ENGAGE and EMERGE and is otherwise referred to as Stages 1 and 2 in the FDA draft guidance on treatment of early Alzheimer\u2019s disease. We look forward to sharing more details about this study in the near future.","Moving to our progress in neuropathic pain. In October, we indicated that we have paused the initiation of the Phase 3 program of vixotrigine or BIIB074 in the state and use-dependent voltage-gated sodium channel blocker in trigeminal neuralgia.","Now, based on recent feedback from the FDA, I am pleased to say that we are planning to initiate a Phase 3 program for the development of vixotrigine in trigeminal neuralgia by the end of the year. And in parallel, we continue to enroll a Phase 2 study of vixotrigine for small fiber neuropathy.","Within neurocognitive disorders, last month we dosed the patient in the Phase 2b study of BIIB104 for the treatment of cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia. BIIB104 is a first-in-class AMPA receptor potentiator that we believe has compelling data from a number of distinct early clinical studies, demonstrating functional circuit activation as measured by fMRI, treatment effects on relevant domains of cognitions such as working memory, short-term memory, verbal recall and reasoning, and the potential for favorable benefit risk profile.","Broadly speaking, we believe neurocognitive impairment is a central node in the network of symptomatology that defines many neurological diseases. Therefore, we believe BIIB104 may have potential applicability in multiple diseases within our core and emerging growth areas.","As we strive to be the neuroscience leader, we continue to prioritize our activities and build depth in what we believe are our most promising programs and disease areas. With that in mind, last month we made the strategy decision to terminate our collaboration with AGTC to develop AAV-based gene therapies for X-linked retinoschisis or XLRS and X-linked retinitis pigmentosa or XLRP based in part on recent clinical data in XLRS.","We have also decided to terminate specific programs included in our collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania. To be clear, our SMA gene therapy program with UPenn, which remains on clinical hold with the FDA, is not affected by this decision.","Overall, Biogen R&D delivered significant progress in 2018. We believe we are in a strong position today with four programs in Phase 3, 13 in Phase 2, and seven in Phase 1 with the deep pre-clinical pipeline across multiple modalities and we continue to generate clinical data that reinforce our commitment to neuroscience and the intrinsic interconnectivity of the space.","For instance, we believe our recent positive date on BIIB067 in SOD1 ALS, resonate across our pipeline, supporting the depth we are building in ALS and highlighting the promise of our collaboration with Ionis to leverage the antisense oligonucleotide platform across a range of neurological disorders.","And we don't stop there. To realize our vision of becoming the definitive leader in neuroscience, we look forward to continuing to invest in and advance our pipeline in asymmetric capabilities with the goal of developing innovative medicines with the potential to transform the lives of patients living with devastating neurological diseases.","I will now pass the call to Jeff.","Jeff Capello","Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. Let me now provide some detail on our financial performance for 2018 and share with you our guidance for 2019.","Let's start with revenues. As Michel mentioned earlier, we had a strong Q4 2018 from a revenue perspective. Total revenue for the fourth quarter grew 7% year-over-year or approximately $3.5 billion and grew 10% for the full year to $13.5 billion.","Overall, our MS business delivered revenues of $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018, including OCREVUS royalties for approximately $152 million. MS revenues in the fourth quarter of 2018 decreased 1% versus the prior year without OCREVUS royalties and increased 2% including OCREVUS royalties.","In the U.S. MS revenues in the fourth quarter 2018 benefited from channel inventory build for approximately $115 million, compared to a build of approximately $15 million in Q4, 2017.","Our U.S. business continued to show signs of stabilization in the fourth quarter, continuing the trends of improving year-over-year performance we saw throughout 2018.","Full year MS revenues were $9.1 billion including OCREVUS royalties of approximately $478 million, representing a decrease of less than 1% versus the prior year. Excluding OCREVUS royalties, MS revenue decreased 4% versus the prior year. Full year 2018 MS revenues benefited by approximately $86 million versus the prior year due to changes in foreign exchange rates, net of hedging.","Global fourth quarter TECFIDERA revenues were $1.1 billion, a 3% increase versus the prior year. This included revenues of $856 million in the U.S., an increase of 3% versus the fourth quarter 2017 and $254 million outside the U.S., an increase of 4% versus the fourth quarter of 2017.","TECFIDERA benefited from increase in channel inventory in U.S. of approximately $65 million in the fourth quarter 2018 compared to an increase of approximately $40 million in Q4 2017. We were pleased to see continued relative stability in new prescriptions in U.S. as we have now anniversaried the launch of OCREVUS.","Outside the U.S., we performed very well in Q4 2018 with double-digit volumes increases in Europe and Japan versus the prior year. Somewhat offset by pricing pressures in several European countries. For the full year, worldwide TECFIDERA revenues were $4.3 billion, an increase of 1% versus prior year. This included $3.3 billion in the U.S. and $1 billion in sales outside the U.S.","The Interferon revenues including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY were $597 during the fourth quarter, a decrease of 7% versus of Q4 2017 due to continued shift from the injectable platforms to oral or high-efficiency therapies. This included $4.31 million in the U.S. and $166 million in sales outside the U.S. Within the U.S.","AVONEX and PLEGRIDY benefited from the channel inventory build for approximately $40 million compared to a build of approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. For the full year, worldwide Interferon revenues were $2.4 billion, consisted of $1.7 billion in the U. S. and $695 million in sales outside the U.S.","TYSABRI worldwide revenues were $464 million this quarter, stable versus the fourth quarter of 2017. This included $257 million in the U.S. and $208 million outside the U.S. In the U.S. revenues increased 2% versus of the prior year. Within the U.S. TYSABRI benefited from a channel inventory build of approximately $10 million compared to relatively stable inventory levels in the fourth quarter 2017.","Within the fourth quarter, we saw continued improvement in TYSABRI performance in the U. S. with the highest new prescription share since the launch of OCREVUS. Outside the U.S. TYSABRI revenue increased 1% versus the prior year. For the full year, worldwide TYSABRI revenues were approximately $1.9 billion, a decrease of 6% versus the prior year, primarily due to the launch of OCREVUS. We recorded U.S. revenues of $1 billion in the U.S. and $839 million internationally.","As expected across our MS business, we saw an increased discounts and allowances in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, primarily due to seasonality. Throughout 2019, we expect another couple hundred basis points of pressure on discounts and allowances with a typical seasonality in the first and fourth quarters.","Overall, we were very pleased with the performance of our MS business in 2018 and are focused on maintaining the resilience of this franchise in light of new competition entering the market. We expect the rate of change in full year global MS product revenues excluding OCREVUS to be similar in 2019 versus 2018, mostly offset by expected growth of OCREVUS royalties. Additionally, we expect a potential inventory draw down in the first quarter of 2019.","Let me now move on to SPINRAZA. Global fourth quarter SPINRAZA revenues were $470 million, a $30 million increase versus the prior year and relatively flat versus the third quarter. This included revenues of $236 million in U.S., an increase of 5% versus the third quarter and $234 million outside the U.S. a decrease of 4% versus Q3.","For the full year 2018, worldwide SPINRAZA revenues were nearly double to $1.7 billion. This included $854 million in the U.S. and $870 million in sales outside the U.S. The number of patients on therapy in U.S. increased by 9% as compared to the end of third quarter of 2018 and discontinuations remained relatively low.","In the U.S., we continue to make strong progress with adults. In the fourth quarter more than 50% of new starts were adults, increasing the total number of adult patients on SPINRAZA to nearly 1,000, an increase of approximately 20% versus the third quarter of 2018.","We saw a continued increase in the revenue contribution from maintenance doses this quarter. In the U.S., approximately 65% of SPINRAZA units in the fourth quarter were attributed to maintenance doses as compared approximately 60% in the third quarter.","In the fourth quarter, approximately 15% of U.S. SPINRAZA units were dispensed through our pre-drug program, similar to the third quarter and a decrease from approximately 20% a year ago.","Outside the U.S., the number of commercial SPINRAZA patients increased approximately 18% versus the prior quarter and there are approximately 260 patients active in the expanded access program.","We recorded revenue from over 40 international markets in the fourth quarter. Despite overall -- excuse me, despite strong overall patient growth, fourth quarter ex-U.S. SPINRAZA revenue increase slightly versus the third quarter due to combination of lower volumes in certain markets due to lowing dose dynamics, the timing of shipments in certain distributor markets, and pricing dynamics in certain markets.","In 2019, we expect global SPINRAZA revenues to grow in the mid to high-teens and we expect growth in both the U.S. and outside the U.S. We expect global SPINRAZA revenue to be relatively stable in Q1 2019 versus Q4 2018 due to seasonality followed by quarter-over-quarter growth.","Outside of the U.S., we expect continued patient growth in 2019, although at a slower pace in 2018. Overall, we were very pleased with both the performance and outlook for SPINRAZA as we continue to believe it has delivered the best launch from an orphan drug ever and continue to deliver strong growth for the company.","Let me now move to our biosimilars business, which generates $156 million revenue this quarter, an increase of 28% versus the prior year. Full year biosimilar revenues were $545 million, an increase of 44% versus the prior year.","BENEPALI continue to be the market leader in countries such as U.K., Denmark and Norway, and became the market leader in the Germany in the fourth quarter.","TYSABRI revenues grew 24% quarter-over-quarter. In October 17th, we launched IMRALDI, our biosimilar referencing HUMIRA. While it is too early to comment on specific share data, we can say that we are very pleased with IMRALDI sales performance in the first quarter in the market, in many cases surpassing the initial rate of uptake from BENEPALI","With the launch of IMRALDI, Biogen became the first company to offer all of the three main anti-TNF biosimilars across Europe. In 2019, we expect double-digit revenue growth from a biosimilars business, primarily driven by the launch of IMRALDI.","Turning to our anti-CD20 revenues, we recorded $535 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 29% versus the prior year, primarily driven by OCREVUS royalties. Full year anti-CD20 revenues were $2 billion, a 27% increase versus 2017. Within anti-CD20 revenues our estimated OCREVUS royalties were $152 million for the fourth quarter and $478 million for the full year. We expect a slight decline in anti-CD20 revenue in 2019, driven by the expected launch of RITUXAN biosimilars in the second half of the year.","Total other revenues were $166 million in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 8% versus the prior year. Other revenues were $586 million for the full year, an increase of 63% versus 2017.","In 2019, we anticipate a modest increase in these revenues with revenue heavily loaded in the first quarter due to the affected timing of sales of approximately $200 million of remaining inventory associated with the Bioverativ\u2019s spinoff, which carries a lower gross margin.","Let me now turn to gross margin performance. Q4 2018 gross margin was 86% of revenues versus approximately 86% in the fourth quarter of 2017, driven by unfavorable net mix of revenue in Q4 2017. Gross margins for the full year of 2018 were approximately 86%, relatively flat compared to the full year 2017.","In 2019, we expect gross margin compression due to sale of remaining Bioverativ inventory just discussed were substantially all the impact anticipated in the first quarter.","Q4 GAAP R&D expense was 17% of revenue or $612 million. Q4 non-GAAP R&D expense was also 17% of revenue or $602 million. Q4 R&D expense includes $35 million opt-in payment we made to Ionis related to BIIB067 for ALS and $17 million related to our collaboration agreement with C4 Therapeutics.","Full year GAAP R&D expense was 19% of revenue or $2.6 billion. Full year non-GAAP R&D expense was 18% of revenue or $2.4 billion. We expect Q1 2019 R&D expense to include approximately $35 million, related to our collaboration agreement with Skyhawk.","Q4 GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A were both 17% of revenue or $591 million. Full year GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A were both 16% of sales or $2.1 billion. Both GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A increase versus the prior quarter, due to the timing of spend as well as certain investments across sales and marketing, worldwide medical and G&A. In 2019, we expect total OpEx per quarter to be slightly above $1.1 billion, as we continue to invest in our pipeline and prepare for the potential launch of aducanumab.","GAAP other net expense which includes interest was $29 million in Q4 and GAAP other net income was $11 million for the full year. Non-GAAP other net expense was $16 million in Q4 and $117 million for the full year. We expect other net expense to be lower in 2019 due to higher interest income resulting from larger cash balances and higher interest rates versus 2018.","In Q4, our GAAP tax rate was approximately 33% as we booked a GAAP tax charge of $136 million related to the initial recognition of deferred taxes on the GILTI tax of international earnings, a component of U.S. corporate tax reform by this legislation.","In Q4, our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 21%. For the full year, our GAAP tax rate was approximately 24% and our non-GAAP tax rate was roughly 21%. In 2019, we expect the underlying run rate for our tax rates to benefit by approximately 200 basis points as a result of U.S. corporate tax reform.","Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately $200 million for the fourth quarter and $205 million for the full year. We repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares in the fourth quarter at an average price of $311.24 for a total value of approximately $1.4 billion, which now brings us to our diluted earnings per share.","In the fourth quarter, we booked GAAP EPS of $4.73 compared to GAAP loss of $1.40 per share in the fourth quarter 2017 and non-GAAP earnings of $6.99 per share, a 33% increase versus the prior year. For the full year, GAAP EPS was $21.58, an 81% increase versus 2017 and non-GAAP EPS was $26.20, a 20% increase versus 2017.","As a reminder, fourth quarter and full year 2017 GAAP EPS was negatively impacted by $5.51 due to U.S. corporate tax reform. We generated approximately $1.9 billion in net cash flows from operations in the fourth quarter and approximately $6.2 billion for the full year. We ended the quarter with approximately $4.9 million in cash and marketable securities and $5.9 million in debt.","Let me now turn to our full year guidance for 2019. We expect revenues of approximately $13.6 billion to $13.8 billion assuming current foreign exchange rates. We anticipate gross margins of 85% to 86%, driven by the unfavorable mix issues I discussed earlier.","We anticipate R&D expense between 16% and 17% of revenue. Of note, guidance does not include any impact from potential acquisitions or large business development transactions as both are hard to predict. We expect SG&A expense to be approximately 16% to 17% of revenues, as we expect to begin meaningful investments in launch preparation activities for aducanumab.","We anticipate our GAAP tax rate for 2019 to be between 18.5% to 19.5% and our non-GAAP tax rate to be between 18% to 19%. We anticipate full year GAAP diluted EPS results of $26.65 to $27.65 representing growth of 23% to 28% and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be $28 to $29, representing growth of 7% to 11%. From a quarterly perspective, it's important to recognize that we had a large business development expense in Q2 2018 effecting the year-over-year comparison for Q2 2019.","I'll now turn the call back over to Michel for his closing comments.","Michel Vounatsos","Thank you, Jeff. We closed 2018 with strong commercial performance, double-digit earnings growth versus a year ago and strong execution of our strategy. We opened 2019 with the announcement of two business development deals. We have enhanced our neuroscience pipeline and broaden our capabilities across multiple modalities as we prepare for multiple upcoming important readouts.","Biogen's vision and strategy are clear. As a pioneer, we aim to capture the significant unmet medical need in neuroscience with a goal of bringing potential new therapies faster and more efficiently to patients. For 2019, we aim to continue our momentum and achieve our guidance.","To deliver on our aspirations, we remain focused on executing well on our strategic priorities to fortify our core business in MS and SMA. And also, allocate capital to expand and progress our neuroscience pipeline while opportunistically returning capital to shareholders.","Biogen will continue to actively pursue business development and M&A. Within the next 12 to 18 months, we expect further progress as we aim to build a multi-franchise neuroscience portfolio including data reduction Alzheimer's, including the final Phase 3 data for aducanumab as well as MS and PSP. Up to five new assets advancing into the clinic and potentially regulatory approval in the U.S. for VUMERITY in MS.","Finally, I want to reiterate our commitment to maximizing return to our shareholders and bringing innovative strategies to patients over the long-term. These demands that we continue to allocate capital efficiently, effectively and appropriately. As we have demonstrated in the past, we will always strive to have an optimal capital structure as well as aim for superior return from the investment we make.","Once again, I would like to thank our employees around the world, who are dedicated to making a positive impact on patient\u2019s life and all of the physician, caregivers and participants in our clinical development programs, our past and future achievements could not be realized without the passion and commitment.","With that, we will open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Your line is open.","Geoff Meacham","Hey, guys good morning. Thanks a lot for the question. Michel, when I look at 2019 guidance, it reflects a slower growth profile for both revenue and earnings. So, the question is from a strategy perspective, does this alter your view on BD, your capital allocation, or do you look at 2019 growth as more of a temporary trend?","And then Mike or Al, real quick, I just wanted to ask you guys on the new Phase 3 study for aducanumab in earlier stage Alzheimer's. Was this informed at all from ENGAGE, EMERGE or PRIME or something else? Thanks.","Michel Vounatsos","Thanks for the good questions. So, the strategy as you know is clear and simple and very usable. There\u2019s three main reasons to believe; first, we have a strong underlying momentum, solid base, value proposition, improving with the offer of biosimilars and we are working on the operating model.","Second, we have a strong and stronger engine for growth with all the enhanced pipeline that Mike spoke about, and we have very important landmark study readouts in the coming period, so this is a very exciting place to be.","Third, we have financial strengths. So concerning the BD and M&A, the drive first will be to continue to accelerate the buildup of our modalities and pipeline. This will be the key driver, scientific and strategic alignment.","We will not go for bridging a potential gap because we are not on a burning platform. The team is building up very well; the management team is spending a lot of time on those activities. We have a broad range of targets and we are working on that but with pace and calm.","Al Sandrock","So, hi Jeff, this is Al. On your second question, we've been considering doing this preclinical study, we call it, for a few years now and it's part of our broader life cycle management strategy.","I'd say the reasons why we're doing it are that many of our advisors and investigators have been encouraging us to do it for some time, and I would say also that the BAN2401 results that we got roughly six months ago increases our level of confidence in aducanumab, and then finally as you know FDA put out guidance recently that contemplates how you might get approval for early AD. So we believe one day, the standard of care will be to treat with amyloid-lowering drugs as early as possible and this trial will go a long way toward informing that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Michael Yee","Thanks, good morning. Congrats on the good quarter. I know everyone is focused on interim analysis, so I\u2019m asking if there will be an interim analysis on aducanumab? Just asking actually, it feels like the street would like to know if you had one or if you had a futility analysis whether that would be disclosable if you passed either of those?","I think Roche talks about the futility and how that's a material piece of information, so I just wanted to understand your view on whether you took either of those of if they will be on futility and whether that\u2019s disclosable? Thanks so much.","Al Sandrock","Mike, this is Al. I am really sorry, but we continue to have a policy here that we don't talk about interim analysis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Terence Flynn","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. With respect to SPINRAZA ex-U.S, I was just wondering if you can give us a little bit more detail on the impact in the fourth quarter from pricing versus loading dose, and then maybe help us think about the pacing going into 2019? And ex-U.S. reimbursement progress, any new countries that you guys are expecting to come on board in 2019? Thanks.","Michael Ehlers","Thanks for the question. So just to reiterate, we're very pleased with the performance of SPINRAZA, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. and think it has a very strong growth profile. It was up 60% year-over-year although down a little bit sequentially.","As I mentioned, really there are three factors that drove the sequential decline and that was; one, a shift from loading to maintenance doses in some of the more mature markets in Europe, the timing of shipments in certain distributor markets which are hard to predict, and then pricing dynamics including unfavorable country mix.","So as we look forward in 2019, we expect for that franchise to resume growth. We expect that to come from several sources. Number one, in the mature markets, just like we saw the dynamic of the shift in the U.S., we expect some of these larger markets to return to growth in 2019. Second, although the IPM, or International Partner Markets, will continue to be lumpy, they are a good source of growth for us, so we expect that to grow as well.","And then if you look at new markets, either entry into new markets for expansion into markets that we've just recently entered, there's a number of kind of interesting things that are happening. If we look at Europe first, we expect to enter the U.K. at some point in 2019 which would be a good size opportunity. In Turkey, we've been very successful in Type 1. We expect to kind of get Type 2 and Type 3. Saudi Arabia, Poland, and Portugal are all markets we expect to enter as well from a European perspective.","Moving around the world, Canada, we just recently got approval in the fourth quarter of 2018. We expect that to be a good growth opportunity for us and a good market. And then, if you look across the rest of the world, in Asia Pacific, South Korea, we expect to get reimbursement in that market in 2019. Taiwan is another good sized market, Hong Kong. And then, in China we expect to get in on a self-pay basis.","And then, Latin America, Brazil could be a sizable country. Today it's on a one-off approval basis. We expect to get reimbursement from the epidemiology is in the thousands in Brazil. So there's ample opportunity for us to grow. It's diversified regionally and by country. That's a real testament to both the effectiveness and reception of SPINRAZA worldwide.","Michel Vounatsos","So we expect to grow SPINRAZA during 2019 in the U.S. and ex-U.S. Remember, in the U. S. one year ago we're not sure by the ability of the organization to penetrate the large adult segment of the prevalence and we add 15%. This has driven more than 50% of the new starts in Q4. There is still a very long way to go. The organization is ready, working on that and beyond the U.S. just give some color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with SVB Leerink. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Porges","Thank you very much and I appreciate all the information on the call. I had a question on BIIB067. Mike, could you talk a little bit about the data? When we might see it? Whether you've had a chance to discuss it with the FDA? The size of the cohort? And how quickly this could advance? You seem quite excited about the signal. And then, perhaps you could just address what the general principles you take away from this finding are for the rest of your program? Thanks.","Michael Ehlers","Yes. Thanks, Geoff, for the question. A few things, hopefully I'll touch on each of these points. We will plan to present the data at an upcoming scientific meeting. We haven't quite yet determined that, but that will be in the coming months where we'll be able to talk about it some length.","We wouldn't really comment on our regulatory strategy at this point, I guess, what I would say is that we know this is a very severe disease. It's really little to nothing for these patients. So our anticipation here is that there would be good receptivity for the kind of efficacy that we think that we can see here.","Just on the data itself, so this is a Phase I study, keep in mind it was designed to be a safety study as primary endpoint of this patients largely, but we incorporated a number of biomarker pharmacodynamic and clinical endpoints in this.","And as I describe, it has been the collection of these both the lowering of SOD1 and the CSF has statistically significant a trend towards lowering in CSF neurofilament as well as three separate clinical outcomes, the ALSFRS, the slow vital capacity for respiratory function, the handheld dynamometry for muscle strength, and the concordance between these endpoints that have led to our excitement for these program.","And I would say the general takeaways you're asking about it\u2019s really two dimensions. One, is this is very, very encouraging to us across our ASO platform, I would say. This is our second foray after SPINRAZA. We've got many other clinical programs, new molecule as we get to the clinic. It shows us that in adult onset neurological disease we're targeting an RNase H-dependent mechanism that we are seeing signs of clinical efficacy.","I believe it will be the first demonstration of proof-of-clinical concept in adults with an RNase H mechanism per se. So we're excited about that. That's one dimension. The other is that the promise that this holds broadly speaking for us in ALS, and neuromuscular disease in general.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Cory Kasimov","Great, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, Al, I know you won't comment on any potential internal interim analysis. But I'm curious to get your thoughts around the expected upcoming interim readout for Roche\u2019s crenezumab in Alzheimer's, and so far as what you see as some of the kind of the key similarities and differences between your drug and Roche\u2019s drug? And also whether you see much of a read through to aducanumab based on these pending results?","Al Sandrock","Hi, Cory. I be cautious about too much read through. First of all these are not the same antibodies, crenezumab binds to sort of a mid-domain in A-beta42 peptide, aducanumab and BAN both are in terminal.","Aducanumab and BAN are highly selective for aggregated forms of A-beta both soluble oligomers as well as insoluble fibrils, crenezumab doesn't have that same level of specificity. I think it's important to note that crenezumab is an IgG4, which doesn't have full effect or function, whereas, BAN and adu both have full effect or function.","And finally, we just saw the results published recently on crenezumab Phase 2 where even their high dose IV arm, they did not show statistically significant lowering of amyloid plaque whether you use subcortical white matter or cerebellum as a reference region.","So that's another important difference between aducanumab and BAN, both of which show substantial reduction in amyloid plaque burden in human. So I think there are some notable differences, and I'll be cautious about too much of a read through.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Chris Raymond","Hey, thanks. Just a couple of financial questions. Just on the tax guidance, I think you're guiding to 200 to 300 bps lower year-on-year, and I know you cited corporate tax reform as the driver. But can you just maybe talk about the step down from 2018 or even the Q4 rate, which presumably should have benefited in tax reform? And is that number sustainable beyond 2019?","And then just on the inventory, I think last year you guys had $50 million Q4 inventory build for the MS franchise. This year I think it looks like it more than double, can talk about what's driving that difference? Thanks.","Jeff Capello","Yeah, so on the tax rate, if you back up to 2017, when we -- when U.S. tax reform got passed, we dropped the tax rate about 300 basis points and at that point we said that there was a further reduction in the tax rate due to tax reform that because of the way our legal structure works from an international perspective, there was inventory that would turn to the system and that would be for the reduction of the race.","So that 200 basis points is really kind of the higher simplistically think about is higher priced inventory from a tax perspective return to the system in 2018. So now in 2019 that inventory is gone, another raise is dropped. So I'm not able to kind of give you a long-term tax rate at this point.","We don't know long-term guidance, but we're comfortable with the rate going down 200 basis points from 2018 to 2019. And then thereafter, it will depend on a lot of things including the distribution of earnings and other things. But for now, I think, the guidance for 2019 is something you can rely on.","With regard to inventory, yes, so we built about $115 million worth of inventory in the fourth quarter compared to a build of roughly $50 million in the fourth quarter of last year, a lot of that\u2019s outside our control. We distribute our product through distributors and they decide to either build inventory or not and we'd recognize revenue on shipment into the channel, which is different than kind of the flow through or consumption of that inventory, which is what we highlighted for people so they can normalize.","So it's just beyond our control. It's not something that we have control over. So it's driven by external factors and we do our best to kind of manage through those and make sure it's clear to people in terms of what's driving demand.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore. Your line is open.","Umer Raffat","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First on aducanumab. My question is, and I have fully acknowledged and I don't think I ever asked about that interim. But my question is this. I realized there's a policy of not commenting on it, but once you do get a notification from the DSMB, given the sheer materiality of this, will you not put out a statement? And I guess that's really what I'm trying to get at, like, for example, trials continues as planned, like, will that happen or not happen once there is a notification to the management?","And then Jeff, on inventory my question is, so the Q4 \u2013 the inventory we saw on the slide and the disclosure for last year is obviously different than the inventory numbers that were reported last year, because of the change you guys implemented in 2Q. But my question is, in 2Q that inventory slide has two different metrics and it's been a little confusing to figure out when we see the inventory disclosures now, which of those metrics are actually being reported because the numbers are different on both.","Alfred Sandrock","Umer, this is Al, I am sorry, but we just can\u2019t comment on interim analysis.","Michael Ehlers","With regard to inventory, Umer, what we disclosed is the change within the quarter, for the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter, that's a number of thing we have consistently disclosed in the press releases so that is generally inventory build up by $115 million from the beginning of the fourth quarter to the end of the fourth quarter of 2018. Similarly in 2017 from the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2017 to the end, it's built by $50 million. So the change within the quarter is up $115 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and up $50 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. So we think the relevant metric people should look at is what was the change within the quarter and if you want to know what the change was comparatively, you take the difference of the change in the change, which is $65 million I think that's pretty clear.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Matthew Harrison","Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to clarify some comments you made about rebates and your outlook on the MS business, broadly can you just speak in a little bit more detail kind of like you were expecting a few hundred basis points of additional chargeback rebate pressure this year in the U.S. You thought that would be offset by OCREVUS, maybe you could just comment broadly on your outlook for the MS business in the U.S. and outside the U.S.? Thanks.","Michael Ehlers","So I think you're referring to two different things. I think we said we expect that our discount and allowances in the U.S. take to offer another couple hundred basis points which is very similar to what happened in 2018. And that's been driven by the mix of the business becoming more Medicaid, Medicare and 340B Hospital reliant in terms of the channel it goes through where there is higher discounts. So no different than the trend we saw from 2017 to 2018. We'll see more pressure from 2018 to 2019.","With regard to the performance of the MS business, I think we said that we expect that business globally to perform similarly excluding OCREVUS to what it did in 2018. And then for any difference would be made out by the OCREVUS royalties and the combination of both of those to be resilient which we kind of, say, flattish. So we expect the kind of the trends with regard to improvement to continue in the U.S., which is very encouraging and the outside the U.S. we will continue to see some pricing pressure and competition with OCREVUS rolling through Europe.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Ying Huang","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. A quick one for maybe Al. We know that cladribine is being in the registration with FDA. I was wondering do have any thoughts on cladribine impact on the MS market? Could we see something like OCREVUS in the U.S. dynamics?","And then secondly on SPINRAZA, from last quarter to this quarter your market share in infants and also in pediatrics have been stable about 50%. Do you see further growth in those two segments for SPINRAZA in the U.S. this year? Thank you.","Al Sandrock","Hi, Ying. This is Al. On cladribine it\u2019s -- we welcome any new therapy for MS patients, that's good for patients and good for doctors to have multiple options for their patients because MS patients are different, every one of them.","Having said that cladribine, it's oral, it's very convenient in the sense that you can give it every six months essentially a cycle every six months if you will, and the key question early on was the safety, which in some of the Phase III data there were some signals that were concerning, which prevented it from being approved a few years ago, and some of those questions may still remain, which takes sort of -- which makes the convenience of it less optimal if you will. So I'll just stop there.","Michel Vounatsos","Concerning SPINRAZA in the U.S. for infants and children if it was your question, we do believe that it is still opportunity to improve the penetration. The reason why we are 50% for infants is that some are still too advanced, and therefore they cannot be dosed.","For children and toddlers, one of the challenge was the complex spine, and we can see that the clinicians are able to dose better nowadays that they have more experience. So, we should be able to continue to make reasonable inroads. The biggest potential again remains really adult, the 60% opportunity for, which we penetrated thoroughly 15% and now have the capability, the reach and the infrastructure in terms of dosing capability and coverage is establishing the U.S.","Al Sandrock","Just as a reminder, we've got 2,600 patients in therapy in U.S. today; we estimate the total potential is 9,000. There's a lot of room to grow from perspective interest.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alethia Young with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Alethia Young","Hey, guys thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the progress. I guess, I want to talk a little bit more about, what you think have been impactful in your efforts with adult, SMA, and I\u2019ve seen that you're making some progress there. So, just wanted to get some more color on that? Thank you.","Michel Vounatsos","I would like to say that it starts with the team and the capability that Biogen was able to deploy in the marketplace. It takes a little bit of time for the more urgent infant population, for which we new that was a natural history the outcome of it, and the treatment centers were well identified.","For the adult population, less symptomatic that can live with some symptoms but they can live quite long life. It was a bit more difficult and challenging to find treating centers and to mobilize them for a better quality of life.","So this is why it took a little bit more time. So we enlarge the team, we did a lot of work in terms of medical affairs, and finally we showed that for the adult population there were incremental gains in functionality and this played a very important role. Al you want to add?","Al Sandrock","Yeah, I mean, many of these patients weren't seeing a neurologist anymore. They were maybe seeing rehab specialists, but they had -- since there was no treatment, they really weren't seeing neurologist even neuromuscular neurologist weren't really seeing them.","But now that there is a treatment, they're starting to find doctors and the doctors -- and it turns out their neuromuscular doctors are the same ones that are treating ALS patients by the way that are now treating a SPINRAZA patients that plus the fact that interventional radiologists have gotten really good at finding ways to get into this -- into the intrathecal space when people with complex spine, spinal fusions and other things present, and so I think it's a combination of both.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Citi. Your line is open.","Robyn Karnauskas","Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. So, because AveXis will be launching in kids, sometime people believe early for -- some time in middle of the year, in the first half of 2019, how do you view that uptake?","And do you think it's \u2013 you mentioned that some of these babies have difficulty getting the intrathecal infusions, would you think that be the area in which they'd start to take share? Or do you still believe that AVONE most likely will get a combination approach of gene therapy and SPINRAZA?","I'm just trying to get a sense of when we start to see that impact, how are you thinking about that for 2019 in your guidance? And then second question was, just on the inventory draw down, so do we still expect to have all of that inventory be taken out in the first quarter? Or do you think there'll be a higher level of inventory laying around for the year? Thanks.","Michael Ehlers","Okay. Robyn, this is Mike. I'll start on this and turn it over. I think our assumptions around the Novartis AVXS-101 gene therapy launch is, they've disclosed they filed in the U.S., E.U. and Japan for Type 1. Our base case is that they launch in the middle of the year and we expect that their initial label to be for Type 1 patients and mainly infants. And of course, we've been talking about it in the call, the majority of patient in Type 2 increase. So we really see this as probably being positioned for the Type 1 or the infantile SMA.","Then I think the latter part of your first question was that we do think that there is opportunity for complementarity between modalities. The NURTURE data in our mind with SPINRAZA demonstrates a nearly maximal potential efficacy in terms of normal motor development if you treat in that first six-week period with SPINRAZA.","That really I think sets the bar for the standard-of-care and it highlights the fact that at some level you really can't mess around on this. You've got a time window where maximal SMA protein expression really matters and I'd say the data that we\u2019ve generated with SPINRAZA really sets the bar very high. ","Al Sandrock","And the with regard to your question on inventory, we would expect the vast majority of the $200 million worth of inventory would get sold through in the first quarter and then there would be none left. Although, we need to manufacturing with Bioverativ but that's completely separate \u2013 distinct from the legacy inventory.","Michel Vounatsos","So for 2019 we aim to continue our momentum while we are getting ready for very important readouts. Thank you all for joining us today on our call. ","Operator","This concludes the Biogen Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Financial Results and Business Update Call.

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen first quarter 2017 financial results and business update. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Matt Calistri, Senior Director, Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.","Matthew Calistri - Biogen, Inc.","Thanks, Dan. Thank you and welcome to Biogen's first quarter 2017 warnings conference call. Before we begin I encourage everyone to go to the Investor section of biogen.com to find the press release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we'll discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in tables one and two. Table three includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We've also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call.","I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. On today's call I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Michel Vounatsos; Dr. Michael Ehlers, EVP of Research and Development; and our CFO, Paul Clancy. We'll be joined for the Q&A portion of the call by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Al Sandrock. Now I'll turn the call over to Michel.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I am especially pleased to welcome you to this call as the CEO of Biogen. Before I turn to the details of the quarter I would like to share some initial thoughts on how Biogen is positioned today and where we see the company progressing. We do have a differentiated expertise in neuroscience and expect this to remain our core moving forward. We intend to maximize the potential of our R&D assets and bolster our pipeline through both internal and external opportunities. We are focused on flawless commercial execution in our priority geographies across MS, SMA, and biosimilars. We are aligning the organization around these goals including building our senior management team. We want our actions to speak louder than our words.","As you will see throughout the rest of the call, I think we are already off to a great start. Q1 was a very good quarter financially and also a quarter with exciting events. For the first quarter of 2017, Biogen generated revenues of $2.8 billion, a 3% increase from the same period a year ago. On an apples-to-apples basis, when we exclude all hemophilia revenues from both period, we grew revenues 8% from the same period a year ago.","GAAP earnings were $3.46 a share, a 22% decrease from the same period a year ago, driven by the charge we took related to our settlement and license agreement with Forward Pharma which Paul will discuss later. Non-GAAP EPS was $5.20, a 9% increase versus the same period a year ago. Excluding hemophilia, non-GAAP EPS growth will have been even higher.","I am pleased with our results and achievement this quarter. Let me highlight what we think are the key takeaways for the quarter. First, financial performance. We saw continued stability in our MS franchise this quarter with a 38% global market share. MS revenues grew 3% year-over-year. We continued to add patients globally with a 2% increase versus last quarter and a 5% increase versus prior year. Biogen remains the global leader amongst the oral high efficacy and interferon MS therapies. Our SPINRAZA launch is off to a promising start with a first quarter revenue of $47 million. I am very proud of what our team has already accomplished, but we are still in the early days of the launch and have much more to achieve. We will not be satisfied until all of the patients and families that seek this treatment are able to receive therapy. This will take some time and tremendous effort from many, such as the dedicated medical teams that treat SMA, the passionate families, the remarkable advocates that rally for these patients, and our team of committed Biogen professionals, all of whom have been working seemingly nonstop to secure access and building up point of care. Our biosimilars business continued its strong trajectory and grew revenues 25% quarter-over-quarter.","Next, I want to talk about non-financial achievement during the quarter. First, we recently enhanced our pipeline with the announcement of the license agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb for a Phase 2 anti-tau asset which we expect to close this quarter. We believe this transaction positions Biogen to be at the forefront of Alzheimer's research in terms of both mechanisms of action and time to market. I am really proud to see us deliver on this deal and we are just getting started. And with that said, I also want to add that we are working to add more assets our pipeline.","Second, we are very pleased with the favorable outcome of the IPR proceeding and the interference. We believe these rulings underscore the strength of our patent portfolio for TECFIDERA. Additionally, we believe this will give us an ability to defend against potential challenges from MMF prodrugs that deliver a similar dose of MMF.","Third, we are progressing and prioritizing our pipeline and Mike will be giving you an update. But before I turn it over to Mike, let me provide you with more details on our commercial performance.","Starting with MS, first, we believe underlying demand for TECFIDERA remains stable in the U.S. with continued growth overseas. We remain focused on maximizing TECFIDERA's growth potential and we believe we are ready and well equipped to compete in an increasingly crowded market.","Second, we are very pleased with the increased demand seen for TYSABRI this quarter in both the U.S. and overseas. Our research indicates a consistently positive benefit to its profile in the eyes of prescribers, and we believe physician confidence in patients' management may be increasing, especially in light of the updated label in Europe.","We continue to launch ZINBRYTA in the U.S. and in an increasing number of international markets. We believe ZINBRYTA fulfills an important unmet need for patients transitioning from one of the platform or orals to a high-efficacy agent.","Overall, we maintain our global market share in MS. We are committed to resourcing and focusing the Biogen team on maintaining our position as the market leader and growing the business, even with the entrance of new competition.","Moving on to biosimilars, BENEPALI is now available in 16 countries with market share growing steadily particularly in Germany, the UK, and Sweden. We estimate there are now 40,000 patients on BENEPALI across Europe and growing.","Now on to SPINRAZA. The initial underlying demand has been robust. We notice a solid progress in terms of both infrastructure and insurance coverage. Infrastructure, in the U.S. as of last week, there were 88 sites across 36 states that have administered SPINRAZA and 203 sites that have submitted start forms. These numbers have been increasing every week. Some leading centers are already dosing more than 10 patients, but most sites have only dosed one or two patients so far. From a coverage and reimbursement perspective, there are now over 165 plans that have an approved individual use of SPINRAZA, 100 commercial plans, and 65 Medicaid plans. Broadly speaking, of all the commercially insured lives across the U.S., not just the ones covered by the 100 plans I mentioned, we estimate 75% have a plan with an established policy regarding SPINRAZA and half of those have a policy with broad access.","The 65 Medicaid plans I mention span 35 states and approximately 20 of those Medicaid plans have a formal policy in place with about half of the covered life under these policies having a broad access.","To date, the majority of the dosed patients are Type 1, and we continue to see approval for Type 2 and Type 3. For plans without a policy or with a restricted Type 1 policy, often patients are still able to get approval through an appeal process or medical necessity request. We will be presenting CHERISH data later today at AAN which includes control data for patients most likely to develop Type 2 and Type 3 SMA. The FDA has already granted a broad label for all SMA patients and it is our hope this new data will convince the payers who have developed narrow medical policies to offer broader access to patients.","In the U.S., it continues to be our goal that no patient will forego treatment because of financial limitation or an insurance denial. To date, roughly 25% of units dispensed have been provided through the free drug program.","There is plenty of attention on the launch of SPINRAZA in the U.S., but we cannot forget about the demand outside of the U.S. Our expanded access program outside of the U.S. now has 353 Type 1 patients across 20 countries, of which 306 of those patients are in Europe. And last week the CHMP in the EU adopted a positive opinion for SPINRAZA, recommending a broad indication. We are preparing for potential EU markets approval in the coming months. We are also getting ready for potential approvals in Japan and Canada this year and anticipate filing in at least 10 additional countries throughout 2017.","It is still early in the SPINRAZA launch, and we have a lot more work to do to get patients in need on therapy.","So, all in all, a rich quarter with solid financial performance, stable leadership in MS, a promising launch of SPINRAZA, a steadily growing biosimilar business, progress in business development, and two important patent victories.","I now turn it over to Mike for an update on our progress in R&D, the true engine of value creation for the company.","Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.","Thank you, Michel, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with some broad comments on the evolution of Biogen R&D. I am extremely excited about how we're becoming more entrepreneurial. Our approach is to blend strong science with a medical mindset and an entrepreneurial emphasis on innovation. We will be agnostic to whether we find innovation internally or externally. The goal is to continue our tradition of applying our deep scientific expertise as we aim to discover and develop the very best medicines for patients.","We're laser focused on neuroscience and value creating adjacencies. I believe this makes abundant sense and positions Biogen uniquely in this breaking area to leverage our leadership in multiple sclerosis, to capture broad opportunities in neuroscience. There is arguably no bigger area of unmet medical need than diseases of the nervous system, and I believe Biogen has a tremendous competitive advantage to be the leader in this space. The genetics of neurological disorders has exploded yielding critical insight into new therapeutics and we can now measure and monitor disease states of the brain with unprecedented precision. We believe the SPINRAZA experience provides a glimpse of the future for targeting severe neurological disease and we aim to capitalize on this changing paradigm.","I'm now going to walk you through the significant progress we made this quarter advancing, prioritize and building out our pipeline. Like the amyloid pathway, we believe tau pathology is central to Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. Similar to our investments in a-beta antibodies and base inhibition, our commitment to tau is strong. Earlier this month we expanded our portfolio beyond BIIB076 in our preclinical anti-tau, antisense oligonucleotide with Ionis by entering into a licensing agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb for an advanced tau asset BMS-986168 as Michel mentioned. This new antibody is aimed at lowering tau and slowing progressive diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy or PSP, rare and devastating condition that affects movement, speech, vision, and cognitive function.","PSP is currently an untreated orphan indication with a tremendous need for an effective therapy. BMS-986168 has shown compelling clinical data, robust lowering of tau in cerebrospinal fluid, and an appropriate benefit\/risk profile in a Phase 1 study. We plan to rapidly initiate Phase 2 studies in both Alzheimer's disease and PSP. This licensing agreement reflects one of the most significant external additions to the Biogen pipeline in many years and highlights our heightened activity to seamlessly integrate business development with internal R&D. We expect more pipeline augmentation in the coming months.","We also advanced BIIB076 into a Phase 1 trial this quarter. BIIB076 is a human recombinant monoclonal antibody targeting tau that was developed using Neurimmune's reverse translational medicine platform. The study is designed to evaluate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics in both healthy volunteers and Alzheimer's disease patients.","We continue to advance assets targeting the beta-amyloid pathway, which we believe plays a particularly important role early in the disease course. Phase 3 enrollment for aducanumab is going well and we expect both ENGAGE and EMERGE will be 50% enrolled by mid-May. We anticipate the studies to be fully enrolled by mid-2018. And we're honored that just last week aducanumab received a SAKIGAKE designation by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in Japan. Under the SAKIGAKE system, the target review period for designated products may be reduced from the standard review period of 12 months to as short as six months.","Our collaboration partner Eisai is progressing a Phase 2 study of BAN2401, a humanized a-beta antibody which exhibits a strong binding preference for protofibrils. We expect data from this trial by the end of the year. Also, under our collaboration, Eisai has recently initiated the second Phase 3 study of elenbecestat, an oral BACE inhibitor.","Now moving to multiple sclerosis. This week at the 69th annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology, or AAN in Boston, we will be presenting over 50 presentations and posters from our portfolio of treatments and investigational therapies. Specifically with MS, new data includes real-world evidence that supports TECFIDERA's efficacy profile and we believe underscores the importance of early treatment. Results show TECFIDERA significantly reduced the risk of relapse by 30% compared to teriflunomide in newly diagnosed patients and those previously treated with a prior disease modifying therapy. TECFIDERA also demonstrated comparable efficacy to fingolimod. New data from ENDORSE, a long-term extension study, also affirmed the well-characterized long-term safety profile of TECFIDERA use for up to nine years.","New data from the TYSABRI Observational Program, or TOP, shows treatment na\u00efve patients who began taking TYSABRI within one year of symptom onset had a significantly greater likelihood of disability improvement than those who initiated treatment later in the course of their disease. Importantly, data also showed patients who continued TYSABRI treatment experienced better clinical outcomes than those who switched to another therapy.","Also in MS as part of our ongoing portfolio prioritization effort, we have decided not to advance BIIB061, an oral remyelinating agent, into a Phase 2 MS study, and instead have chosen to prioritize opicinumab, or anti-LINGO. No new data on BIIB061 has driven this decision. We expect to initiate a Phase 2b study for opicinumab in the fourth quarter.","After much diligence, we believe the feasibility of running studies for both BIIB061 and opicinumab in similar patient populations would ultimately slow down development for both compounds. We have more robust data and a greater clinical understanding of opicinumab, and thus have chosen to prioritize this program. We're exploring other indications for BIIB061 where remyelination and repair are important.","Also, as Michel noted earlier, we will present significant data on SPINRAZA at AAN this week. We believe the overall findings continue to support the robust efficacy and benefit risk profile of SPINRAZA, a suite of remarkable data made possible through our close collaborations Ionis. Specifically, later today, we will present the end-of-study CHERISH results which we believe further demonstrate the meaningful impact SPINRAZA can have in individuals with later-onset SMA. CHERISH was a Phase 3 study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of SPINRAZA in individuals most likely to develop Type 2 or Type 3 SMA. The end-of-study analysis demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in motor function as assessed by the treatment difference of 4.9 points in the mean change from baseline to month 15 in the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded. From baseline to month 15, individuals who received SPINRAZA achieved a 3.9 point mean improvement while individuals who were not on treatment experienced a mean decline of one point. Data from the other endpoints analyzed including upper limb motor function and attainment of new motor milestones were consistently in favor of children who received treatment. No patients discontinued the study due to adverse events and the results demonstrated a favorable benefit\/risk profile.","This Thursday, we will present new interim data from the Phase 2 NURTURE study evaluating SPINRAZA for the treatment of infants under six weeks old with genetically diagnosed and pre-symptomatic SMA at initiation of treatment. At the time of the interim analysis, 20 infants were enrolled for a median of 317 days and all infants in the study were alive and none required respiratory intervention. Additionally, most infants achieved motor milestone and growth parameter gains generally consistent with normal development such as head control, independent sitting, standing, and walking independently. These results are dramatically different from the known course of SMA infants with Type 1 SMA where motor milestone achievement of any sort is absent. In this study, no infants have discontinued or withdrawn from the study due to adverse events and no new safety concerns have been identified. These results are encouraging and we believe continue to highlight the need for newborn screening.","Importantly as we look to expand our presence in SMA, we are also excited about the potential for gene therapy as a complementary mechanism. Through our collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania, we plan to advance our SMA gene therapy program into the clinic by the first half of next year.","We're also working to advance BIIB074 for neuropathic pain. We recently completed the topline data analyses of the exploratory Phase 2a in erythromelalgia, a disease characterized by Nav 1.7 mutations. In this study, of the seven patients analyzed, no statistically significant treatment effect was observed for the primary or secondary endpoints and the variability in the responses was notable. No new safety signals were observed. We're planning to initiate another Phase 2 study in small fiber neuropathy towards the end of this year as we continue to explore multiple potential indications for this asset.","We have previously seen compelling efficacy signals for BIIB074 in Phase 2 studies of both trigeminal neuralgia and painful lumbo-sacral radiculopathy or PLSR. Results for trigeminal neuralgia were recently published in Lancet Neurology. We continue to enroll the Phase 2b PLSR study with data expected next year. For trigeminal neuralgia, we now intend to initiate the Phase 3 studies simultaneously in the U.S. and Europe. As a result, we now expect patient enrollment to begin in 2018.","Lastly, in our effort to develop new therapies for neurologic diseases, we believe there is opportunity in stroke. We expect the follow-on Phase 2b dose ranging study for natalizumab in acute ischemic stroke, ACTION 2, to be fully enrolled this year and hope to share the results shortly thereafter.","We're making good progress advancing our early clinical pipeline with 13 programs in Phase 1 or Phase 2 development. I look forward to sharing updates on these programs as they progress.","Overall, I'm very excited about our pipeline, but good is never good enough. We'd like to see more later-stage candidates. We aim to continue prioritizing the most promising assets while looking externally to expand our pipeline.","With that, I will now pass the call to Paul.","Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.","Thanks, Mike. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.46 in the first quarter. GAAP EPS was negatively impacted by $1.22 related to the settlement and license with Forward Pharma in the U.S. PTO ruling in favor of Biogen in the interference proceeding.","Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $5.20 in the first quarter, an increase of 9% versus prior year.","Total revenue for Q1 increased 3% year-over-year to approximately $2.8 billion. Excluding hemophilia revenues from both periods, total revenue grew 8%.","Global first quarter TECFIDERA revenues were $958 million. This included revenues of $751 million in the U.S., an increase of 1% versus Q1 last year, and $207 million outside the U.S., an increase of 3% versus Q1 last year. On a sequential basis, U.S. TECFIDERA revenues were negatively impacted by approximately $50 million to $60 million due to lower levels of inventory at the specialty pharmacies.","Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY were $648 million during the first quarter, a decrease of 3% versus Q1 last year. This included $465 million in the U.S. and $184 million in sales outside the U.S.","TYSABRI worldwide revenues were $545 million this quarter, an increase of 14% versus Q1 last year. This included $306 million in the U.S. and $239 million outside the U.S. Outside the U.S., Q1 TYSABRI revenue benefited by approximately $45 million, due to reaching an agreement with the price and reimbursement committee of the Italian National Medicines Agency related to prior periods.","SPINRAZA revenues for Q1, its first full quarter on the market, were strong as we reported $47 million. SPINRAZA U.S. revenue was $46 million. This represents very strong underlying demand combined with some natural inventory build as the launch ramps. We estimate that less than $10 million of the SPINRAZA revenue was due to inventory that was built up in the channel in the U.S. We also had $1 million in sales outside the U.S. related to named patient sales.","Hemophilia revenues for the sub-period, prior to the spinoff of Bioverativ, were $74 million. Our biosimilar business generated $66 million in revenue this quarter. Anti-CD20 revenues were $341 million for Q1 and total other revenues were $90 million.","Now turning to the expense lines on the P&L. Both Q1 GAAP and non-GAAP cost of goods sold were $385 million or 14% of revenue. Q1 GAAP R&D expense was $423 million or 15% of revenue. Q1 non-GAAP R&D was $421 million, also 15% of revenue, a decrease on a sequential basis as we had no meaningful milestone payments or BD activity in Q1, and as the Phase 3 studies for SPINRAZA wound down.","Q1 GAAP SG&A expense was $499 million or 18% of revenue. Q1 non-GAAP SG&A was $483 million or 17% of revenue. Both GAAP and non-GAAP other net expense was $38 million in Q1. In Q1, our GAAP tax rate was approximately 24% and our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 23%, which includes some modest favorability from discrete tax items related to Q1.","Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 216 million for Q1. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 2 million shares of the company's common stock for a total value of $584 million. And since March 31, we've purchased an additional approximately 2 million shares for a total value of $543 million.","We ended the quarter with approximately $5.7 billion in cash and marketable securities with approximately 24% of this in the United States.","As we go forward, we'll be closely watching the launch of OCREVUS. Overall, we anticipate a negative impact to our portfolio that'll be partially offset by the royalties that we receive. In conjunction with the recently announced agreement to exclusively license the BMS anti-tau molecule, we expect to make an upfront payment of $300 million to Bristol-Myers Squibb in the second quarter and a near-term $60 million payment to the former stockholders of iPierian. These will impact both our GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense assuming deal closure. These amounts exceed the $100 million we earmarked for business development expense in our previously announced 2017 full year financial guidance. We plan to update our annual financial guidance on the second quarter earnings call.","I'll turn the call over to Michel for his closing comments.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","Thank you, Paul. I will venture to say that 2017 is off to a strong start for Biogen, but we have much more to do. We are refocusing the organization and I am building my management team. We are all energized and are working to develop the strategy and priorities for both short-term and long-term shareholder value creation. We plan to update you on our progress when we report our second quarter earnings in July, but we do not wait with obvious actions to be taken to support Biogen in terms of R&D, BD and commercial. Our actions will speak for themselves.","For July, we hope to provide you with clarity on our priorities and plan. I aim to communicate a clear picture of the Biogen of tomorrow, a company that can meaningfully improve patients' life in the increasingly important field of neuroscience through new, innovative therapies and create long-term sustainable value for our company and our shareholders. And I believe strongly that this is the new Biogen, a clear leader in a well-defined and fast-growing space. We do tackle big challenges. We are laser focused on execution and we aim to deliver strong results.","In closing, I'd like to thank our employees around the world who are dedicated to making a positive impact on patients' lives, and all of the physicians, caregivers and participants in our clinical development programs. The past and future achievements could not be realized without their passion and commitment. With that, we'll open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question. Your first question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Oh, good morning. Congrats on the fine launch for SPINRAZA and the overall quality of Q1 results as well. My question's on SPINRAZA. I guess we've gone, in the last three months, from thinking the launch would be gradual to today calling it robust. So what's going better than you expected? Is it access to reimbursement or your ability to work through the logistical issues at the centers or greater urgency to treat, greater demand? Please comment. Thanks.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","So a couple of months ago, and since the beginning actually \u2013 this is Michel \u2013 we did identify two bottlenecks. And number one was infrastructure due to the intrathecal therapy injection modalities that were not performed into the SMA northern (33:30) neuromuscular centers, and in addition, the insurance coverage. Those two bottlenecks remain and they will be also relevant for the other markets where we're going to launch SPINRAZA hopefully soon.","Having said that, motivated families, patients, parents, advocacy groups, a professional team at Biogen, dedicated providers, the leadership of the hospital and the providers were able to accommodate, not as a linear fashion, some bigger centers with a certain pattern, smaller centers eventually with more speed and flexibility, one size does not fit all. But all in all, this is where we stand today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much, and share my congratulations on SPINRAZA. Could you give us a little bit more detail on the MS business, particularly the contribution of price and volume in the U.S. for the brands there, and comment on price? Previously you'd said that you anticipated taking one price increase a year. Is that still the company's view? And is that something that we should continue to plan for the balance of the year? Thanks.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","So in the U.S., that remains our largest and stable market for which we remain fully dedicated to continue to improve the picture.","First of all, on the market dynamic, if you recall well, I did mention that in 2016 we saw a slight contraction of the market in terms of commercial goods versus the prior period.","Well, we did see that sustain during Q1 versus Q4 of 2016, probably, and by a few percentage, nothing dramatic. One of the reason might well be that there was a bit of warehousing due to OCREVUS. I don't know by facts, but this might be a reason.","All in all, the assumption within the company is that the market will return to low-single-digit market growth for the remainder of 2017.","For Biogen business, a very strong defense of our performance. And actually, I am pleased by the momentum I see in a slightly declining market of our NTRx and TRx shares and you can have a look into those.","I think that TECFIDERA defended very well, TYSABRI rebounded. Overall, Biogen is holding very strong and we continue to see a slight erosion of the interferons as expected.","So all in all I will say a good performance that I want to see improved. Capture rate is holding very well, slightly improving. Discontinuation due to TEC GI did not really improve and I'm not satisfied by that. But I do not give up. So we are working hard to improve on this figure.","But all in all, I will say it's very solid engagement while the team has the plate full of tactical plans in order to be ready for an increased competition while we speak.","Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.","And then, Geoff, this is Paul. Just second part of your question, we understand it's an important question, and I know we've commented in the past, but we're not going to comment on any kind of perspective of forward pricing in the MS market.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","If I may add just a small comment on this important dynamic that we see in the marketplace, is that Biogen has the opportunity to benefit from a complete portfolio in MS, and we are working very hard. And if we want to change the landscape, we need to move away and try to progress on value-based and innovative type of contracting. It's difficult. The team is making some progress, but today I have nothing to report except that some progress and some discussion with different PNs. So we are working on this dimension.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Morning, guys. Thanks for the questions and also want to give my congrats on the quarter. Michel, you talked about filling out the pipeline more and with the launch of anti-tau, are you comfortable with the number of assets or mechanisms that you have in the Alzheimer's portfolio? And is it reasonable to assume that biz dev may be neurology focused or is it likely that you guys will look more broadly at the orphan space just given the SPINRAZA launch? Thank you.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","Thanks for the question. I'll get started, and obviously, Mike will comment more thoroughly. First, I would like to say that I'm very pleased that Biogen was able to pull it in a very competitive setting. Anti-tau is an important mechanism that complements well via all the programs we have with the same target, but also the a-beta assets that we have with aducanumab at the forefront and the BACE inhibitor that we have partnered. So these positions, Biogen's I will say pretty well in AD and Mike will complement. We continue to work hard and we are doing that in order to improve the footprint of our phase early stage which is a sweet spot on where we can add much value with the development.","Biogen's, at Biogen neuroscience is dimension in life, and this is where we can add most of the value with meaningful development because we have great people, great team. And the partners see that. So before we move beyond, we're looking to neuro space. And in the neuro space, we look first at MS, SMA and neurology. Mike?","Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Geoff, for the question. On the tau side, I'd say we're very excited now to have this more advanced tau antibody in the portfolio. And as I'd mentioned, we've got an earlier second antibody, BIIB076 and in our collaboration with Ionis, an antisense oligonucleotide against tau which we're looking to advance to the clinic in the coming months. So we're quite excited about that. Michel said it well. We're really concentrated in neuro as an area. I'd say when you look across the opportunity landscape externally, we really try to focus on things that are in the early clinical asset space. That's kind of our core, where we believe that we can identify things with a bit of asymmetric knowledge and apply some asymmetric capabilities to that.","We don't exclude other areas, but that's just where we're concentrated. So if we see a good opportunity that's a little bit later in a more adjacent area or even something that's earlier, we're quite open to it. On the question around more orphan diseases or other things, I think that the experience with SPINRAZA highlights to us the real potential advantage of intrathecal ASOs as a modality. We've got an early Phase 1 ongoing study in SOD1 mutant ALS as just another example of that. So we see great opportunity in that intersection between neuroscience and certain orphan diseases.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Hi, guys. Congrats on the SPINRAZA launch. So, since I was totally off on my end, I thought I'd ask you how to understand SPINRAZA numbers some more. So Paul, thank you. You mentioned it was about less than $10 million worth of inventory of the $46 million in U.S. So that would imply $36 million in sales or perhaps something like 360 infusions. So I guess what I'm trying to understand is if there were 30 centers enrolled as of early March and 88 centers as of April 21, that implies most of the patients have probably not had more than three infusions. So is it unreasonable if I were to say 360 divided by 3, perhaps about 120 patients on therapy as of Q1? And I'm partially doing that to understand if there's a spillover into 2Q or not.","And maybe one, just a quick one on R&D. Just wanted to understand the significance of the midway enrolled on aducanumab Phase 3. Does the protocol enabled an interim analysis of sorts on week 52 or week 76 for these first 1300 patients? Thank you.","Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.","Umer, this is Paul. Let me kind of do a couple things. One is the inventory, I know it was important for every \u2013 on SPINRAZA was important, but it literally is a triangulation of data. So I wouldn't \u2013 it's not as precise as our knowledge of kind of the inventory on TECFIDERA in the specialty pharmacy channel, but it is our best estimate at this time that it's something in the less than $10 million range. And while we have a closed system on SPINRAZA, sometimes the patient data lags and we're estimating things along the way. No doubt as we move through Q1 the patients began to ramp and the dosing schedule, as you point out, the loading dose schedule does likely have some level of spillover effect. But I think that's kind of small dynamics and broadly what we're trying to do is get patient access and get through the infusion capacity constraints, get through the access constraints, get as many patients across all the different types of SMN patients on therapy.","Alfred W. Sandrock - Biogen, Inc.","And Umer, this is Al, on the aducanumab question. We have a policy here that we're not talking about interim analyses. I'm afraid I can't answer that question.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Ronny Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein Limited","Good morning, everybody, and thank you for taking my question. I'm going to stick with nusinersen. First, do you have any better feel right now for how long the effect of nusinersen is? Given that we kind of are done with the question of the early launch, the question now is how long can you actually keep those patients alive and therefore, what should we model for those product's accumulation of patients long-term? And second, you've mentioned that you're about to take your gene therapy into the clinic. I guess the question is what is the differentiation of your program versus the existing gene therapy which is already in the clinic? What are you doing better than they that will allow you to differentiate versus their product?","Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.","Okay. Ronny, this is Mike. I'll start with that a little bit. On the question of SPINRAZA durability, I guess what we can say is that we started the first patient dose just about five years ago, and from what we've seen for that, there's been, essentially, sustained effects with those patients to date. There's a lot that's not known here. Obviously, this is kind of an ongoing clinical experiment and many of these patients are being rolled over into an open label kind of observation period for this. So the fact is, is that we just don't know what ultimately the durability would be, but everything that we've seen is a durable effect of continued dosing of SPINRAZA. So I'd say on that, on the gene therapy side of this \u2013 so there are a lot of things. One is we're very encouraged by the gene therapy data that is out there, of what AveXis has publicly reported. We are quite bullish in general on the modality of AAV-based gene therapy. We do believe that there's the prospect for differentiation in terms of tissue tropism, serotype, delivery routes, dosage, viral load, manufacturing, and so forth. So we think there's ample room for differentiation and time will tell. The other thing we would say is we believe that there can be a future out there where these are used in combination in certain settings that will depend very much on the stage and type of SMA.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions. Just curious, what are the qualifications for the free drug program for SPINRAZA? And do you anticipate the 25% of units flowing through now will kind of remain the steady state going forward?","Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.","Ronny (sic) [Cory] (47:23), this is Paul. Good. Thanks for the question. It's kind of tied up in if there's denial, effectively. There's obviously also some normal, as you would expect, income for people that can't afford it. With respect to the kind of free goods, I think that is an estimate that we won't know until we get much farther, and I would guess it wobbles quarter to quarter. I mean, it even wobbled within the quarter, so I think it wobbles around a little bit quarter to quarter as well.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Specifically maybe Mike, can you comment on what's the difference between BIIB076, your anti-tau antibody that just entered Phase 1 and then the anti-tau antibody license from Bristol-Myers, what really caused the decision to out-license that compound?","And then secondly, maybe, I think, Michel, you commented on roughly half of the Medicaid plans now cover SPINRAZA. Can you provide any color on what's the percentage of commercial plans that cover SPINRAZA now? Thank you.","Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.","Okay, Ying, so I'll start with that. Thanks for the question. A few things, the reason we like \u2013 I mentioned about how we just in general see intersecting tau as a very important feature of neurodegenerative disease including Alzheimer's disease.","I'd say three or four core things. One, it was a more advanced clinical stage asset that was of interest. Two, it was really quite clear that you had a very potent antibody here where they had generated a very compelling biomarker data in terms of robust lowering of CSF tau. There'd been more clinical experience and a known kind of benefit\/risk profile that had been seen in many patients to date, as you would expect from a more advanced clinical asset. And then it also gave us this kind of accelerated opportunity in progressive supranuclear palsy as another very exciting indication for us.","Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.","Ying, this is Paul. Let me kind of try to tackle the second part of your question in terms of coverage on SPINRAZA in the commercial plans. Our estimate is that about 75% plans that cover the lives across the United States have coverage and approved SPINRAZA. Of that, about half of those have a narrow, call it Type 1 type coverage and about half of those have broad coverage. Importantly, as Mike pointed out, we'll be presenting data tonight that will hopefully start to get a more broad coverage as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Schimmer with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Can you please estimate the size of the SPINRAZA patient backlog? And do you believe you can address infrastructure bottleneck issues so that it's no longer a gating step by end of the year? And then for Europe, how are you handling this so it doesn't slow launch there, too? Thank you.","Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.","Yeah. Josh, actually we'd prefer not to. We obviously have internal data on start forms and we have a sense for that, but we'd prefer not to because I just don't know the accuracy of it all at this point in time.","With respect to Europe, we are effectively have been putting pre-launch efforts in place on a country by country basis, prioritizing, obviously, those countries that we expect to get reimbursement earlier as opposed to later. So tremendous amount of energy in Germany, energy in the Nordics, energy actually also in UK for some relatively unique circumstances. And I think it's going to be a very similar dynamic with respect to trying to accommodate and get through infusion capacity.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","If I may add very briefly, I am monitoring very closely the ability of the organization to implement and to execute, being for SPINRAZA, and I think that the data to date speaks for itself, and we'll continue to do the same in Europe with the individual regulators to follow up following the CHMP endorsement with a broad label and including reimbursement.","So we'll get started hopefully we believe this summer with Germany and Scandinavia with an access condition. And we have an early access program with more than 300 patients. And gradually the countries will come with market access condition one after the other. And it's all about execution from the Biogen team, it's execution on SMA, execution on biosimilar and execution obviously on MS.","I just want to reiterate that for TECFIDERA, we are working very hard. TECFIDERA is now the market \u2013 is growing share in 17 out of 21 markets in Europe, okay? Germany is growing share six months in a row. We have hit within France the highest ever share for TECFIDERA. So it's all about the ability for the team to implement well with what we have in the bag in the portfolio today in a very focused manner and the right way.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Salim Syed with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.","Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Hey guys, congrats on the quarter. Just two questions. Paul, I think both of these are for you. You mentioned OCREVUS having a negative impact. Can you just go into a little bit more color there? And what products in particular do you see OCREVUS impacting? Is it mostly TYSABRI, or do you think it's TECFIDERA?","And then second, just on SMID-cap valuations, it sounds like now you guys are approaching M&A a little bit more aggressively. Paul, can you maybe comment on your thoughts on SMID-cap valuations at these levels? Thank you.","Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.","Yeah, let me take the second one first. I mean, no comment that one. So, I mean, I have points of view on it, but we obviously don't talk about it. It's kind of like one step away from talking about names.","Look, OCREVUS, we've done a lot of work on it. Again, we do think a new entrant that has an interesting profile for patients and physicians will get a place in the marketplace and inevitably as we have plus or minus 40 share across our existing portfolio of products, there'll be an impact on that.","We think that OCREVUS plays in the high efficacy segment. And as a result, the likelihood is that it impacts TYSABRI vis-\u00e0-vis the products in our portfolio more than others as well.","There's a chance it impacts TECFIDERA as well. We think that the platform therapies inclusive of AVONEX and PLEGRIDY are the least impacted. All of that is obviously a total forecast and we're going to be monitoring it very closely as we move forward.","And, look, this is not a surprise, right? So I think that I would characterize it as similar to way Michel has characterized it as that the best thing that we can do is just simply continue to really put forward the strength of our own products and we have a great, great suite of products across a bunch of different kind of segments and kind of patient needs in the marketplace.","And then certainly in the United States, we're heartened that we're somewhat hedged from the royalties that are gained from OCREVUS.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","If I can just briefly add to what Paul rightly said, towards the higher end of the spectrum, I reinforce that, at least at the beginning, patients with high level of the (56:06) positivity that have to be switched, and this is a good thing, and obviously the PPMS, for which we'll get a benefit.","So this is what we see, this is the very early days. The label is in line with what we did assume. We are monitoring very closely but we are monitoring more our assets than the competition.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Alethia Young with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on the SPINRAZA launch. Just one around the S1P class in general.

Was just wondering on SPINRAZA if you can give us any color on the percentage of new starts versus rollover patient.","And then I noticed there was an uptick in cost of goods this quarter. Paul, was there anything notable there or is that going to trend down over the rest of the year? Thanks.","Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.","Terence, thanks for the question. This is Paul. Let me try to take both of them. I think what you're referring to on SPINRAZA is with respect to rollover patients of those that were in the trial or in our EAP program. And on both dimensions, it was a very small number actually. The trial patients are continuing on in a trial. The EAP patients, because that if you recall, it was approved in such a short period of time from filing, we actually in the United States had well below 100 patients on EAP and only a handful of them actually have moved into commercial patients. So the vast majority of the sales for Q1 on SPINRAZA are due to, in effect, de novo new patient.","Cost of goods sold is a bit a function of a number of things. The biosimilar business, which is growing quite strong, comes with a high cost of goods sold. We have had \u2013 the AVONEX business actually has an additional royalty that started in the second half of 2016 and when we compare it to the first half of 2016, we kind of have unfavorable comps. So I think that's indicative probably of what we're going to see over the next number of quarters.","Matthew Calistri - Biogen, Inc.","And Dan, we're going to have time for one more question.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for fitting me in. I appreciate it. I just wanted to try and sort of group together sort of all the comments you've made on SPINRAZA and just try and understand sort of a broader question, which is obviously there are some of these dynamics that you've talked about including insurance and infusion which is sort of limiting some of the uptake, though you've obviously worked through that with patients. And I guess what I'm trying to understand is how should we think about if there was a bolus in this quarter and the new start rate should decline or if you still think that the dynamics you talked around insurance and infusions are still holding back a substantial portion of patients and that the new start rate should continue to increase as we think about for maybe the next quarter or through the rest of the year. Thanks.","Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.","Matthew, thanks for the question. This is Paul. Quite frankly, it's hard to really tell on that, the kinetics of this. And we've said it all along, it's hard to tell. We're very pleased with Q1. I personally would expect it continues to ramp if you look at the number of patients in the United States. So you just look at the number of patients, the number of centers that still haven't, that we're still working through plans, I would. The kinetics of it \u2013 and also, we always have to keep in mind the kinetics of kind of the cohort of patients going through loading dose then moving to maintenance dose and so on and so forth. I think we'll see some level of we'll all be interpreting the data as we go quarter by quarter. But broadly speaking, I think what this really pulls out is the tremendous value of the drug in the tremendous unmet need in the patient population.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","And if I may just add and conclude, the two bottlenecks that we did identify at the outset remain. It's a battle every day, and we are not yet where we want to be. Some of the largest plan or the largest facilities in terms of infrastructure are still not dosing the way the patients deserves and the way the families and the advocacy group expect. So there is still a way to go, but it's unlocking and progressing week after week.","I think the key element that first of all the country deserves, the patient deserves is newborn screening. The day we have that, we can really change the treatment and the evolution of SMA. And if you look at the NURTURE data the results speaks for themselves.","Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.","Thank you all for your attention today.","Operator","Thank you to everyone.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen first quarter 2016 financial results and business update conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. Thank you.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Matt Calistri, Senior Director of Investor Relations for Biogen.","Matthew Calistri - Senior Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, and welcome to Biogen's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the press release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the GAAP-to-non-GAAP financial measures that we'll discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in tables 1 and 2. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP-to-non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call.","I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult our SEC filings for additional detail.","On today's call, I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. George Scangos; Dr. Al Sandrock, our Chief Medical Officer; our CFO, Paul Clancy; and our new Chief Commercial Officer, Michel Vounatsos is with us here today. Now I'll turn the call over to George.","George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer","Okay, thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us this morning. For the first quarter of 2016, Biogen generated $2.7 billion in total revenues, 7% increase from the same period a year ago. And our non-GAAP EPS was $4.79, 25% increase from the same period a year ago. As you've heard from us since the beginning of the year, a cornerstone to our strategy for sustainable growth is our healthy commercial business and a strong focus on thoughtfully managing expenses, and I think these results should reinforce that message.","TECFIDERA continues to gain share globally, now with more than 190,000 patients having been treated. And at AAN this week, we presented compelling data that showcased its strong and sustained efficacy in newly diagnosed MS patients, emphasizing that earlier treatment with TECFIDERA improves long-term clinical outcomes. We also presented compelling data about TECFIDERA's real-world efficacy.","Last month, we announced our new Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Michel Vounatsos, had joined us. Michel brings a wealth of experience from 20 successful years of increasing responsibility at Merck, most recently as president of primary care and customer centricity. Michel officially started on Monday, and we're excited to be working with him. He'll be instrumental in driving our near-term growth while helping to prepare the organization to support our exciting pipeline.","In the first quarter, we launched BENEPALI, our biosimilar version of Enbrel, in six European countries: the UK, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and The Netherlands. And FLIXABI, our biosimilar version of Remicade, received a positive opinion from the CHMP, and we're awaiting approval from the European Commission shortly.","And of course an important part of our strategy for sustainable growth is our pipeline potential future therapies. Notably, aducanumab is enrolling patients in two Phase 3 trials. Opicinumab, which is anti-LINGO, results are expected midyear. And nusinersen, in collaboration with Ionis, is close to completing enrollment of the Phase 3 trial called ENDEAR. Al will provide more color on the pipeline during his comments.","Finally, I'd like to make a few comments to address some questions that I know will come. First, we're in the final stages of hiring an R&D head and expect to make an announcement shortly. Second, like you, we read the media reports about our hemophilia business and the subsequent analyst reports. As a matter of policy, we do not comment on speculation, and will not do so in this instance.","We're in an exciting stage in the evolution of Biogen. We're encouraged by the trajectory of our commercial portfolio, and we'll continue to focus on cost containment to maximize our earnings. We're eagerly awaiting the data from opicinumab and nusinersen, and we're pleased with the early enthusiasm for our biosimilars in Europe. We've recently brought several new compounds into development, and we continue to look for opportunities outside of Biogen.","And with that I'll turn the call over to Al, who'll update you on our progress in R&D.","Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer","Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. This quarter, we continued to execute on our pipeline candidates and generate new data to support our commercialized products.","Starting with opicinumab or anti-LINGO, we are looking forward to seeing the Phase 2 data, which is still scheduled for the middle of this year. I should note that no one has seen these data yet, but after more than a decade of work on LINGO, beginning with discovering the gene and then elucidating its biology, most of which was conducted at Biogen, we're excited to learn about opicinumab's potential as a reparative therapy for MS.","In Alzheimer's disease, we are working diligently to enroll our aducanumab Phase 3 trials and are pleased with progress thus far. Looking ahead, we anticipate safety data from the titration arm of the Phase 1b PRIME study in the second half of this year.","Amiselimod, or MT-1303, our S1P1 inhibitor for IBD, is currently being tested in a Phase 2 trial in Crohn's disease, and we are working toward the start of Phase 3 studies in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in the second half of this year.","Raxatrigine, a small molecule inhibitor of the Nav 1.7 sodium channel, is anticipated to begin a Phase 3 trial to confirm its efficacy is in patients with trigeminal neuralgia, and we are also planning to initiate a Phase 2 trial in patients with painful lumbosacral radiculopathy later this year.","Turning to our hemophilia products, we find the data that was presented at the December ASH meeting on immune tolerance induction with ELOCTATE quite encouraging. We believe that the Fc portion of these fusion proteins utilized in both ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX may offer additional benefits beyond half-life extension, although these preliminary findings will require confirmation from additional studies.","At this week's American Academy of Neurology meeting, we presented important new data demonstrating the breadth and diversity of our marketed and pipeline multiple sclerosis therapies, including TECFIDERA, TYSABRI, ZINBRYTA and PLEGRIDY. Let me provide some of the highlights of our presentation. TECFIDERA was shown to provide sustained and strong efficacy in newly diagnosed MS patients, reinforcing that earlier treatment with TECFIDERA is important in improving long-term clinical outcomes.","We also presented the results of another study that retrospectively examined the health insurance claims database of more than 5,000 patients in routine clinical practice. Annualized relapse rates one year after starting disease-modifying therapy were compared to the year before therapy initiation. These real-world data support the efficacy of TECFIDERA treatment seen in the controlled clinical trials, and this, combined with its safety profile and oral convenience, make it a very compelling therapeutic option for MS patients.","Data presented at AAN reinforced the nearly 10 years of clinical experience with TYSABRI, confirming its high efficacy, reversible immune effects, and well-characterized safety profile. ZINBRYTA, with its targeted and reversible mechanism of action, was shown to be positive on key MS cognitive outcomes. PLEGRIDY was shown to reduce the conversion of newly acquired MS lesions into T1 black holes, which have been associated with axonal loss.","Also at AAN, our collaboration partner, Ionis, presented an update on the ongoing open label Phase II trial of nusinersen in infants with spinal muscular atrophy. An analysis as of January 2016 showed no new events, as defined by progression to permanent ventilation or death, in the study since December of 2014, continued increases in muscle function scores, and achievement of new motor milestones when compared to natural history studies. We believe these data look increasingly encouraging, and that nusinersen could represent an important new therapy for spinal muscular atrophy.","With respect to our earlier stage efforts, at our R&D Day last November, we talked about using human genetics to identify causal biological pathways, as we strive to discover and develop new treatment for difficult diseases. In February, we joined the Center for Therapeutic Target Validation, the pioneering public-private collaboration that fosters interactions between academic and industry members for the purpose of developing open, transformative approaches to selecting and validating novel targets in drug development. This collaboration expands on our strategy of using genetically validated targets, biomarkers, and multiple therapeutic approaches to decrease the risk of drug development.","With that, I'll now pass the call to Paul.","Paul J. Clancy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Biogen, Inc.","Thanks, Al. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.43 in the first quarter, while our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.79. Total revenue for Q1 grew 7% year-over-year to approximately $2.7 billion. Our revenue growth was driven by the stable patient trends we now see for TECFIDERA and TYSABRI in the U.S., and continued growth in ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX. Although PLEGRIDY showed meaningful growth, our overall interferon business declined compared to the first quarter of last year, as the market continues to migrate to orals. Overall, we're pleased that the breadth and strength of our product portfolio enabled us to absorb such fluctuations, expand our top line, and maintain our global MS market share of approximately 38%.","As a reminder, we had $173 million in foreign exchange hedge gains in 2015, which has begun to impact our year-over-year comparisons. Compared to the first quarter of last year, we had $26 million less in hedge gains this quarter. Combined with the $24 million headwind from natural foreign exchange rates, overall revenue was weakened by approximately $50 million year over year. I'll highlight the FX impact for each of the therapies.","Global first quarter TECFIDERA revenue was $946 million. We recorded revenues of $744 million in the U.S. and $202 million outside the U.S. In the U.S., we believe there was a draw-down of TECFIDERA inventory in the wholesale channel, representing approximately $20 million versus prior quarter. Despite an expected choppy start to the quarter, as we worked through the typical seasonality issues, we believe underlying U.S. TECFIDERA patient demand is largely stable. U.S. gross-to-net percentage was comparable to Q4 and largely consistent with our average expected rate for the balance of the year.","Outside the U.S., foreign exchange impact, including the reduction in hedge gains, weakened full-year TECFIDERA revenue by approximately $14 million year over year. Last October, we bolstered our marketing efforts in the U.S. by launching a television campaign aimed at increasing patient awareness about MS and TECFIDERA. We believe we did increase awareness. Our current TV campaign will expire in the middle of this year. For various reasons, we plan to sunset this lever and don't currently plan to purchase additional TV spots beyond the middle of the year. We do, nevertheless, plan to continue our marketing efforts across other print and digital channels.","Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, were $670 million during the first quarter, which includes $467 million in the U.S. and $203 million in sales outside the U.S. In the U.S., the results were weaker than anticipated due to a combination of lower underlying demand as patients continued to move toward orals, seasonality issues, and a draw-down of AVONEX wholesale inventory of approximately $20 million. Outside the U.S., foreign exchange impact inclusive of a reduction in hedge gains weakened Q1 interferon revenues by approximately $20 million year over year.","Now moving to TYSABRI. With nearly 10 years of post-marketing experience, TYSABRI continued to add patients this quarter, with worldwide revenues of $477 million. These results were comprised of $288 million in the U.S. and $189 million internationally. We believe TYSABRI's well-understood safety profile and robust efficacy, position it well. Foreign exchange impact, including a reduction in hedge gains, weakened Q1 TYSABRI revenue by approximately $14 million year over year.","Turning to our hemophilia business. ELOCTATE revenue for the quarter was $108 million, and ALPROLIX revenue in Q1 was $75 million. We recorded $329 million for Q1 in our anti-CD20 collaboration, which includes our profit share from RITUXAN and GAZYVA in the U.S., as well as our profit share and royalties on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. As expected, our share of pre-tax profits in the U.S. on sales of RITUXAN decreased from 40% to 39% at the end of February, following approval of GAZYVA in RITUXAN-refractory indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.","Total other revenues, which include revenues from collaboration relationships, royalties, and contract manufacturing, were $88 million. We continued to benefit this quarter from contract manufacturing revenue related to a strategic partner.","Now turning to the expense lines on the P&L. Q1 cost of goods sold were $313 million, or 11% of revenue, as we experienced lower-than-typical write-offs of manufacturing runs in inventory. Q1 R&D expense was $437 million, or 16% of revenue. Of note in Q1, we did not have any meaningful business development expense. Recall in the fourth quarter we made a $60 million payment to Mitsubishi Tanabe related to the in-licensing of MT-1303. Additionally, the lower-than-expected R&D run rate seen in Q1 was also favorably impacted by the timing of clinical manufacturing campaigns and other R&D activities.","Q1 SG&A expense was $497 million or 18% of revenue. We remain focused on achieving savings in non-labor expenses, with the objective of reducing lower-priority fees and services for the balance of 2016. Other net expense was $53 million in Q1, which includes the interest expense related to our 2015 bond offering.","In Q1, our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 26%. This rate was negatively impacted by approximately 150 basis points related to discrete items. Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 219 million for Q1. And we ended the quarter with approximately $6.8 billion in cash and marketable securities, with approximately 45% of this in the U.S. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $4.79 for the quarter, representing a strong 25% increase year over year.","Over the last few years, we've gone through an unprecedented number of product launches, and thought it was the right strategy to not be penny wise and pound foolish. Starting in 2015, we pivoted to initiate a number of measures to curb operating expense growth. And late in 2015, we announced a restructuring, and we believe the benefits materialized this quarter. For the balance of the year, we're focused on commercial execution and diligent efforts to further reduce spending where appropriate, while ensuring we simultaneously support the advancement of the pipeline.","I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments.","George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thanks, Paul. Look, I'm pleased with the start of the year. And especially with the 25% increase in earnings versus Q1 of 2015. For the remainder of the year, we're focused on three areas: careful control of our costs, maximizing our revenues, and rapidly advancing the pipeline. The cost reduction actions that we took last year resulted in a meaningful increase in earnings this quarter, and as we move through the year we'll continue to focus on cost control to do all that we can to concentrate our resources on the activities that we believe will add the greatest value.","On the revenue side, we're pleased to have Michel Vounatsos join us. I'm very confident in Michel and look forward to all that he and his team will do to maximize the value of our commercial portfolio as we move through this year and into next. We have great drugs that are benefiting a lot of patients, and we want to maximize the benefits to both patients and our shareholders.","Additionally, we hope to launch two additional compounds this year, ZINBRYTA and, in the EU, FLIXABI. Since we think of revenue on a multiyear basis, we also will continue our focus on pursuing opportunities outside of Biogen. We continue to track companies and compounds that are potentially interesting for us, and we are in constant discussions with multiple parties, from the types of tuck-in acquisitions that we've done historically to later-stage assets closer to commercialization. And, as we said at previous calls, we want to be active in this area while remaining financially disciplined.","This is a very important year for the advancement of our internal pipeline. And it's important to make sure that the enrollment in the two Phase 3 of aducanumab continues to go well. We're pleased with how we're tracking so far, but it's still early, and we want to make sure that we stay on or ideally ahead of schedule for patient enrollment. We aim to get the Phase 3 trials for raxatrigine and amiselimod started on schedule, and we need to make sure that our early pipeline progresses quickly and that we make fact-based go\/no-go decisions.","And of course once we have the Phase 2 data for opicinumab in the middle of the year, we'll quickly decide on the appropriate path forward for opicinumab itself and for the other remyelinating programs in out pipeline. As Al mentioned, the open label data for nusinersen continue to look encouraging, and we need to do everything that we can to minimize the time to see data from the Phase 3 trials and, if positive, to get the drug to patients as soon as possible.","Although not so visible from outside the company, we'll continue to invest in R&D. We believe that our strategy of building world-class research and development will not only help us identify important new therapies ourselves, but will also help us to make thoughtful, sophisticated decisions about what to bring in from outside the company.","So we have a lot to do. This is a year for us to keep our heads down and focus on execution in all of the areas that I just outlined. We have a great team and a dedicated group of employees. And as always, I'd like to thank our employees for making a positive impact on patients' lives, and thank the patients and physicians involved in our clinical development programs. The achievements that we've made together could not have been realized without their passion and commitment.","So thank you all for joining us this morning. And, operator, we'll now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So I'm going to ask a two-part question, which you'll probably give me a hard time for, but \u2013 so on TECFIDERA, can you just talk a little bit about what's gone on outside the U.S.? If you back out the FX movements that you were talking about, you only saw a sequential $9 million increase in revenues. Is volume substantially slowing outside the U.S.? And then maybe just related to that, you had some contracting changes across the portfolio, specifically with CVS last year. Any big impacts to gross-to-net or some of the trends that may have affected the interferon franchise? Thanks.","Paul J. Clancy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Biogen, Inc.","Thanks, Matt. Great question. This is Paul. I'll try to take it. Outside the United States \u2013 we're actually pretty pleased outside the United States. I'd say Germany is a place where we'd like to see performance a little bit better. It probably looks a lot like the United States' performance of TECFIDERA, kind of getting darn close to a 20% share and not punching through over the course of 2015. That's an important market outside the United States, as you all know.","When I go across other parts that really are the big contributors outside the United States, it's kind of obviously France, UK, Southern Europe countries of Italy and Spain, and we're very pleased with the performance in Southern Europe. Those are early days in terms of the launch curves for TECFIDERA specifically. We're very, very pleased with that. Performance has exceeded our expectations. And certainly, as we've pointed out in the past, our UK performance is exceptionally strong. We've got a \u2013 what we feel is a remarkable team there. They've kind of really kind of broken down the marketplace and attacked it quite vigorously across the suite of Biogen MS therapies. So I think very pleased, I'd say, with the performance outside the United States, with a little bit of homework to do in Germany, which \u2013 I think we're actually showing some early signs, very early signs late in the quarter, positive signs.","With respect to contracting, it is, as people know, specific to AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, specific to newly diagnosed patients. I think that you combine that with typical seasonality issues in Q1, and we still feel we made the right choices there in terms of as we moved into 2016, and so we don't think there's been a meaningful impact. Certainly kind of working through prior authorizations and things like that for some of the patients has become a more active part of what we do in our patient services organization.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Sorry. Thank you very much for taking my question \u2013 not plural. Paul, congrats again on great P&L management. We all appreciate it, and your investors appreciate it. So many questions to ask. Maybe, Al, just because this is the one I get the most, just going back to the Eisai collaboration, and the A-beta antibody that may or may not have data shortly, the question that I've been getting \u2013 I'd just love to hear your thoughts \u2013 are, you emphasized a lot when looking at these competing A-beta antibodies, really understanding what the imaging data show post-therapy. That is, does it drain plaque from the brain? And if the answer to that's no, then the clinical outcome is perhaps less important because it doesn't do what your a-mab does, so to speak. But there's been some questions about specifically where the Eisai BAN antibody binds, which type of fibrils, and whether or not \u2013 given its specific binding affinities \u2013 whether or not you would expect necessarily to see changes on PET scan. So I was just wondering if you could talk us through that. Thanks so much.","Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer","Yeah, Mark. The BAN2401, to my understanding, binds the protofibrils as well as oligomers, and I would expect it to reduce amyloid plaque burden. The question for me is does it do that, first of all, and second, to what degree? The thing that was remarkable about aducanumab was that we had a very substantial reduction in the course of one year, arguably 85% or so. Competitor antibodies have not done that, and I don't know where 2401 will land, but that's an important piece.","And then we can then start to understand that the relationship between reduction in plaque burden and cognitive outcome. In our hands, in the aducanumab program, only the patients who reduced plaque burden by greater than one standard deviation changed relative to what the placebo patients did \u2013 in other words, beyond the noise. Those are the people who got cognitive benefit. The people who did not do that did not have any benefit that we could detect. So we think that's an important piece to look at.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alethia Young from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the expense management as well. I guess from the DTC campaign that you had with TECFIDERA, what were some of the learnings that you took away for that campaign around the television form and why you chose to keep the print? And just kind of similar along that lines, do you have any color on what the average duration for TECFIDERA is right now in the United States?","George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer","I'll take the first part of that question. Look, the main purpose of the ad campaign, television campaign, was to increase awareness of TECFIDERA. We were surprised, actually, at the beginning, by the low awareness among patients of TECFIDERA. And we had data suggesting that when patients did learn about TECFIDERA and went to their physician to discuss it, they often had it prescribed. So we wanted to get the awareness up. The ad did succeed in getting awareness up. And then the thesis is, once awareness is up and they have those discussions, they'll go to their physicians and we'll see an increase in prescriptions.","We've said we would see that, if we do, in Q2. We're in Q2. And so I think we'll have a final verdict on the success of that TV campaign when we talk to you next quarter. And so those ads don't run forever. So we're taking a pause. We'll continue our other types of activities, and we'll see what we learn and make decisions about any potential future television ads.","Paul J. Clancy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Biogen, Inc.","Alethia \u2013 and this is Paul. I'll try to take the second part of your question. Let me kind of answer it in a slightly different way that is a little bit more customary to the way we look at the data and probably more indicative. We try to triangulate on what we call discontinuation rates, the percentage of patients that leave a therapy, call it over the course of a 52-week period. And all the disease-modifying therapies have discontinuation rates, and we think that TECFIDERA experienced higher discontinuation rates than normal, as we moved through 2015, largely due to lymphocyte monitoring and kind of the label change.","We actually, importantly, think that we're kind of on, hopefully, on the back side of that. That the medical education has largely been completed. It obviously never stops, but we're hopeful that actually that can provide a little bit of a tailwind as we move through 2016 and as it begins to get back to a more normal level.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from Leerink Partners. Your line is open.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you very much, and thanks for taking the question. Paul, just \u2013 could you give us some color on how the rest of the year is looking now? You obviously have got a tailwind here with the significantly lower R&D expense, as you've tightened your belt on SG&A. But you did have what looks like $45 million of sequential currency headwind or loss of hedging from Q4. So how should we think about those drivers for the rest of the year? Can you keep at this sort of level on R&D and SG&A? And should we anticipate this kind of magnitude of currency effect through the balance of the year because of your hedge positions?","Paul J. Clancy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Biogen, Inc.","Yeah. Great questions, Geoff, because it's kind of a dynamic that the loss of hedging \u2013 not a surprise to us. So that was actually part of our business plan as we swung into 2016. And fundamentally we don't make predictions about where currencies are going to go. But we fully anticipated the fact that we had hedge gains throughout the P&L in 2015, that really come about from the hedges that we put on in 2014. So it's essentially a wraparound effect of the currency changes, mostly in the EU, as we kind of ended, very ended \u2013 if you remember, the changes were very end of December of 2014 and January of 2015. So that was fully expected. And so we believe that that will just continue to be a bit of a headwind, which we had thought about.","The R&D, I think I'd point out one key dynamic is it's always a little bit choppy, R&D as a percentage of sales, based on business development activity. And we certainly want to, and would welcome, really good business development activity. That's always a positive investment, a positive expense, if done correctly. With all that said, no doubt about it that, as I said, we have made cost control and feel like we're reaping the benefits of what we did late in 2015, as we came into this year. And I think it will continue to be a meaningful effort from me, from the whole organization, to make sure we focus on efficiencies throughout the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah, maybe on that R&D investment, either for Paul or George. We all appreciate the focus on the bottom line and costs, and appreciate also there were some puts and takes in Q1. But you're down at 16% of revenue in the first quarter. That's, I think, an all-time low for Biogen. Is that an appropriate rate for this company kind of long term, three to five years, in terms of investment?","George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thanks, Eric. Let me take that question. Look, R&D is choppy, and I don't want anybody to interpret that number as a deliberate effort to cut back on R&D and a de-emphasis on R&D. It is quite the opposite, actually. We are continuing to build a world-class research group. We will continue to invest in research. We believe that is a fundamental part of our strategy to build value. I think we've done a really good job so far. We'll continue that focus. Clinical development, we will spend whatever is necessary to move our pipeline forward \u2013 those pipeline compounds that are high potential, high value. We've talked about those. We're continue to invest in those. Frankly, the expenses there we would expect to go up over time as we move more compounds into Phase 3. So I think the trend is largely in that direction.","And part of this quarter was also, as Paul said, the lack of BD. And there's not going to be a lack of BD forever. So it was a lack in one quarter. So I don't want anybody to interpret the one-quarter number as a change in our strategy or a de-emphasis of R&D. It's quite the opposite, actually.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Thanks for the question. I know you're not commenting on other outside reports on hemophilia, but I wanted to ask, bigger picture, there's been changes in the market. The incumbent's being acquired. There's gene therapy data yesterday. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the push-pulls for this business, and is this business the business you've been thinking about? And maybe talk a little bit about how this fits in overall in the growth that you see here, given all the changes going on in hemophilia. Thanks.","George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, sure. Happy to take that. Look, ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX are doing well. They're gaining market share, and we're pleased with their performance. And they're continuing to gain share. So we're feeling good about there. We have not yet seen any impact on their trajectories from the introduction of other long-acting factors, so we take that as a positive sign. So I think the prospects for the business look quite healthy.","In the longer term, there are a number of products, as there are in every therapeutic area, coming forward, and we're keeping a close eye on them. There's certainly \u2013 we saw BioMarin's data, which are interesting but early. I mean, I haven't seen anything that you haven't seen. I saw good Factor VIII levels that persisted for some period of time, and we saw some liver enzyme issues that needed to be treated with corticosteroids. So we'll see how that plays out over time. Those are early. I would say interesting data, but early. It's similar, I think, to our immune tolerance induction data that we have with ELOCTATE.","We haven't talked about this a lot, but a fair number of hemophiliacs develop inhibitory antibodies when they're treated. And that results in the necessity for immune tolerance induction, which means high levels of factor that are given over 12 to 18 months before immune tolerance emerges. There've been a very limited number of patients, three, so I don't want to overstate this. Again, these are very early data, so \u2013 and I don't want to be here overstating the case. But, again, these are early data, but also encouraging. So of the three patients that have been treated with ELOCTATE for immune tolerance induction, they all became tolerant within three to four months. So much shorter period of time. If those data are confirmed in further studies, we believe that that could be an important upward lift for ELOCTATE.","So I think there are lots of early data emerging. They all need to be confirmed with larger studies. And we feel good about the business and where we are. We have our own longer-acting factors coming. We talked about some of them. There are earlier ones that are in our research group now. So I think we feel good about the current products, and we feel good about the future of the business as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First one is, many investors think you guys have lost flexibility on balance sheet because you guys really don't have much net debt. I'm just probing maybe the question for Paul \u2013 what's the willingness here to do another significant share buyback given your balance sheet strength? And then, secondly, I want to ask about a TECFIDERA inventory situation here. So in fourth quarter you had a $30 million inventory built in the U.S., and then there's a destocking of $20 million this quarter. Should we expect another $10 million to go next quarter? Thank you.","Paul J. Clancy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Biogen, Inc.","All right, Ying, why don't I try to clean up the clarity on the second part of your question. So the $30 million that I talked about last quarter was our best estimate at that time. In retrospect now, it probably is closer to the $20 million. In reality, it's probably in between. So I think that we've gone through the destocking of what we talked about last quarter and just wanted to kind of clarify it with the prepared remarks.","With respect to the balance sheet, I think it gets to the broader question of capital allocation. Currently, we're actually sitting on a pretty high cash balance. As I pointed out, like many others, we have the peculiar situation of ex-U.S. cash is a little bit more than half of that. But aside from that, that largely arises out of two things: the great, strong cash flow generation of the company, coupled with the debt financing that we did in the fall of 2015. Look, I think we will look to strategically deploy it. And if we come up that there are not options to strategically deploy it, we will look towards returning capital to shareholders. We don't measure that, as we've talked about before, on a 90-day basis, just because that's not the kind of clock speed of things. In both situations, it depends on price and value. So it depends, and in both situations, the financial objective is to maximize intrinsic value per share. So we look towards investing in deployments of capital that really drive great internal rates of return.","I think I'd also point out, look, over a longer period of time, I think this company, with the great cash flow generation it has, has flexibility to do both.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question. So just a question on strategy a little bit, and thinking about the company longer term. So you've got the MS business now stable, but it's faced some compression from new therapies. And you have hemophilia as a growing business and pipeline. I'm just wondering, how are you thinking about how important it is to diversify the business further? Do you have any concerns or no (42:17), or how are you thinking about, could there be something that puts pricing pressure on the MS market, and what could trigger it, and how are you thinking about maybe derisking the company from such an event? None of us think of it as a near-term event, but it's something that could happen over the long term. Maybe just help us think about the longer-term strategy of the company and your thoughts on price.","George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Robyn. This is George. I'll start with that, and other people can chime in. Look, I think we're feeling good about the MS business as it exists today. We're going right. But if you look at our pipeline, you'll see that many of the things we're working on are not in MS. We think LINGO, actually, could be a transformative event in the treatment of MS, and we are not working in \u2013 beyond ZINBRYTA on novel \u2013 let's say additional drugs that would downregulate the immune system. I think there are enough of those on the market; there are more coming. For many MS patients, those don't stop the progression. They slow the progression, but they don't stop the progression. And so we believe things like LINGO actually are the types of compounds that could actually transform that market and give it additional vibrancy as we move out through the 2020s.","That being said, if you look at what we're emphasizing now and what we have in Phase 3, it's nusinersen for SMA, it's aducanumab for Alzheimer's disease, it's raxatrigine for neuropathic pain. It's amiselimod for IBD and Crohn's disease. So we have deliberately brought in a series of compounds and are conducting late-stage trials in things that are outside of MS, partially for the reason you just outlined.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","(44:18) and your thoughts on price \u2013 anything that can trigger a pricing compression in the marketplace?","George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer","We don't see anything in the near term, no. As you move out into the 2020s, certainly could be, but don't see anything near term.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. A couple commercial ones. In the context of your DTC campaign, I was curious if you guys have any data on re-treatment of patients who went on TECFIDERA right at the launch? And then just with respect to \u2013 related question with respect to first quarter trends or even fourth quarter, any impact thus far from generic Copaxone on the interferon market vis-\u00e0-vis share? Thanks.","Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer","Yeah, Geoff, I'll try to address that. Not a lot of data on re-treatment. So we have plenty of data, but I can't off the top of my head think of anything as it relates to that. With respect to generic Cop, the data would suggest that it's a pretty small percentage at this point in time. And the data would suggest that it very much is just impacting Copaxone. So that's how we see it anecdotally, as well as how the data from a market share and a patient trends suggests.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. A question for Michel, if I may. First of all, congratulations on the new position. I know it's very early days, but I'm curious if you could maybe talk broadly about your objectives coming into Biogen, areas where see the potential to have the most impact on the commercial business under your leadership, and perhaps more specifically how you're thinking about potentially reaccelerating growth in MS and positioning for a potential ocrelizumab entry while still balancing the company's focus on achieving cost savings?","Paul J. Clancy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Biogen, Inc.","Thanks, Brian. Brian, this is Paul. We had Michel prepared for wholesaler inventory questions. Michel?"," So thanks for the question. Good morning, everybody. This is Michel Vounatsos, week one at Biogen. So as you can imagine, I am more on the learning and listening mode, and it's far too early for me to assess the strategy. I will be focusing a lot of time on the key geographies, obviously, and the key customers, to best understand and the key franchises. So I hope that in the near future, I'll be in a better position to assess the next steps. What I can tell you is that I'm extremely encouraged and honored to be part of this team and looking forward to engaging with all of you in the near future. Thanks for your understanding.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Birchenough from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Jim Birchenough - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah, hi, guys. Maybe a question on the pipeline and some help in assessing the risk-adjusted value of nusinersen. And on the risk side of it, when you look at the data we saw at AAN and that we've seen over the last few years, how do you get comfortable with the comparison with historical controls? And then on the opportunity, perhaps you could speak to how you view that opportunity in SMA between the Type I and then the Type II\/III patient. Thanks.","Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer","Well, the comparison with historical controls is always a little bit dangerous to do, because you have to choose cohorts, and you try to match them to your patients but the standard of practice changes over time. So these patients might be getting better over time just by the clinical practice improving. On the other hand, when you start to see lack of events of the type that was shown at the AAN \u2013 since December of 2014, no new events. That's a pretty striking difference, and these are hard endpoints, like time to tracheostomy or ventilation and time to death. It's hard for me to see how that kind of thing could be happening due to simply improving medical care.","So I think we're getting more and more encouraged, but I would note that we have these two well-controlled trials, one in infant-onset SMA and one in childhood-onset SMA. And that, to me, is a definitive data set that we're going to be looking at. And in terms of the opportunities in infant and childhood, I mean, I think they're both big opportunities, and I look forward to being able to help patients in both categories.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Actually wanted to follow up on nusinersen. George, in your scripted comments, when you talked about doing whatever you can to minimize the time to Phase 3 data for the product, is there anything specific that can actually be done to shorten that timeline, given that enrollment is complete for one of the trials and close to it for the other? Is there anything else you were referring to?","George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer","Look, at this time, let me just say that we are cognizant of the need to get this drug to patients as soon as we can, if it works. So the first part of that is being confident that it works. And, as Al said, we're going to need to see data from the control trials in order to make that case to the agencies, certainly, and for us to be absolutely certain as well. So we want to get there as quickly as we can. And once we have those data, we absolutely want to minimize the time until these kids have access to it \u2013 again, if it works. And these are especially the Type I kids who don't have a lot of time. And so there are a lot of kids out there today who desperately need something. And so we're trying to shorten that timeframe. But I don't want to get into any of the specifics of how we're doing that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just on the LINGO MS data coming in midyear, I know you guys are looking at a range of endpoints here, including disability and cognition. I think disability's pretty easy for all of us to benchmark, as there's a lot of data there. But on the cognition side, I know you're using this PASAT-3 scale. Anything you can do there, just to help frame for us in terms of what would be a meaningful outcome on that measurement? Thank you.","Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer","Yeah, we've had a lot of experience with PASAT. We've been using it in MS trials for about 20 years now. One of the things we know is that there's a practice effect. And so I expect to see some improvement on the score, even in untreated patients, just because of the practice effect. What I'm hoping to see with anti-LINGO, and I don't know whether we will or not, is that there would be an even better learning effect in the anti-LINGO-treated patients. And it would be great to see a dose response. That would make it even more compelling if we saw that. In terms of what is considered clinically meaningful, that hasn't been established in the world of MS yet. We have no established precedents on that. I will say that some compounds have shown some efficacy on this by virtue of preventing new MS lesions, but certainly not in this new era of reparative therapies.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks. Just a question for Al. On aducanumab, I was just hoping to get your thoughts on the targeting of A-beta. Specifically, I think you've implied, and I think there's plenty of data out there, suggesting that beta amyloid levels or amyloid beta levels might have actually plateaued by the time a patient shows any signs of mild cognitive impairment. Was just curious to get your thoughts, sort of the appropriateness of targeting A-beta in patients where plaques have already reached sort of a level-set, and what potentially could be driving the disease in these patients, in terms of their progression and whether there's another target that would make more sense?","Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer","Yeah, so it's true that when you look at plaque burden, it does tend to plateau already in the prodromal phase. And certainly by the (53:43), it's pretty flat. And so, what drives the progression beyond that, we believe, is probably tau. Tau comes on later. If you look at the imaging studies, tau comes on later. And there's a lot of data, preclinical data, that shows that A-beta pathology triggers tau pathology. So we're learning a lot about tau now. We know that, in normal aging, there is some aggregated tau in the medial temporal lobe. But in patients with Alzheimer's disease, it spreads beyond the medial temporal lobe, and that spread is probably triggered by A-beta. And so that's the reason why we have some programs in tau. We have some preclinical, as well as early clinical programs. Both antibodies, as well as antisense. And so, in the later stages, we might need to treat for tau, perhaps in combination with the A-beta therapies, because I don't think you want to re-accumulate A-beta once you removed it.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Chris Raymond from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, thanks for letting me slip in here. So just a question on anti-LINGO. So at AAN, there was some interesting data on clemastine. That agent seems to have at least some sort of similarity in terms of mechanism to LINGO in terms of impacting the oligodendrocyte differentiation at least. Wondering, Al, if you had any thoughts \u2013 is there any kind of read-through we should be thinking about, with respect to that agent and the results there? Thanks.","Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer","Yeah, so we've \u2013 the clemastine came from this micropillar assay that was developed in San Francisco, where they have oligodendrocytes wrapping myelin essentially around tubes. And what they found was that there were a number of antimuscarinic compounds that work, benztropine, as well as clemastine. We've actually tested clemastine in our oligodendroctye differentiation assay here, and in our hands it's less potent than BIIB-61, our oral compound that we have in early clinical trials, and it's also less effective overall in a side-by-side comparison in our hands.","Nevertheless, I did look at the data. Crossover designs like the one that they did are probably not the best approach for looking at disease-modifying therapies, because when you switch from clemastine to placebo, I don't expect that the \u2013 if it is causing myelination, how would the placebo patients look? They would continue to get the benefits from the clemastine that they had received in the period prior. So nevertheless they did show a modest effect on latency of the conduction between the retina and the brain, and we're keeping a close eye on that. I think that these are all early-day experiments in reparative therapies, and I believe we have established one of the best ways of looking at this in our anti-LINGO program, both in acute optic neuritis, as well as the MS program.","George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer","Okay. If there are no further questions, let me thank you all for your time this morning, and we'll sign off.
